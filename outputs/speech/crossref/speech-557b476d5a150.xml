to set out in efforts to determine the effect of electrocardiographic (ECG) feedback
on the performance in speech anxiety. Forty-six high school students participated in
a speech performance educational program. They were randomly divided into two groups,
an experimental group with ECG feedback (N = 21) and a control group (N = 25).
Feedback was given with video recording in the control, whereas in the experimental
group, an additional ECG feedback was provided. Speech performance was evaluated by
the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) speech ability test, which determines the 10
different speaking categories. ECG was recorded during rest and speech, together with
a video recording of the speech performance. Changes in R-R intervals were used to
reflect anxiety profiles. Three trials were performed for 3-week program. Results
showed that the subjects with ECG feedback revealed a significant improvement in
speech performance and anxiety states, which compared to those in the control group.
These findings suggest that visualization of the anxiety profile feedback with ECG
can be a better cognitive therapeutic strategy in speech anxiety.<component x="51.02"

public speaking. It commonly presents in delivering a speech that leads to interfere
with social communication. Speech anxiety has been investigated in the field of
communication and psychology. In language education, assessment of the anxiety state
and developing a new strategy to overcome such state has been the primary focus.
However, because anxiety can affect speech performance, other academic fields have
also participated in treating speech anxiety (Daly et al. 2009; Pull 2012). For
example, anxiety that is caused by the negative experience-trait anxiety is managed
by consultation psychology. State anxiety, which is caused by similar circumstance
with uncomfortable memory, can be approached by a different field. In educational
aspect, known strategies from the fields of psychology or communication are limited.
Even in the educational program, current etiologies and strategies (Table 1) do not
provide a satisfactory solution to cope with speech anxiety (Ministry of education,
Science and technology 2009). Phenomenon of speech anxiety is different from reducing
the anxiety. It is not caused by lack of insight, but from inability to perform
despite knowing what needs to be spoken. 'Practice the speech as many times as
possible with positive self-suggestion' may no longer be a specific strategy.
Although there exist methods to which speech anxiety is assessed, including the
observation, selfreport and measurement of biofeedback, or interview (Kim 1995),
overcoming speech anxiety requires further modalities.<component x="306.14" y="74.9"

electroencephalogram, electrocardiography, or blood pressure monitoring, can reflect
objective values in the individuals. Most biosignals have been extensively
investigated in medicine, physiology or engineering. However, lack of collaborative
efforts on bio-signals analysis and feedback strategies limit us to gain the
biological information on speech anxiety. Anxiety is associated with physiological
changes, such as an increase of heart rate, perspiration, muscle tension, or rapid
respiration (Barlow 2001). Anxiety increases sympathetic discharge in the nervous
system. Increased blood supply to the heart relatively decreases the blood flow in
the digestive system, which results in diarrhea or constipation (Fox 2008). Since
speech anxiety also influences the autonomic nervous system with physiological
responses, it enables 'speech anxiety' that expresses bio-signals, which reflects the
degree of anxiety. An electrocardiogram (ECG) records periodic electrical activities
of the heart. Clinically, wave abnormalities are frequently used to elucidate cardiac
dysfunction, such as a depressed 'ST segment' in patients with angina (Garcia and
Holtz 2003). Variabilities of R-R intervals have been used to provide heart rate,
thus, subsequently interpreting the autonomic nervous system during the anxiety
status (Sinji 2004; Yang et al. 2009; Jang et al. 2010). The purpose of this present
study is to investigate whether the monitoring of R-R intervals can be a potential
therapeutic strategy. We hypothesized that the group provided with ECG feedback will
show a significant improvement. We attempted to monitor the real time measurement of
the R-R intervals, with video recording during speech. As a feedback, R-R
interval-based anxiety profiles were provided together with speech
performance.<component x="51.02" y="84.19" width="238.17" height="432.34" page="2"

change, thus, there was no overlap between times until the end of the test (Fig. 3a).
In case of a fluent and a well-trained announcer, a positive control, showed the

be applied as a potential therapeutic strategy in speech anxiety. Monitoring of the
real time measurement of ECG and providing the R-R intervals, as a feedback, showed a
better outcome in speech performance. ECG provides a time dependant
electrophysiological factors. Since it determines the variable degree of speech
anxiety by R-R intervals, it would be of benefit to detect the time point when the
subject was delivering the speech. This technique has advantages over the measurement
by the speech anxiety spectrum or times series analysis. The difference of this
study, when comparing to that of the previous biofeedback program, is that it
provided visualization process, which used ECG recording. Therefore, the changes in
the R-R intervals enabled the subjects to monitor their anxiety profiles. Whereas,
previously proposed strategies are 'as many practice sessions or trials as possible'
or 'increase one's self confidence', and this study provided objective bio-signals
that allowed the participants to self-monitor the anxiety state. Visualization of
anxiety profiles, which used medical information, provides an educational
significance as one of cognitive strategy. Therefore, recognition of bio-signals and
experience of the recovery point are more effective when compared to that of the
previous video biofeedback program. In this study, speech performance was improved to
be determined by the total score of speech test. However, it did not mean that all
the categories of speech showed a better performance. Further analysis showed that
'effective summarizing ability', 'semi-verbal expression', and 'nonverbal expression
ability' were effective. In particular, nonverbal expression ability was the most
effective with this method of speech anxiety profiling. There does not seem to be a
difference between 'contents' and 'expression'. However, there are limitations that
this study did not take into account. We attempted to start this program with a group
of high school students. All of them were men and had the same age of 17 years. As an
initial study to test this strategy, it might be reasonable to know the feasibility
in a homogenously educated group. However, effectiveness of this technique on other
age populations or gender was not determined. Further expansion of study into women
and to other age groups is also warranted. The other possibility to account for the
improvement can be that repeated trial itself may result in improvement. In this
study, feedback with video alone, which is commonly used for the treatment of speech
anxiety, also showed a trend of improvement, although it was not significant.
Therefore, a better performance in the experimental group cannot be explained by the
repetition itself. Instead, exploring the most optimal number of trials also needs to
be determined. In addition, how long the effect can be maintained will be addressed
as well. Further follow-up study is necessary to answer this question. In conclusion,
speech anxiety can affect the speech performance and the associated anxiety can be
presented by the ECG bio-signal, R-R interval. Analysis and the use of R-R interval,
as anxiety profile and visualization, enable cognitive strategies to cope with speech
anxiety.<component x="51.02" y="74.95" width="238.13" height="631.61" page="7"

to set out in efforts to determine the effect of electrocardiographic (ECG) feedback
on the performance in speech anxiety. Forty-six high school students participated in
a speech performance educational program. They were randomly divided into two groups,
an experimental group with ECG feedback (N = 21) and a control group (N = 25).
Feedback was given with video recording in the control, whereas in the experimental
group, an additional ECG feedback was provided. Speech performance was evaluated by
the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) speech ability test, which determines the 10
different speaking categories. ECG was recorded during rest and speech, together with
a video recording of the speech performance. Changes in R-R intervals were used to
reflect anxiety profiles. Three trials were performed for 3-week program. Results
showed that the subjects with ECG feedback revealed a significant improvement in
speech performance and anxiety states, which compared to those in the control group.
These findings suggest that visualization of the anxiety profile feedback with ECG
can be a better cognitive therapeutic strategy in speech anxiety.<component x="51.02"

public speaking. It commonly presents in delivering a speech that leads to interfere
with social communication. Speech anxiety has been investigated in the field of
communication and psychology. In language education, assessment of the anxiety state
and developing a new strategy to overcome such state has been the primary focus.
However, because anxiety can affect speech performance, other academic fields have
also participated in treating speech anxiety (Daly et al. 2009; Pull 2012). For
example, anxiety that is caused by the negative experience-trait anxiety is managed
by consultation psychology. State anxiety, which is caused by similar circumstance
with uncomfortable memory, can be approached by a different field. In educational
aspect, known strategies from the fields of psychology or communication are limited.
Even in the educational program, current etiologies and strategies (Table 1) do not
provide a satisfactory solution to cope with speech anxiety (Ministry of education,
Science and technology 2009). Phenomenon of speech anxiety is different from reducing
the anxiety. It is not caused by lack of insight, but from inability to perform
despite knowing what needs to be spoken. 'Practice the speech as many times as
possible with positive self-suggestion' may no longer be a specific strategy.
Although there exist methods to which speech anxiety is assessed, including the
observation, selfreport and measurement of biofeedback, or interview (Kim 1995),
overcoming speech anxiety requires further modalities.<component x="306.14" y="74.9"

electroencephalogram, electrocardiography, or blood pressure monitoring, can reflect
objective values in the individuals. Most biosignals have been extensively
investigated in medicine, physiology or engineering. However, lack of collaborative
efforts on bio-signals analysis and feedback strategies limit us to gain the
biological information on speech anxiety. Anxiety is associated with physiological
changes, such as an increase of heart rate, perspiration, muscle tension, or rapid
respiration (Barlow 2001). Anxiety increases sympathetic discharge in the nervous
system. Increased blood supply to the heart relatively decreases the blood flow in
the digestive system, which results in diarrhea or constipation (Fox 2008). Since
speech anxiety also influences the autonomic nervous system with physiological
responses, it enables 'speech anxiety' that expresses bio-signals, which reflects the
degree of anxiety. An electrocardiogram (ECG) records periodic electrical activities
of the heart. Clinically, wave abnormalities are frequently used to elucidate cardiac
dysfunction, such as a depressed 'ST segment' in patients with angina (Garcia and
Holtz 2003). Variabilities of R-R intervals have been used to provide heart rate,
thus, subsequently interpreting the autonomic nervous system during the anxiety
status (Sinji 2004; Yang et al. 2009; Jang et al. 2010). The purpose of this present
study is to investigate whether the monitoring of R-R intervals can be a potential
therapeutic strategy. We hypothesized that the group provided with ECG feedback will
show a significant improvement. We attempted to monitor the real time measurement of
the R-R intervals, with video recording during speech. As a feedback, R-R
interval-based anxiety profiles were provided together with speech
performance.<component x="51.02" y="84.19" width="238.17" height="432.34" page="2"

be applied as a potential therapeutic strategy in speech anxiety. Monitoring of the
real time measurement of ECG and providing the R-R intervals, as a feedback, showed a
better outcome in speech performance. ECG provides a time dependant
electrophysiological factors. Since it determines the variable degree of speech
anxiety by R-R intervals, it would be of benefit to detect the time point when the
subject was delivering the speech. This technique has advantages over the measurement
by the speech anxiety spectrum or times series analysis. The difference of this
study, when comparing to that of the previous biofeedback program, is that it
provided visualization process, which used ECG recording. Therefore, the changes in
the R-R intervals enabled the subjects to monitor their anxiety profiles. Whereas,
previously proposed strategies are 'as many practice sessions or trials as possible'
or 'increase one's self confidence', and this study provided objective bio-signals
that allowed the participants to self-monitor the anxiety state. Visualization of
anxiety profiles, which used medical information, provides an educational
significance as one of cognitive strategy. Therefore, recognition of bio-signals and
experience of the recovery point are more effective when compared to that of the
previous video biofeedback program. In this study, speech performance was improved to
be determined by the total score of speech test. However, it did not mean that all
the categories of speech showed a better performance. Further analysis showed that
'effective summarizing ability', 'semi-verbal expression', and 'nonverbal expression
ability' were effective. In particular, nonverbal expression ability was the most
effective with this method of speech anxiety profiling. There does not seem to be a
difference between 'contents' and 'expression'. However, there are limitations that
this study did not take into account. We attempted to start this program with a group
of high school students. All of them were men and had the same age of 17 years. As an
initial study to test this strategy, it might be reasonable to know the feasibility
in a homogenously educated group. However, effectiveness of this technique on other
age populations or gender was not determined. Further expansion of study into women
and to other age groups is also warranted. The other possibility to account for the
improvement can be that repeated trial itself may result in improvement. In this
study, feedback with video alone, which is commonly used for the treatment of speech
anxiety, also showed a trend of improvement, although it was not significant.
Therefore, a better performance in the experimental group cannot be explained by the
repetition itself. Instead, exploring the most optimal number of trials also needs to
be determined. In addition, how long the effect can be maintained will be addressed
as well. Further follow-up study is necessary to answer this question. In conclusion,
speech anxiety can affect the speech performance and the associated anxiety can be
presented by the ECG bio-signal, R-R interval. Analysis and the use of R-R interval,
as anxiety profile and visualization, enable cognitive strategies to cope with speech
anxiety.<component x="51.02" y="74.95" width="238.13" height="631.61" page="7"
