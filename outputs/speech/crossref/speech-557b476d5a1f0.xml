relationship between the onset of reading and language specific speech perception,
the degree to which native speech perception is superior to non-native speech
perception, was investigated. In Experiment 1 with children of 4, 6, and 8 years,
language specific speech perception occurred maximally at 6 years and was positively
related to reading ability for age and language comprehension level. In Experiment 2,
with an expanded range of ages and various stimulus and task changes, the
relationship between reading and language specific speech perception still held, and
maximal language specific speech perception occurred around the onset of reading
instruction for three different sets of speech contrasts, but not for a control set
of non-speech contrasts. The results show that language specific speech perception is
a linguistic rather than an acoustic phenomenon. Results are discussed in terms of
early speech perception abilities, experience with oral phonics versus whole word
reading instruction, and the effect of age communication, cognitive ability, reading
ability, alphabetic versus logographic languages, versusinstruction. Key words:

conducted on the relationship between reading ability and phonological processing
abilities in children. Wagner and Torgesen (Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1987; Wagner,
Torgesen, Laughton, Simmons &amp; Rashotte, 1993; Wagner, Torgesen &amp; Rashotte,
1994) identified three aspects of phonological processing. These are (a) phonological
awareness, consisting of phonological analysis (phoneme segmentation and
categorisation tasks) and phonological synthesis (phoneme blending); (b) retrieval of
phonological codes from long-term store, either in isolated or serial speeded naming
tasks; and (c) phonological recoding to maintain information in working memory (using
tasks such as digit span and sentence repetition recall). All three are relatively
stable over development (Wagner et al., 1993, 1994; Hansen &amp; Bowey, 1994), and
related to reading ability. There is evidence for (a) a causal relationship between
phonological awareness and reading ability (Calfee, Lindamood &amp; Lindamood, 1973;
Bradley &amp; Bryant, 1985; Goswami &amp; Bryant, 1990; Wagner et al., 1994), and for
a reciprocal causal relationship between phonological awareness and reading (Morais,
Cary, Alegria &amp; Bertelson, 1979; Read, Zhang, Nie &amp; Ding, 1986; Bradley &amp;
Bryant, 1978; Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1987, Wagner et al., 1994); (b) a positive
relationship between children's phonological recoding in lexical access and their
reading ability (Wolf, 1984; Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1987); and (c) a positive
relationship between children's phonological recoding to maintain information in
working memory and their reading ability (e.g., Mann &amp; Liberman, 1984; Hansen
&amp; Bowey, 1994). Are these three aspects of phonological processing different
abilities or imperfect measures of the same underlying ability? Wagner and Torgeson
(1987; Wagner et al., 1993) support a model in which one underlying ability accounts
for phonological analysis and working memory performance, and another for
phonological synthesis and performance on retrieval of phonological code tasks. The
first is the most important source of individual differences in kindergarten
children's phonological processing and is argued to have a phonological basis,
whereby the quality of children's phonological representations affects their memory
span performance (Wagner et al., 1993). This is thus a perceptual primacy hypothesis:
if phonological representations are misaligned or degraded (due to inaccurate or
imperfect speech perception mechanisms), then phonological awareness and memory span
performance will be impaired (Wagner et al., 1993) as will, in turn, reading ability.
To investigate this hypothesis it is important that the relationship between speech
perception, phonological processing, and reading be investigated, and this will be
done here. Research on phonological processing and reading has mostly been conducted
independently of speech perception research. In an exception to this McBride-Chang
(1996) tested whether speech perception affects reading ability directly, or
indirectly via its effect on phonological processing. Structural modeling with eight-
to ten-year-old children revealed the most parsimonious model was one in which speech
perception affects phonological awareness, which in turn affects word reading.
Similar results have been found with reading disabled adults (Watson &amp; Miller,
1993). Gibbs (1996) found similar but delayed effects at the onset of reading, with
speech perception ability at five and six years predicting phonological awareness at
six and seven years, respectively. Together these results support the contention that
basic speech perception abilities are indeed implicated in reading difficulties via
their effect on phonological analysis skills (Wagner et al., 1994). A basic speech
perception skill is categorical speech perception in which stimuli differing along
physical continua such as formant transitions or voice onset time are perceived to
belong to distinct categories (Eimas, Siqueland, Jusczyk &amp; Vigorito, 1971;
Burnham, Earnshaw &amp; Clark, 1991; Aslin, Pisoni, Hennessy &amp; Perey, 1981;
Burnham, 1986). A number of studies have shown that children with reading
difficulties produce less sharp category boundaries than their normal reading
counterparts (Brandt &amp; Rosen, 1980, but see Werker &amp; Tees, 1987; Godfrey,
Syrdal-Lasky, Millay &amp; Knox, 1981; Hurford &amp; Sanders, 1990; Manis,
McBride-Chang, Seidenberg, Keating, Doi, Munson &amp; Petersen, 1997; Joanisse,
Manis, Keating &amp; Seidenberg, 2000; Werker &amp; Tees, 1987). Werker and Tees
(1987) take such results to show that phonological categories are less robust in
reading disabled than normal reading children, and that group differences are
functionally significant and especially evident under stressful conditions (Werker
&amp; Tees, 1987; Brady, Shankweiler &amp; Mann, 1983). However, as to the basis of
this difference between disabled and normal reading, the underlying perceptual cause
is as yet uncertain. Again we can see that the relationship between speech perception
and reading begs further enquiry (Werker &amp; Tees, 1987). A possible perceptual
factor underlying reading and reading disability is the ability to process rapid
changes in acoustic stimuli. Children with specific language impairment have
difficulty discriminating speech sound pairs distinguished by rapid frequency changes
in formant transitions (consonants), but not pairs of steady-state (vowel) sounds
(Tallal &amp; Piercy, 1974; Reed, 1989), or in processing rapid visualstimuli (Reed,
1989). Tallal (1980; Tallal &amp; Piercy, 1973a, b, 1974) suggests that the
difficulty lies in discriminating the temporal sequence of rapidly-presented acoustic
(not necessarily linguistic) stimuli, i.e., that there is a primary perceptual
deficit. There are training studies to support this notion (Tallal, Miller, Bedi,
Byma, Wang, Nagarajan, Schreiner, Jenkins &amp; Merzenich, 1996; Merzenich, Jenkins,
Johnston, Schreiner, Miller &amp; Tallal, 1996), however, the specific benefit of
training on non-speech as opposed to speech stimuli on reading is yet to be
demonstrated, and there is opposing evidence that the difficulty is specifically with
phonological contrasts rather than more general acoustic features (Mody,
Studdert-Kennedy &amp; Brady, 1997). So, it is by no means clear that the perceptual
factor of which Tallal speaks is a primary acoustic factor as claimed, rather than a
specifically linguistic factor. Pointers to a perceptual basis for reading skills may
be gleaned from considering developmental processes in speech perception. Young
infants' astounding abilities to discriminate almost any phonologically-relevant or
irrelevant phonetic contrast are well-documented (e.g., Eimas et al., 1971; Streeter,
1976; Best, McRoberts &amp; Sithole, 1988, Burnham et al., 1991; see Burnham, 1986,
and Goodman &amp; Nusbaum, 1994 for reviews). This initial speech perception is then
modified through processes of attunement (Aslin, Pisoni, Hennessy &amp; Perey, 1981),
prototype abstraction for native language phones (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl, Williams,
Lacerda, Stevens &amp; Lindblom, 1992), and especially attenuation for non-native
phones (Burnham et al., 1991; Burnham, 1986; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker,
Gilbert, Humphrey &amp; Tees, 1981; Werker &amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker &amp;
Lalonde, 1988; Werker, 1994). These processes result in the perceptual reorganisation
of initial phonetic classes into language specific phonological categories around 6
to 9 months (Werker, 1994). Based on such evidence Werker and Tees (1987) suggest
that infants' initial phonetic sensitivities are the building blocks of phonological
categories, and that these categories are then sharpened by experience with oral
communication. In line with this, an alternative model to Tallal's (1980) primary
perceptual deficit is that there is a secondary perceptual deficit based on subtle
differences in the efficiency and accuracy with which children reorganise their
speech perception in accord with the specific phonology of their language
environment. Additionally we have obtained evidence that phonological categories may
written also be sharpened by experience with language. Burnham (1986; Burnham, et
al., 1991) investigated English language environment listeners' ability to perceive
two synthetic stop contrasts; one phonologically relevant, irrelevant and another
phonologically . Using the Infant Speech Identification method (Burnham, Earnshaw
&amp; Quinn, 1987) perceptual ability for each of 1 1 / years, 6 / years, and in the
two contrasts was tested at 10 months, 2 2 2 adults. Analysis of category boundary
sharpness showed perception of the h ] contrast, perceived as /b/ and /p/ by English
phonologically-relevant [p]-[p speakers, became more categorical with increasing age,
especially between two and six years. However, for the phonologically-irrelevant
contrast, [b]- [p], both perceived as /b/ by English speakers, boundary sharpness
improved between infancy and two years, reverted to chance level at six years, and
then improved slightly by adulthood. Burnham (1986; Burnham et al., 1991) speculated
that the intensification of language specific speech perception between two and six
years is related to the onset of reading instruction. Encouragement to process
language in terms of separate phonemes, and instruction in phoneme-tographeme mapping
would, it was reasoned, promote speech perception bias towards away from phoneme
classes of the ambient language and phonologicversus ally irrelevant phonetic
differences (e.g., [b] [p] for English language environment listeners). This language
specific speech perception, as it may be called, would facilitate the
phoneme-to-grapheme mapping process, one of the most difficult tasks in reading
acquisition. Based on this reasoning, we may hypothesise that around school age, the
degree of language specific speech perception will be positively related to
children's reading ability. The Burnham et al. (1991) results also show significant
improvement for the nonnative contrast by adulthood; presumably as a result of
reading becoming more automatic, fine-grained phonetic discriminations again are
possible. The two experiments reported here were conducted to investigate this
proposed relationship between language specific speech perception and reading. Both
experiments concern young children's perception of phonologically-relevant and
phonologically-irrelevant speech contrasts, and their performance on reading-related
tests. Four questions are investigated. 1. What is the developmental locus of the
intensification of language specific speech perception observed by Burnham et al.
(1991)? Does it occur specifically at six years and does it abate at some later
stage? 2. Is language specific speech perception related to reading acquisition? 3.
Is the language specific speech perception phenomenon robust - is h ] and attenuation
for the non-native improvement for the native [p]-[p [b]-[p] contrast also evident
for other native/non-native speech contrasts, and in other test situations? 4. Is
language specific speech perception a specifically linguistic phenomenon or can it be
explained by more general auditory processes?<component x="130.35" y="204.57"

are to define the developmental locus of the intensification of language specific
speech perception, and to investigate whether it is related to reading ability.
Burnham et al. (1991) found a trough in the perception of non-native speech sounds at
six years compared with two years and adulthood. As there were wide differences
between ages, the locus could not be specified. Here four-, six-, and eight-year-old
English language environment children were tested on each of the two contrasts used
in our h ] and the non-native [b]-[p] (Burnham et al., earlier study, the native
[p]-[p 1991). To investigate the relationship with reading ability, children were
also given an articulation, a language comprehension, and for the six- and
eightyear-olds, a reading test. It was expected that language specific speech
perception (given by the perceptual ability for native (N) minus the ability for
non-native (NN) speech contrasts) should occur maximally at six years of age, and
that children's degree of language specific speech perception should be positively
related to their reading ability.<component x="130.35" y="313.77" width="334.73"

perception test is described in detail in Burnham et al. (1991), and more briefly
here. Participants sat facing a large screen painted blue to the left and orange to
the right of their midline. The screen housed central attention-getting lights, a
central audio speaker through which sounds were presented, and two lateral
reinforcement windows each of which could be illuminated to reveal animated toy
rabbits. In front of the child were two paddles side-by-side, color-coded to match
the two sides of the screen. When one of the two training sounds was presented
centrally, pressing the paddle on the side pre-assigned for that sound resulted in
reinforcement delivery from the window on that side, and similarly for the other
sound and side. Incorrect paddle presses were not reinforced. Stimulus sounds were
synthesised bilabial stop consonants plus the vowel [a:]. For the native contrast
condition the training sounds were synthesised bilabial stop consonants of 0 msec
voice onset time (VOT), [pa:], and h a:] (/ba/ and /pa/ in English), and the
generalisation test +70 msec VOT, [p sounds were these endpoints plus the six
intervening sounds at 10 msec VOT intervals, i.e., bilabial stops with VOTs of 0, 10,
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 msec. For the non-native contrast condition the training
sounds were synthesised bilabial stops of 0 msec VOT, [pa:], and -70 msec VOT, [ba:]
(both /ba/ in English), and the generalisation test sounds were these plus the six
intervening sounds at 10 msec VOT intervals, i.e., bilabial stops with VOTs of 0,
-10, -20, -30, -40, -50, -60, and -70 msec. Sounds were played on an Otari MX5050
reel-to-reel tape recorder through an Acoustics Research BXi speaker. Each stimulus
syllable was 500 msec in duration, and in each trial 10 repetitions of each syllable
were presented with 250 msecs of silence between repetitions. Thus each trial was of
7.5 secs duration. Language tests The Queensland Articulation Test (Kilminister &amp;
Laird, 1978), the Bankson Language Screening Test (Bankson, 1977), and the Daniels
and Diack Reading Test Number 1 (Daniels &amp; Diack, 1974) were used. The Queensland
Articulation Test (QAT hereafter) is a 64-item Australian language test similar to
the Edinburgh Articulation Test, in which subjects are asked to name pictured
objects. The items are designed such that all English language consonants are tested
in initial, medial and final positions with ] medial and final appropriate
phonotactic constraints ([h] initial only, [ ], and [j] initial and medial only, and
[ ] medial only). only, [w], [ Productions are scored as correct or incorrect with a
possible total of 64. Children were tested on a subset of the 39 most discriminating
items of the Bankson Language Screening Test (Bankson hereafter), including items to
test syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic understanding (Bankson, 1977). Each item was
scored as correct or incorrect with a possible total of 39. Six- and eight-year-olds,
but not four-year-olds, were also given the Daniels and Diack Reading Test Number 1
(Reading hereafter), consisting of 36 items which become progressively more
difficult. Children are required to read the items aloud and continue until they make
errors on three consecutive items. Items 1 to 26 require a yes/no answer, the answer
being recorded simply to maintain the child's interest, and each item is awarded 3
points if no reading errors occur. The remaining items are questions with four
multiple-choice answers, with one point given if the question is read correctly and
one for each of the 4 alternatives read correctly. The maximum possible score is

native contrast perception test, the non-native contrast perception test, the QAT,
and the Bankson. The six- and eight-yearolds were also given the Reading test.
Subjects were usually tested first on one of the perception tests, then the language
tests, and then the other perception test. This order was sometimes modified if the
child found the perception test initially daunting. Despite such deviations order of
presentation of the native and non-native perception tests was counterbalanced
between subjects, as was order within the language tests. The procedure for the QAT,
the Bankson, and Reading followed the prescribed published procedures (Kilminister
&amp; Laird, 1978; Bankson, 1977; Daniels &amp; Diack, 1974). The procedure for the
speech perception tests was identical for the native and non-native contrasts, except
that the stimuli, and the random presentation orders of test stimuli differed.
Children sat in front of the screen, were told they would hear one of two sounds, and
instructed to press one paddle for one sound and the other for the other sound. For
example, the child was told on the left "When you hear the 'ba' sound press this blue
paddle here ( ) and on the right when you hear the 'pa' sound press this orange
paddle here ( )". Similar instructions were given for the non-native contrast with
the prevoicing in the -70 msec stimulus being pronounced "mba". The consequences of
pressing the correct paddle (reinforcement by animated bunny) were demonstrated.
Children were told to use only one hand to press the paddles, and instructed to keep
the agreed-upon hand on the table on an appropriatelysized red handprint until the
stimulus sound began, with the other hand kept under the table. One experimenter
stayed next to the child for the initial part of training. For the six- and
eight-year-olds the experimenter then retired but for the four-year-olds the
experimenter remained to monitor performance and maintain the child's interest. In
the initial period, reinforced training with randomly-presented end point sounds
continued until at least three unprompted correct paddle presses to each side
occurred. Then any three consecutive correct responses to the randomly-presented
endpoints was followed by an unreinforced generalisation test trial in which one of
the eight possible test sounds was presented. After each test trial children returned
to reinforced training until a further three consecutive correct responses occurred.
Reinforcement was given for correct training trials but no reinforcement was given in
test trials. Testing 1 continued until all eight test trials had been presented once.
The time taken to complete the tests varied with age. The four-year-olds required two
testing sessions totalling around 1.5 hours. This included short breaks if required
by the child. The six- and eight-year-olds completed the tests in a single session of
between 50 and 75 minutes.<component x="130.35" y="204.57" width="334.82"

responses for the 8 test trials are compared with 7 ideal categorical curves
constructed with sharp crossovers between the two versus response types ("ba" "pa"

These 7 curves use the narrowest possible VOT width here (10 msec), with category

closeness of fit is determined by a method similar to testing planned contrasts in an
analysis of variance. The resultant degree of fit, between -1 and +1, measures the

found that at 6 2 years of age there was a significant reduction of scores for a
non-native speech contrast, despite continued improvement for a similar native
contrast, and that this difference decreased by adulthood. In that experiment native
and non-native contrasts was a between subject factor, and here it was deliberately
made within subjects, to allow correlations and regression analyses. Each subject's
nonnative contrast categorical score was subtracted from their native categorical
score, (N-NN), as a measure of language specific speech perception. Initial
exploratory correlations of the native, non-native, and (N-NN) scores with age and
QAT, Bankson, and Reading scores revealed an interesting complex of results. Age was
positively correlated with both native and non-native r negatively scores ( = 0.20,
0.21, respectively) but correlated with (N-NN) r scores ( = -0.15). On the other hand
all the language tests were positively correlated with native, negatively correlated
with non-native, and positively r correlated with (N-NN) scores ( = 0.08, -0.01, and
0.03 respectively for QAT; 0.11, -0.17, and 0.18 for Bankson; and 0.29, -0.10, and
0.16 for pattern Reading). While the magnitude of some of these is negligible, the of
results suggests that N-NN scores may be tapping something different than either
native or non-native scores alone. This is not inconsistent with our notion that N-NN
should measure language specific speech perception, independently of native and
non-native scores. Accordingly, the scores for the three language tests and subjects'
exact ages were regressed onto the NNN language specific speech perception scores.
Two separate analyses were conducted, one with all subjects in which the reading
scores were omitted, and one for just the six- and eight-year-olds in which reading
scores were included. 2 F The regression with all subjects was significant R = 0.29,
(3,32) = 4.42, P &lt; (N-NN) = 0.48 QAT 0.01, MSE = 0.27, and the regression equation

rounding the resultant coefficient to +1, 0 or -1 is a way to simplify the regression
equation to facilitate meaningful verbal descriptions (DeSarbo, Hausman, Shen &amp;
Thompson, 1982; Harris, 1985). Using this method the resultant equation is (N-NN) =
QAT - Age. This, along with the significance tests shows that language specific
speech perception is highest in those participants with relatively good articulation
ability for their age. The regression which included Reading scores conducted with

be interpreted to show that language specific speech perception is highest in those

lateness="0.4" reference_score="8.47">Burnham et al. (1991) showed that there is a
period of increased language specific speech perception some time between 2 years and
adulthood. The speech perception results here suggest that this occurs specifically
around 6 years. In addition, the results are consistent with the notion that language
specific speech perception subsides around 8 years; while categorical perception
scores for the native contrast continued to increase from 4 to 6 to 8 years, there
was a U-shaped trend for the non-native contrast suggesting that categorical speech
perception of the non-native contrast was worse at 6 than 4 or 8 years. However, this
should be interpreted cautiously, as while a similar quadratic trend component was
significant in Burnham et al. (1991), it was not here. This effect here may have been
ameliorated for two possible reasons. Firstly, the categorical scores here were
generally high (see Figure 2) relative to those in Burnham et al. (1991; see Figure 2
there), possibly because in the earlier study children were simply told they would
hear two sounds and left to deduce the sound/button-press contingencies themselves,
whereas here more specific phonologically-relevant labels for the speech sounds were
given to reduce test duration, and allow the other language tests to be completed.
These generally higher scores here may have reduced any potential quadratic trend. A
second possibility is that the ages 4, 6, and 8 years represent the trough of a
broader dip in non-native speech perception performance, and that if younger and
older ages are included this trend may become more evident. To investigate this,
finer gradations and a wider range of ages are used in Experiment 2, and power is
increased by more than doubling subject numbers in each age group. So the first aim
of this study has been only partly realised - it appears that the locus of the
intensification of post-infancy language specific speech perception occurs around 6
years, i.e., around the onset of reading, but further evidence is required. The
regression analysis with the four-, six-, and eight-year-olds showed that language
specific speech perception is positively related to children's level of articulation
ability for age. This makes good intuitive sense: if particular children are
articulating well for their age then it should follow that they have greater
perceptual bias towards the speech sounds present in their own language. The
direction of causality between speech perception and speech production, or whether
causality is uni- or bi-directional (Werker, 1993) cannot be determined here, but it
is notable that very few instances of a relationship between children's speech
perception and speech production skills have been reported previously (Zlatin &amp;
Koenigsknecht, 1976; Strange &amp; Broen, 1981). The reason that we found a
perception-production relationship here may be that we used language specific
perceptual bias (N-NN) scores based on two different speech contrasts, rather than
perceptual ability on a single task. Further study of the relationship between
language specificity in speech perception and speech production is warranted. The
regression analysis with just the six- and eight-year-old children, and with reading
added, showed that children who are good readers for their age and level of language
comprehension are those who manifest greater language specific speech perception.
(Articulation ability was no longer a significant predictor, suggesting that after
the onset of reading instruction, reading is a more powerful predictor of language
specific speech perception than is articulation.) Again the regression solution makes
sense intuitively. Children who have high language specific speech perception should
have a good grasp of the phoneme-to-grapheme conversion rules involved in reading,
and should be able to apply these rules to unfamiliar words. In addition, such
children should have a good grasp of which phonetic variations signal phonological
differences in their language and which are simply allophones of a native language
phoneme class. Again the direction of causality cannot be determined here, though
either causal direction would appear intuitively feasible.<component x="130.35"

language specific speech developmental locus perception found in Experiment 1. To
investigate the of the intensification of language specific speech perception in a
more fine-grained manner, a wider range of ages was included. Children at the
beginning of their first year of school (called 'Kindergarten' year in Sydney
schools), children at the end of their Kindergarten year, and children in subsequent
years, Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4, as well as a control group of adults were tested. Power

the tion and reading , measures of phonological segmentation and reading ability were
included. nature of language specific speech perception Regarding the it is unclear
from the results of Experiment 1 whether language specific speech perception involves
a bias towards native as opposed to non-native speech sounds, or a familiar
unfamiliar bias towards (native) sounds and away from all sounds, be they non-native
speech or even non-speech. To evaluate this, non-speech analogues of voicing
contrasts, tone onset time (TOT) stimuli, were included. If performance on non-native
contrasts were to be attenuated for six-year-olds below the level of these non-speech
TOT sounds then the bias could be said to be specifically phonological.
generalisability To investigate the of the results of Experiment 1, three changes
were made. Firstly, naturally-produced as opposed to synthetic syllables were used.
Secondly, perception of two additional speech contrasts was tested. And thirdly, a
different method, discrimination rather than identification was used. If such changes
do not affect the basic relationship between speech perception and reading ability
found in Experiment 1, then we can conclude that this relationship is
robust.<component x="130.35" y="271.77" width="334.76" height="359.67" page="14"

Children were tested in schools close to the university. The youngest group of
children (Young Xage = 5-4.46 years, range = 4-2 to 5-10 years) were in their
Kindergarten; first year of schooling and tested in April, close to the start of the

perception, phoneme segmentation, and reading tests. Speech perception tests An AX
discrimination paradigm, in which pairs of sounds were presented for same/different
judgements, was used. To ensure that children understood the meanings of "same" and
"different" visual training materials, a card with two identical side-by-side red
squares ("same") and a card with a red square and a blue square side-by-side
("different"), and cards of nonsense animals which differed in the number of legs,
type of neck and patterning on the body were used. Some animal cards showed two
identical animals ("same"), others showed very different pairs ("different"), and yet
others showed slightly different pairs ("just a little bit different but still
different"). There were five blocks of trials, and in all five the interstimulus
interval (ISI) between the offset of sound 1 and the onset of sound 2 was 500-msec.
Participants were required to report whether the two sounds were the "same" or
"different". Stimulus sounds were recorded from a master tape on an Otari MX5050
reel-to-reel tape recorder with Ampex 631 tape onto TDK SA (Type II) cassette tapes.
A Marantz portable cassette recorder was used to present the sounds. There were three
blocks of speech sound stimuli, one block of nonspeech stimuli, and an auditory
post-test block, always presented last. The three speech sound blocks consisted of
natural speech tokens of consonants paired with the [a:] vowel. Each of these three
speech sound blocks contained two speech contrasts: one which was
phonologically-relevant for English language environment listeners (produced by a
male native English speaker) and one which was phonologically irrelevant for English
language listeners (produced by a male native Hindi speaker). The productions of the
English and Hindi speaker were selected and edited to ensure that intonation contour,
pitch, and duration of the tokens were perceptually equivalent via initial screening
by a panel of experienced judges, and further acoustic screening with a speech
editor. Two different tokens of each phone were used to ensure acoustic variability,
while maintaining phonetic identity. Sounds used in the five blocks are described
below and acoustic and phonetic details of native and non-native sounds are given in
Appendix 1A, 1B, and 1C for blocks A, B, and C, respectively. Block A - bilabial

non-speech analogues of VOT contrasts because they are composed of a high frequency
(1500 Hz) component modelled on the high frequency broad-band burst in stop
consonants and a low frequency (500 Hz) component modelled on the low frequency voice
bar in stop consonants (Pisoni, 1977); and because they tend to be perceived

analogues of voiceless unaspirated 0 msec and voiceless aspirated +70 msec VOT stop
consonant contrasts (see native voicing contrasts, Block A and B above). For the 0
msec stimulus, onset of the two sinusoidal tones, one of 500 Hz, and another 1500 Hz,
was simultaneous and each lasted for 245 msec. For the +70 msec stimulus, the
duration of the 500 Hz tone was 245 msec, and its onset preceded the 175 msec 1500 Hz
tone by 70 msec. In both stimulus sounds the offset of the two tones was
simultaneous, with the total duration of each stimulus Negative TOT Contrast, 0 msec
vs -70 msec TOT: being 245 msec. These sounds are used as analogues of 0 msec
voiceless unaspirated and -70 msec voiced unaspirated VOT stops (see non-native
voicing contrasts in Blocks A, B above). The 0 msec stimulus was described above. For
the -70 msec stimulus, the duration of the low frequency 500 Hz tone was 315 msec and
its onset preceded that of the 245 msec 1500 Hz tone by 70 msec, so the total
duration of this sound was 315 msec. Block structure. In blocks A, B, C and D, 16 AX
pairs were presented. For each pair the ISI was 500 msec, employed to ensure that
subjects processed sounds at a phonetic level (Werker &amp; Logan, 1985; Werker &amp;
Tees, 1984b). Of the 16 pairs in each block, 8 were of the appropriate native
contrast and 8 were of the appropriate non-native contrast (positive and negative TOT
contrasts respectively for Block D). Within contrasts half (4) were pairs of the same
phone (or TOTs) and half (4) were pairs of different phones (or TOTs). For the same
pairs half (2) were the same phones (or TOTs) for one member of the contrast (AA
pairs) and half (2) were the same phones (or TOTs) for the other member of the
contrast (BB pairs). For "same" pairs in Blocks A, different B, and C tokens of the
same phone were used to ensure acoustic but not phonetic variability. For the
different pairs half (2) were presented in each order (AB or BA) and within each
order the tokens of each phone type varied across trials. Auditory post-test. To
ensure that children were applying the same/different labels correctly and that their
hearing was adequate, a series of eight AX pairs of harmonic tones was presented at
the end of the four test blocks. There was a high harmonic tone (based on 1500 Hz),
and a low harmonic tone (based on 500 Hz). Four of the AX trials were same stimuli
(two low-low and two high-high pairs) and 4 were different (high-low pairs with
counterbalanced order). Phoneme segmentation test The phoneme segmentation test
consisted of 24 items in which the targeted phoneme occurred either initially or
finally, and as a singleton or in a cluster, such that there were 6 items in each
initial/final singleton/cluster subgroup. &#xD7; Two versions of the test were given:
a receptive deletion task and a productive identification task. In the former,
children were told for example, "Say 'ice' without the /s/ sound". In the latter they
were asked, "What sound is in 'ice' but not in 'eye'?". Six practice items were
given. Reading test The Daniels and Diack Reading Test 1 was administered to all the
children (see 'Apparatus and materials' in Experiment 1).<component x="130.35"

individually in a quiet room at their school. Children sat on a small chair at a
table facing the experimenter. Each child was the given speech perception, phoneme
segmentation, and reading tests with order of presentation counterbalanced between
subjects. Children mostly completed all tests in one sitting ranging between 40 and
50 minutes. Breaks were given when the child required them and one experimenter gave
the speech tests and another the reading and phoneme segmentation tests to provide
some variety. The adults were only given the speech perception tests. Speech
perception test Training with the visual same/different training materials always
occurred first. Children were shown one card with two red squares and one with a blue
and red square and asked to identify which was "same" and "different". These were
then put face up on the table, one on each side of the child. Children were then
asked to place pairs of nonsense animals in the "same" or the "different" pile. When
the child categorized the animals correctly they then proceeded to the four auditory
blocks with order of block presentation counterbalanced between subjects. At the end
of each block two more nonsense animal pairs (one same, one different) were presented
to ensure continued understanding. Following the fourth block, the auditory post-test
was given. Subjects were excluded from later analysis if they did not score at least
6 correct on the 8 items in the auditory post-test. Adults were tested in a similar
fashion except that the same/different training materials were not used. Phoneme
segmentation test Children were first presented with the six practice items, and did
not proceed to the test items until they had responded correctly to at least 5 of
these, and/or until the experimenter considered that the child understood the task.
Half of the children in each age group were given the receptive deletion form and
half were given the productive identification form of the task. Reading test Children
were asked to read the items aloud and testing continued until errors occurred on
three consecutive items (see 'Apparatus and materials', Experiment 1). Intelligence
For the purpose of accounting for variability in regression analyses, each child was
given an estimate of general intelligence by their teacher. This was a simple
coarse-grained measure of "Above Average", "Average" or "Below Average", and these
were converted to scores of 3, 2 and 1 respectively. More detailed intelligence tests
could not be given due to the policy of the schools that participated in the study.
Scoring For the speech perception test discriminative index (DI) scores were
calculated, given by DI = (Correct 'Different' responses on Different Trials "Hits" -
Incorrect 'Different' responses on Same Trials "False Positives")/(Number of
Different (AB + BA) trials), with a denominator of 4 for all contrasts. Eight such DI
scores were calculated for each subject: a native and the non-native score for Blocks
A, B, and C, and an index each for the positive TOT contrast and the negative TOT

that this peak may be a product of some acoustic quirk of the particular native and

conducted in which the outcome measures were language specific speech perception
scores (N-NN) for each of the three sets of speech contrasts, and positive TOT bias
(P-N) scores for the nonspeech contrasts. The predictor variables in each were rated
intelligence, sex, age, phoneme segmentation, and reading. As significant
relationships were found between (N-NN) and age and language variables in Experiment
1, here intelligence and sex were entered first to partial them out, and then the
contribution of age, phoneme segmentation, and reading was ascertained. The 2 ,
F-values and coefficients are shown in Table 3 results of these analyses, R for the
three speech contrasts and the non-speech contrast, and the results are summarised
below. Speech contrasts. For all three speech contrasts, sex and intelligence did not
significantly predict the (N-NN) dependent variable, whereas the subsequent addition
of age and the language variables did. The coefficients are presented in Table 3.
Applying the same interpretive device as in Experiment 1 (DeSarbo et al., 1982;
Harris, 1985), the results for each contrast can be described as follows. For the
bilabials, (N-NN) = Reading - Age, which is the same solution as was found for
synthetic versions of these same contrasts in the identification task in Experiment
1, except that language comprehension (not measured here) appeared in the equation
there. A similar verbal description is applicable, children who have a high degree of
language specific speech perception tend to be good readers for their age. For the
alveolars, (N-NN) = Phoneme Segmentation - Reading - Age, so for these contrasts
children with a high degree of language specific speech perception are those who are
relatively good segmenters for their age and level of reading ability. This is a
similar but not identical result as that for bilabials and suggests that under some

greater language specific speech perception scores. Non-speech contrasts. For the
non-speech contrasts the regression for sex and intelligence was not significant, and
additionally age and the language not variables did add significantly to the
prediction. Thus applying the same analysis rationale as for the speech contrasts led
to no significant relationship between any of the predictor variables and the
dependent variable here, TOT (P-N). The only individual variable which even
approached significance was P intelligence ( = 0.053), and the positive beta weight
(see Table 3) shows that (P-N) scores were positively related to intelligence
(whereas for all the speech contrasts beta weights for intelligence were negligible).
Thus it can be concluded (P-N) scores for the TOT contrasts are unaffected by
linguistic variables (phonological segmentation and reading). This is in direct
contrast to the speech perception results, which show a relationship between (N-NN)
and linguistic variables, and/or a negative relationship with age. Non-native speech

it is of interest to determine the relationship between perception of non-native
speech and non-speech. Mean discrimination indices for the three native contrasts,
the three non-native contrasts, and the two non-speech contrasts are plotted against

of Experiment 1 and especially Experiment 2 (see Figure 5) suggest that language
specific speech perception is comprised of three components, as follows. facilitation
There is of the perception of native speech sounds due to linguistic experience.
There is attenuationof the perception of all other additional attenusounds, both
non-native speech and non-speech. There is ation below the normal level of of the
perception of non-native speech sounds perceptual acuity . These first two processes
are evident throughout development, at least after the onset of phonemic speech
perception in infancy (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl et al., 1992; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker
et al., 1981; Werker &amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker,
1994), and are certainly evident over the ages studied here. The third process is
generally evident over the ages studied here; though around the onset of reading
perception of both non-native speech sounds and non-speech sounds are equally and
maximally suppressed. This may be described as a floor effect, but it may be more
heuristic to characterise this as an efficient strategy whereby incoming sounds are
best assigned to orthographically defined categories if perceptual attention to all
sounds which are not native speech is equally attenuated. (Discrimination of
non-native speech and non-speech is also equal for adults, and this could be due to
adults being better able to adopt strategies to perform a particular laboratory
task.) Clearly these explanations are ad hoc, but they highlight the need for further
investigation of the dynamic interaction of speech perception processes such as
facilitation and attenuation right across development, in infants, children, and
adults (Aslin, 1981; Gottlieb, 1976).<component x="130.35" y="204.57" width="334.68"

specific speech perception with the onset of reading? Heightened language specific
speech perception in the early years of schooling has now been found in three
separate experiments (Burnham et al., 1991; Experiments 1 and 2 here), and to be
significantly related to reading acquisition in Experiments 1 and 2 here. This is
consistent with the notion that reading instruction in an alphabetic language directs
perceptual attention to matching graphemes to phonemes, which in turn requires
efficient phoneme segmentation, and efficient assignment of allophonic variants to
strictly defined phoneme categories. The continued ability to perceive the phonetic
characteristics which distinguish native speech phonemes and selectively suppress
just those phonetic characteristics which distinguish nonnative speech phones from
each other (Werker, 1994; Burnham, 1986), and from similar native phones (Best,
1994), that is, language specific speech perception, would be very useful at this
time. What we have found here is that there is heightened language specific speech
perception after children begin school, and this is related to the onset of reading.
Results here suggest that around reading onset children may adopt a strategy in which
perception ofall contrasts that are not phonologically relevant is suppressed, while
both before and after this time perceptual performance for non-native speech is
additionally suppressed. To the extent that the evidence presented here suggests that
the additional suppression for non-native speech contrasts is based on their phonetic
characteristics rather than any acoustic characteristics they share with non-speech
auditory level sounds, there is a prima facie argument against the involvement of a
lowdeficit as a precursor to reading difficulties (Tallal, 1980). Moreover, it is
clear that language specific speech perception is in place in early infancy, and thus
is a likely candidate to play a role in the acquisition of later linguistic abilities
(Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl et al., 1992; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker et al., 1981; Werker
&amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker, 1994). Indeed, the results of Experiment 1 here
suggest that around 4 years language specific speech perception is related to
articulation ability. Nevertheless, there is not yet sufficient evidence to make
definitive judgements on this issue; it remains possible that underlying individual
differences in speech production, speech perception, general cognitive ability
(Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995), and even auditory perception (Tallal, 1980) could
contribute to more sharply defined phonological categories in some pre-school
children than in others. Longitudinal studies from preschool through to post-reading
age are clearly required.<component x="130.35" y="204.57" width="334.71"

lateness="0.8571428571428571" reference_score="13.26">The heightened language
specific speech perception uncovered here around reading onset is additional to, and
in no way diminishes the importance of the well-documented perceptual reorganisation
between 6 and 12 months (Polka &amp; Werker, 1994; Kuhl et al., 1992; Werker &amp;
Lalonde, 1988; Werker &amp; Tees, 1992; Werker, 1994; Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995).
One main difference between earlier "phonemic" and the later "orthographic" periods
(Burnham, Tyler &amp; Horlyck, 2002) is that while in infancy perceptual
reorganisation occurs due to the natural ontogenetic processes of perceiving and
producing speech, in the later period, heightened language specific speech perception
results from the imposition of the "unnatural" requirement to read an alphabetic
language. It is the similarities between these two periods that are of most interest.
In both periods language specific speech perception does not involve any loss of
speech perception ability. Werker and colleagues showed that if the ISI in an AX
discrimination task is shortened to allow phonetic or acoustic processing (Werker
&amp; Tees, 1984b; Werker &amp; Logan, 1985), or if extensive exposure is given
(Werker &amp; Logan, 1985), adults candiscriminate non-native speech contrasts which
under normal circumstances they appear unable to discriminate. Thus, there is no
sensori-neural loss of speech perception; exposure to a particular language results
in perceptual selectivity rather than perceptual loss. In a similar vein, the
orthographic language specific speech perception uncovered here is transitory,
occurring specifically around the onset of formal language instruction, and
relinquishing hold around Grade 2 to Grade 3, possibly due to reading becoming more
proficient. Another important similarity between these two periods relates to the
work of Lalonde and Werker (1995), who suggest that there is an initial perceptual
analysis underlying all speech perception, which is untouched by specific linguistic
experience or general cognitive ability. The output of such perceptual analysis then
is redescribed at increasingly complex and abstract levels throughout development
(Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995; Karmiloff-Smith, 1991). So, according to Lalonde and
Werker, the same phonetic detail is available to infants before and after the six- to
nine-month reorganisation period, but during this period there is a redescription of
the output from phonetic analysers in order to reflect native speech categories. "The
redescription results in a second representation superimposed on the first, leaving
the original detail of language-general discrimination intact . . ." (Lalonde &amp;
Werker, 1995: 472). In this way Lalonde and Werker's model allows the infant's
ability for redescription to be related to general cognitive abilities, even if
underlying phonetic or acoustic abilities are more or less equivalent. This model may
be expanded if more were known about how the processes of speech perception interact
with other linguistic processes occurring at the time of redescription. For example,
does perceptual assimilation (Best, 1994) operate equivalently at all periods of
development, and do particular phonetic characteristics of speech sounds (Burnham,
1986; Stevens &amp; Keyser, 1989) differentially affect perceptual performance in
different developmental contexts? The orthographic period uncovered here could be
seen to be a further redescription, which is superimposed on the earlier
redescription (see Burnham et al., 2002, for elaboration). And like the earlier
redescription, there appear to be later vestiges of this. For instance, in auditory
phoneme deletion and addition tasks, Tyler and Burnham (2000) found adults had longer
reaction times for orthographic interference items, such as WORTH-EARTH - "add /w/ to
/ &#x3B8;/" or "delete /w/ from /w /", than for non-interfering items, such &#x3B8;
as FACT-ACT - "add /f/ to /&#xE6;kt/" or "delete /f/ from /f&#xE6;kt/" (see also Taft
&amp; Hambly, 1985).<component x="130.35" y="204.57" width="334.67" height="333.75"

lateness="0.8857142857142857" reference_score="11.46">There are important
implications of these results for reading instruction. Three of these are set out
below. Is reading instruction in an alphabetic language a necessary condition for the
intensification of language specific speech perception? In order to test this,
six-year-old children who were not being taught to read (either due to a later onset
or absence of schooling; Morais et al., 1979), and sixyear-olds being taught to read
a non-alphabetic script (Read et al., 1986) should be compared on native and
non-native speech perception. Additionally, given the supposed role of
phoneme-to-grapheme correspondences in language specific speech perception, it would
be of interest to investigate the degree of language specific speech perception when
children learn a language with a transparent orthography such as Spanish or Turkish,
in which phoneme-to-grapheme conversion rules are both feedforward and feedback
consistent, versus an opaque language such as English or Irish, with irregular
grapheme-to-phoneme mappings. Does phonics reading instruction result in greater
language specific speech perception than whole word reading instruction? Our
arguments above support the use of phonic rather than whole word methods of early
reading instruction, because the phonics method should facilitate acquisition of the
arbitrary language-specific phoneme-to-grapheme conversion rule conventions. If, as
we would predict, children taught with phonics-based methods (see Liberman &amp;
Liberman, 1992; Byrne &amp; Fielding-Barnsley, 1993; Schwartz, 1988) show greater
language specific speech perception independent of reading ability (Andrews, 1992a,
b) than children taught with a whole word method (Goodman &amp; Goodman, 1979;
Goodman, 1986), then this would suggest that heightened language specific speech
perception is consequence not only a of learning to read, but also anindexof reading
instruction efficacy. Is heightened language specific speech perception the result of
reading instruction or maturation? The heightened language specific speech perception
found here in Experiments 1 and 2 appears to be related to both age and reading
ability. It is not yet clear whether 'reading ability' relates to the amount of
reading instruction, the type of reading instruction, the child's ability to benefit
from reading instruction, pre-reading skills that children bring to school, each
child's ability for graphemic redescription of the speech input, or children's
general cognitive ability (Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995). These need to be investigated
in a design in which reading instruction and age are independently manipulated. Such
a study is currently being conducted in our laboratory.<component x="130.35"

with older children and adults, multiple trials are often given for each stimulus.
This was not possible here due to the attention span of the youngest children, the
four-year-olds. In the current study each child was required to complete two speech
perception tests, i.e., the native and non-native tests, and a battery of language
tests, so presentation of more than one exemplar for each test stimulus was not
possible. Despite this limitation, the method for converting responses to categorical
scores (see Burnham et al., 1991), adequately takes into account single presentations
of test stimuli. 2. These TOT sounds are the same as those used in Pisoni's
laboratory (Pisoni, 1977; Jusczyk et al., 1980), and we thank Professor Pisoni for
supplying them. ( ( or a non-parametric equivalent (e.g., A ) was not appropriate

over age in relative performance on the two contrasts: at the younger ages there is
superior performance X = on the negative contrast (Young Kindergarten &amp;
Kindergarten combined: positive X X = 0.21), in Grade 1 performance is equivalent
(Grade 1: = 0.17, 0.11, negative positive X = 0.18), while at the older ages
performance is better on the positive contrast negative X X = 0.56, = 0.46). This
latter result confirms (Grades 2, 3, 4, and adults: positive negative adults'
superiority for positive region contrasts found by Pisoni (1977), and extends it to
children as young as about 7 years. The opposite effect for the four- and
five-year-old Kindergarten children, i.e., superior performance on the negative
region contrast and the crossover in Grade 1, is intriguing and deserves further
study. 5. Note that the P-N TOT DIs are analogues of the N-NN DIs for the speech
contrasts, because the positive region TOT contrast is an analogue of voicing
contrasts which are phonologically relevant in English, while the negative region TOT
contrast is an analogue of voicing contrasts which are phonologically irrelevant in
English. 6. A possible reason for this may be that the non-native place contrast was
the easiest of the non-native contrasts to discriminate (see Figure 3c). Of the three
sets of speech contrasts the place contrasts had the lowest mean N-NN scores for the
combined child groups X X X = 0.72, = 0.77, = 0.53) and this was attributable to the
fact ( bilabials alveolars place X that while the native contrasts were equally
difficult in each of the three pairs ( = bilabials X X = 0.94, = 0.90), the
non-native contrast was considerably easier 0.90, alveolars place X X X = 0.18, =
0.17, = 0.37). It is thus for the place contrasts ( bilabials alveolars place quite
likely that the relationship between language specific speech perception and related
reading skills is only evident when difficult to perceive non-native speech contrasts
are used.<component x="134.79" y="332.67" width="330.39" height="387.29" page="32"

relationship between the onset of reading and language specific speech perception,
the degree to which native speech perception is superior to non-native speech
perception, was investigated. In Experiment 1 with children of 4, 6, and 8 years,
language specific speech perception occurred maximally at 6 years and was positively
related to reading ability for age and language comprehension level. In Experiment 2,
with an expanded range of ages and various stimulus and task changes, the
relationship between reading and language specific speech perception still held, and
maximal language specific speech perception occurred around the onset of reading
instruction for three different sets of speech contrasts, but not for a control set
of non-speech contrasts. The results show that language specific speech perception is
a linguistic rather than an acoustic phenomenon. Results are discussed in terms of
early speech perception abilities, experience with oral phonics versus whole word
reading instruction, and the effect of age communication, cognitive ability, reading
ability, alphabetic versus logographic languages, versusinstruction. Key words:

conducted on the relationship between reading ability and phonological processing
abilities in children. Wagner and Torgesen (Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1987; Wagner,
Torgesen, Laughton, Simmons &amp; Rashotte, 1993; Wagner, Torgesen &amp; Rashotte,
1994) identified three aspects of phonological processing. These are (a) phonological
awareness, consisting of phonological analysis (phoneme segmentation and
categorisation tasks) and phonological synthesis (phoneme blending); (b) retrieval of
phonological codes from long-term store, either in isolated or serial speeded naming
tasks; and (c) phonological recoding to maintain information in working memory (using
tasks such as digit span and sentence repetition recall). All three are relatively
stable over development (Wagner et al., 1993, 1994; Hansen &amp; Bowey, 1994), and
related to reading ability. There is evidence for (a) a causal relationship between
phonological awareness and reading ability (Calfee, Lindamood &amp; Lindamood, 1973;
Bradley &amp; Bryant, 1985; Goswami &amp; Bryant, 1990; Wagner et al., 1994), and for
a reciprocal causal relationship between phonological awareness and reading (Morais,
Cary, Alegria &amp; Bertelson, 1979; Read, Zhang, Nie &amp; Ding, 1986; Bradley &amp;
Bryant, 1978; Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1987, Wagner et al., 1994); (b) a positive
relationship between children's phonological recoding in lexical access and their
reading ability (Wolf, 1984; Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1987); and (c) a positive
relationship between children's phonological recoding to maintain information in
working memory and their reading ability (e.g., Mann &amp; Liberman, 1984; Hansen
&amp; Bowey, 1994). Are these three aspects of phonological processing different
abilities or imperfect measures of the same underlying ability? Wagner and Torgeson
(1987; Wagner et al., 1993) support a model in which one underlying ability accounts
for phonological analysis and working memory performance, and another for
phonological synthesis and performance on retrieval of phonological code tasks. The
first is the most important source of individual differences in kindergarten
children's phonological processing and is argued to have a phonological basis,
whereby the quality of children's phonological representations affects their memory
span performance (Wagner et al., 1993). This is thus a perceptual primacy hypothesis:
if phonological representations are misaligned or degraded (due to inaccurate or
imperfect speech perception mechanisms), then phonological awareness and memory span
performance will be impaired (Wagner et al., 1993) as will, in turn, reading ability.
To investigate this hypothesis it is important that the relationship between speech
perception, phonological processing, and reading be investigated, and this will be
done here. Research on phonological processing and reading has mostly been conducted
independently of speech perception research. In an exception to this McBride-Chang
(1996) tested whether speech perception affects reading ability directly, or
indirectly via its effect on phonological processing. Structural modeling with eight-
to ten-year-old children revealed the most parsimonious model was one in which speech
perception affects phonological awareness, which in turn affects word reading.
Similar results have been found with reading disabled adults (Watson &amp; Miller,
1993). Gibbs (1996) found similar but delayed effects at the onset of reading, with
speech perception ability at five and six years predicting phonological awareness at
six and seven years, respectively. Together these results support the contention that
basic speech perception abilities are indeed implicated in reading difficulties via
their effect on phonological analysis skills (Wagner et al., 1994). A basic speech
perception skill is categorical speech perception in which stimuli differing along
physical continua such as formant transitions or voice onset time are perceived to
belong to distinct categories (Eimas, Siqueland, Jusczyk &amp; Vigorito, 1971;
Burnham, Earnshaw &amp; Clark, 1991; Aslin, Pisoni, Hennessy &amp; Perey, 1981;
Burnham, 1986). A number of studies have shown that children with reading
difficulties produce less sharp category boundaries than their normal reading
counterparts (Brandt &amp; Rosen, 1980, but see Werker &amp; Tees, 1987; Godfrey,
Syrdal-Lasky, Millay &amp; Knox, 1981; Hurford &amp; Sanders, 1990; Manis,
McBride-Chang, Seidenberg, Keating, Doi, Munson &amp; Petersen, 1997; Joanisse,
Manis, Keating &amp; Seidenberg, 2000; Werker &amp; Tees, 1987). Werker and Tees
(1987) take such results to show that phonological categories are less robust in
reading disabled than normal reading children, and that group differences are
functionally significant and especially evident under stressful conditions (Werker
&amp; Tees, 1987; Brady, Shankweiler &amp; Mann, 1983). However, as to the basis of
this difference between disabled and normal reading, the underlying perceptual cause
is as yet uncertain. Again we can see that the relationship between speech perception
and reading begs further enquiry (Werker &amp; Tees, 1987). A possible perceptual
factor underlying reading and reading disability is the ability to process rapid
changes in acoustic stimuli. Children with specific language impairment have
difficulty discriminating speech sound pairs distinguished by rapid frequency changes
in formant transitions (consonants), but not pairs of steady-state (vowel) sounds
(Tallal &amp; Piercy, 1974; Reed, 1989), or in processing rapid visualstimuli (Reed,
1989). Tallal (1980; Tallal &amp; Piercy, 1973a, b, 1974) suggests that the
difficulty lies in discriminating the temporal sequence of rapidly-presented acoustic
(not necessarily linguistic) stimuli, i.e., that there is a primary perceptual
deficit. There are training studies to support this notion (Tallal, Miller, Bedi,
Byma, Wang, Nagarajan, Schreiner, Jenkins &amp; Merzenich, 1996; Merzenich, Jenkins,
Johnston, Schreiner, Miller &amp; Tallal, 1996), however, the specific benefit of
training on non-speech as opposed to speech stimuli on reading is yet to be
demonstrated, and there is opposing evidence that the difficulty is specifically with
phonological contrasts rather than more general acoustic features (Mody,
Studdert-Kennedy &amp; Brady, 1997). So, it is by no means clear that the perceptual
factor of which Tallal speaks is a primary acoustic factor as claimed, rather than a
specifically linguistic factor. Pointers to a perceptual basis for reading skills may
be gleaned from considering developmental processes in speech perception. Young
infants' astounding abilities to discriminate almost any phonologically-relevant or
irrelevant phonetic contrast are well-documented (e.g., Eimas et al., 1971; Streeter,
1976; Best, McRoberts &amp; Sithole, 1988, Burnham et al., 1991; see Burnham, 1986,
and Goodman &amp; Nusbaum, 1994 for reviews). This initial speech perception is then
modified through processes of attunement (Aslin, Pisoni, Hennessy &amp; Perey, 1981),
prototype abstraction for native language phones (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl, Williams,
Lacerda, Stevens &amp; Lindblom, 1992), and especially attenuation for non-native
phones (Burnham et al., 1991; Burnham, 1986; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker,
Gilbert, Humphrey &amp; Tees, 1981; Werker &amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker &amp;
Lalonde, 1988; Werker, 1994). These processes result in the perceptual reorganisation
of initial phonetic classes into language specific phonological categories around 6
to 9 months (Werker, 1994). Based on such evidence Werker and Tees (1987) suggest
that infants' initial phonetic sensitivities are the building blocks of phonological
categories, and that these categories are then sharpened by experience with oral
communication. In line with this, an alternative model to Tallal's (1980) primary
perceptual deficit is that there is a secondary perceptual deficit based on subtle
differences in the efficiency and accuracy with which children reorganise their
speech perception in accord with the specific phonology of their language
environment. Additionally we have obtained evidence that phonological categories may
written also be sharpened by experience with language. Burnham (1986; Burnham, et
al., 1991) investigated English language environment listeners' ability to perceive
two synthetic stop contrasts; one phonologically relevant, irrelevant and another
phonologically . Using the Infant Speech Identification method (Burnham, Earnshaw
&amp; Quinn, 1987) perceptual ability for each of 1 1 / years, 6 / years, and in the
two contrasts was tested at 10 months, 2 2 2 adults. Analysis of category boundary
sharpness showed perception of the h ] contrast, perceived as /b/ and /p/ by English
phonologically-relevant [p]-[p speakers, became more categorical with increasing age,
especially between two and six years. However, for the phonologically-irrelevant
contrast, [b]- [p], both perceived as /b/ by English speakers, boundary sharpness
improved between infancy and two years, reverted to chance level at six years, and
then improved slightly by adulthood. Burnham (1986; Burnham et al., 1991) speculated
that the intensification of language specific speech perception between two and six
years is related to the onset of reading instruction. Encouragement to process
language in terms of separate phonemes, and instruction in phoneme-tographeme mapping
would, it was reasoned, promote speech perception bias towards away from phoneme
classes of the ambient language and phonologicversus ally irrelevant phonetic
differences (e.g., [b] [p] for English language environment listeners). This language
specific speech perception, as it may be called, would facilitate the
phoneme-to-grapheme mapping process, one of the most difficult tasks in reading
acquisition. Based on this reasoning, we may hypothesise that around school age, the
degree of language specific speech perception will be positively related to
children's reading ability. The Burnham et al. (1991) results also show significant
improvement for the nonnative contrast by adulthood; presumably as a result of
reading becoming more automatic, fine-grained phonetic discriminations again are
possible. The two experiments reported here were conducted to investigate this
proposed relationship between language specific speech perception and reading. Both
experiments concern young children's perception of phonologically-relevant and
phonologically-irrelevant speech contrasts, and their performance on reading-related
tests. Four questions are investigated. 1. What is the developmental locus of the
intensification of language specific speech perception observed by Burnham et al.
(1991)? Does it occur specifically at six years and does it abate at some later
stage? 2. Is language specific speech perception related to reading acquisition? 3.
Is the language specific speech perception phenomenon robust - is h ] and attenuation
for the non-native improvement for the native [p]-[p [b]-[p] contrast also evident
for other native/non-native speech contrasts, and in other test situations? 4. Is
language specific speech perception a specifically linguistic phenomenon or can it be
explained by more general auditory processes?<component x="130.35" y="204.57"

are to define the developmental locus of the intensification of language specific
speech perception, and to investigate whether it is related to reading ability.
Burnham et al. (1991) found a trough in the perception of non-native speech sounds at
six years compared with two years and adulthood. As there were wide differences
between ages, the locus could not be specified. Here four-, six-, and eight-year-old
English language environment children were tested on each of the two contrasts used
in our h ] and the non-native [b]-[p] (Burnham et al., earlier study, the native
[p]-[p 1991). To investigate the relationship with reading ability, children were
also given an articulation, a language comprehension, and for the six- and
eightyear-olds, a reading test. It was expected that language specific speech
perception (given by the perceptual ability for native (N) minus the ability for
non-native (NN) speech contrasts) should occur maximally at six years of age, and
that children's degree of language specific speech perception should be positively
related to their reading ability.<component x="130.35" y="313.77" width="334.73"

perception test is described in detail in Burnham et al. (1991), and more briefly
here. Participants sat facing a large screen painted blue to the left and orange to
the right of their midline. The screen housed central attention-getting lights, a
central audio speaker through which sounds were presented, and two lateral
reinforcement windows each of which could be illuminated to reveal animated toy
rabbits. In front of the child were two paddles side-by-side, color-coded to match
the two sides of the screen. When one of the two training sounds was presented
centrally, pressing the paddle on the side pre-assigned for that sound resulted in
reinforcement delivery from the window on that side, and similarly for the other
sound and side. Incorrect paddle presses were not reinforced. Stimulus sounds were
synthesised bilabial stop consonants plus the vowel [a:]. For the native contrast
condition the training sounds were synthesised bilabial stop consonants of 0 msec
voice onset time (VOT), [pa:], and h a:] (/ba/ and /pa/ in English), and the

intervening sounds at 10 msec VOT intervals, i.e., bilabial stops with VOTs of 0, 10,
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 msec. For the non-native contrast condition the training
sounds were synthesised bilabial stops of 0 msec VOT, [pa:], and -70 msec VOT, [ba:]
(both /ba/ in English), and the generalisation test sounds were these plus the six
intervening sounds at 10 msec VOT intervals, i.e., bilabial stops with VOTs of 0,
-10, -20, -30, -40, -50, -60, and -70 msec. Sounds were played on an Otari MX5050
reel-to-reel tape recorder through an Acoustics Research BXi speaker. Each stimulus
syllable was 500 msec in duration, and in each trial 10 repetitions of each syllable
were presented with 250 msecs of silence between repetitions. Thus each trial was of
7.5 secs duration. Language tests The Queensland Articulation Test (Kilminister &amp;
Laird, 1978), the Bankson Language Screening Test (Bankson, 1977), and the Daniels
and Diack Reading Test Number 1 (Daniels &amp; Diack, 1974) were used. The Queensland
Articulation Test (QAT hereafter) is a 64-item Australian language test similar to
the Edinburgh Articulation Test, in which subjects are asked to name pictured
objects. The items are designed such that all English language consonants are tested
in initial, medial and final positions with ] medial and final appropriate
phonotactic constraints ([h] initial only, [ ], and [j] initial and medial only, and
[ ] medial only). only, [w], [ Productions are scored as correct or incorrect with a
possible total of 64. Children were tested on a subset of the 39 most discriminating
items of the Bankson Language Screening Test (Bankson hereafter), including items to
test syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic understanding (Bankson, 1977). Each item was
scored as correct or incorrect with a possible total of 39. Six- and eight-year-olds,
but not four-year-olds, were also given the Daniels and Diack Reading Test Number 1
(Reading hereafter), consisting of 36 items which become progressively more
difficult. Children are required to read the items aloud and continue until they make
errors on three consecutive items. Items 1 to 26 require a yes/no answer, the answer
being recorded simply to maintain the child's interest, and each item is awarded 3
points if no reading errors occur. The remaining items are questions with four
multiple-choice answers, with one point given if the question is read correctly and
one for each of the 4 alternatives read correctly. The maximum possible score is

native contrast perception test, the non-native contrast perception test, the QAT,
and the Bankson. The six- and eight-yearolds were also given the Reading test.
Subjects were usually tested first on one of the perception tests, then the language
tests, and then the other perception test. This order was sometimes modified if the
child found the perception test initially daunting. Despite such deviations order of
presentation of the native and non-native perception tests was counterbalanced
between subjects, as was order within the language tests. The procedure for the QAT,
the Bankson, and Reading followed the prescribed published procedures (Kilminister
&amp; Laird, 1978; Bankson, 1977; Daniels &amp; Diack, 1974). The procedure for the
speech perception tests was identical for the native and non-native contrasts, except
that the stimuli, and the random presentation orders of test stimuli differed.
Children sat in front of the screen, were told they would hear one of two sounds, and
instructed to press one paddle for one sound and the other for the other sound. For
example, the child was told on the left "When you hear the 'ba' sound press this blue
paddle here ( ) and on the right when you hear the 'pa' sound press this orange
paddle here ( )". Similar instructions were given for the non-native contrast with
the prevoicing in the -70 msec stimulus being pronounced "mba". The consequences of
pressing the correct paddle (reinforcement by animated bunny) were demonstrated.
Children were told to use only one hand to press the paddles, and instructed to keep
the agreed-upon hand on the table on an appropriatelysized red handprint until the
stimulus sound began, with the other hand kept under the table. One experimenter
stayed next to the child for the initial part of training. For the six- and
eight-year-olds the experimenter then retired but for the four-year-olds the
experimenter remained to monitor performance and maintain the child's interest. In
the initial period, reinforced training with randomly-presented end point sounds
continued until at least three unprompted correct paddle presses to each side
occurred. Then any three consecutive correct responses to the randomly-presented
endpoints was followed by an unreinforced generalisation test trial in which one of
the eight possible test sounds was presented. After each test trial children returned
to reinforced training until a further three consecutive correct responses occurred.
Reinforcement was given for correct training trials but no reinforcement was given in
test trials. Testing 1 continued until all eight test trials had been presented once.
The time taken to complete the tests varied with age. The four-year-olds required two
testing sessions totalling around 1.5 hours. This included short breaks if required
by the child. The six- and eight-year-olds completed the tests in a single session of
between 50 and 75 minutes.<component x="130.35" y="204.57" width="334.82"

al., 1991). To derive these categorical scores, each individual's pattern of
responses for the 8 test trials are compared with 7 ideal categorical curves
constructed with sharp crossovers between the two versus response types ("ba" "pa"
for the native, and "ba" versus"mba" for the non-native speech perception tests).
These 7 curves use the narrowest possible VOT width here (10 msec), with category
crossover centered on 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, or 65 msec VOT (positive for the native,
and negative for the non-native contrast). Once the best fit is found, then the
closeness of fit is determined by a method similar to testing planned contrasts in an
analysis of variance. The resultant degree of fit, between -1 and +1, measures the
sharpness of the individual's pattern of responses, and provides individual
categorical scores for each participant to be used in group analyses. Mean

found that at 6 2 years of age there was a significant reduction of scores for a
non-native speech contrast, despite continued improvement for a similar native
contrast, and that this difference decreased by adulthood. In that experiment native
and non-native contrasts was a between subject factor, and here it was deliberately
made within subjects, to allow correlations and regression analyses. Each subject's
nonnative contrast categorical score was subtracted from their native categorical
score, (N-NN), as a measure of language specific speech perception. Initial
exploratory correlations of the native, non-native, and (N-NN) scores with age and
QAT, Bankson, and Reading scores revealed an interesting complex of results. Age was
positively correlated with both native and non-native r negatively scores ( = 0.20,
0.21, respectively) but correlated with (N-NN) r scores ( = -0.15). On the other hand
all the language tests were positively correlated with native, negatively correlated
with non-native, and positively r correlated with (N-NN) scores ( = 0.08, -0.01, and
0.03 respectively for QAT; 0.11, -0.17, and 0.18 for Bankson; and 0.29, -0.10, and
0.16 for pattern Reading). While the magnitude of some of these is negligible, the of
results suggests that N-NN scores may be tapping something different than either
native or non-native scores alone. This is not inconsistent with our notion that N-NN
should measure language specific speech perception, independently of native and
non-native scores. Accordingly, the scores for the three language tests and subjects'
exact ages were regressed onto the NNN language specific speech perception scores.
Two separate analyses were conducted, one with all subjects in which the reading
scores were omitted, and one for just the six- and eight-year-olds in which reading
scores were included. 2 F The regression with all subjects was significant R = 0.29,

rounding the resultant coefficient to +1, 0 or -1 is a way to simplify the regression
equation to facilitate meaningful verbal descriptions (DeSarbo, Hausman, Shen &amp;
Thompson, 1982; Harris, 1985). Using this method the resultant equation is (N-NN) =
QAT - Age. This, along with the significance tests shows that language specific
speech perception is highest in those participants with relatively good articulation
ability for their age. The regression which included Reading scores conducted with

be interpreted to show that language specific speech perception is highest in those

lateness="0.4" reference_score="8.47">Burnham et al. (1991) showed that there is a
period of increased language specific speech perception some time between 2 years and
adulthood. The speech perception results here suggest that this occurs specifically
around 6 years. In addition, the results are consistent with the notion that language
specific speech perception subsides around 8 years; while categorical perception
scores for the native contrast continued to increase from 4 to 6 to 8 years, there
was a U-shaped trend for the non-native contrast suggesting that categorical speech
perception of the non-native contrast was worse at 6 than 4 or 8 years. However, this
should be interpreted cautiously, as while a similar quadratic trend component was
significant in Burnham et al. (1991), it was not here. This effect here may have been
ameliorated for two possible reasons. Firstly, the categorical scores here were
generally high (see Figure 2) relative to those in Burnham et al. (1991; see Figure 2
there), possibly because in the earlier study children were simply told they would
hear two sounds and left to deduce the sound/button-press contingencies themselves,
whereas here more specific phonologically-relevant labels for the speech sounds were
given to reduce test duration, and allow the other language tests to be completed.
These generally higher scores here may have reduced any potential quadratic trend. A
second possibility is that the ages 4, 6, and 8 years represent the trough of a
broader dip in non-native speech perception performance, and that if younger and
older ages are included this trend may become more evident. To investigate this,
finer gradations and a wider range of ages are used in Experiment 2, and power is
increased by more than doubling subject numbers in each age group. So the first aim
of this study has been only partly realised - it appears that the locus of the
intensification of post-infancy language specific speech perception occurs around 6
years, i.e., around the onset of reading, but further evidence is required. The
regression analysis with the four-, six-, and eight-year-olds showed that language
specific speech perception is positively related to children's level of articulation
ability for age. This makes good intuitive sense: if particular children are
articulating well for their age then it should follow that they have greater
perceptual bias towards the speech sounds present in their own language. The
direction of causality between speech perception and speech production, or whether
causality is uni- or bi-directional (Werker, 1993) cannot be determined here, but it
is notable that very few instances of a relationship between children's speech
perception and speech production skills have been reported previously (Zlatin &amp;
Koenigsknecht, 1976; Strange &amp; Broen, 1981). The reason that we found a
perception-production relationship here may be that we used language specific
perceptual bias (N-NN) scores based on two different speech contrasts, rather than
perceptual ability on a single task. Further study of the relationship between
language specificity in speech perception and speech production is warranted. The
regression analysis with just the six- and eight-year-old children, and with reading
added, showed that children who are good readers for their age and level of language
comprehension are those who manifest greater language specific speech perception.
(Articulation ability was no longer a significant predictor, suggesting that after
the onset of reading instruction, reading is a more powerful predictor of language
specific speech perception than is articulation.) Again the regression solution makes
sense intuitively. Children who have high language specific speech perception should
have a good grasp of the phoneme-to-grapheme conversion rules involved in reading,
and should be able to apply these rules to unfamiliar words. In addition, such
children should have a good grasp of which phonetic variations signal phonological
differences in their language and which are simply allophones of a native language
phoneme class. Again the direction of causality cannot be determined here, though
either causal direction would appear intuitively feasible.<component x="130.35"

language specific speech developmental locus perception found in Experiment 1. To
investigate the of the intensification of language specific speech perception in a
more fine-grained manner, a wider range of ages was included. Children at the
beginning of their first year of school (called 'Kindergarten' year in Sydney
schools), children at the end of their Kindergarten year, and children in subsequent
years, Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4, as well as a control group of adults were tested. Power

from the results of Experiment 1 whether language specific speech perception involves
a bias towards native as opposed to non-native speech sounds, or a familiar
unfamiliar bias towards (native) sounds and away from all sounds, be they non-native
speech or even non-speech. To evaluate this, non-speech analogues of voicing
contrasts, tone onset time (TOT) stimuli, were included. If performance on non-native
contrasts were to be attenuated for six-year-olds below the level of these non-speech
TOT sounds then the bias could be said to be specifically phonological.
generalisability To investigate the of the results of Experiment 1, three changes
were made. Firstly, naturally-produced as opposed to synthetic syllables were used.
Secondly, perception of two additional speech contrasts was tested. And thirdly, a
different method, discrimination rather than identification was used. If such changes
do not affect the basic relationship between speech perception and reading ability
found in Experiment 1, then we can conclude that this relationship is
robust.<component x="130.35" y="271.77" width="334.76" height="359.67" page="14"

perception, phoneme segmentation, and reading tests. Speech perception tests An AX
discrimination paradigm, in which pairs of sounds were presented for same/different
judgements, was used. To ensure that children understood the meanings of "same" and
"different" visual training materials, a card with two identical side-by-side red
squares ("same") and a card with a red square and a blue square side-by-side
("different"), and cards of nonsense animals which differed in the number of legs,
type of neck and patterning on the body were used. Some animal cards showed two
identical animals ("same"), others showed very different pairs ("different"), and yet
others showed slightly different pairs ("just a little bit different but still
different"). There were five blocks of trials, and in all five the interstimulus
interval (ISI) between the offset of sound 1 and the onset of sound 2 was 500-msec.
Participants were required to report whether the two sounds were the "same" or
"different". Stimulus sounds were recorded from a master tape on an Otari MX5050
reel-to-reel tape recorder with Ampex 631 tape onto TDK SA (Type II) cassette tapes.
A Marantz portable cassette recorder was used to present the sounds. There were three
blocks of speech sound stimuli, one block of nonspeech stimuli, and an auditory
post-test block, always presented last. The three speech sound blocks consisted of
natural speech tokens of consonants paired with the [a:] vowel. Each of these three
speech sound blocks contained two speech contrasts: one which was
phonologically-relevant for English language environment listeners (produced by a
male native English speaker) and one which was phonologically irrelevant for English
language listeners (produced by a male native Hindi speaker). The productions of the
English and Hindi speaker were selected and edited to ensure that intonation contour,
pitch, and duration of the tokens were perceptually equivalent via initial screening
by a panel of experienced judges, and further acoustic screening with a speech
editor. Two different tokens of each phone were used to ensure acoustic variability,
while maintaining phonetic identity. Sounds used in the five blocks are described

English language listeners as /d/. Block D - non-speech (TOT) analogues of voicing
contrasts. This block consisted of tone onset time (TOT) stimuli, considered to be
non-speech analogues of VOT contrasts because they are composed of a high frequency
(1500 Hz) component modelled on the high frequency broad-band burst in stop
consonants and a low frequency (500 Hz) component modelled on the low frequency voice
bar in stop consonants (Pisoni, 1977); and because they tend to be perceived
categorically by adults (Pisoni, 1977) and infants 2 Positive TOT Contrast, 0 msec vs
(Jusczyk, Pisoni, Walley &amp; Murray, 1980). +70 msec TOT: These sounds are used as
analogues of voiceless unaspirated 0 msec and voiceless aspirated +70 msec VOT stop
consonant contrasts (see native voicing contrasts, Block A and B above). For the 0
msec stimulus, onset of the two sinusoidal tones, one of 500 Hz, and another 1500 Hz,
was simultaneous and each lasted for 245 msec. For the +70 msec stimulus, the
duration of the 500 Hz tone was 245 msec, and its onset preceded the 175 msec 1500 Hz
tone by 70 msec. In both stimulus sounds the offset of the two tones was
simultaneous, with the total duration of each stimulus Negative TOT Contrast, 0 msec
vs -70 msec TOT: being 245 msec. These sounds are used as analogues of 0 msec
voiceless unaspirated and -70 msec voiced unaspirated VOT stops (see non-native
voicing contrasts in Blocks A, B above). The 0 msec stimulus was described above. For
the -70 msec stimulus, the duration of the low frequency 500 Hz tone was 315 msec and
its onset preceded that of the 245 msec 1500 Hz tone by 70 msec, so the total
duration of this sound was 315 msec. Block structure. In blocks A, B, C and D, 16 AX
pairs were presented. For each pair the ISI was 500 msec, employed to ensure that
subjects processed sounds at a phonetic level (Werker &amp; Logan, 1985; Werker &amp;
Tees, 1984b). Of the 16 pairs in each block, 8 were of the appropriate native
contrast and 8 were of the appropriate non-native contrast (positive and negative TOT
contrasts respectively for Block D). Within contrasts half (4) were pairs of the same
phone (or TOTs) and half (4) were pairs of different phones (or TOTs). For the same
pairs half (2) were the same phones (or TOTs) for one member of the contrast (AA
pairs) and half (2) were the same phones (or TOTs) for the other member of the
contrast (BB pairs). For "same" pairs in Blocks A, different B, and C tokens of the
same phone were used to ensure acoustic but not phonetic variability. For the
different pairs half (2) were presented in each order (AB or BA) and within each
order the tokens of each phone type varied across trials. Auditory post-test. To
ensure that children were applying the same/different labels correctly and that their
hearing was adequate, a series of eight AX pairs of harmonic tones was presented at
the end of the four test blocks. There was a high harmonic tone (based on 1500 Hz),
and a low harmonic tone (based on 500 Hz). Four of the AX trials were same stimuli
(two low-low and two high-high pairs) and 4 were different (high-low pairs with
counterbalanced order). Phoneme segmentation test The phoneme segmentation test
consisted of 24 items in which the targeted phoneme occurred either initially or
finally, and as a singleton or in a cluster, such that there were 6 items in each
initial/final singleton/cluster subgroup. &#xD7; Two versions of the test were given:
a receptive deletion task and a productive identification task. In the former,
children were told for example, "Say 'ice' without the /s/ sound". In the latter they
were asked, "What sound is in 'ice' but not in 'eye'?". Six practice items were
given. Reading test The Daniels and Diack Reading Test 1 was administered to all the
children (see 'Apparatus and materials' in Experiment 1).<component x="130.35"

individually in a quiet room at their school. Children sat on a small chair at a
table facing the experimenter. Each child was the given speech perception, phoneme
segmentation, and reading tests with order of presentation counterbalanced between
subjects. Children mostly completed all tests in one sitting ranging between 40 and
50 minutes. Breaks were given when the child required them and one experimenter gave
the speech tests and another the reading and phoneme segmentation tests to provide
some variety. The adults were only given the speech perception tests. Speech
perception test Training with the visual same/different training materials always
occurred first. Children were shown one card with two red squares and one with a blue
and red square and asked to identify which was "same" and "different". These were
then put face up on the table, one on each side of the child. Children were then
asked to place pairs of nonsense animals in the "same" or the "different" pile. When
the child categorized the animals correctly they then proceeded to the four auditory
blocks with order of block presentation counterbalanced between subjects. At the end
of each block two more nonsense animal pairs (one same, one different) were presented
to ensure continued understanding. Following the fourth block, the auditory post-test
was given. Subjects were excluded from later analysis if they did not score at least
6 correct on the 8 items in the auditory post-test. Adults were tested in a similar
fashion except that the same/different training materials were not used. Phoneme
segmentation test Children were first presented with the six practice items, and did
not proceed to the test items until they had responded correctly to at least 5 of
these, and/or until the experimenter considered that the child understood the task.
Half of the children in each age group were given the receptive deletion form and
half were given the productive identification form of the task. Reading test Children
were asked to read the items aloud and testing continued until errors occurred on
three consecutive items (see 'Apparatus and materials', Experiment 1). Intelligence
For the purpose of accounting for variability in regression analyses, each child was
given an estimate of general intelligence by their teacher. This was a simple
coarse-grained measure of "Above Average", "Average" or "Below Average", and these
were converted to scores of 3, 2 and 1 respectively. More detailed intelligence tests
could not be given due to the policy of the schools that participated in the study.
Scoring For the speech perception test discriminative index (DI) scores were
calculated, given by DI = (Correct 'Different' responses on Different Trials "Hits" -
Incorrect 'Different' responses on Same Trials "False Positives")/(Number of
Different (AB + BA) trials), with a denominator of 4 for all contrasts. Eight such DI
scores were calculated for each subject: a native and the non-native score for Blocks
A, B, and C, and an index each for the positive TOT contrast and the negative TOT
contrast in Block D. The maximum DI score is 1 and 3 chance level is 0. Items in the
phoneme segmentation test were scored as correct or incorrect with a possible maximum
of 24. For the reading test the scoring protocol given by Daniels and Diack (1974),
with a maximum possible score of 128 was used. Both phoneme segmentation and reading
scores were converted to percentages.<component x="130.35" y="347.01" width="334.68"

These significant interactions in conjunction with inspection of Figure 3a indicate
that the age trend for the non-native contrast was more linear and quadratic than for
the native contrast, with a trough centred on the Grade 1 children. These results are
similar to the age trends with the synthetic versions of these contrasts in

different peaks for the bilabial and alveolar contrast sets (see Figure 4). This
relatively common peak in (N-NN) scores presumably reflects children's focus on
native language sounds as a function of age or schooling, although it is possible
that this peak may be a product of some acoustic quirk of the particular native and
non-native sounds we used. If this were indeed the case, then speech analogue sounds
with similar acoustic characteristics should show a similar "language specific" peak.

intelligence, sex, age, phoneme segmentation, and reading. As significant

Applying the same interpretive device as in Experiment 1 (DeSarbo et al., 1982;
Harris, 1985), the results for each contrast can be described as follows. For the
bilabials, (N-NN) = Reading - Age, which is the same solution as was found for
synthetic versions of these same contrasts in the identification task in Experiment
1, except that language comprehension (not measured here) appeared in the equation
there. A similar verbal description is applicable, children who have a high degree of
language specific speech perception tend to be good readers for their age. For the
alveolars, (N-NN) = Phoneme Segmentation - Reading - Age, so for these contrasts
children with a high degree of language specific speech perception are those who are
relatively good segmenters for their age and level of reading ability. This is a
similar but not identical result as that for bilabials and suggests that under some

non-speech contrasts the regression for sex and intelligence was not significant, and
additionally age and the language not variables did add significantly to the
prediction. Thus applying the same analysis rationale as for the speech contrasts led
to no significant relationship between any of the predictor variables and the
dependent variable here, TOT (P-N). The only individual variable which even
approached significance was P intelligence ( = 0.053), and the positive beta weight
(see Table 3) shows that (P-N) scores were positively related to intelligence
(whereas for all the speech contrasts beta weights for intelligence were negligible).
Thus it can be concluded (P-N) scores for the TOT contrasts are unaffected by
linguistic variables (phonological segmentation and reading). This is in direct
contrast to the speech perception results, which show a relationship between (N-NN)
and linguistic variables, and/or a negative relationship with age. Non-native speech
vs non-speech. Given the better discrimination of native over non-native contrasts,
it is of interest to determine the relationship between perception of non-native
speech and non-speech. Mean discrimination indices for the three native contrasts,
the three non-native contrasts, and the two non-speech contrasts are plotted against
age in Figure 5. Overall discrimination of native contrasts was better than for
non-native and nonF speech contrasts combined, (1,189) = 1548.51, MSE = 0.08, and

instruction proper begins in Grade 1. Here we found a sharp increase in reading and
phoneme segmentation scores from the beginning to the end of Kindergarten year (see
Table 2). For each of the three sets of speech contrasts language specific speech
perception intensifies at the end of the Kindergarten year, subsequently to be
attenuated at the end of the first (Kindergarten) or second (Grade 1) year of school.

of Experiment 1 and especially Experiment 2 (see Figure 5) suggest that language
specific speech perception is comprised of three components, as follows. facilitation
There is of the perception of native speech sounds due to linguistic experience.
There is attenuationof the perception of all other additional attenusounds, both
non-native speech and non-speech. There is ation below the normal level of of the
perception of non-native speech sounds perceptual acuity . These first two processes
are evident throughout development, at least after the onset of phonemic speech
perception in infancy (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl et al., 1992; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker
et al., 1981; Werker &amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker,
1994), and are certainly evident over the ages studied here. The third process is
generally evident over the ages studied here; though around the onset of reading
perception of both non-native speech sounds and non-speech sounds are equally and
maximally suppressed. This may be described as a floor effect, but it may be more
heuristic to characterise this as an efficient strategy whereby incoming sounds are
best assigned to orthographically defined categories if perceptual attention to all
sounds which are not native speech is equally attenuated. (Discrimination of
non-native speech and non-speech is also equal for adults, and this could be due to
adults being better able to adopt strategies to perform a particular laboratory
task.) Clearly these explanations are ad hoc, but they highlight the need for further
investigation of the dynamic interaction of speech perception processes such as
facilitation and attenuation right across development, in infants, children, and
adults (Aslin, 1981; Gottlieb, 1976).<component x="130.35" y="204.57" width="334.68"

specific speech perception with the onset of reading? Heightened language specific
speech perception in the early years of schooling has now been found in three
separate experiments (Burnham et al., 1991; Experiments 1 and 2 here), and to be
significantly related to reading acquisition in Experiments 1 and 2 here. This is
consistent with the notion that reading instruction in an alphabetic language directs
perceptual attention to matching graphemes to phonemes, which in turn requires
efficient phoneme segmentation, and efficient assignment of allophonic variants to
strictly defined phoneme categories. The continued ability to perceive the phonetic
characteristics which distinguish native speech phonemes and selectively suppress
just those phonetic characteristics which distinguish nonnative speech phones from
each other (Werker, 1994; Burnham, 1986), and from similar native phones (Best,
1994), that is, language specific speech perception, would be very useful at this
time. What we have found here is that there is heightened language specific speech
perception after children begin school, and this is related to the onset of reading.
Results here suggest that around reading onset children may adopt a strategy in which
perception ofall contrasts that are not phonologically relevant is suppressed, while
both before and after this time perceptual performance for non-native speech is
additionally suppressed. To the extent that the evidence presented here suggests that
the additional suppression for non-native speech contrasts is based on their phonetic
characteristics rather than any acoustic characteristics they share with non-speech
auditory level sounds, there is a prima facie argument against the involvement of a
lowdeficit as a precursor to reading difficulties (Tallal, 1980). Moreover, it is
clear that language specific speech perception is in place in early infancy, and thus
is a likely candidate to play a role in the acquisition of later linguistic abilities
(Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl et al., 1992; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker et al., 1981; Werker
&amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker, 1994). Indeed, the results of Experiment 1 here
suggest that around 4 years language specific speech perception is related to
articulation ability. Nevertheless, there is not yet sufficient evidence to make
definitive judgements on this issue; it remains possible that underlying individual
differences in speech production, speech perception, general cognitive ability
(Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995), and even auditory perception (Tallal, 1980) could
contribute to more sharply defined phonological categories in some pre-school
children than in others. Longitudinal studies from preschool through to post-reading
age are clearly required.<component x="130.35" y="204.57" width="334.71"

lateness="0.8571428571428571" reference_score="13.26">The heightened language
specific speech perception uncovered here around reading onset is additional to, and
in no way diminishes the importance of the well-documented perceptual reorganisation
between 6 and 12 months (Polka &amp; Werker, 1994; Kuhl et al., 1992; Werker &amp;
Lalonde, 1988; Werker &amp; Tees, 1992; Werker, 1994; Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995).
One main difference between earlier "phonemic" and the later "orthographic" periods
(Burnham, Tyler &amp; Horlyck, 2002) is that while in infancy perceptual
reorganisation occurs due to the natural ontogenetic processes of perceiving and
producing speech, in the later period, heightened language specific speech perception
results from the imposition of the "unnatural" requirement to read an alphabetic
language. It is the similarities between these two periods that are of most interest.
In both periods language specific speech perception does not involve any loss of
speech perception ability. Werker and colleagues showed that if the ISI in an AX
discrimination task is shortened to allow phonetic or acoustic processing (Werker
&amp; Tees, 1984b; Werker &amp; Logan, 1985), or if extensive exposure is given
(Werker &amp; Logan, 1985), adults candiscriminate non-native speech contrasts which
under normal circumstances they appear unable to discriminate. Thus, there is no
sensori-neural loss of speech perception; exposure to a particular language results
in perceptual selectivity rather than perceptual loss. In a similar vein, the
orthographic language specific speech perception uncovered here is transitory,
occurring specifically around the onset of formal language instruction, and
relinquishing hold around Grade 2 to Grade 3, possibly due to reading becoming more
proficient. Another important similarity between these two periods relates to the
work of Lalonde and Werker (1995), who suggest that there is an initial perceptual
analysis underlying all speech perception, which is untouched by specific linguistic
experience or general cognitive ability. The output of such perceptual analysis then
is redescribed at increasingly complex and abstract levels throughout development
(Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995; Karmiloff-Smith, 1991). So, according to Lalonde and
Werker, the same phonetic detail is available to infants before and after the six- to
nine-month reorganisation period, but during this period there is a redescription of
the output from phonetic analysers in order to reflect native speech categories. "The
redescription results in a second representation superimposed on the first, leaving
the original detail of language-general discrimination intact . . ." (Lalonde &amp;
Werker, 1995: 472). In this way Lalonde and Werker's model allows the infant's
ability for redescription to be related to general cognitive abilities, even if
underlying phonetic or acoustic abilities are more or less equivalent. This model may
be expanded if more were known about how the processes of speech perception interact
with other linguistic processes occurring at the time of redescription. For example,
does perceptual assimilation (Best, 1994) operate equivalently at all periods of
development, and do particular phonetic characteristics of speech sounds (Burnham,
1986; Stevens &amp; Keyser, 1989) differentially affect perceptual performance in
different developmental contexts? The orthographic period uncovered here could be
seen to be a further redescription, which is superimposed on the earlier
redescription (see Burnham et al., 2002, for elaboration). And like the earlier
redescription, there appear to be later vestiges of this. For instance, in auditory
phoneme deletion and addition tasks, Tyler and Burnham (2000) found adults had longer
reaction times for orthographic interference items, such as WORTH-EARTH - "add /w/ to
/ &#x3B8;/" or "delete /w/ from /w /", than for non-interfering items, such &#x3B8;
as FACT-ACT - "add /f/ to /&#xE6;kt/" or "delete /f/ from /f&#xE6;kt/" (see also Taft
&amp; Hambly, 1985).<component x="130.35" y="204.57" width="334.67" height="333.75"

implications of these results for reading instruction. Three of these are set out
below. Is reading instruction in an alphabetic language a necessary condition for the
intensification of language specific speech perception? In order to test this,
six-year-old children who were not being taught to read (either due to a later onset
or absence of schooling; Morais et al., 1979), and sixyear-olds being taught to read
a non-alphabetic script (Read et al., 1986) should be compared on native and
non-native speech perception. Additionally, given the supposed role of
phoneme-to-grapheme correspondences in language specific speech perception, it would
be of interest to investigate the degree of language specific speech perception when
children learn a language with a transparent orthography such as Spanish or Turkish,
in which phoneme-to-grapheme conversion rules are both feedforward and feedback
consistent, versus an opaque language such as English or Irish, with irregular
grapheme-to-phoneme mappings. Does phonics reading instruction result in greater
language specific speech perception than whole word reading instruction? Our
arguments above support the use of phonic rather than whole word methods of early
reading instruction, because the phonics method should facilitate acquisition of the
arbitrary language-specific phoneme-to-grapheme conversion rule conventions. If, as
we would predict, children taught with phonics-based methods (see Liberman &amp;
Liberman, 1992; Byrne &amp; Fielding-Barnsley, 1993; Schwartz, 1988) show greater
language specific speech perception independent of reading ability (Andrews, 1992a,
b) than children taught with a whole word method (Goodman &amp; Goodman, 1979;
Goodman, 1986), then this would suggest that heightened language specific speech
perception is consequence not only a of learning to read, but also anindexof reading
instruction efficacy. Is heightened language specific speech perception the result of
reading instruction or maturation? The heightened language specific speech perception
found here in Experiments 1 and 2 appears to be related to both age and reading
ability. It is not yet clear whether 'reading ability' relates to the amount of
reading instruction, the type of reading instruction, the child's ability to benefit
from reading instruction, pre-reading skills that children bring to school, each
child's ability for graphemic redescription of the speech input, or children's
general cognitive ability (Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995). These need to be investigated
in a design in which reading instruction and age are independently manipulated. Such
a study is currently being conducted in our laboratory.<component x="130.35"

with older children and adults, multiple trials are often given for each stimulus.
This was not possible here due to the attention span of the youngest children, the
four-year-olds. In the current study each child was required to complete two speech
perception tests, i.e., the native and non-native tests, and a battery of language
tests, so presentation of more than one exemplar for each test stimulus was not
possible. Despite this limitation, the method for converting responses to categorical
scores (see Burnham et al., 1991), adequately takes into account single presentations
of test stimuli. 2. These TOT sounds are the same as those used in Pisoni's
laboratory (Pisoni, 1977; Jusczyk et al., 1980), and we thank Professor Pisoni for
supplying them. ( ( or a non-parametric equivalent (e.g., A ) was not appropriate

over age in relative performance on the two contrasts: at the younger ages there is
superior performance X = on the negative contrast (Young Kindergarten &amp;
Kindergarten combined: positive X X = 0.21), in Grade 1 performance is equivalent
(Grade 1: = 0.17, 0.11, negative positive X = 0.18), while at the older ages
performance is better on the positive contrast negative X X = 0.56, = 0.46). This
latter result confirms (Grades 2, 3, 4, and adults: positive negative adults'
superiority for positive region contrasts found by Pisoni (1977), and extends it to
children as young as about 7 years. The opposite effect for the four- and
five-year-old Kindergarten children, i.e., superior performance on the negative
region contrast and the crossover in Grade 1, is intriguing and deserves further
study. 5. Note that the P-N TOT DIs are analogues of the N-NN DIs for the speech
contrasts, because the positive region TOT contrast is an analogue of voicing
contrasts which are phonologically relevant in English, while the negative region TOT
contrast is an analogue of voicing contrasts which are phonologically irrelevant in
English. 6. A possible reason for this may be that the non-native place contrast was
the easiest of the non-native contrasts to discriminate (see Figure 3c). Of the three
sets of speech contrasts the place contrasts had the lowest mean N-NN scores for the
combined child groups X X X = 0.72, = 0.77, = 0.53) and this was attributable to the
fact ( bilabials alveolars place X that while the native contrasts were equally
difficult in each of the three pairs ( = bilabials X X = 0.94, = 0.90), the
non-native contrast was considerably easier 0.90, alveolars place X X X = 0.18, =
0.17, = 0.37). It is thus for the place contrasts ( bilabials alveolars place quite
likely that the relationship between language specific speech perception and related
reading skills is only evident when difficult to perceive non-native speech contrasts
