influences speech intelligibility. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has proved
suitable for quantifying speech intelligibility in patients with different degrees of
nasal emissions. We investigated the influence of hyponasality on the results of
speech recognition before and after nasal surgery using ASR. Speech recordings, nasal
peak inspiratory flow and self-perception measurements were carried out in 20
German-speaking patients (8 women, 12 men; aged 38 - 22 years) who underwent surgery
for various nasal and sinus pathologies. The degree of speech intelligibility was
quantified as the percentage of correctly recognized words of a standardized word
chain by ASR (word recognition rate; WR). WR was measured 1 day before (t1), 1 day
after with nasal packings (t2), and 3 months after (t3) surgery; nasal peak flow on
t1 and t3. WR was calculated with program for the automatic evaluation of all kinds
of speech disorders (PEAKS). WR decreased immediately after surgery (t1 vs. t2 but
increased 3 months after surgery (t2 vs. t3 as a parameter of speech intelligibility
was significantly p p \ \ 0.01) 0.01).<component x="51.02" y="261.75" width="238.1"

that ASR is capable of quantifying the influence of hyponasality on speech; nasal
obstruction leads to significantly reduced WR and nasal peak flow cannot replace

of human communication, demonstrating the ability to present thoughts with
articulation and voice [1]. Voice is itself determined by two factors, the voice
source and the vocal tract. Anatomically, the larynx serves as tone generator [2].
This primary signal is further modulated by characteristics of the cross-sectional
area of the vocal tract, involving the supraglottic space, including the pharynx,
nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses [2]. Even minor alterations in these structures
may lead to changes in voice and thereby influence speech intelligibility. Research
in this field has focused on various factors that influence speech intelligibility.
Studies have been undertaken to assess speech quality in patients with cleft palate,
motor speech disorders, and hearing impairment [3-5]. However, the relationship
between speech intelligibility, nose and sinus pathologies, as well as the effects of
surgical treatments, has not been adequately explored [6]. In contrast, several
studies have investigated sinus symptoms such as nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, loss
of smell etc., in attempts to identify the most suitable techniques for surgery to
nose and paranasal sinuses [7-11]. Research on the function of the sinuses themselves
has been carried out for many years [12-14]. In addition to the important functions
of air-conditioning, olfaction, and filtering, pneumatisation may serve to decrease
the weight of the head, and sinuses are assumed an important acoustic resonator
modulating voice [6, 15]. The secretory mucosal function, with active convection of
water into the sinuses, leads to saturation of the inspiratory air with water [16].
One of the main functions of surgery on pathologies of nose and paranasal sinuses is
to increase aeration, in order to reduce inflammation in these cavities [17]. Changes
in nasality are thought to influence speech intelligibility [6]. Nasal obstruction,
especially of the nasal cavity, is one of the main factors in decreasing nasality
[5]. Often the presence of hyponasality is of minor interest in clinical evaluations,
even though it is of major interest for patients-especially with high demands on
their speech. However, speech evaluation prior to endonasal surgery is neither
routinely performed nor standardized. Perceptual evaluation by several listeners is
presently accepted as an ''objective'' assessment of nasality. Here, nasal vowels
such as /m/, /n/, and /ng/ are altered or replaced by pre-nasal plosives. It appears
as decreased nasal resonance with a dull, obstructed-sounding voice. If consonants,
especially voiced plosives, are substituted with correspondent nasalized consonants,
hypernasality is present. Air leaks through the nose, the intraoral pressure of air
is reduced, and the acuity of oral consonants is decreased [18] by changing resonance
functions and altered formant structure of the phoneme [19]. MRI studies of the
spectral characteristics of human nasal sounds showed that the paranasal sinuses have
an important role in shaping these functions [20]. Further investigation of the
effects of sinus surgery supported this assumption [6, 21]. Recently, an automatic
speech recognition (ASR) system was used for the objective assessment of speech
intelligibility and showed very good concordance with perceptual evaluation [3, 4,
22]. ASR is usually used for automatic communication systems in order to recognize
speech, e.g., for telephone or dictating systems. It relies on the analysis of
acoustic properties of speech and often includes phonetic and linguistic knowledge
using stochastic methods [23, 24]. ASR is now increasingly being used to quantify
speech alterations for medical purposes [25]. For the ASR system presented here, the
percentage of correctly recognized words of a known sequence (word recognition rate;
WR) corresponds to speech intelligibility. Thus, the method can be used to evaluate
global speech quality. In previous investigations, it has shown a diminished degree
of intelligibility in children with increased nasality due to cleft palate [26]. It
is important to learn more about the effects of nose and sinus surgery on speech
intelligibility and also to investigate short-, as well as long-term changes after
surgery. Here we present the first data on the use of an ASR system to measure the
speech intelligibility of patients with pathology of nose and paranasal
sinuses.<component x="306.14" y="74.9" width="238.13" height="245.6" page="1"

information was excluded from further calculations. Female patients had a slightly
higher WR at t1 (mean 71.2 - 5.5%) than males (mean 67.2 - 9.9%), with a smaller
range of results (Table 1; Fig. 1). Age showed no influence on WR (Table 2). The mean
WR at the second speech recording session on the first post-operative day (t2), still

51.6 - 11.1% (Table 1; Fig. 1). Results in female patients tended to show greater
scatter than in males. Three months postoperatively (t3), mean WR had increased to 68

paranasal sinuses. Measurements during total nasal obstruction with bilateral nasal
packing were performed to demonstrate the influence of changes in nasality on ASR.
The study group consisted of consecutively admitted patients for nasal/sinus surgery.
A broad spectrum of diseases was included in order to measure a wide range of speech
characteristics as shown in Fig. 2 and Tables 1 and 2. Data included 59 speech
samples (WR at t1 was excluded from one patient for reasons described earlier) and 40
measurements of nasal inspiratory flow using the nasal peak inspiratory flow meter
from 20 patients. The generation of universal parameters for reporting speech
outcomes in individuals has been the aim of a number of studies focusing on different
components of speech [5, 33, 34]. The quality of phonetic implementation of words,
and therefore the evaluation of speech intelligibility, serves as global evaluation
of quality of speech. The percentage of correctly identified words is a measure of
speech intelligibility [26]. Of course, a speech recognition system does not
understand the speech as a human listener would. The subjective factor-meaning the
interpretation and processing of perceived speech in the respective brain areas- is
also a relevant criterion for a human observer. Voice quality, phonetic and
morpho-syntactic structure, background noises, loudness, and rate of speech all
influence perception. Context and prosodic elements in particular contribute to a
better understanding of a human listener. That is why speech intelligibility is often
rated differently by differently experienced and competent listeners and limits the
reliability of the perceptual evaluation of speech. It is also known that other
factors such as the speaker and his native tongue, the speaking style, vocabulary,
grammatical complexity, and acoustic properties of the recording system can greatly
affect ASR. In the present study, a standardized procedure was used in order to
exclude the above-mentioned confounding factors and others such as perplexity of
speech and free- versus read speech [35]. By using a standard text (''Der Nordwind
und die Sonne'') and stable recording conditions, the impact of most of these factors
on ASR and the subsequent analysis of results was minimized. The percentage of
correctly identified words of a word sequence, which is defined as the WR, has been
shown to correspond to speech intelligibility-as demonstrated previously for children
and adults with phonetic disorders [4, 22]. Moreover, since the system excludes
semantic and syntactic knowledge, the method is more precise and accurate than the
usually used perceptual evaluations summarized from several listeners. Of course, no
information about acceptability or esthetic appearance of speech can be provided by
ASR. The ASR system is trained with 6.9 h of adult speech in order to model a
''standard'' listener. Unlike perceptual evaluation by human listeners, it is not
affected by perceptual and subjective influences [3]. Evaluation of the same speech
data will always lead to the same result. Therefore, speech recognition is an
objective and accurate tool for the measurement of speech intelligibility [22]. ASR
is based on the statistical modeling of the acoustic and linguistic features of human
speech. In this study we focussed on the acoustic features of speech [36]. The
results of WR in this study population never reached 100%, which one might expect for
normal speakers. However, similar results were obtained in previous studies with the
same ASR system where the WR also did not reach 100% [4]. This is due to limitations
of the method and these consistent results show there is nonsystematic influences.
Given that there is still no gold standard for the perception of spoken speech rather
than merely vowels, we consider ASR to be the best method in that regard. The ASR
system used here has already been employed in several previous studies. Of course, as
an objective method, the intention is for this system to be used in other languages.
Ongoing tests with different languages have already produced promising preliminary
results [37]. Age had no significant influence on WR in this study because the study
population was rather small. However, the effects of age on WR have recently been
demonstrated by Wilpon [38], for children [26, 39]. In adults, similar results were
found after total laryngectomy [4] and in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma
[22]. An increase of hyponasality and decrease of speech intelligibility is generally
assumed to occur as the severity of sinus diseases and obstruction-inducing nasal
deformities increases [15]. Surgical interventions aiming to relieve such conditions
ought to improve speech intelligibility [40]. However, the population in the present
study was too small to allow further statistic evaluations. Previous investigations
of a similar design also had small study populations and varying surgical
interventions [6, 21, 40]. Those evaluations primarily focused on speech analysis
based on single vocals and consonant variations [6, 21]. However, the main aim of
this study was to evaluate speech intelligibility using the ASR system for the first
time in a study population as defined above. Consistency regarding the extent of
surgery of nose and sinuses lay outside the primary focus of this study, but led us
to the initiation of further studies looking specifically at different surgical
interventions. An interesting study done by Yue et al. [41] studied changes in
resonance characteristics of the nasal cavity and nasal airway resistance after
endoscopic sinus surgery, with pre-operative staging of the chronic sinusitis. They
concluded that nasality cannot be ameliorated immediately after surgery, to which we
would agree. Comparison of speech intelligibility in this study measured by ASR at t1
and t3 showed minimal differences in WR rates. A significant reduction in speech
intelligibility was only demonstrated at t2 when participants had nasal packings-a
situation only tolerated in the context of nose/ sinus surgery. Total obstruction of
the nasal cavity with nasal packings caused maximal hyponasality analogous to nasal
obstruction caused by nasal and sinus pathologies. It can be concluded that
hyponasality induced by total obstruction of the nasal cavity significantly
influences speech intelligibility. Hence the ASR system does help to evaluate speech
intelligibility. Similar results have been shown for spectral properties of
consonants and nasalized vowels before and after surgery [21] and the testing of
nasalance with nasalized sentences [15]. Nevertheless, our results may be interpreted
in different ways. First, an insignificant difference between pre- and post-operative
speech intelligibility results may reassure patients that they do not need to expect
major voice changes. On the other hand, expectations to improve hyponasality as the
main intention for surgery need to be lowered. It may also be argued that the ASR
system used was incapable of detecting small changes in nasality. There are reports
in the literature of similar studies that attempted to establish methods and
parameters to determine, for example, if there is a relationship between chronic
sinusitis and dysphonia. However, these studies demonstrated that, due to the small
changes, more effort needs to be directed at increasing the size of the study
population [42]. Interestingly in the clinical daily routine, patients often present
with massive nasal polyposis or septal deviation, whose hyponasality is less
prominent than in patients with acute onset of rhinosinusitis. Hence, changes in
nasal flow and pressure in the nasal cavity and sinuses may be less relevant for
speech when they are chronic and persistent, whereas acute changes are more
significant. Other components such as the velopharyngeal opening may play an
important role [43]. Measurement of the degree of nasal obstruction by nasal
inspiratory peak flow demonstrated that no patient had complete obstruction of the
nasal cavity, either at time point t1 or t3. We found no correlation of speech
intelligibility and nasal inspiratory peak flow. Studies on nasal flow and the
percentage of laminar and turbulent nasal flow have been carried out using various
models [44-46]. These studies led to a primarily functional approach in septal

influences speech intelligibility. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has proved
suitable for quantifying speech intelligibility in patients with different degrees of
nasal emissions. We investigated the influence of hyponasality on the results of
speech recognition before and after nasal surgery using ASR. Speech recordings, nasal
peak inspiratory flow and self-perception measurements were carried out in 20
German-speaking patients (8 women, 12 men; aged 38 - 22 years) who underwent surgery
for various nasal and sinus pathologies. The degree of speech intelligibility was
quantified as the percentage of correctly recognized words of a standardized word
chain by ASR (word recognition rate; WR). WR was measured 1 day before (t1), 1 day
after with nasal packings (t2), and 3 months after (t3) surgery; nasal peak flow on
t1 and t3. WR was calculated with program for the automatic evaluation of all kinds
of speech disorders (PEAKS). WR decreased immediately after surgery (t1 vs. t2 but
increased 3 months after surgery (t2 vs. t3 as a parameter of speech intelligibility
was significantly p p \ \ 0.01) 0.01).<component x="51.02" y="261.75" width="238.1"

of human communication, demonstrating the ability to present thoughts with
articulation and voice [1]. Voice is itself determined by two factors, the voice
source and the vocal tract. Anatomically, the larynx serves as tone generator [2].
This primary signal is further modulated by characteristics of the cross-sectional
area of the vocal tract, involving the supraglottic space, including the pharynx,
nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses [2]. Even minor alterations in these structures
may lead to changes in voice and thereby influence speech intelligibility. Research
in this field has focused on various factors that influence speech intelligibility.
Studies have been undertaken to assess speech quality in patients with cleft palate,
motor speech disorders, and hearing impairment [3-5]. However, the relationship
between speech intelligibility, nose and sinus pathologies, as well as the effects of
surgical treatments, has not been adequately explored [6]. In contrast, several
studies have investigated sinus symptoms such as nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, loss
of smell etc., in attempts to identify the most suitable techniques for surgery to
nose and paranasal sinuses [7-11]. Research on the function of the sinuses themselves
has been carried out for many years [12-14]. In addition to the important functions
of air-conditioning, olfaction, and filtering, pneumatisation may serve to decrease
the weight of the head, and sinuses are assumed an important acoustic resonator
modulating voice [6, 15]. The secretory mucosal function, with active convection of
water into the sinuses, leads to saturation of the inspiratory air with water [16].
One of the main functions of surgery on pathologies of nose and paranasal sinuses is
to increase aeration, in order to reduce inflammation in these cavities [17]. Changes
in nasality are thought to influence speech intelligibility [6]. Nasal obstruction,
especially of the nasal cavity, is one of the main factors in decreasing nasality
[5]. Often the presence of hyponasality is of minor interest in clinical evaluations,
even though it is of major interest for patients-especially with high demands on
their speech. However, speech evaluation prior to endonasal surgery is neither
routinely performed nor standardized. Perceptual evaluation by several listeners is
presently accepted as an ''objective'' assessment of nasality. Here, nasal vowels
such as /m/, /n/, and /ng/ are altered or replaced by pre-nasal plosives. It appears
as decreased nasal resonance with a dull, obstructed-sounding voice. If consonants,
especially voiced plosives, are substituted with correspondent nasalized consonants,
hypernasality is present. Air leaks through the nose, the intraoral pressure of air
is reduced, and the acuity of oral consonants is decreased [18] by changing resonance
functions and altered formant structure of the phoneme [19]. MRI studies of the
spectral characteristics of human nasal sounds showed that the paranasal sinuses have
an important role in shaping these functions [20]. Further investigation of the
effects of sinus surgery supported this assumption [6, 21]. Recently, an automatic
speech recognition (ASR) system was used for the objective assessment of speech
intelligibility and showed very good concordance with perceptual evaluation [3, 4,
22]. ASR is usually used for automatic communication systems in order to recognize
speech, e.g., for telephone or dictating systems. It relies on the analysis of
acoustic properties of speech and often includes phonetic and linguistic knowledge
using stochastic methods [23, 24]. ASR is now increasingly being used to quantify
speech alterations for medical purposes [25]. For the ASR system presented here, the
percentage of correctly recognized words of a known sequence (word recognition rate;
WR) corresponds to speech intelligibility. Thus, the method can be used to evaluate
global speech quality. In previous investigations, it has shown a diminished degree
of intelligibility in children with increased nasality due to cleft palate [26]. It
is important to learn more about the effects of nose and sinus surgery on speech
intelligibility and also to investigate short-, as well as long-term changes after
surgery. Here we present the first data on the use of an ASR system to measure the
speech intelligibility of patients with pathology of nose and paranasal
sinuses.<component x="306.14" y="74.9" width="238.13" height="245.6" page="1"

speech recording session was calculated. The mean WR for the pre-operative speech
recording (t1) was 65.7 - 16.5% (47.2% min, 78.7% max) (Table 1). At t1, one patient
reached a WR of only 4.6% due to microphone problems during recording and that
information was excluded from further calculations. Female patients had a slightly
higher WR at t1 (mean 71.2 - 5.5%) than males (mean 67.2 - 9.9%), with a smaller
range of results (Table 1; Fig. 1). Age showed no influence on WR (Table 2). The mean
WR at the second speech recording session on the first post-operative day (t2), still
with nasal packing, was 55.7 - 12.8% (32.4% min, 80.6% max) for the whole study group
(Table 1). For female patients, the mean WR was 61.7 - 13.4% and for male patients
51.6 - 11.1% (Table 1; Fig. 1). Results in female patients tended to show greater
scatter than in males. Three months postoperatively (t3), mean WR had increased to 68
- 5.3% (57.4% min, 75.9% max) and the degree of scatter was non-significantly lower
compared with t1 and t2 (Table 1). In this context the lowest WR result at t3
measured about 10 points higher than at t1 and also the whole study group showed
fewer outliers, so the degree of scatter of WR results became lower in t3. Gender had
no relevant influence on WR results, with a mean of 69.8 - 3.3% for female and 66.8 -
6.1% for male patients. The range of WR results was again smaller in women than in
men (Table 1; Fig. 1). Comparison of the results between the first (t1) and the last
(t3) speech recording sessions did not show a signifip cant difference in mean WR ( =

paranasal sinuses. Measurements during total nasal obstruction with bilateral nasal
packing were performed to demonstrate the influence of changes in nasality on ASR.
The study group consisted of consecutively admitted patients for nasal/sinus surgery.
A broad spectrum of diseases was included in order to measure a wide range of speech
characteristics as shown in Fig. 2 and Tables 1 and 2. Data included 59 speech
samples (WR at t1 was excluded from one patient for reasons described earlier) and 40
measurements of nasal inspiratory flow using the nasal peak inspiratory flow meter
from 20 patients. The generation of universal parameters for reporting speech
outcomes in individuals has been the aim of a number of studies focusing on different
components of speech [5, 33, 34]. The quality of phonetic implementation of words,
and therefore the evaluation of speech intelligibility, serves as global evaluation
of quality of speech. The percentage of correctly identified words is a measure of
speech intelligibility [26]. Of course, a speech recognition system does not
understand the speech as a human listener would. The subjective factor-meaning the
interpretation and processing of perceived speech in the respective brain areas- is
also a relevant criterion for a human observer. Voice quality, phonetic and
morpho-syntactic structure, background noises, loudness, and rate of speech all
influence perception. Context and prosodic elements in particular contribute to a
better understanding of a human listener. That is why speech intelligibility is often
rated differently by differently experienced and competent listeners and limits the
reliability of the perceptual evaluation of speech. It is also known that other
factors such as the speaker and his native tongue, the speaking style, vocabulary,
grammatical complexity, and acoustic properties of the recording system can greatly
affect ASR. In the present study, a standardized procedure was used in order to
exclude the above-mentioned confounding factors and others such as perplexity of
speech and free- versus read speech [35]. By using a standard text (''Der Nordwind
und die Sonne'') and stable recording conditions, the impact of most of these factors
on ASR and the subsequent analysis of results was minimized. The percentage of
correctly identified words of a word sequence, which is defined as the WR, has been
shown to correspond to speech intelligibility-as demonstrated previously for children
and adults with phonetic disorders [4, 22]. Moreover, since the system excludes
semantic and syntactic knowledge, the method is more precise and accurate than the
usually used perceptual evaluations summarized from several listeners. Of course, no
information about acceptability or esthetic appearance of speech can be provided by
ASR. The ASR system is trained with 6.9 h of adult speech in order to model a
''standard'' listener. Unlike perceptual evaluation by human listeners, it is not
affected by perceptual and subjective influences [3]. Evaluation of the same speech
data will always lead to the same result. Therefore, speech recognition is an
objective and accurate tool for the measurement of speech intelligibility [22]. ASR
is based on the statistical modeling of the acoustic and linguistic features of human
speech. In this study we focussed on the acoustic features of speech [36]. The
results of WR in this study population never reached 100%, which one might expect for
normal speakers. However, similar results were obtained in previous studies with the
same ASR system where the WR also did not reach 100% [4]. This is due to limitations
of the method and these consistent results show there is nonsystematic influences.
Given that there is still no gold standard for the perception of spoken speech rather
than merely vowels, we consider ASR to be the best method in that regard. The ASR
system used here has already been employed in several previous studies. Of course, as
an objective method, the intention is for this system to be used in other languages.
Ongoing tests with different languages have already produced promising preliminary
results [37]. Age had no significant influence on WR in this study because the study
population was rather small. However, the effects of age on WR have recently been
demonstrated by Wilpon [38], for children [26, 39]. In adults, similar results were
found after total laryngectomy [4] and in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma
[22]. An increase of hyponasality and decrease of speech intelligibility is generally
assumed to occur as the severity of sinus diseases and obstruction-inducing nasal
deformities increases [15]. Surgical interventions aiming to relieve such conditions
ought to improve speech intelligibility [40]. However, the population in the present
study was too small to allow further statistic evaluations. Previous investigations
of a similar design also had small study populations and varying surgical
interventions [6, 21, 40]. Those evaluations primarily focused on speech analysis
based on single vocals and consonant variations [6, 21]. However, the main aim of
this study was to evaluate speech intelligibility using the ASR system for the first
time in a study population as defined above. Consistency regarding the extent of
surgery of nose and sinuses lay outside the primary focus of this study, but led us
to the initiation of further studies looking specifically at different surgical
interventions. An interesting study done by Yue et al. [41] studied changes in
resonance characteristics of the nasal cavity and nasal airway resistance after
endoscopic sinus surgery, with pre-operative staging of the chronic sinusitis. They
concluded that nasality cannot be ameliorated immediately after surgery, to which we
would agree. Comparison of speech intelligibility in this study measured by ASR at t1
and t3 showed minimal differences in WR rates. A significant reduction in speech
intelligibility was only demonstrated at t2 when participants had nasal packings-a
situation only tolerated in the context of nose/ sinus surgery. Total obstruction of
the nasal cavity with nasal packings caused maximal hyponasality analogous to nasal
obstruction caused by nasal and sinus pathologies. It can be concluded that
hyponasality induced by total obstruction of the nasal cavity significantly
influences speech intelligibility. Hence the ASR system does help to evaluate speech
intelligibility. Similar results have been shown for spectral properties of
consonants and nasalized vowels before and after surgery [21] and the testing of
nasalance with nasalized sentences [15]. Nevertheless, our results may be interpreted
in different ways. First, an insignificant difference between pre- and post-operative
speech intelligibility results may reassure patients that they do not need to expect
major voice changes. On the other hand, expectations to improve hyponasality as the
main intention for surgery need to be lowered. It may also be argued that the ASR
system used was incapable of detecting small changes in nasality. There are reports
in the literature of similar studies that attempted to establish methods and
parameters to determine, for example, if there is a relationship between chronic
sinusitis and dysphonia. However, these studies demonstrated that, due to the small
changes, more effort needs to be directed at increasing the size of the study
population [42]. Interestingly in the clinical daily routine, patients often present
with massive nasal polyposis or septal deviation, whose hyponasality is less
prominent than in patients with acute onset of rhinosinusitis. Hence, changes in
nasal flow and pressure in the nasal cavity and sinuses may be less relevant for
speech when they are chronic and persistent, whereas acute changes are more
significant. Other components such as the velopharyngeal opening may play an
important role [43]. Measurement of the degree of nasal obstruction by nasal
inspiratory peak flow demonstrated that no patient had complete obstruction of the
nasal cavity, either at time point t1 or t3. We found no correlation of speech
intelligibility and nasal inspiratory peak flow. Studies on nasal flow and the
percentage of laminar and turbulent nasal flow have been carried out using various
models [44-46]. These studies led to a primarily functional approach in septal
surgery, but no evaluation of speech was undertaken.<component x="306.14" y="76.03"
