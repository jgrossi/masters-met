designed to cover the progression of skills agreed to by clinicians and educators as
being pertinent to interpreting Videofluoroscopy Swallowing Studies (VFSSs). Sessions
taught included knowledge of anatomy and physiology of swallowing, examination and
identification of structures and landmarks from radiographs, and the use of an
assessment scale such as the Bethlehem Assessment Scale (BAS) to interpret VFSSs. The
ability to interpret eight VFSSs using the BAS was used as the final assessment.
ANOVA for repeated measures and post hoc tests using Tukey's HSD statistic revealed
that there was a statistically significant correlation between students' knowledge of
anatomy and physiology and their knowledge of radiographic anatomy. There was a
statistically significant correlation between their knowledge of radiographic anatomy
and their ability to interpret videofluoroscopic examinations, as assessed using the
BAS. There was also a statistically significant correlation between their knowledge
of anatomy and physiology and their ability to interpret videofluoroscopic
examinations using the BAS. Key words: Student teaching - Dysphagia - Fluoroscopy -
Deglutition - Deglutition disorders. Videofluoroscopy Swallowing Studies (VFSSs) are
widely used in clinical settings to determine the nature and extent of swallowing
problems. Little data are available to inform what leads to good inter- and
intrarater reliability when interpreting results of this technique [1]. Kuhlemeier et

VFSSs was adequate only for evaluating oral stage, laryngeal penetration and
aspiration, and pharyngeal retention, but it was questionable for the evaluation of
functional components. This article examines methods of achieving reliability when
interpreting VFSSs and ways of teaching this skill to student speech pathologists. In
Australia, dysphagia is seen as part of a standard university undergraduate course in
speech pathology. However, there are still many differences in teaching students the
interpretation of videofluoroscopic examinations. These differences include the
number of hours spent on teaching dysphagia and videofluoroscopy and the year level
at which these subjects are introduced to the students (Table 1). In 1994, the
Australian Association of Speech and Hearing (AASH) established Competency-Based
Occupational Standards (C-BOS). This document outlined the relevant minimal
professional standards required of a newly qualified speech pathologist in the
assessment and management of various speech, language, and swallowing disorders [3].
In the area of dysphagia assessment and management, these standards include the
following: clinicians need to examine the nature of the client's difficulty using a
variety of methods including case history, observational techniques, and
investigative techniques; clinicians should be involved in the decision to
investigate dysphagia further, using radiographic and other techniques; and
clinicians should be aware of the use and interpretation of videofluoroscopic
investigation (with reference to a senior or supervising speech pathologist for
assistance when appropriate). Currently there is no agreed on structured method for
teaching the interpretation of videofluoroscopic examinations. There is a need to
teach this technique because of its wide use in varied clinical settings. Accuracy
and clinical rigor in interpreting VFSSs are vital in clinical diagnosis. This
project sought to examine the optimal<component x="314.98" y="55.08" width="227.53"

for evaluating dysphagia in motor neuron disease subjects, involves interpreting
dynamic VFSSs guided by a 4-point rating scale, with clear verbal descriptors and
printed radiological examples of the scalar points. Developed from the Charing Cross
profile [5], the BAS has established validity and reliability data from studies of
experienced clinicians' use of the scale. Specific parameters allow the evaluation of
individual functions that contribute to the dynamic process of swallowing. These
parameters include: labial function, lingual function, jaw function, velar function,
swallow reflex, hyoid elevation, pooling in valleculae, pooling in pyriform sinuses,
aspiration, pharyngeal wall function, and cricopharyngeal function [6]. In using the
BAS for assessing students' skills, this article examines teaching and learning
paradigms in the interpretation of videofluoroscopic examinations. We<component

year of the four-year speech pathology undergraduate course at La Trobe University.
They had no previous specific training in the interpretation of videofluoroscopic
examinations and had no known hearing or visual impairment. The rationale for using
only female participants was to eliminate the confounding factor that gender might
have on the results. In addition, the speech pathology course is very much
femaledominated and it would have been difficult to obtain an equal number of male
participants.<component x="314.98" y="55.52" width="227.51" height="87.0" page="2"

1 covered materials relating to the normal anatomy and physiology of swallowing. This
included the normal process of swallowing, the anatomical structures and muscles
involved in swallowing, and the innervation of these muscles. Teaching was didactic
with quality overheads and handouts provided to augment the session. Following this
session, all subjects were required to complete and submit a worksheet to assess
knowledge gained. Session 2 was to teach radiographic anatomy and landmarking.
Subjects were taught by the researcher how to identify structures and landmarks on
"still" radiographic images. Following this teaching session, subjects were required
to complete and submit a worksheet relating to the topic covered. The worksheet
consisted of radiographs with arrows labeling structures to be identified. Students
were required to identify and correctly label by writing the names alongside the
anatomical areas outlined. Sessions 3 and 4 taught subjects how to interpret and rate
the parameters in the oral and the pharyngeal phase of the swallow in VFSSs using the
BAS. Parameters in the oral phase were labial function, lingual function, and jaw
function; parameters in the pharyngeal phase were velar elevation, swallow reflex,
hyoid elevation, residue in the valleculae, residue in the pyriform sinuses,
aspiration, pharyngeal wall function, and cricopharyngeal function. Subjects were
provided with visual examples of normal and abnormal swallows (in the form of VFSSs).
Subjects were also taught what viewing mode (i.e., normal play mode, pause mode, or
frame-by-frame mode) to use when rating each of the parameters and the levels of
function for each parameter using the BAS descriptors (which included visual examples
of each of the four points on the scale). In session 5, subjects were given the
opportunity to practice (as a group) using the BAS for interpreting differing
videofluoroscopic examinations in class.<component x="63.54" y="358.86"

reference_score="8.25">Five hours of carefully structured teaching was developed. In
order to assess knowledge gained, worksheets were given after each specific skill had
been covered in the training sessions (namely, the anatomy and physiology of
swallowing, radiographic anatomy of the swallowing mechanism, and interpretation of
dynamic videofluoroscopic examinations using the BAS), and all subjects agreed to
complete the final assessment. The teaching package was designed in this way for a
number of reasons. First, it was agreed that students would need an understanding of
"normal" anatomy and physiology before they could understand abnormalities in the
swallowing process. Second, swallowing, being a complex and integrated process,
needed to be divided into its component phases so that students could gain a fuller
understanding of the different aspects. In addition, the BAS divides the areas to be
interpreted into the oral phase and pharyngeal phase. Therefore, it was essential
that students learn where each phase began and ended so that they could use the BAS
reliably. Finally, it was necessary to teach the students to interpret radiographs so
that they could identify structures and spaces that are in the swallowing process.
The BAS refers to a number of structures and spaces in the ratings of some specified
parameters. It was also assumed that this would follow the progression of skills that
are necessary in the interpretation of dynamic VFSSs. Subjects agreed to attend all 5
teaching sessions and complete and return all assessments. The subjects were given
one week to complete and submit each worksheet example (see Appendix 1) and another
week to complete and submit the final assessment which consisted of 8 VFSSs recorded
on videocassette for subjects to take home and complete, using the BAS. In order to
discount any practice effect, the sequence of the 8 VFSSs was randomized so that the
order of the swallows was different from tape to tape. The 8 VFSSs chosen had no
identifying information on them which minimized the possibility that subjects would
compare their responses among themselves.<component x="63.54" y="55.53"

least 75% of the answers correct. The mean score was 87.5% and the range of scores
was between 79% and 100%. The results for worksheet 1 are summarized in Tables 2 and
3. These results are categorized into question topics examining knowledge of
structures and question topics examining knowledge of functions. The tables are also
ranked according to scores in terms of percentage correct. The questions that did not
reach the 75% correct criterion are in italics. Of the 40 individual aspects that
were covered in worksheet 1, there were 9 aspects that did not achieve the 75%
correct criterion. The overall of mean correct answers was 83.3%, the standard
deviation was 19%, and the range was between 31.6% and 100% of students' correctly
answering individual aspects. The individual aspects where subjects were unable to
attain the required 75% correct score were complex concepts involving several
structures; a series of diagrams might have aided subjects to understand better. It
may have been that subjects did not understand these concepts or the wording of the
question. Radiographic Anatomy In worksheet 2, subjects were required to label 8
diagrams of radiographic still images with a total of 71 structures (Figs. 1 and 2).
The subjects scored in the range of 94.4%-100% correct for this worksheet. The mean
score was 98.6% with a standard deviation of 1.6. Table 4 summarizes the results of
worksheet 2, with individual aspects ranked in terms of scores. The table shows that
all structures that were to be labeled were done so correctly, with all above 75%
correct. The range of accurate labeling was between 90.4% and 100%. Teeth, vallecula,
and the first cervical vertebrae were labeled accurately 100% of the time. The
following items had relatively low frequencies of occurrence (i.e., the number of
times that students were requested to label structures): teeth (frequency 2),

parameters in the BAS. This analysis showed that poorto-good interrater reliability

kappa coefficients, obtained z values and their corresponding p values were
calculated. Table 5 summarizes the parameters ranked in terms of their obtained z
values. All the z scores were above that which would be expected from ?? for all 11
parameters tested. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures was
performed to allow the comparion of the scores in the knowledge of the anatomy and
physiology of swallowing (worksheet 1), the ability to identify structures and
landmarks in still radiographic images (worksheet 2), and the 8 trials at

anatomy and physiology of swallowing (worksheet 1), the ability to identify
structures and landmarks in still radiographic images (worksheet 2), and the 8 trials
at interpreting dynamic videofluoroscopic examinations using the BAS (final
assessment). Since the obtained F ratio is significant, post hoc testing using
Tukey's HSD enabled the determination of which factors in the progression of skills
required to interpret videofluoroscopic examinations were more important. Table 7
illustrates the statistical comparison between the knowledge of the anatomy and
physiology of swallowing (worksheet 1), the ability to identify structures and
landmarks in still radiographic images (worksheet 2), and the 8 trials at

Thus, it can be demonstrated that 4 4 there was a correlation between the knowledge
of the anatomy and physiology of swallowing and competence in interpreting
videofluoroscopic examinations (as demonstrated by the ability to obtain a 75%
agreement on specified parameters in the BAS). There was also a relationship between
the interpretation of structures (as ascertained by identification of structures and
landmarks on still radiographic images) and functions (interpretation of VFSSs using

landmarking, and success at interpreting VFSSs.<component x="314.98" y="76.03"

inadequately. The use of serial diagrams and models could have aided subjects to

designed to cover the progression of skills agreed to by clinicians and educators as
being pertinent to interpreting Videofluoroscopy Swallowing Studies (VFSSs). Sessions
taught included knowledge of anatomy and physiology of swallowing, examination and
identification of structures and landmarks from radiographs, and the use of an
assessment scale such as the Bethlehem Assessment Scale (BAS) to interpret VFSSs. The
ability to interpret eight VFSSs using the BAS was used as the final assessment.
ANOVA for repeated measures and post hoc tests using Tukey's HSD statistic revealed
that there was a statistically significant correlation between students' knowledge of
anatomy and physiology and their knowledge of radiographic anatomy. There was a
statistically significant correlation between their knowledge of radiographic anatomy
and their ability to interpret videofluoroscopic examinations, as assessed using the
BAS. There was also a statistically significant correlation between their knowledge
of anatomy and physiology and their ability to interpret videofluoroscopic
examinations using the BAS. Key words: Student teaching - Dysphagia - Fluoroscopy -

VFSSs was adequate only for evaluating oral stage, laryngeal penetration and
aspiration, and pharyngeal retention, but it was questionable for the evaluation of
functional components. This article examines methods of achieving reliability when
interpreting VFSSs and ways of teaching this skill to student speech pathologists. In
Australia, dysphagia is seen as part of a standard university undergraduate course in
speech pathology. However, there are still many differences in teaching students the
interpretation of videofluoroscopic examinations. These differences include the
number of hours spent on teaching dysphagia and videofluoroscopy and the year level
at which these subjects are introduced to the students (Table 1). In 1994, the
Australian Association of Speech and Hearing (AASH) established Competency-Based
Occupational Standards (C-BOS). This document outlined the relevant minimal
professional standards required of a newly qualified speech pathologist in the
assessment and management of various speech, language, and swallowing disorders [3].
In the area of dysphagia assessment and management, these standards include the
following: clinicians need to examine the nature of the client's difficulty using a
variety of methods including case history, observational techniques, and
investigative techniques; clinicians should be involved in the decision to
investigate dysphagia further, using radiographic and other techniques; and
clinicians should be aware of the use and interpretation of videofluoroscopic
investigation (with reference to a senior or supervising speech pathologist for
assistance when appropriate). Currently there is no agreed on structured method for
teaching the interpretation of videofluoroscopic examinations. There is a need to
teach this technique because of its wide use in varied clinical settings. Accuracy
and clinical rigor in interpreting VFSSs are vital in clinical diagnosis. This
project sought to examine the optimal<component x="314.98" y="55.08" width="227.53"

for evaluating dysphagia in motor neuron disease subjects, involves interpreting
dynamic VFSSs guided by a 4-point rating scale, with clear verbal descriptors and

profile [5], the BAS has established validity and reliability data from studies of
experienced clinicians' use of the scale. Specific parameters allow the evaluation of
individual functions that contribute to the dynamic process of swallowing. These
parameters include: labial function, lingual function, jaw function, velar function,
swallow reflex, hyoid elevation, pooling in valleculae, pooling in pyriform sinuses,
aspiration, pharyngeal wall function, and cricopharyngeal function [6]. In using the
BAS for assessing students' skills, this article examines teaching and learning

1 covered materials relating to the normal anatomy and physiology of swallowing. This
included the normal process of swallowing, the anatomical structures and muscles
involved in swallowing, and the innervation of these muscles. Teaching was didactic
with quality overheads and handouts provided to augment the session. Following this
session, all subjects were required to complete and submit a worksheet to assess
knowledge gained. Session 2 was to teach radiographic anatomy and landmarking.
Subjects were taught by the researcher how to identify structures and landmarks on
"still" radiographic images. Following this teaching session, subjects were required
to complete and submit a worksheet relating to the topic covered. The worksheet
consisted of radiographs with arrows labeling structures to be identified. Students
were required to identify and correctly label by writing the names alongside the
anatomical areas outlined. Sessions 3 and 4 taught subjects how to interpret and rate
the parameters in the oral and the pharyngeal phase of the swallow in VFSSs using the
BAS. Parameters in the oral phase were labial function, lingual function, and jaw
function; parameters in the pharyngeal phase were velar elevation, swallow reflex,
hyoid elevation, residue in the valleculae, residue in the pyriform sinuses,
aspiration, pharyngeal wall function, and cricopharyngeal function. Subjects were
provided with visual examples of normal and abnormal swallows (in the form of VFSSs).
Subjects were also taught what viewing mode (i.e., normal play mode, pause mode, or
frame-by-frame mode) to use when rating each of the parameters and the levels of
function for each parameter using the BAS descriptors (which included visual examples
of each of the four points on the scale). In session 5, subjects were given the
opportunity to practice (as a group) using the BAS for interpreting differing
videofluoroscopic examinations in class.<component x="63.54" y="358.86"

order to assess knowledge gained, worksheets were given after each specific skill had
been covered in the training sessions (namely, the anatomy and physiology of
swallowing, radiographic anatomy of the swallowing mechanism, and interpretation of
dynamic videofluoroscopic examinations using the BAS), and all subjects agreed to
complete the final assessment. The teaching package was designed in this way for a
number of reasons. First, it was agreed that students would need an understanding of
"normal" anatomy and physiology before they could understand abnormalities in the
swallowing process. Second, swallowing, being a complex and integrated process,
needed to be divided into its component phases so that students could gain a fuller
understanding of the different aspects. In addition, the BAS divides the areas to be
interpreted into the oral phase and pharyngeal phase. Therefore, it was essential
that students learn where each phase began and ended so that they could use the BAS
reliably. Finally, it was necessary to teach the students to interpret radiographs so
that they could identify structures and spaces that are in the swallowing process.
The BAS refers to a number of structures and spaces in the ratings of some specified
parameters. It was also assumed that this would follow the progression of skills that
are necessary in the interpretation of dynamic VFSSs. Subjects agreed to attend all 5
teaching sessions and complete and return all assessments. The subjects were given
one week to complete and submit each worksheet example (see Appendix 1) and another
week to complete and submit the final assessment which consisted of 8 VFSSs recorded
on videocassette for subjects to take home and complete, using the BAS. In order to
discount any practice effect, the sequence of the 8 VFSSs was randomized so that the
order of the swallows was different from tape to tape. The 8 VFSSs chosen had no
identifying information on them which minimized the possibility that subjects would
compare their responses among themselves.<component x="63.54" y="55.53"

ranked according to scores in terms of percentage correct. The questions that did not
reach the 75% correct criterion are in italics. Of the 40 individual aspects that

correct criterion. The overall of mean correct answers was 83.3%, the standard
deviation was 19%, and the range was between 31.6% and 100% of students' correctly
answering individual aspects. The individual aspects where subjects were unable to
attain the required 75% correct score were complex concepts involving several
structures; a series of diagrams might have aided subjects to understand better. It
may have been that subjects did not understand these concepts or the wording of the
question. Radiographic Anatomy In worksheet 2, subjects were required to label 8
diagrams of radiographic still images with a total of 71 structures (Figs. 1 and 2).
The subjects scored in the range of 94.4%-100% correct for this worksheet. The mean
score was 98.6% with a standard deviation of 1.6. Table 4 summarizes the results of

required to interpret videofluoroscopic examinations were more important. Table 7
illustrates the statistical comparison between the knowledge of the anatomy and

inadequately. The use of serial diagrams and models could have aided subjects to

identification of this parameter to be worse compared with that for other parameters
on the BAS. Alternatively, the first author's teaching of this function may have been
