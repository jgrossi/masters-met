			<abstract>
				<p>This article examines a teaching package that was designed to cover the progression of skills agreed to by clinicians and educators as being pertinent to interpreting Videofluoroscopy Swallowing Studies (VFSSs). Sessions taught included knowledge of anatomy and physiology of swallowing, examination and identification of structures and landmarks from radiographs, and the use of an assessment scale such as the Bethlehem Assessment Scale (BAS) to interpret VFSSs. The ability to interpret eight VFSSs using the BAS was used as the final assessment. ANOVA for repeated measures and post hoc tests using Tukey's HSD statistic revealed that there was a statistically significant correlation between students' knowledge of anatomy and physiology and their knowledge of radiographic anatomy. There was a statistically significant correlation between their knowledge of radiographic anatomy and their ability to interpret videofluoroscopic examinations, as assessed using the BAS. There was also a statistically significant correlation between their knowledge of anatomy and physiology and their ability to interpret videofluoroscopic examinations using the BAS.</p>

In 1994, the Australian Association of Speech and Hearing (AASH) established Competency-Based Occupational Standards (C-BOS). This document outlined the relevant minimal professional standards required of a newly qualified speech pathologist in the assessment and management of various speech, language, and swallowing disorders [3]. In the area of dysphagia assessment and management, these standards include the following: clinicians need to examine the nature of the client’s difficulty using a variety of methods including case history, observational techniques, and investigative techniques; clinicians should be involved in the decision to investigate dysphagia further, using radiographic and other techniques; and clinicians should be aware of the use and interpretation of videofluoroscopic investigation (with reference to a senior or supervising speech pathologist for assistance when appropriate).

Clinical Implications The results of this research reinforce the necessity of Australian clinicians adhering to C-BOS. C-BOS states that “Clinicians should be aware of the use and interpretation of videofluoroscopic investigation with reference to a senior or supervising speech pathologist for assistance when appropriate” (our italics). With the current level of teaching of the interpretation of videofluoroscopic examinations, we cannot assume new graduates can interpret videofluoroscopic examinations as reliably as might be desired [7]. Our work also reinforces the belief that accredited postgraduate training should be made available for new graduates to improve and refine their skills at interpreting videofluoroscopic examinations and hence achieve more accurate assessment in dysphagia. Conclusions Recent literature has shown that dysphagia assessment and management forms a significant part of a speech pathologist’s caseload. The issues raised by our study highlight that we may not be providing adequate knowlege, skill, and practice as part of the undergraduate training program. There is a need for educators to meet the ne</context>
