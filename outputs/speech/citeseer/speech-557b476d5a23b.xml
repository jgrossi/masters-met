				<p>Background: The Bercow review found a high level of public dissatisfaction with speech and language services for children. Children with speech, language, and communication needs (SLCN) often have chronic complex conditions that require provision from health, education, and community services. Speech and language therapists are a small group of Allied Health Professionals with a specialist skill-set that equips them to work with children with SLCN. They work within and across the diverse range of public service providers. The aim of this review was to explore the applicability of Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) to the case of speech and language therapy. Methods: A review of qualitative research on a successfully embedded speech and language therapy intervention was undertaken to test the applicability of NPT. The review focused on two of the collective action elements of NPT (relational integration and interaction workability) using all previously published qualitative data from both parents and practitioners' perspectives on the intervention. Results: The synthesis of the data based on the Normalisation Process Model (NPM) uncovered strengths in the interpersonal processes between the practitioners and parents, and weaknesses in how the accountability of the intervention is distributed in the health system.</p>

It is suggested that the design of services for children and families needs to extend beyond the consideration of benefits and barriers to embrace the social processes that appear to afford success in embedding innovation in healthcare. Background In his review of the services for children with speech, language, and communication needs (SLCN) in England and Wales, Bercow [1] said that, ‘The requirements of children and young people with SLCN and their families will be met when, and only when, appropriate services to support them, across the age range and spectrum of need, are designed and delivered in a way that is accessible to them.’ Over one-half of the 1,000 families who participated in the consultation said that speech and language therapy services were poor. Whilst families indicated that improvements in services could come from enhanced resourcing, their evidence also showed that there is an imperative for change in the design and delivery of speech and la</context>

Having an intervention with distributed accountability that is demonstrable to parents appears to result in more parental satisfaction. It seems that the issues of flexibility in accountability and distribution of the intervention rests with the healthcare provider side of the partnership. When parents talk about getting a referral to speech and language therapy services in the UK, they frequently use words like ‘fight’ and ‘battle’ [1,5,6]. Rannard [5] sampled 40 families and found an average time lag of two years between the point when parents first had concerns about their child and the point of referral to a speech and language practitioner. Although some parents reported that they had delayed seeking help because they thought the child might grow out of the problem, in most other cases parents said that delayed referral was due to problems in getting the primary healthcare professional to refer to speech and language therapy. Like some parents, primary care workers might also delay referral because of their knowledge of wid</context>

The HPP has become successfully embedded in the UK; therefore, the finding of limited flexibility in accountability and confidence runs contrary to the predictions made by NPM. One reason could be that parents and practitioners are happy to have relatively passive parental roles within the clinical relationship and, therefore, no work on this aspect of the intervention is needed. In a qualitative study on parents’ views of speech and language therapy in children with the most severe speech and language difficulties, Rannard [5] found that parents rate a partnership approach to their child’s needs very positively. A partnership approach in educational provision was identified as a process that helped parents to change their initially negative opinion about special educational provision when they had a preference for mainstream education. We can learn from this that partnership working is valued by parents, they see it as a mechanism that will bring about change in their child, and there is evidence that team working by professionals can enable parents to feel more satisfied with providerbased recommendations for thei</context>

We might assume that the professional competency of speech and language therapists means that they are highly skilled in supporting the types of flexible co-construction that May says supports the normalisation of an intervention. If this is the case, then we might always expect to find evidence of flexible construction of agency in the context of speech and language therapy. Data from Baxendale et al. [8] suggest that this is not the case. They compared parental perspectives on the HPP with traditional clinicbased therapy following a randomised control trial of the two interventions. The expectations of all parents prior to speech and language therapy was that the therapy would be provided on a one-to-one basis with the practitioner providing the therapy in a clinic environment, and that the work would involve some direct elicitation procedures, such as helping the child imitate sounds or repeat sounds.

It is an opportune time to consider the complex context in which speech and language interventions are delivered to explore: how intervention research should be designed so that interventions can be integrated across and within the diverse public service delivery context; and how interventions can be designed to better meet the specific needs and expectations of the families themselves. To date, there are only a handful of studies on the parental perspective on speech and language therapy [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], and only three of these studies have used the type of qualitative methodology that is needed to explore the parents’ frame of reference [6,7,11]. Given the priority for early intervention, the focus on the transition into speech and language therapy is a good place to start to deepen understanding of the perspectives of the main participants.

With new postBercow funding for intervention research, it is especially important that the potential implementation of new interventions is explored at an early stage so that, if found to be efficacious, new interventions can be quickly embedded within existing practice. The complex nature of the interventions and the diverse delivery conditions of those interventions across a range of public services provides a challenging context in which to design new interventions that can be embedded in practice for patient benefit. Murray et al. [19] suggested that Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) provides a framework that can be used to design and evaluate complex interventions to improve potentiality for implementation of research interventions in practice.

They highlight the opportunity to draw on health psychology and social theory to fully explore and model the multiple and complex mechanisms of change in intervention design.

James Implementation Science 2011, 6:95 http://www.implementationscience.com/content/6/1/95 Page 3 of 10 Defining method for secondary analysis The first step in the analysis was to identify the important and recurrent themes that arose in the five studies in the review. The next step was to map the recurrent themes on to the constructs of the NPM [20]. The existing published research on the HPP did not contain data that was relevant to the two exogenous components of the NPM, but there were recurrent themes that mapped on to the two endogenous constructs of the model. The next step was to isolate all the quotations that were reported in the three papers that included data from semi-structured interviews of focus groups. All the direct quotations were taken out of the thematic context in which they had been grouped in the original research. They were read and then considered for inclusion into a construct map of the NPM endogenous factors. </context>

According to May, an intervention that gets embedded in practice is likely to be one that allows flexible accomplishment of both congruence and disposal. The emphasis is on the flexibility needed for parties to combine their ideas and beliefs (congruence) and make them concrete in outcomes that are meaningful to both parties (disposal). According to the proposition in the model, the successfully embedded HPP should reveal evidence of flexible interpersonal work between practitioner and parent. The second endogenous process defined by May [20], named Relational Integration, covers the network of relations in which the clinical work is embedded. According to May, this network of relations is how the knowledge and practice of the intervention is defined and mediated. This is comprised of two dimensions, accountability and confidence. Accountability refers to internal network and has three components. These are: validity of the knowledge associated with the intervention, which includes ways in which disputes about that knowledge are minimised and the distribution of the knowledge within the hierarchies in the network; expertise, belie</context>

The intervention uses an indirect method of therapy, which means that the practitioner works through another agent in order to achieve change in the child. In this case, the agent of therapy is the mother or caregiver. The practitioner uses video footage to help parents, who attend in groups, to see how they could adapt their own interaction to support the development of communication in their child.

Parents start off expecting the child to be the focus of therapy (co-operation, legitimacy, and conduct), but the data on disposal (goals and meaning) show that parents have accepted that they are the legitimate target of therapy in the HPP. In focus groups with speech and language therapists, Pennington and Thompson [29] reported that the speech and language therapists valued how the parents had been able to adopt a totally different approach, they related this change in parents’ communicative style positively, and they attributed the change to the content and delivery of the programme. The evidence of flexibility in practitioners is less noticeable, but there is evidence that they adjust the components of therapy according to parental feedback (see Goals). From the data in Table 3, it is evident that the speech and language therapists appear to carry the knowledge of the limits of the research evidence for t</context>

Therefore, it is not the case that practitioners are always successful in helping parents change their perspective on their role in the intervention. One conclusion from this analysis is that the HPP is an intervention that is particularly good at helping practitioners theorise about, discuss, and evaluate the mechanisms of change in the intervention. James Implementation Science 2011, 6:95 http://www.implementationscience.com/content/6/1/95 Page 5 of 10 Pennington and Thompson [29] also reported that the practitioners perceived increased confidence and empowerment in the parents who took part in the HPP. The practitioners in this study often attributed this change to the group delivery of the programme. However, practitioners also reported that they found the group work particularly difficult and that parents were apprehensive and insecure in the group. In congruence with this, it was often the group delivery aspect of the intervention that was dropped by the practitioners. The parents did not attribute any change in their own learning or feelings of confidence to other</context>

Thus, parental satisfaction may not only rely on the interpersonal factors within the consultation that are considered to be related to reported outcomes in primary care, such as achieving therapeutic alliance and power sharing [30,31], rather the distribution of the intervention within the healthcare system should also be considered as a design factor, amenable to change, that could enhance parents’ satisfaction with speech and language therapy.
