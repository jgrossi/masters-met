				<p>Altered nasality influences speech intelligibil-ity. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has proved suitable for quantifying speech intelligibility in patients with different degrees of nasal emissions. We investigated the influence of hyponasality on the results of speech recognition before and after nasal surgery using ASR. Speech recordings, nasal peak inspiratory flow and self-perception measurements were carried out in 20 German-speaking patients (8 women, 12 men; aged 38 ± 22 years) who underwent surgery for various nasal and sinus pathologies. The degree of speech intelligibility was quantified as the percentage of correctly recognized words of a standardized word chain by ASR (word recognition rate; WR). WR was measured 1 day before (t1), 1 day after with nasal packings (t2), and 3 months after (t3) surgery; nasal peak flow on t1 and t3. WR was calculated with program for the automatic evaluation of all kinds of speech disorders (PEAKS). WR as a parameter of speech intelligibility was significantly decreased immediately after surgery (t1 vs. t2 p \ 0.01) but increased 3 months after surgery (t2 vs. t3 p \ 0.01). WR showed no association with age or gender. There was no significant difference between WR at t1 and t3, despite a post-operative increase in nasal peak inspiratory flow measurements. The results show that ASR is capable of quantifying the influence of hyponasality on speech; nasal obstruction leads to significantly reduced WR and nasal peak flow cannot replace evaluation of nasality.</p>

Moreover, since the system excludes semantic and syntactic knowledge, the method is more precise and accurate than the usually used perceptual evaluations summarized from several listeners. Of course, no information about acceptability or esthetic appearance of speech can be provided by ASR. The ASR system is trained with 6.9 h of adult speech in order to model a ‘‘standard’’ listener. Unlike perceptual evaluation by human listeners, it is not affected by perceptual and subjective influences [3]. Evaluation of the same speech data will always lead to the same result. Therefore, speech recognition is an objective and accurate tool for the measurement of speech intelligibility [22]. ASR is based on the statistical modeling of the acoustic and linguistic features of human speech. In this study we focussed on the acoustic features of speech [36]. The results of WR in this study population never reached 100%, which one might expect for normal speakers. However, similar results were obtained in previous studies with the same ASR system where the WR also did not reach 100% [4]. This is due </context>

The ASR system used here has already been employed in several previous studies. Of course, as an objective method, the intention is for this system to be used in other languages. Ongoing tests with different languages have already produced promising preliminary results [37]. Age had no significant influence on WR in this study because the study population was rather small. However, the effects of age on WR have recently been demonstrated by Wilpon [38], for children [26, 39]. In adults, similar results were found after total laryngectomy [4] and in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma [22]. An increase of hyponasality and decrease of speech intelligibility is generally assumed to occur as the severity of sinus diseases and obstruction-inducing nasal deformities increases [15]. Surgical interventions aiming to relieve such conditions ought to improve speech intelligibility [40].

One of the main functions of surgery on pathologies of nose and paranasal sinuses is to increase aeration, in order to reduce inflammation in these cavities [17]. Changes in nasality are thought to influence speech intelligibility [6]. Nasal obstruction, especially of the nasal cavity, is one of the main factors in decreasing nasality [5]. Often the presence of hyponasality is of minor interest in clinical evaluations, even though it is of major interest for patients—especially with high demands on their speech.

A broad spectrum of diseases was included in order to measure a wide range of speech characteristics as shown in Fig. 2 and Tables 1 and 2. Data included 59 speech samples (WR at t1 was excluded from one patient for reasons described earlier) and 40 measurements of nasal inspiratory flow using the nasal peak inspiratory flow meter from 20 patients. The generation of universal parameters for reporting speech outcomes in individuals has been the aim of a number of studies focusing on different components of speech [5, 33, 34]. The quality of phonetic implementation of words, and therefore the evaluation of speech intelligibility, serves as global evaluation of quality of speech. The percentage of correctly identified words is a measure of speech intelligibility [26]. Of course, a speech recognition system does not understand the speech as a human listener would. The subjective factor—meaning the interpretation and processing of perceived speech in the respective brain areas— is also a relevant criterion for a human observer.

The percentage of correctly identified words of a word sequence, which is defined as the WR, has been shown to correspond to speech intelligibility—as demonstrated previously for children and adults with phonetic disorders [4, 22]. Moreover, since the system excludes semantic and syntactic knowledge, the method is more precise and accurate than the usually used perceptual evaluations summarized from several listeners. Of course, no information about acceptability or esthetic appearance of speech can be provided by ASR. The ASR system is trained with 6.9 h of adult speech in order to model a ‘‘standard’’ listener.

The generation of universal parameters for reporting speech outcomes in individuals has been the aim of a number of studies focusing on different components of speech [5, 33, 34]. The quality of phonetic implementation of words, and therefore the evaluation of speech intelligibility, serves as global evaluation of quality of speech. The percentage of correctly identified words is a measure of speech intelligibility [26]. Of course, a speech recognition system does not understand the speech as a human listener would. The subjective factor—meaning the interpretation and processing of perceived speech in the respective brain areas— is also a relevant criterion for a human observer. Voice quality, phonetic and morpho-syntactic structure, background noises, loudness, and rate of speech all influence perception. Context and prosodic elements in particular contribute to a better understanding of a human listener.

The ASR system is trained with 6.9 h of adult speech in order to model a ‘‘standard’’ listener. Unlike perceptual evaluation by human listeners, it is not affected by perceptual and subjective influences [3]. Evaluation of the same speech data will always lead to the same result. Therefore, speech recognition is an objective and accurate tool for the measurement of speech intelligibility [22]. ASR is based on the statistical modeling of the acoustic and linguistic features of human speech. In this study we focussed on the acoustic features of speech [36]. The results of WR in this study population never reached 100%, which one might expect for normal speakers. However, similar results were obtained in previous studies with the same ASR system where the WR also did not reach 100% [4]. This is due to limitations of the method and these consistent results show there is nonsystematic influences. Given that there is still no gold standard for the perception of spoken speech rather than merely vowels, we consider ASR to be the best method in that regard.

Consistency regarding the extent of surgery of nose and sinuses lay outside the primary focus of this study, but led us to the initiation of further studies looking specifically at different surgical interventions. An interesting study done by Yue et al. [41] studied changes in resonance characteristics of the nasal cavity and nasal airway resistance after endoscopic sinus surgery, with pre-operative staging of the chronic sinusitis. They concluded that nasality cannot be ameliorated immediately after surgery, to which we would agree. Comparison of speech intelligibility in this study measured by ASR at t1 and t3 showed minimal differences in WR rates. A significant reduction in speech intelligibility was only demonstrated at t2 when participants had nasal packings—a situation only tolerated in the context of nose/ sinus surgery.

However, these studies demonstrated that, due to the small changes, more effort needs to be directed at increasing the size of the study population [42]. Interestingly in the clinical daily routine, patients often present with massive nasal polyposis or septal deviation, whose hyponasality is less prominent than in patients with acute onset of rhinosinusitis. Hence, changes in nasal flow and pressure in the nasal cavity and sinuses may be less relevant for speech when they are chronic and persistent, whereas acute changes are more significant.

Measurement of the degree of nasal obstruction by nasal inspiratory peak flow demonstrated that no patient had complete obstruction of the nasal cavity, either at time point t1 or t3. We found no correlation of speech intelligibility and nasal inspiratory peak flow. Studies on nasal flow and the percentage of laminar and turbulent nasal flow have been carried out using various models [44–46]. These studies led to a primarily functional approach in septal surgery, but no evaluation of speech was undertaken.
