			<abstract>
				<p>In two studies the relationship between the onset of reading and language specific speech perception, the degree to which native speech perception is superior to non-native speech perception, was investigated. In Experiment 1 with children of 4, 6, and 8 years, language specific speech perception occurred maximally at 6 years and was positively related to reading ability for age and language comprehension level. In Experiment 2, with an expanded range of ages and various stimulus and task changes, the relationship between reading and language specific speech perception still held, and maximal language specific speech perception occurred around the onset of reading instruction for three different sets of speech contrasts, but not for a control set of non-speech contrasts. The results show that language specific speech perception is a linguistic rather than an acoustic phenomenon. Results are discussed in terms of early speech perception abilities, experience with oral communication, cognitive ability, reading ability, alphabetic versus logographic languages, phonics versus whole word reading instruction, and the effect of age versus instruction.</p>

Clearly these explanations are ad hoc, but they highlight the need for further investigation of the dynamic interaction of speech perception processes such as facilitation and attenuation right across development, in infants, children, and adults (Aslin, 1981; Gottlieb, 1976).

Sounds were played on an Otari MX5050 reel-to-reel tape recorder through an Acoustics Research BXi speaker. Each stimulus syllable was 500 msec in duration, and in each trial 10 repetitions of each syllable were presented with 250 msecs of silence between repetitions.

The Queensland Articulation Test (QAT hereafter) is a 64-item Australian language test similar to the Edinburgh Articulation Test, in which subjects are asked to name pictured objects. The items are designed such that all English language consonants are tested in initial, medial and final positions with appropriate phonotactic constraints ([h] initial only, [ ] medial and final only, [w], [ ], and [j] initial and medial only, and [ ] medial only).

Subjects were usually tested first on one of the perception tests, then the language tests, and then the other perception test. This order was sometimes modified if the child found the perception test initially daunting. Despite such deviations order of presentation of the native and non-native perception tests was counterbalanced between subjects, as was order within the language tests. The procedure for the QAT, the Bankson, and Reading followed the prescribed published procedures (Kilminister &amp; Laird, 1978; Bankson, 1977; Daniels &amp; Diack, 1974). The procedure for the speech perception tests was identical for the native and non-native contrasts, except that the stimuli, and the random presentation orders of test stimuli differed. Children sat in front of the screen, were told they would hear one of two sounds, and instructed to press one paddle for one sound and the other for the other sound.

What we have found here is that there is heightened language specific speech perception after children begin school, and this is related to the onset of reading.

Together these results support the contention that basic speech perception abilities are indeed implicated in reading difficulties via their effect on phonological analysis skills (Wagner et al., 1994). A basic speech perception skill is categorical speech perception in which stimuli differing along physical continua such as formant transitions or voice onset time are perceived to belong to distinct categories (Eimas, Siqueland, Jusczyk &amp; Vigorito, 1971; Burnham, Earnshaw &amp; Clark, 1991; Aslin, Pisoni, Hennessy &amp; Perey, 1981; Burnham, 1986).

So, it is by no means clear that the perceptual factor of which Tallal speaks is a primary acoustic factor as claimed, rather than a specifically linguistic factor. Pointers to a perceptual basis for reading skills may be gleaned from considering developmental processes in speech perception. Young infants’ astounding abilities to discriminate almost any phonologically-relevant or irrelevant phonetic contrast are well-documented (e.g., Eimas et al., 1971; Streeter, 1976; Best, McRoberts &amp; Sithole, 1988, Burnham et al., 1991; see Burnham, 1986, and Goodman &amp; Nusbaum, 1994 for reviews). This initial speech perception is then modified through processes of attunement (Aslin, Pisoni, Hennessy &amp; Perey, 1981), prototype abstraction for native language phones (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl, Williams, Lacerda, Stevens &amp; Lindblom, 1992), and especially attenuation for non-native phones (Burnham et al., 1991; 576 DENIS BURNHAM Burnham, 1986; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker, Gilbert, Humphrey &amp; Tees, 1981; Werker &amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker, 1994). These processes result in the perceptual reorganisation of initial phonetic classes into</context>

In line with this, an alternative model to Tallal’s (1980) primary perceptual deficit is that there is a secondary perceptual deficit based on subtle differences in the efficiency and accuracy with which children reorganise their speech perception in accord with the specific phonology of their language environment. Additionally we have obtained evidence that phonological categories may also be sharpened by experience with written language. Burnham (1986; Burnham, et al., 1991) investigated English language environment listeners’ ability to perceive two synthetic stop contrasts; one phonologically relevant, and another phonologically irrelevant. Using the Infant Speech Identification method (Burnham, Earnshaw &amp; Quinn, 1987) perceptual ability for each of the two contrasts was tested at 10 months, 21/2 years, 61/2 years, and in adults. Analysis of category boundary sharpness showed perception of the phonologically-relevant [p]–[ph] contrast, perceived as /b/ and /p/ by English speakers, became more categorical with increasing age, especially b</context>

So, it is by no means clear that the perceptual factor of which Tallal speaks is a primary acoustic factor as claimed, rather than a specifically linguistic factor. Pointers to a perceptual basis for reading skills may be gleaned from considering developmental processes in speech perception. Young infants’ astounding abilities to discriminate almost any phonologically-relevant or irrelevant phonetic contrast are well-documented (e.g., Eimas et al., 1971; Streeter, 1976; Best, McRoberts &amp; Sithole, 1988, Burnham et al., 1991; see Burnham, 1986, and Goodman &amp; Nusbaum, 1994 for reviews). This initial speech perception is then modified through processes of attunement (Aslin, Pisoni, Hennessy &amp; Perey, 1981), prototype abstraction for native language phones (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl, Williams, Lacerda, Stevens &amp; Lindblom, 1992), and especially attenuation for non-native phones (Burnham et al., 1991; 576 DENIS BURNHAM Burnham, 1986; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker, Gilbert, Humphrey &amp; Tees, 1981; Werker &amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker, 1994).

In line with this, an alternative model to Tallal’s (1980) primary perceptual deficit is that there is a secondary perceptual deficit based on subtle differences in the efficiency and accuracy with which children reorganise their speech perception in accord with the specific phonology of their language environment. Additionally we have obtained evidence that phonological categories may also be sharpened by experience with written language. Burnham (1986; Burnham, et al., 1991) investigated English language environment listeners’ ability to perceive two synthetic stop contrasts; one phonologically relevant, and another phonologically irrelevant. Using the Infant Speech Identification method (Burnham, Earnshaw &amp; Quinn, 1987) perceptual ability for each of the two contrasts was tested at 10 months, 21/2 years, 61/2 years, and in adults. Analysis of category boundary sharpness showed perception of the phonologically-relevant [p]–[ph] contrast, perceived as /b/ and /p/ by English speakers, became more categorical with increasing age, especially between two and six years</context>

This language specific speech perception, as it may be called, would facilitate the phoneme-to-grapheme mapping process, one of the most difficult tasks in reading acquisition. Based on this reasoning, we may hypothesise that around school age, the degree of language specific speech perception will be positively related to children’s reading ability. The Burnham et al. (1991) results also show significant improvement for the nonnative contrast by adulthood; presumably as a result of reading becoming more automatic, fine-grained phonetic discriminations again are possible. SPEECH PERCEPTION AND READING 577 The two experiments reported here were conducted to investigate this proposed relationship between language specific speech perception and reading. Both experiments concern young children’s perception of phonologically-relevant and phonologically-irrelevant speech contrasts, and their performance on reading-related tests.

Is language specific speech perception a specifically linguistic phenomenon or can it be explained by more general auditory processes? EXPERIMENT 1 The two aims of Experiment 1 are to define the developmental locus of the intensification of language specific speech perception, and to investigate whether it is related to reading ability. Burnham et al. (1991) found a trough in the perception of non-native speech sounds at six years compared with two years and adulthood. As there were wide differences between ages, the locus could not be specified. Here four-, six-, and eight-year-old English language environment children were tested on each of the two contrasts used in our earlier study, the native [p]–[ph] and the non-native [b]–[p] (Burnham et al., 1991). To investigate the relationship with reading ability, children were also given an articulation, a language comprehension, and for the six- and eightyear-olds, a reading test.

The schools and preschool in the area surrounding the university were in a predominantly middle class area. The school reading curriculum used programs that were oriented towards a whole word method but with a degree of phonics instruction incorporated into the program. Apparatus and materials Speech perception test Apparatus for the speech perception test is described in detail in Burnham et al. (1991), and more briefly here. Participants sat facing a large screen painted blue to the left and orange to the right of their midline. The screen housed central attention-getting lights, a central audio speaker through which sounds were presented, and two lateral reinforcement windows each of which could be illuminated to reveal animated toy rabbits. In front of the child were two paddles side-by-side, color-coded to match the two sides of the screen. When one of the two training sounds was presented centrally, pressing the paddle on the side pre-assigned for that sound resulted in reinforcement d</context>

Discussion Burnham et al. (1991) showed that there is a period of increased language specific speech perception some time between 2 years and adulthood. The speech perception results here suggest that this occurs specifically around 6 years. In addition, the results are consistent with the notion that language specific speech perception subsides around 8 years; while categorical perception scores for the native contrast continued to increase from 4 to 6 to 8 years, there was a U-shaped trend for the non-native contrast suggesting that categorical speech perception of the non-native contrast was worse at 6 than 4 or 8 years. </context>

These significant interactions in conjunction with inspection of Figure 3a indicate that the age trend for the non-native contrast was more linear and quadratic than for the native contrast, with a trough centred on the Grade 1 children. These results are similar to the age trends with the synthetic versions of these contrasts in Experiment 1 here, and in Burnham et al. (1991). Alveolar/dental stop voicing contrasts. For the dental voicing contrasts similar results were found. The native contrast was discriminated more easily than the non-native contrast, F(1,189) = 764.55 (Xnative = 0.93, Xnon-native = 0.25); and there were interactions of speech contrast with linear F(1,189) = 45.29, and quadratic age trends F(1,189) = 4.20, MSE = 0.06.

For all three speech contrasts, similar results regarding the locus of language specific speech perception were obtained, in all three a negative relationship with age was found, and in two of the three a relationship between reading and language specific speech perception was obtained. The similar results in Experiments 1 and 2 here and in Burnham et al. (1991) point to the pervasiveness of heightened language specific speech perception following the onset of reading. General discussion Together the results of the two experiments show that language specific speech perception is a specifically linguistic phenomenon, and that heightened language specific speech perception is related to the onset of reading. The nature of language specific speech perception Building upon previous research, the results of Experiment 1 and especially Experiment 2 (see Figure 5) suggest that language specific speech perception is comprised of three components, as follows.</context>

For example, does perceptual assimilation (Best, 1994) operate equivalently at all periods of development, and do particular phonetic characteristics of speech sounds (Burnham, 1986; Stevens &amp; Keyser, 1989) differentially affect perceptual performance in different developmental contexts? The orthographic period uncovered here could be seen to be a further redescription, which is superimposed on the earlier redescription (see Burnham et al., 2002, for elaboration). And like the earlier redescription, there appear to be later vestiges of this. For instance, in auditory phoneme deletion and addition tasks, Tyler and Burnham (2000) found adults had longer reaction times for orthographic interference items, such as WORTH-EARTH – “add /w/ to / θ/” or “delete /w/ from /w θ/”, than for non-interfering items, such as FACT-ACT – “add /f/ to /ækt/” or “delete /f/ from /fækt/” (see also Taft &amp; Hambly, 1985).

Does phonics reading instruction result in greater language specific speech perception than whole word reading instruction? Our arguments above support the use of phonic rather than whole word methods of early reading instruction, because the phonics method should facilitate acquisition of the arbitrary language-specific phoneme-to-grapheme conversion rule conventions. If, as we would predict, children taught with phonics-based methods (see Liberman &amp; Liberman, 1992; Byrne &amp; Fielding-Barnsley, 1993; Schwartz, 1988) show greater language specific speech perception independent of reading ability (Andrews, 1992a, b) than children taught with a whole word method (Goodman &amp; Goodman, 1979; Goodman, 1986), then this would suggest that heightened language specific speech perception is not only a consequence of learning to read, but also an index of reading instruction efficacy.

Subjects were usually tested first on one of the perception tests, then the language tests, and then the other perception test. This order was sometimes modified if the child found the perception test initially daunting. Despite such deviations order of presentation of the native and non-native perception tests was counterbalanced between subjects, as was order within the language tests. The procedure for the QAT, the Bankson, and Reading followed the prescribed published procedures (Kilminister &amp; Laird, 1978; Bankson, 1977; Daniels &amp; Diack, 1974). The procedure for the speech perception tests was identical for the native and non-native contrasts, except that the stimuli, and the random presentation orders of test stimuli differed. Children sat in front of the screen, were told they would hear one of two sounds, and instructed to press one paddle for one sound and the other for the other sound.

Structural modeling with eight- to ten-year-old children revealed the most parsimonious model was one in which speech perception affects phonological awareness, which in turn affects word reading. Similar results have been found with reading disabled adults (Watson &amp; Miller, 1993). Gibbs (1996) found similar but delayed effects at the onset of reading, with speech perception ability at five and six years predicting phonological awareness at six and seven years, respectively. Together these results support the contention that basic speech perception abilities are indeed implicated in reading difficulties via their effect on phonological analysis skills (Wagner et al., 1994).

The output of such perceptual analysis then is redescribed at increasingly complex and abstract levels throughout development (Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995; Karmiloff-Smith, 1991). So, according to Lalonde and Werker, the same phonetic detail is available to infants before and after the six- to nine-month reorganisation period, but during this period there is a redescription of the output from phonetic analysers in order to reflect native speech categories. “The redescription results in a second representation superimposed on the first, leaving the original detail of language-general discrimination intact . . .” (Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995: 472).

The six- and eight-yearolds were also given the Reading test. Subjects were usually tested first on one of the perception tests, then the language tests, and then the other perception test. This order was sometimes modified if the child found the perception test initially daunting. Despite such deviations order of presentation of the native and non-native perception tests was counterbalanced between subjects, as was order within the language tests. The procedure for the QAT, the Bankson, and Reading followed the prescribed published procedures (Kilminister &amp; Laird, 1978; Bankson, 1977; Daniels &amp; Diack, 1974).

Pointers to a perceptual basis for reading skills may be gleaned from considering developmental processes in speech perception. Young infants’ astounding abilities to discriminate almost any phonologically-relevant or irrelevant phonetic contrast are well-documented (e.g., Eimas et al., 1971; Streeter, 1976; Best, McRoberts &amp; Sithole, 1988, Burnham et al., 1991; see Burnham, 1986, and Goodman &amp; Nusbaum, 1994 for reviews). This initial speech perception is then modified through processes of attunement (Aslin, Pisoni, Hennessy &amp; Perey, 1981), prototype abstraction for native language phones (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl, Williams, Lacerda, Stevens &amp; Lindblom, 1992), and especially attenuation for non-native phones (Burnham et al., 1991; 576 DENIS BURNHAM Burnham, 1986; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker, Gilbert, Humphrey &amp; Tees, 1981; Werker &amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker, 1994). These processes result in the perceptual reorganisation of initial phonetic classes into language specific phonological categories around 6 to 9 months (Werker, 1994). Based on such evidence Werker and Tees (1987) suggest that infants’ initial phonetic sensitivities are the building blocks of phonological catego</context>
<context citStr="Kuhl, 1991" endWordPosition="10023" position="64422" startWordPosition="10022"> of Experiment 1 and especially Experiment 2 (see Figure 5) suggest that language specific speech perception is comprised of three components, as follows. There is facilitation of the perception of native speech sounds due to linguistic experience. There is attenuation of the perception of all other sounds, both non-native speech and non-speech. There is additional attenuation of the perception of non-native speech sounds below the normal level of perceptual acuity. These first two processes are evident throughout development, at least after the onset of phonemic speech perception in infancy (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl et al., 1992; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker et al., 1981; Werker &amp; 600 DENIS BURNHAM Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker, 1994), and are certainly evident over the ages studied here. The third process is generally evident over the ages studied here; though around the onset of reading perception of both non-native speech sounds and non-speech sounds are equally and maximally suppressed. This may be described as a floor effect, but it may be more heuristic to characterise this as an efficient strategy whereby incoming sounds are best assigned to orthographically defined catego</context>
<context citStr="Kuhl, 1991" endWordPosition="10523" position="67712" startWordPosition="10522">he extent that the evidence presented here suggests that the additional suppression for non-native speech contrasts is based on their phonetic characteristics rather than any acoustic characteristics they share with non-speech sounds, there is a prima facie argument against the involvement of a lowlevel auditory deficit as a precursor to reading difficulties (Tallal, 1980). SPEECH PERCEPTION AND READING 601 Moreover, it is clear that language specific speech perception is in place in early infancy, and thus is a likely candidate to play a role in the acquisition of later linguistic abilities (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl et al., 1992; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker et al., 1981; Werker &amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker, 1994). Indeed, the results of Experiment 1 here suggest that around 4 years language specific speech perception is related to articulation ability. Nevertheless, there is not yet sufficient evidence to make definitive judgements on this issue; it remains possible that underlying individual differences in speech production, speech perception, general cognitive ability (Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995), and even auditory perception (Tallal, 1980) could contribute to more sharply defined phonological categor</context>

There is facilitation of the perception of native speech sounds due to linguistic experience. There is attenuation of the perception of all other sounds, both non-native speech and non-speech. There is additional attenuation of the perception of non-native speech sounds below the normal level of perceptual acuity. These first two processes are evident throughout development, at least after the onset of phonemic speech perception in infancy (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl et al., 1992; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker et al., 1981; Werker &amp; 600 DENIS BURNHAM Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker, 1994), and are certainly evident over the ages studied here. The third process is generally evident over the ages studied here; though around the onset of reading perception of both non-native speech sounds and non-speech sounds are equally and maximally suppressed. This may be described as a floor effect, but it may be more heuristic to characterise this as an efficient strategy whereby incoming sounds are best assigned to orthographically defined categories if perceptual </context>

SPEECH PERCEPTION AND READING 601 Moreover, it is clear that language specific speech perception is in place in early infancy, and thus is a likely candidate to play a role in the acquisition of later linguistic abilities (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl et al., 1992; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker et al., 1981; Werker &amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker, 1994). Indeed, the results of Experiment 1 here suggest that around 4 years language specific speech perception is related to articulation ability. Nevertheless, there is not yet sufficient evidence to make definitive judgements on this issue; it remains possible that underlying individual differences in speech production, speech perception, general cognitive ability (Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995), and even auditory perception (Tallal, 1980) could contribute to more sharply defined phonological categories in some pre-sch</context>

Thus, there is no sensori-neural loss of speech perception; exposure to a particular language results in perceptual selectivity rather than perceptual loss. In a similar vein, the orthographic language specific speech perception uncovered here is transitory, occurring specifically around the onset of formal language instruction, and relinquishing hold around Grade 2 to Grade 3, possibly due to reading becoming more proficient. Another important similarity between these two periods relates to the work of Lalonde and Werker (1995), who suggest that there is an initial perceptual analysis underlying all speech perception, which is untouched by 602 DENIS BURNHAM specific linguistic experience or general cognitive ability. The output of such perceptual analysis then is redescribed at increasingly complex and abstract levels throughout development (Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995; Karmiloff-Smith, 1991).

Language specific speech perception in infancy and childhood The heightened language specific speech perception uncovered here around reading onset is additional to, and in no way diminishes the importance of the well-documented perceptual reorganisation between 6 and 12 months (Polka &amp; Werker, 1994; Kuhl et al., 1992; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker &amp; Tees,</context>

Is heightened language specific speech perception the result of reading instruction or maturation? The heightened language specific speech perception found here in Experiments 1 and 2 appears to be related to both age and reading ability. It is not yet clear whether ‘reading ability’ relates to the amount of reading instruction, the type of reading instruction, the child’s ability to benefit from reading instruction, pre-reading skills that children bring to school, each child’s ability for graphemic redescription of the speech input, or children’s general cognitive ability (Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995). These need to be investigated in a design in which reading instruction and age are independently manipulated. Such a study is currently being conducted in our laboratory.

Does phonics reading instruction result in greater language specific speech perception than whole word reading instruction? Our arguments above support the use of phonic rather than whole word methods of early reading instruction, because the phonics method should facilitate acquisition of the arbitrary language-specific phoneme-to-grapheme conversion rule conventions. If, as we would predict, children taught with phonics-based methods (see Liberman &amp; Liberman, 1992; Byrne &amp; Fielding-Barnsley, 1993; Schwartz, 1988) show greater language specific speech perception independent of reading ability (Andrews, 1992a, b) than children taught with a whole word method (Goodman &amp; Goodman, 1979; Goodman, 1986), then this would suggest that heightened language specific speech perception is not only a consequence of learning to read, but also an index of reading instruction efficacy.

To investigate this hypothesis it is important that the relationship between speech perception, phonological processing, and reading be investigated, and this will be done here. Research on phonological processing and reading has mostly been conducted independently of speech perception research. In an exception to this McBride-Chang (1996) tested whether speech perception affects reading ability directly, or indirectly via its effect on phonological processing. Structural modeling with eight- to ten-year-old children revealed the most parsimonious model was one in which speech perception affects phonological awareness, which in turn affects word reading. Similar results have been found with reading disabled adults (Watson &amp; Miller, 1993). Gibbs (1996) found similar but delayed effects at the onset of reading, with speech perception ability at five and six years predicting phonological awareness at six and seven years, respectiv</context>

Despite this limitation, the method for converting responses to categorical scores (see Burnham et al., 1991), adequately takes into account single presentations of test stimuli. 2.

Again we can see that the relationship between speech perception and reading begs further enquiry (Werker &amp; Tees, 1987). A possible perceptual factor underlying reading and reading disability is the ability to process rapid changes in acoustic stimuli. Children with specific language impairment have difficulty discriminating speech sound pairs distinguished by rapid frequency changes in formant transitions (consonants), but not pairs of steady-state (vowel) sounds (Tallal &amp; Piercy, 1974; Reed, 1989), or in processing rapid visual stimuli (Reed, 1989). Tallal (1980; Tallal &amp; Piercy, 1973a, b, 1974) suggests that the difficulty lies in discriminating the temporal sequence of rapidly-presented acoustic (not necessarily linguistic) stimuli, i.e., that there is a primary perceptual deficit. There are training studies to support this notion (Tallal, Miller, Bedi, Byma, Wang, Nagarajan, Schreiner, Jenkins &amp; Merzenich, 1996; Merzenich, Jenkins, Johnston, Schreiner, Miller &amp; Tallal, 1996), however, the specific benefit of training on non-speech as opposed to speech stimuli on reading is yet to be</context>

Our arguments above support the use of phonic rather than whole word methods of early reading instruction, because the phonics method should facilitate acquisition of the arbitrary language-specific phoneme-to-grapheme conversion rule conventions. If, as we would predict, children taught with phonics-based methods (see Liberman &amp; Liberman, 1992; Byrne &amp; Fielding-Barnsley, 1993; Schwartz, 1988) show greater language specific speech perception independent of reading ability (Andrews, 1992a, b) than children taught with a whole word method (Goodman &amp; Goodman, 1979; Goodman, 1986), then this would suggest that heightened language specific speech perception is not only a consequence of learning to read, but also an index of reading instruction efficacy. Is heightened language specific speech perception the result of reading instruction or maturation? The heightened language specific speech perception found here in Experiments 1 and 2 appears to be related to both age and reading ability</context>

In this way Lalonde and Werker’s model allows the infant’s ability for redescription to be related to general cognitive abilities, even if underlying phonetic or acoustic abilities are more or less equivalent. This model may be expanded if more were known about how the processes of speech perception interact with other linguistic processes occurring at the time of redescription. For example, does perceptual assimilation (Best, 1994) operate equivalently at all periods of development, and do particular phonetic characteristics of speech sounds (Burnham, 1986; Stevens &amp; Keyser, 1989) differentially affect perceptual performance in different developmental contexts?

This makes good intuitive sense: if particular children are articulating well for their age then it should follow that they have greater perceptual bias towards the speech sounds present in their own language. The direction of causality between speech perception and speech production, or whether causality is uni- or bi-directional (Werker, 1993) cannot be determined here, but it is notable that very few instances of a relationship between children’s speech perception and speech production skills have been reported previously (Zlatin &amp; Koenigsknecht, 1976; Strange &amp; Broen, 1981). The reason that we found a perception-production relationship here may be that we used language specific perceptual bias (N-NN) scores based on two different speech contrasts, rather than perceptual ability on a single task. Further study of the relationship between language specificity in speech perception and speech production is warranted. The regression analysis with just the six- and eight-year-old children, and with reading added, showed that children who are good readers for their age and level of language comprehension are those who manifest greater language specific speech perceptio</context>

So, it is by no means clear that the perceptual factor of which Tallal speaks is a primary acoustic factor as claimed, rather than a specifically linguistic factor. Pointers to a perceptual basis for reading skills may be gleaned from considering developmental processes in speech perception. Young infants’ astounding abilities to discriminate almost any phonologically-relevant or irrelevant phonetic contrast are well-documented (e.g., Eimas et al., 1971; Streeter, 1976; Best, McRoberts &amp; Sithole, 1988, Burnham et al., 1991; see Burnham, 1986, and Goodman &amp; Nusbaum, 1994 for reviews).

Key words: Perceptual re-organisation, Phoneme awareness, Phonemic perception, Reading, Reading instruction, Speech perception Introduction Considerable research has been conducted on the relationship between reading ability and phonological processing abilities in children. Wagner and Torgesen (Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1987; Wagner, Torgesen, Laughton, Simmons &amp; Rashotte, 1993; Wagner, Torgesen &amp; Rashotte, 1994) identified three aspects of phonological processing. These are (a) phonological awareness, consisting of phonological analysis (phoneme segmentation and categorisation tasks) and phonological synthesis (phoneme blending); (b) retrieval of phonological codes from long-term store, either in isolated or serial speeded naming tasks; and (c) phonological recoding to maintain information in working memory (using tasks such as digit span and sentence repetition recall). All three are relatively stable over deve</context>

These are (a) phonological awareness, consisting of phonological analysis (phoneme segmentation and categorisation tasks) and phonological synthesis (phoneme blending); (b) retrieval of phonological codes from long-term store, either in isolated or serial speeded naming tasks; and (c) phonological recoding to maintain information in working memory (using tasks such as digit span and sentence repetition recall). All three are relatively stable over development (Wagner et al., 1993, 1994; Hansen &amp; Bowey, 1994), and related to reading ability.

Wagner and Torgeson (1987; Wagner et al., 1993) support a model in which one underlying ability accounts for phonological analysis and working memory performance, and another for phonological synthesis and performance on retrieval of phonological code tasks. The first is the most important source of individual differences in kindergarten children’s phonological processing and is argued to have a phonological basis, whereby the quality of children’s phonological representations affects their memory span performance (Wagner et al., 1993). This is thus a perceptual primacy hypothesis: if phonological representations are misaligned or degraded (due to inaccurate or imperfect speech perception mechanisms), then phonological awareness and memory span performance will be impaired (Wagner et al., 1993) as will, in turn, reading ability. To investigate this hypothesis it is important that the relationship between speech perception, phonological processing, and reading be investigated, and this will be done here.

The regression analysis with the four-, six-, and eight-year-olds showed that language specific speech perception is positively related to children’s level of articulation ability for age. This makes good intuitive sense: if particular children are articulating well for their age then it should follow that they have greater perceptual bias towards the speech sounds present in their own language. The direction of causality between speech perception and speech production, or whether causality is uni- or bi-directional (Werker, 1993) cannot be determined here, but it is notable that very few instances of a relationship between children’s speech perception and speech production skills have been reported previously (Zlatin &amp; Koenigsknecht, 1976; Strange &amp; Broen, 1981). The reason that we found a perception-production relationship here may be that we used language specific perceptual bias (N-NN) scores based on two different speech contrasts, rather than perceptual ability on a single task. Further study of the relationship between language specificity in speech perception and speech production is warranted. The regression a</context>

This initial speech perception is then modified through processes of attunement (Aslin, Pisoni, Hennessy &amp; Perey, 1981), prototype abstraction for native language phones (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl, Williams, Lacerda, Stevens &amp; Lindblom, 1992), and especially attenuation for non-native phones (Burnham et al., 1991; 576 DENIS BURNHAM Burnham, 1986; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker, Gilbert, Humphrey &amp; Tees, 1981; Werker &amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker, 1994).

There is facilitation of the perception of native speech sounds due to linguistic experience. There is attenuation of the perception of all other sounds, both non-native speech and non-speech. There is additional attenuation of the perception of non-native speech sounds below the normal level of perceptual acuity. These first two processes are evident throughout development, at least after the onset of phonemic speech perception in infancy (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl et al., 1992; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker et al., 1981; Werker &amp; 600 DENIS BURNHAM Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker, 1994), and are certainly evident over the ages studied here.

This is consistent with the notion that reading instruction in an alphabetic language directs perceptual attention to matching graphemes to phonemes, which in turn requires efficient phoneme segmentation, and efficient assignment of allophonic variants to strictly defined phoneme categories. The continued ability to perceive the phonetic characteristics which distinguish native speech phonemes and selectively suppress just those phonetic characteristics which distinguish nonnative speech phones from each other (Werker, 1994; Burnham, 1986), and from similar native phones (Best, 1994), that is, language specific speech perception, would be very useful at this time. What we have found here is that there is heightened language specific speech perception after children begin school, and this is related to the onset of reading. Results here suggest that around reading onset children may adopt a strategy in which perception of all contrasts that are not phonologically relevant is suppressed, while both before and after this time perceptual performance for non-native speech is additionally suppressed.

SPEECH PERCEPTION AND READING 601 Moreover, it is clear that language specific speech perception is in place in early infancy, and thus is a likely candidate to play a role in the acquisition of later linguistic abilities (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl et al., 1992; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker et al., 1981; Werker &amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker, 1994). Indeed, the results of Experiment 1 here suggest that around 4 years language specific speech perception is related to articulation ability. Nevertheless, there is not yet sufficient evidence to make definitive judgements on this issue; it remains possible that underlying individual differences in speech production, speech perception, general cognitive ability (Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995), and even auditory perception (Tallal, 1980) could contribute to more sharply defined phonological categories in some pre-school children than in others.

One main difference between earlier “phonemic” and the later “orthographic” periods (Burnham, Tyler &amp; Horlyck, 2002) is that while in infancy perceptual reorganisation occurs due to the natural ontogenetic processes of perceiving and producing speech, in the later period, heightened language specific speech perception results from the imposition of the “unnatural” requirement to read an alphabetic language.

Werker and colleagues showed that if the ISI in an AX discrimination task is shortened to allow phonetic or acoustic processing (Werker &amp; Tees, 1984b; Werker &amp; Logan, 1985), or if extensive exposure is given (Werker &amp; Logan, 1985), adults can discriminate non-native speech contrasts which under normal circumstances they appear unable to discriminate. Thus, there is no sensori-neural loss of speech perception; exposure to a particular language results in perceptual selectivity rather than perceptual loss.

The 0 msec stimulus was described above. For the –70 msec stimulus, the duration of the low frequency 500 Hz tone was 315 msec and its onset preceded that of the 245 msec 1500 Hz tone by 70 msec, so the total duration of this sound was 315 msec.

For each pair the ISI was 500 msec, employed to ensure that subjects processed sounds at a phonetic level (Werker &amp; Logan, 1985; Werker &amp; Tees, 1984b). Of the 16 pairs in each block, 8 were of the appropriate native contrast and 8 were of the appropriate non-native contrast (positive and negative TOT contrasts respectively for Block D). Within contrasts half (4) were pairs of the same phone (or TOTs) and half (4) were pairs of different phones (or TOTs).

Werker and colleagues showed that if the ISI in an AX discrimination task is shortened to allow phonetic or acoustic processing (Werker &amp; Tees, 1984b; Werker &amp; Logan, 1985), or if extensive exposure is given (Werker &amp; Logan, 1985), adults can discriminate non-native speech contrasts which under normal circumstances they appear unable to discriminate. Thus, there is no sensori-neural loss of speech perception; exposure to a particular language results in perceptual selectivity rather than perceptual loss.

These processes result in the perceptual reorganisation of initial phonetic classes into language specific phonological categories around 6 to 9 months (Werker, 1994). Based on such evidence Werker and Tees (1987) suggest that infants’ initial phonetic sensitivities are the building blocks of phonological categories, and that these categories are then sharpened by experience with oral communication. In line with this, an alternative model to Tallal’s (1980) primary perceptual deficit is that there is a secondary perceptual deficit based on subtle differences in the efficiency and accuracy with which children reorganise their speech perception in accord with the specific phonology of their language environment. Additionally we have obtained evidence that phonological categories may also be sharpened by </context>

Longitudinal studies from preschool through to post-reading age are clearly required. Language specific speech perception in infancy and childhood The heightened language specific speech perception uncovered here around reading onset is additional to, and in no way diminishes the importance of the well-documented perceptual reorganisation between 6 and 12 months (Polka &amp; Werker, 1994; Kuhl et al., 1992; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker &amp; Tees, 1992; Werker, 1994; Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995). One main difference between earlier “phonemic” and the later “orthographic” periods (Burnham, Tyler &amp; Horlyck, 2002) is that while in infancy perceptual reorganisation occurs due to the natural ontogenetic processes of perceiving and producing speech, in the later period, heightened language specific speech perception results from the imposition of the “unnatural” requirement to read an alphabetic language.

There is facilitation of the perception of native speech sounds due to linguistic experience. There is attenuation of the perception of all other sounds, both non-native speech and non-speech. There is additional attenuation of the perception of non-native speech sounds below the normal level of perceptual acuity. These first two processes are evident throughout development, at least after the onset of phonemic speech perception in infancy (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl et al., 1992; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker et al., 1981; Werker &amp; 600 DENIS BURNHAM Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker, 1994), and are certainly evident over the ages studied here. The third process is generally evident over the ages studied here; though around the onset of reading perception of both non-native speech sounds and non-speech sounds are equally and maximally suppressed. This may be described as a floor effect, but it may be more heuristic to characterise this as an efficient strategy whereby incoming sounds are best assigned to orthographically defined categories if perceptual attention to all sounds which are not nati</context>

SPEECH PERCEPTION AND READING 601 Moreover, it is clear that language specific speech perception is in place in early infancy, and thus is a likely candidate to play a role in the acquisition of later linguistic abilities (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl et al., 1992; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker et al., 1981; Werker &amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker, 1994). Indeed, the results of Experiment 1 here suggest that around 4 years language specific speech perception is related to articulation ability. Nevertheless, there is not yet sufficient evidence to make definitive judgements on this issue; it remains possible that underlying individual differences in speech production, speech perception, general cognitive ability (Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995), and even auditory perception (Tallal, 1980) could contribute to more sharply defined phonological categories in some pre-school children than in others.

This makes good intuitive sense: if particular children are articulating well for their age then it should follow that they have greater perceptual bias towards the speech sounds present in their own language. The direction of causality between speech perception and speech production, or whether causality is uni- or bi-directional (Werker, 1993) cannot be determined here, but it is notable that very few instances of a relationship between children’s speech perception and speech production skills have been reported previously (Zlatin &amp; Koenigsknecht, 1976; Strange &amp; Broen, 1981). The reason that we found a perception-production relationship here may be that we used language specific perceptual bias (N-NN) scores based on two different speech contrasts, rather than perceptual ability on a single task. Further study of the relationship between language specificity in speech perception and speech production is warranted. The regression analysis with just the six- and eight-year-old children, and with reading added, showed that children who are good readers for their age and level of language comprehension are those who manifest greater language s</context>
