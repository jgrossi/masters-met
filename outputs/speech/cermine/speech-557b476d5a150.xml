        <p>The present study was to set out in efforts to determine the effect of electrocardiographic (ECG) feedback on the performance in speech anxiety. Forty-six high school students participated in a speech performance educational program. They were randomly divided into two groups, an experimental group with ECG feedback (N = 21) and a control group (N = 25). Feedback was given with video recording in the control, whereas in the experimental group, an additional ECG feedback was provided. Speech performance was evaluated by the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) speech ability test, which determines the 10 different speaking categories. ECG was recorded during rest and speech, together with a video recording of the speech performance. Changes in R-R intervals were used to reflect anxiety profiles. Three trials were performed for 3-week program. Results showed that the subjects with ECG feedback revealed a significant improvement in speech performance and anxiety states, which compared to those in the control group. These findings suggest that visualization of the anxiety profile feedback with ECG can be a better cognitive therapeutic strategy in speech anxiety.</p>

      <p>Speech anxiety is the fear of public speaking. It commonly
presents in delivering a speech that leads to interfere with
social communication. Speech anxiety has been
investigated in the field of communication and psychology. In
language education, assessment of the anxiety state and
developing a new strategy to overcome such state has been
the primary focus. However, because anxiety can affect
speech performance, other academic fields have also
participated in treating speech anxiety (Daly et al. 2009; Pull
2012). For example, anxiety that is caused by the negative
experience-trait anxiety is managed by consultation
psychology. State anxiety, which is caused by similar
circumstance with uncomfortable memory, can be approached
by a different field.</p>
      <p>In educational aspect, known strategies from the fields
of psychology or communication are limited. Even in the
educational program, current etiologies and strategies
(Table 1) do not provide a satisfactory solution to cope
with speech anxiety (Ministry of education, Science and
technology 2009). Phenomenon of speech anxiety is
different from reducing the anxiety. It is not caused by lack of
insight, but from inability to perform despite knowing what
needs to be spoken. ‘Practice the speech as many times as
possible with positive self-suggestion’ may no longer be a
specific strategy. Although there exist methods to which
speech anxiety is assessed, including the observation,
selfreport and measurement of biofeedback, or interview (Kim
1995), overcoming speech anxiety requires further
modalities.

      <p>Bio-signals, such as an electroencephalogram,
electrocardiography, or blood pressure monitoring, can
reflect objective values in the individuals. Most
biosignals have been extensively investigated in medicine,
physiology or engineering. However, lack of
collaborative efforts on bio-signals analysis and feedback
strategies limit us to gain the biological information on
speech anxiety.</p>
      <p>Anxiety is associated with physiological changes, such
as an increase of heart rate, perspiration, muscle tension, or
rapid respiration (Barlow 2001). Anxiety increases
sympathetic discharge in the nervous system. Increased blood
supply to the heart relatively decreases the blood flow in
the digestive system, which results in diarrhea or
constipation (Fox 2008). Since speech anxiety also influences the
autonomic nervous system with physiological responses, it
enables ‘speech anxiety’ that expresses bio-signals, which
reflects the degree of anxiety. An electrocardiogram (ECG)
records periodic electrical activities of the heart. Clinically,
wave abnormalities are frequently used to elucidate cardiac
dysfunction, such as a depressed ‘ST segment’ in patients
with angina (Garcia and Holtz 2003). Variabilities of R–R
intervals have been used to provide heart rate, thus,
subsequently interpreting the autonomic nervous system
during the anxiety status (Sinji 2004; Yang et al. 2009; Jang
et al. 2010).</p>
      <p>The purpose of this present study is to investigate
whether the monitoring of R–R intervals can be a
potential therapeutic strategy. We hypothesized that the
group provided with ECG feedback will show a
significant improvement. We attempted to monitor the real time
measurement of the R–R intervals, with video recording
during speech. As a feedback, R–R interval-based
anxiety profiles were provided together with speech
performance.
They were 46 high school students and all of them were
men. There were more male students with speech anxiety
than that of female students in Korea. The main reason of
the subjects being only male students was to attempt to
exclude the possible bias due to sexual differences.
Recruited subjects were volunteers for a 3-week speech
educational program. This procedure was performed
between May 17 and June 10 of 2011. All the subjects were
able to understand and follow the instructions. They were
allowed to stop or continue the project, during this
program. For the positive control, announcers during training
course (N = 6) were also participated to visualize ECG
anxiety profiles.</p>
      <p>Experimental Protocol
The subjects were divided into two groups. One group was
provided with the speech performance test from Korean
Broadcasting System (KBS) (Kim 2010) with a video
(N = 25). The other group received an additional anxiety
profile from ECG monitoring (N = 21). The difference in
the sample size was due to randomization. Following the
baseline evaluation with KBS speech performance test and
ECG, three performances and feedbacks were given, during

screen. a Speech anxiety profiles were shown on the screen that the
subject can recognize the anxiety part in detail. b Experimental

the 3-week program. To avoid bias from the appearance or
voice of the instructor, instruction and feedbacks were
provided by one researcher who was unaware of the
hypothesis, wearing the same costumes with similar voice
and tone. For the control group, feedback was given by the
video recording of the previous speech performance. In the
experimental group, anxiety profiles by ECG were
displayed simultaneously on the screen (Fig. 1a). Protocols
for the procedure were in compliance with guidelines and
were approved by the institutional review committee of
NECA (National Evidence-based Healthcare Collaborating
Agency). All of the subjects participated voluntarily and
written consent forms were received from their parents.
Speech Performance Test
The subject viewed a 10-min documentary, and was asked
to summarize the content as a three-minuet speech. The
data on speech performance was expressed by the KBS
speech performance score. KBS speech evaluation is
comprised of two testing components, ‘contents’ and
‘expressions’ with 10 categories (five categories
respectively). In brief, for the evaluation of contents, ‘impressive
introduction’, ‘understandable explanation’, ‘emphasis on
the important point,’ ‘organized content’ and ‘effective
summary’ were scored. For the expression ability,
‘appropriateness of semi-verbal language’, ‘adequate
selection of words and grammar’, ‘fluency’, ‘proper use of
non-verbal language’ and ‘effective time arrangement’
were included. Each category was assessed by scores
ranging from 1 to 5 points, and a higher score, indicated a
better performance. Assessment of score was performed by
the trained personnel in KBS, who was not aware of the
experimental protocols. For the performance rating,
multiple raters were involved for the agreement of the
assessment. There were three to nine raters for each
subscale. The averaged scores were used from the raters. The
experimental procedure was done with a computer based
test (CBT) method (Fig. 1b). The speech performance was
recorded, reviewed, and given a score with feedback.
ECG Analysis and Anxiety Profiles
For ECG analysis, the QECG-3 (Quantitative
electrocardiography-three limb lead, LXC3203, Daejeon, Korea)
model was used. Standard three limb leads (lead I, lead II,
lead III) were applied, according to the manufacture’s
recommendation. The ECG electrode sensors were attached to
the subjects at the resting state in a sitting position. Real
time values of R–R intervals were monitored and displayed.
The anxiety score was represented by the mean values of the
R–R interval. Shortening of the R–R interval was interpreted
as activation of sympathetic activity, which indicated greater
levels of anxiety (Fig. 2a). In contrast, a longer R–R interval
represents the decreased activation of sympathetic activity,
reflecting a lesser degree of anxiety (Fig. 2b).</p>

anxiety. Blue line is the R–R intervals of resting state. Red line is the
R–R intervals during speech. It shows that R–R intervals were
shortened immediately after speaking. However, shortened R-R
intervals do not increase until the end of recording. It suggests that
anxiety is not relieved during this testing period. b The graph of
normal subject shows that the R–R intervals were gradually increased
to the point of resting state. c A graph from well-trained announcer.
R–R interval differences are not detected between the rest and the
speech performance, suggesting they do not have the increased level
of anxiety during delivering the speech
The baseline characteristics in the control and the
experimental groups were performed by an independent t test.
Statistical analysis on the effects of feedback was
determined by comparing the groups before and after the
performance, by repeated measures ANOVA. Cohen’s effect
size evaluation was performed to reveal the fold increase in
the R–R interval. For the further analysis of each category,
they were compared by repeated measures ANOVA. The
values were presented as mean ± standard deviation. A
P value below of 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
The R–R Interval and Anxiety
There were changes in ECG between the rest and the
speech. Following the resting state, we observed a
shortening of R–R intervals during speech (Fig. 2).</p>
      <p>The R–R intervals of a subject with severe speech
anxiety showed a difference between the resting state and
the speech state. This difference did not change, thus, there
was no overlap between times until the end of the test
(Fig. 3a). In case of a fluent and a well-trained announcer,
a positive control, showed the overlapping of R–R
intervals, indicating that R–R intervals, during rest and speech,
were not different (Fig. 3c). Most subjects showed an
initial separation of the R–R intervals, which was then
subsequently overlapped as the speech was continued
(Fig. 3b).</p>
      <p>Fig. 4 R–R intervals (ECG anxiety profiles) and speech
performance. Pre- and post-training evaluation of the feedback trial showed
significant improvement in the experimental group. The control group
with repetitive tests also shows an improving tendency, although it
does not reach statistical significance. It indicates that ECG feedback
is more effective in reducing speech anxiety than that of video-alone
in control

The Changes in Speech Anxiety with ECG Profiles
To evaluate the effect of feedback by the speech anxiety
profile, mean values of the R–R interval were analyzed.
During rest, mean R–R interval for the control group was
0.785 ± 0.102 s and 0.722 ± 0.130 s for the experimental
group (t = 1.810; P = 0.077). Before the speech, the R–R
intervals were 0.665 ± 0.112 s (mean ± standard
deviation) for the control and 0.629 ± 0.081 s for the
experimental group, which indicated that there was no difference
(independent t test; t = 1.263, P = 0.213). Following the
three-week feedback trials, the mean value of experimental
group showed to be 0.629 to 0.715, a 0.086 increment
(Fig. 4), whereas the control group revealed the mean value
of R–R intervals to be increased from 0.665 to 0.701, an
increment of 0.036. Repeated measures ANOVA showed
that the R–R intervals of ‘within-subject effects’ showed to
be significantly different (F = 10.678, P = 0.002).
However, between-subject effects (F = 0.214, P = 0.646) and
interactions between the two types of effects were found to
be not significant (F = 1.812, P = 0.185) (Table 2).
Cohen’s effect size between the experimental group and the
control group revealed a post-test value of 0.133, indicating
a onefold increase, whereas that of the pretest was -0.368,
with mean treatment effect size of 0.501.1</p>

Table 5 Improved categories of speech performance following the ECG anxiety profile feedback trial
Changes in Speech Ability by ECG Anxiety Profiles
Before feedback, in ‘impressive introduction’ subscale, the
control group seemed to show a trend of high performance
(t = 1.964, P = 0.057). There was no significant
difference in all the categories between the two groups, on KBS
speech test (Table 3). Following with ECG anxiety
profiles, total score of KBS speech test showed a better
performance. In order to test the difference between ‘pre-’ and
‘post-test,’ both in the control and the experimental groups,
repeated measures ANOVA showed (Table 4) a significant
improvement in the ‘within-subject effects’ (F = 3457.038,
P = 0.000). Although ‘between-subject effects’ was not
significant (F = 2.945, P = 0.093), while the interactions
between the two types of effects were found to be significant
(F = 5.414, P = 0.025). Thus, this indicates that speech
performance was significantly improved in the subjects of
the experimental group.</p>
        <p>In the subscale analysis of KBS speech test (Table 5),
‘effective summarizing ability’ (F = 50.056, P = 0.000),
‘semi-verbal expression ability’ (F = 12.169, P = 0.001),
and ‘non-verbal expression ability’ (F = 8.563, P =
0.005) showed a difference ‘within-subject effects’ in the
experimental group, with significance. In addition,
‘nonverbal expression ability’ also revealed a degree of
significance in the ‘between-subject effects,’ implying that
improvement of speech performance is more effective in
the experimental condition.

Present study was to investigate whether the ECG feedback
can be applied as a potential therapeutic strategy in speech
anxiety. Monitoring of the real time measurement of ECG
and providing the R–R intervals, as a feedback, showed a
better outcome in speech performance.</p>
        <p>ECG provides a time dependant electrophysiological
factors. Since it determines the variable degree of speech
anxiety by R–R intervals, it would be of benefit to detect
the time point when the subject was delivering the speech.</p>
        <p>This technique has advantages over the measurement by
the speech anxiety spectrum or times series analysis. The
difference of this study, when comparing to that of the
previous biofeedback program, is that it provided
visualization process, which used ECG recording. Therefore, the
changes in the R–R intervals enabled the subjects to
monitor their anxiety profiles. Whereas, previously
proposed strategies are ‘as many practice sessions or trials as
possible’ or ‘increase one’s self confidence’, and this study
provided objective bio-signals that allowed the participants
to self-monitor the anxiety state. Visualization of anxiety
profiles, which used medical information, provides an
educational significance as one of cognitive strategy.</p>
        <p>Therefore, recognition of bio-signals and experience of the
recovery point are more effective when compared to that of
the previous video biofeedback program.</p>
        <p>In this study, speech performance was improved to be
determined by the total score of speech test. However, it
did not mean that all the categories of speech showed a
better performance. Further analysis showed that ‘effective
summarizing ability’, ‘semi-verbal expression’, and
‘nonverbal expression ability’ were effective. In particular,
nonverbal expression ability was the most effective with this
method of speech anxiety profiling. There does not seem to
be a difference between ‘contents’ and ‘expression’.</p>
        <p>However, there are limitations that this study did not
take into account. We attempted to start this program with
a group of high school students. All of them were men and
had the same age of 17 years. As an initial study to test this
strategy, it might be reasonable to know the feasibility in a
homogenously educated group. However, effectiveness of
this technique on other age populations or gender was not
determined. Further expansion of study into women and to
other age groups is also warranted. The other possibility to
account for the improvement can be that repeated trial
itself may result in improvement. In this study, feedback
with video alone, which is commonly used for the
treatment of speech anxiety, also showed a trend of
improvement, although it was not significant. Therefore, a better
performance in the experimental group cannot be explained
by the repetition itself. Instead, exploring the most optimal
number of trials also needs to be determined. In addition,
how long the effect can be maintained will be addressed as
well. Further follow-up study is necessary to answer this
question.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, speech anxiety can affect the speech
performance and the associated anxiety can be presented
by the ECG bio-signal, R–R interval. Analysis and the use
of R–R interval, as anxiety profile and visualization, enable
cognitive strategies to cope with speech anxiety.</p>
