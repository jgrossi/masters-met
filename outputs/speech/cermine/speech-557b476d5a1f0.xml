      <abstract>
        <p>In two studies the relationship between the onset of reading and language specific speech perception, the degree to which native speech perception is superior to non-native speech perception, was investigated. In Experiment 1 with children of 4, 6, and 8 years, language specific speech perception occurred maximally at 6 years and was positively related to reading ability for age and language comprehension level. In Experiment 2, with an expanded range of ages and various stimulus and task changes, the relationship between reading and language specific speech perception still held, and maximal language specific speech perception occurred around the onset of reading instruction for three different sets of speech contrasts, but not for a control set of non-speech contrasts. The results show that language specific speech perception is a linguistic rather than an acoustic phenomenon. Results are discussed in terms of early speech perception abilities, experience with oral communication, cognitive ability, reading ability, alphabetic versus logographic languages, phonics versus whole word reading instruction, and the effect of age versus instruction.</p>

      <p>Considerable research has been conducted on the relationship between
reading ability and phonological processing abilities in children. Wagner
and Torgesen (Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1987; Wagner, Torgesen, Laughton,
Simmons &amp; Rashotte, 1993; Wagner, Torgesen &amp; Rashotte, 1994)
identified three aspects of phonological processing. These are (a) phonological
awareness, consisting of phonological analysis (phoneme segmentation and
categorisation tasks) and phonological synthesis (phoneme blending); (b)
retrieval of phonological codes from long-term store, either in isolated or
serial speeded naming tasks; and (c) phonological recoding to maintain
information in working memory (using tasks such as digit span and sentence
repetition recall). All three are relatively stable over development (Wagner
et al., 1993, 1994; Hansen &amp; Bowey, 1994), and related to reading ability.
There is evidence for (a) a causal relationship between phonological
awareness and reading ability (Calfee, Lindamood &amp; Lindamood, 1973; Bradley
&amp; Bryant, 1985; Goswami &amp; Bryant, 1990; Wagner et al., 1994), and for a
reciprocal causal relationship between phonological awareness and reading
(Morais, Cary, Alegria &amp; Bertelson, 1979; Read, Zhang, Nie &amp; Ding, 1986;
Bradley &amp; Bryant, 1978; Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1987, Wagner et al., 1994); (b)
a positive relationship between children’s phonological recoding in lexical
access and their reading ability (Wolf, 1984; Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1987); and
(c) a positive relationship between children’s phonological recoding to
maintain information in working memory and their reading ability (e.g., Mann &amp;
Liberman, 1984; Hansen &amp; Bowey, 1994).</p>
      <p>Are these three aspects of phonological processing different abilities or
imperfect measures of the same underlying ability? Wagner and Torgeson
(1987; Wagner et al., 1993) support a model in which one underlying ability
accounts for phonological analysis and working memory performance, and
another for phonological synthesis and performance on retrieval of
phonological code tasks. The first is the most important source of individual
differences in kindergarten children’s phonological processing and is argued
to have a phonological basis, whereby the quality of children’s phonological
representations affects their memory span performance (Wagner et al., 1993).
This is thus a perceptual primacy hypothesis: if phonological representations
are misaligned or degraded (due to inaccurate or imperfect speech perception
mechanisms), then phonological awareness and memory span performance
will be impaired (Wagner et al., 1993) as will, in turn, reading ability. To
investigate this hypothesis it is important that the relationship between speech
perception, phonological processing, and reading be investigated, and this
will be done here.</p>
      <p>Research on phonological processing and reading has mostly been
conducted independently of speech perception research. In an exception to this
McBride-Chang (1996) tested whether speech perception affects reading
ability directly, or indirectly via its effect on phonological processing.
Structural modeling with eight- to ten-year-old children revealed the most
parsimonious model was one in which speech perception affects phonological
awareness, which in turn affects word reading. Similar results have been
found with reading disabled adults (Watson &amp; Miller, 1993). Gibbs (1996)
found similar but delayed effects at the onset of reading, with speech
perception ability at five and six years predicting phonological awareness at six and
seven years, respectively. Together these results support the contention that
basic speech perception abilities are indeed implicated in reading difficulties
via their effect on phonological analysis skills (Wagner et al., 1994).</p>
      <p>A basic speech perception skill is categorical speech perception in which
stimuli differing along physical continua such as formant transitions or voice
onset time are perceived to belong to distinct categories (Eimas, Siqueland,
Jusczyk &amp; Vigorito, 1971; Burnham, Earnshaw &amp; Clark, 1991; Aslin, Pisoni,
Hennessy &amp; Perey, 1981; Burnham, 1986). A number of studies have shown
that children with reading difficulties produce less sharp category
boundaries than their normal reading counterparts (Brandt &amp; Rosen, 1980, but see
Werker &amp; Tees, 1987; Godfrey, Syrdal-Lasky, Millay &amp; Knox, 1981; Hurford
&amp; Sanders, 1990; Manis, McBride-Chang, Seidenberg, Keating, Doi, Munson
&amp; Petersen, 1997; Joanisse, Manis, Keating &amp; Seidenberg, 2000; Werker &amp;
Tees, 1987). Werker and Tees (1987) take such results to show that
phonological categories are less robust in reading disabled than normal reading
children, and that group differences are functionally significant and especially
evident under stressful conditions (Werker &amp; Tees, 1987; Brady, Shankweiler
&amp; Mann, 1983). However, as to the basis of this difference between disabled
and normal reading, the underlying perceptual cause is as yet uncertain.
Again we can see that the relationship between speech perception and reading
begs further enquiry (Werker &amp; Tees, 1987).</p>
      <p>A possible perceptual factor underlying reading and reading disability is
the ability to process rapid changes in acoustic stimuli. Children with specific
language impairment have difficulty discriminating speech sound pairs
distinguished by rapid frequency changes in formant transitions (consonants), but
not pairs of steady-state (vowel) sounds (Tallal &amp; Piercy, 1974; Reed, 1989),
or in processing rapid visual stimuli (Reed, 1989). Tallal (1980; Tallal &amp;
Piercy, 1973a, b, 1974) suggests that the difficulty lies in discriminating the
temporal sequence of rapidly-presented acoustic (not necessarily linguistic)
stimuli, i.e., that there is a primary perceptual deficit. There are training
studies to support this notion (Tallal, Miller, Bedi, Byma, Wang,
Nagarajan, Schreiner, Jenkins &amp; Merzenich, 1996; Merzenich, Jenkins, Johnston,
Schreiner, Miller &amp; Tallal, 1996), however, the specific benefit of training
on non-speech as opposed to speech stimuli on reading is yet to be
demonstrated, and there is opposing evidence that the difficulty is specifically with
phonological contrasts rather than more general acoustic features (Mody,
Studdert-Kennedy &amp; Brady, 1997). So, it is by no means clear that the
perceptual factor of which Tallal speaks is a primary acoustic factor as claimed,
rather than a specifically linguistic factor.</p>
      <p>Pointers to a perceptual basis for reading skills may be gleaned from
considering developmental processes in speech perception. Young infants’
astounding abilities to discriminate almost any phonologically-relevant or
irrelevant phonetic contrast are well-documented (e.g., Eimas et al., 1971;
Streeter, 1976; Best, McRoberts &amp; Sithole, 1988, Burnham et al., 1991; see
Burnham, 1986, and Goodman &amp; Nusbaum, 1994 for reviews). This initial
speech perception is then modified through processes of attunement (Aslin,
Pisoni, Hennessy &amp; Perey, 1981), prototype abstraction for native language
phones (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl, Williams, Lacerda, Stevens &amp; Lindblom, 1992),
and especially attenuation for non-native phones (Burnham et al., 1991;
Burnham, 1986; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker, Gilbert, Humphrey &amp; Tees,
1981; Werker &amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker, 1994).
These processes result in the perceptual reorganisation of initial phonetic
classes into language specific phonological categories around 6 to 9 months
(Werker, 1994).</p>
      <p>Based on such evidence Werker and Tees (1987) suggest that infants’
initial phonetic sensitivities are the building blocks of phonological
categories, and that these categories are then sharpened by experience with
oral communication. In line with this, an alternative model to Tallal’s (1980)
primary perceptual deficit is that there is a secondary perceptual deficit based
on subtle differences in the efficiency and accuracy with which children
reorganise their speech perception in accord with the specific phonology of their
language environment.</p>
      <p>Additionally we have obtained evidence that phonological categories may
also be sharpened by experience with written language. Burnham (1986;
Burnham, et al., 1991) investigated English language environment listeners’
ability to perceive two synthetic stop contrasts; one phonologically relevant,
and another phonologically irrelevant. Using the Infant Speech Identification
method (Burnham, Earnshaw &amp; Quinn, 1987) perceptual ability for each of
the two contrasts was tested at 10 months, 21/2 years, 61/2 years, and in
adults. Analysis of category boundary sharpness showed perception of the
phonologically-relevant [p]–[ph] contrast, perceived as /b/ and /p/ by English
speakers, became more categorical with increasing age, especially between
two and six years. However, for the phonologically-irrelevant contrast, [b]–
[p], both perceived as /b/ by English speakers, boundary sharpness improved
between infancy and two years, reverted to chance level at six years, and then
improved slightly by adulthood.</p>
      <p>Burnham (1986; Burnham et al., 1991) speculated that the
intensification of language specific speech perception between two and six years
is related to the onset of reading instruction. Encouragement to process
language in terms of separate phonemes, and instruction in
phoneme-tographeme mapping would, it was reasoned, promote speech perception bias
towards phoneme classes of the ambient language and away from
phonologically irrelevant phonetic differences (e.g., [b] versus [p] for English language
environment listeners). This language specific speech perception, as it may
be called, would facilitate the phoneme-to-grapheme mapping process, one
of the most difficult tasks in reading acquisition. Based on this reasoning,
we may hypothesise that around school age, the degree of language specific
speech perception will be positively related to children’s reading ability. The
Burnham et al. (1991) results also show significant improvement for the
nonnative contrast by adulthood; presumably as a result of reading becoming
more automatic, fine-grained phonetic discriminations again are possible.</p>
      <p>The two experiments reported here were conducted to investigate
this proposed relationship between language specific speech perception
and reading. Both experiments concern young children’s perception of
phonologically-relevant and phonologically-irrelevant speech contrasts, and
their performance on reading-related tests. Four questions are investigated.</p>

      <sec id="1-4">
        <title>4. Is language specific speech perception a specifically linguistic pheno</title>
        <p>menon or can it be explained by more general auditory processes?
The two aims of Experiment 1 are to define the developmental locus of
the intensification of language specific speech perception, and to investigate
whether it is related to reading ability. Burnham et al. (1991) found a trough
in the perception of non-native speech sounds at six years compared with two
years and adulthood. As there were wide differences between ages, the locus
could not be specified. Here four-, six-, and eight-year-old English language
environment children were tested on each of the two contrasts used in our
earlier study, the native [p]–[ph] and the non-native [b]–[p] (Burnham et al.,
1991).</p>
        <p>To investigate the relationship with reading ability, children were also
given an articulation, a language comprehension, and for the six- and
eightyear-olds, a reading test. It was expected that language specific speech
perception (given by the perceptual ability for native (N) minus the ability
for non-native (NN) speech contrasts) should occur maximally at six years of
age, and that children’s degree of language specific speech perception should
be positively related to their reading ability.
Thirty-six monolingual native English-speaking predominantly Anglo
background children were tested, 12 four-year-olds (6 boys, 6 girls; X = 4 years
8.01 months, 4–8.01 years hereafter; range = 4–5 to 4–10.9 years), 12
sixyear-olds (6 boys, 6 girls; X = 6–7.98 years; range = 6–5.8 to 6–10.4 years),
and 12 eight-year-olds (5 boys, 7 girls; X = 8–8.27 years; range = 8–5.7 to
8–11 years). (An additional 2 four-year-olds were tested but failed to reach
criterion on the non-native speech discrimination test. All six- and
eight-yearolds completed all tests.) The four-year-old group attended pre-schools and
the six- and eight-year-olds attended schools near the university. The schools
and preschool in the area surrounding the university were in a
predominantly middle class area. The school reading curriculum used programs that
were oriented towards a whole word method but with a degree of phonics
instruction incorporated into the program.
Speech perception test
Apparatus for the speech perception test is described in detail in Burnham et
al. (1991), and more briefly here. Participants sat facing a large screen painted
blue to the left and orange to the right of their midline. The screen housed
central attention-getting lights, a central audio speaker through which sounds
were presented, and two lateral reinforcement windows each of which could
be illuminated to reveal animated toy rabbits. In front of the child were two
paddles side-by-side, color-coded to match the two sides of the screen. When
one of the two training sounds was presented centrally, pressing the paddle on
the side pre-assigned for that sound resulted in reinforcement delivery from
the window on that side, and similarly for the other sound and side. Incorrect
paddle presses were not reinforced.</p>
        <p>Stimulus sounds were synthesised bilabial stop consonants plus the vowel
[a:]. For the native contrast condition the training sounds were
synthesised bilabial stop consonants of 0 msec voice onset time (VOT), [pa:], and
+70 msec VOT, [pha:] (/ba/ and /pa/ in English), and the generalisation test
sounds were these endpoints plus the six intervening sounds at 10 msec
VOT intervals, i.e., bilabial stops with VOTs of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60,
and 70 msec. For the non-native contrast condition the training sounds were
synthesised bilabial stops of 0 msec VOT, [pa:], and –70 msec VOT, [ba:]
(both /ba/ in English), and the generalisation test sounds were these plus
the six intervening sounds at 10 msec VOT intervals, i.e., bilabial stops with
VOTs of 0, –10, –20, –30, –40, –50, –60, and –70 msec. Sounds were played
on an Otari MX5050 reel-to-reel tape recorder through an Acoustics Research
BXi speaker. Each stimulus syllable was 500 msec in duration, and in each
trial 10 repetitions of each syllable were presented with 250 msecs of silence
between repetitions. Thus each trial was of 7.5 secs duration.
Language tests
The Queensland Articulation Test (Kilminister &amp; Laird, 1978), the Bankson
Language Screening Test (Bankson, 1977), and the Daniels and Diack
Reading Test Number 1 (Daniels &amp; Diack, 1974) were used. The
Queensland Articulation Test (QAT hereafter) is a 64-item Australian language
test similar to the Edinburgh Articulation Test, in which subjects are asked
to name pictured objects. The items are designed such that all English
language consonants are tested in initial, medial and final positions with
appropriate phonotactic constraints ([h] initial only, [ ] medial and final
only, [w], [ ], and [j] initial and medial only, and [ ] medial only).
Productions are scored as correct or incorrect with a possible total of 64.
Children were tested on a subset of the 39 most discriminating items of the
Bankson Language Screening Test (Bankson hereafter), including items to
test syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic understanding (Bankson, 1977). Each
item was scored as correct or incorrect with a possible total of 39. Six- and
eight-year-olds, but not four-year-olds, were also given the Daniels and Diack
Reading Test Number 1 (Reading hereafter), consisting of 36 items which
become progressively more difficult. Children are required to read the items
aloud and continue until they make errors on three consecutive items. Items 1
to 26 require a yes/no answer, the answer being recorded simply to maintain
the child’s interest, and each item is awarded 3 points if no reading errors
occur. The remaining items are questions with four multiple-choice answers,
with one point given if the question is read correctly and one for each of the
4 alternatives read correctly. The maximum possible score is 128.
All subjects were given the native contrast perception test, the non-native
contrast perception test, the QAT, and the Bankson. The six- and
eight-yearolds were also given the Reading test. Subjects were usually tested first on one
of the perception tests, then the language tests, and then the other perception
test. This order was sometimes modified if the child found the perception test
initially daunting. Despite such deviations order of presentation of the native
and non-native perception tests was counterbalanced between subjects, as was
order within the language tests. The procedure for the QAT, the Bankson, and
Reading followed the prescribed published procedures (Kilminister &amp; Laird,
1978; Bankson, 1977; Daniels &amp; Diack, 1974).</p>
        <p>The procedure for the speech perception tests was identical for the native
and non-native contrasts, except that the stimuli, and the random presentation
orders of test stimuli differed. Children sat in front of the screen, were told
they would hear one of two sounds, and instructed to press one paddle for
one sound and the other for the other sound. For example, the child was told
“When you hear the ‘ba’ sound press this blue paddle here (on the left) and
when you hear the ‘pa’ sound press this orange paddle here (on the right)”.
Similar instructions were given for the non-native contrast with the prevoicing
in the –70 msec stimulus being pronounced “mba”. The consequences of
pressing the correct paddle (reinforcement by animated bunny) were
demonstrated. Children were told to use only one hand to press the paddles, and
instructed to keep the agreed-upon hand on the table on an
appropriatelysized red handprint until the stimulus sound began, with the other hand kept
under the table. One experimenter stayed next to the child for the initial part
of training. For the six- and eight-year-olds the experimenter then retired but
for the four-year-olds the experimenter remained to monitor performance and
maintain the child’s interest.</p>
        <p>In the initial period, reinforced training with randomly-presented end point
sounds continued until at least three unprompted correct paddle presses to
each side occurred. Then any three consecutive correct responses to the
randomly-presented endpoints was followed by an unreinforced
generalisation test trial in which one of the eight possible test sounds was presented.
After each test trial children returned to reinforced training until a further
three consecutive correct responses occurred. Reinforcement was given for
correct training trials but no reinforcement was given in test trials. Testing
continued until all eight test trials had been presented once.1</p>
        <p>The time taken to complete the tests varied with age. The four-year-olds
required two testing sessions totalling around 1.5 hours. This included short
breaks if required by the child. The six- and eight-year-olds completed the
tests in a single session of between 50 and 75 minutes.
Each of the eight native contrast test sound responses were scored as
appropriate for the 0 msec VOT or the +70 msec VOT endpoint; and the 8
non-native contrast test sound responses as appropriate for the 0 msec or the
–70 msec VOT endpoint. Group identification curves are shown in Figure 1.
The native contrast identification functions appear to become progressively
steeper over age, whereas those for the non-native contrast appear to slope in
the appropriate direction for the four-year-olds, give way to a flatter function
at 6 years, followed by a more appropriately sloped curve at 8 years.</p>
        <p>Individuals’ patterns of responses on the native and on the non-native
contrast were converted to categorical perception scores via a method, which
is affective with small numbers of test responses, unlike methods such as d or
logistic functions (Burnham et al., 1991). To derive these categorical scores,
each individual’s pattern of responses for the 8 test trials are compared with
7 ideal categorical curves constructed with sharp crossovers between the two
response types (“ba” versus “pa” for the native, and “ba” versus “mba” for
the non-native speech perception tests). These 7 curves use the narrowest
possible VOT width here (10 msec), with category crossover centered on 5,
15, 25, 35, 45, 55, or 65 msec VOT (positive for the native, and negative for
the non-native contrast). Once the best fit is found, then the closeness of fit
is determined by a method similar to testing planned contrasts in an analysis
of variance. The resultant degree of fit, between –1 and +1, measures the
sharpness of the individual’s pattern of responses, and provides individual
categorical scores for each participant to be used in group analyses.</p>
        <p>Mean categorical scores are plotted in Figure 2. An age × speech contrast,
3 × (2) analysis of variance with repeated measures on speech contrast
revealed significantly higher categorical perception scores on the native (X =
0.91) than the non-native (X = 0.48) contrasts, F(1,33) = 24.00, Mean Square
Error (MSE) = 0.15. The overall speech contrast × age effect was not
significant, nor was speech contrast × linear age trend, F(1,33) = 1.46, P &gt; 0.05,
MSE = 0.15, or the speech contrast × quadratic age trend, F(1,33) = 3.06, P &lt;
0.10, MSE = 0.15, despite the suggestion in Figure 2 of a quadratic U-shaped
component centred on 6 years for the non-native native contrast.</p>

better than six-year-olds, F(1,22) = 24.91, MSE = 365.18.</p>
          <p>Relationship between speech perception and language tests
Burnham et al. (1991) found that at 6 versus 2 years of age there was
a significant reduction of scores for a non-native speech contrast, despite
continued improvement for a similar native contrast, and that this difference
decreased by adulthood. In that experiment native and non-native contrasts
was a between subject factor, and here it was deliberately made within
subjects, to allow correlations and regression analyses. Each subject’s
nonnative contrast categorical score was subtracted from their native categorical
score, (N-NN), as a measure of language specific speech perception. Initial
exploratory correlations of the native, non-native, and (N-NN) scores with
age and QAT, Bankson, and Reading scores revealed an interesting complex
of results. Age was positively correlated with both native and non-native
scores (r = 0.20, 0.21, respectively) but negatively correlated with (N-NN)
scores (r = –0.15). On the other hand all the language tests were positively
correlated with native, negatively correlated with non-native, and positively
correlated with (N-NN) scores (r = 0.08, –0.01, and 0.03 respectively for
QAT; 0.11, –0.17, and 0.18 for Bankson; and 0.29, –0.10, and 0.16 for
Reading). While the magnitude of some of these is negligible, the pattern
of results suggests that N-NN scores may be tapping something different
than either native or non-native scores alone. This is not inconsistent with
our notion that N-NN should measure language specific speech perception,
independently of native and non-native scores. Accordingly, the scores for
the three language tests and subjects’ exact ages were regressed onto the
NNN language specific speech perception scores. Two separate analyses were
conducted, one with all subjects in which the reading scores were omitted,
and one for just the six- and eight-year-olds in which reading scores were
included.</p>
          <p>The regression with all subjects was significant R2 = 0.29, F(3,32) = 4.42,
P &lt; 0.01, MSE = 0.27, and the regression equation was (N-NN) = 0.48 QAT
+ 0.38 Bankson – 0.79 Age. F to enter or remove was significant for the QAT,
F(1,32) = 7.17, P = 0.01 and Age, F(1,32) = 10.82, P = 0.002, but not the
Bankson, F(1,32) = 2.91, P = 0.01. Dividing each coefficient by the highest
coefficient and rounding the resultant coefficient to +1, 0 or –1 is a way to
simplify the regression equation to facilitate meaningful verbal descriptions
(DeSarbo, Hausman, Shen &amp; Thompson, 1982; Harris, 1985). Using this
method the resultant equation is (N-NN) = QAT – Age. This, along with the
significance tests shows that language specific speech perception is highest in
those participants with relatively good articulation ability for their age.</p>
          <p>The regression which included Reading scores conducted with just the
sixand eight-year-olds was significant, R2 = 0.53, F(4,19) = 5.34, P &lt; 0.005,
MSE = 0.216, and the regression equation was (N-NN) = 0.88 Reading +
0.23 QAT – 0.90 Age – 0.49 Bankson. F to enter or remove were significant
for Reading, F(1,19) = 9.02, P = 0.01, Age F(1,19) = 13.34, P = 0.002, and
Bankson F(1,19) = 4.36, P = 0.05, but not for QAT, F(1,19) = 1.95, P = 0.18.
The simplified regression equation, (N-NN) = Reading – Age – Bankson, and
the significance tests can be interpreted to show that language specific speech
perception is highest in those participants with relatively good reading ability
for their age and level of language comprehension.
Burnham et al. (1991) showed that there is a period of increased language
specific speech perception some time between 2 years and adulthood. The
speech perception results here suggest that this occurs specifically around 6
years. In addition, the results are consistent with the notion that language
specific speech perception subsides around 8 years; while categorical
perception scores for the native contrast continued to increase from 4 to 6 to 8
years, there was a U-shaped trend for the non-native contrast suggesting that
categorical speech perception of the non-native contrast was worse at 6 than 4
or 8 years. However, this should be interpreted cautiously, as while a similar
quadratic trend component was significant in Burnham et al. (1991), it was
not here. This effect here may have been ameliorated for two possible reasons.
Firstly, the categorical scores here were generally high (see Figure 2) relative
to those in Burnham et al. (1991; see Figure 2 there), possibly because in
the earlier study children were simply told they would hear two sounds and
left to deduce the sound/button-press contingencies themselves, whereas here
more specific phonologically-relevant labels for the speech sounds were given
to reduce test duration, and allow the other language tests to be completed.
These generally higher scores here may have reduced any potential quadratic
trend. A second possibility is that the ages 4, 6, and 8 years represent the
trough of a broader dip in non-native speech perception performance, and that
if younger and older ages are included this trend may become more evident.
To investigate this, finer gradations and a wider range of ages are used in
Experiment 2, and power is increased by more than doubling subject numbers
in each age group. So the first aim of this study has been only partly realised
– it appears that the locus of the intensification of post-infancy language
specific speech perception occurs around 6 years, i.e., around the onset of
reading, but further evidence is required.</p>
          <p>The regression analysis with the four-, six-, and eight-year-olds showed
that language specific speech perception is positively related to children’s
level of articulation ability for age. This makes good intuitive sense: if
particular children are articulating well for their age then it should follow that they
have greater perceptual bias towards the speech sounds present in their own
language. The direction of causality between speech perception and speech
production, or whether causality is uni- or bi-directional (Werker, 1993)
cannot be determined here, but it is notable that very few instances of a
relationship between children’s speech perception and speech production skills
have been reported previously (Zlatin &amp; Koenigsknecht, 1976; Strange &amp;
Broen, 1981). The reason that we found a perception-production relationship
here may be that we used language specific perceptual bias (N-NN) scores
based on two different speech contrasts, rather than perceptual ability on a
single task. Further study of the relationship between language specificity in
speech perception and speech production is warranted.</p>
          <p>The regression analysis with just the six- and eight-year-old children, and
with reading added, showed that children who are good readers for their age
and level of language comprehension are those who manifest greater language
specific speech perception. (Articulation ability was no longer a significant
predictor, suggesting that after the onset of reading instruction, reading is
a more powerful predictor of language specific speech perception than is
articulation.) Again the regression solution makes sense intuitively. Children
who have high language specific speech perception should have a good
grasp of the phoneme-to-grapheme conversion rules involved in reading, and
should be able to apply these rules to unfamiliar words. In addition, such
children should have a good grasp of which phonetic variations signal
phonological differences in their language and which are simply allophones of
a native language phoneme class. Again the direction of causality cannot
be determined here, though either causal direction would appear intuitively
feasible.
Experiment 2 has four aims, all related to the language specific speech
perception found in Experiment 1. To investigate the developmental locus
of the intensification of language specific speech perception in a more
fine-grained manner, a wider range of ages was included. Children at the
beginning of their first year of school (called ‘Kindergarten’ year in Sydney
schools), children at the end of their Kindergarten year, and children in
subsequent years, Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4, as well as a control group of adults
were tested. Power is also greatly improved with 28 subjects per group here
compared with 12 per group in Experiment 1.</p>
          <p>To investigate the relationship between language specific speech
perception and reading, measures of phonological segmentation and reading ability
were included.</p>
          <p>Regarding the nature of language specific speech perception it is unclear
from the results of Experiment 1 whether language specific speech perception
involves a bias towards native as opposed to non-native speech sounds, or a
bias towards familiar (native) sounds and away from all unfamiliar sounds,
be they non-native speech or even non-speech. To evaluate this, non-speech
analogues of voicing contrasts, tone onset time (TOT) stimuli, were included.
If performance on non-native contrasts were to be attenuated for six-year-olds
below the level of these non-speech TOT sounds then the bias could be said
to be specifically phonological.</p>
          <p>To investigate the generalisability of the results of Experiment 1, three
changes were made. Firstly, naturally-produced as opposed to synthetic
syllables were used. Secondly, perception of two additional speech contrasts
was tested. And thirdly, a different method, discrimination rather than
identification was used. If such changes do not affect the basic relationship
between speech perception and reading ability found in Experiment 1, then
we can conclude that this relationship is robust.
A total of 196 monolingual English speakers from the same pool as in
Experiment 1 were tested, six groups of 28 children and one group of 28
adults, with 14 males and 14 females in each group. Children were tested
in schools close to the university. The youngest group of children (Young
Kindergarten; X age = 5–4.46 years, range = 4–2 to 5–10 years) were in their
first year of schooling and tested in April, close to the start of the school
year. The Australian school year begins in early February, so these children
had approximately 2 months of schooling at the time of testing. The second
(Kindergarten) group of children were also in the preparatory kindergarten
class but were tested late the previous school year (December). Allowing for
school holidays, they had had approximately 8 months of schooling, and their
X age was 5–9.75 years (range = 5–0 to 6–8 years). The remaining four child
groups were taken from Grades 1, 2, 3 and 4 and were tested in the first
half of the school year, giving them approximately 1–3, 2–3, 3–3, and 4–3
years of schooling respectively. Their mean ages were respectively 6–6.54
years (range = 5–8 to 7–4 years); 7–6.43 years (range = 6–10 to 8–5 years),
8–5.96 years (range = 7–8 to 9–3 years) and 9–5.93 years (range = 8–7 to
10–4 years). The adults were university students (with at least 13 years of
schooling), and their mean age was 23–7.44 years (range = 17 to 41 years;
sd = 6.11 months).</p>
          <p>Speech perception tests
An AX discrimination paradigm, in which pairs of sounds were presented
for same/different judgements, was used. To ensure that children understood
the meanings of “same” and “different” visual training materials, a card with
two identical side-by-side red squares (“same”) and a card with a red square
and a blue square side-by-side (“different”), and cards of nonsense animals
which differed in the number of legs, type of neck and patterning on the body
were used. Some animal cards showed two identical animals (“same”), others
showed very different pairs (“different”), and yet others showed slightly
different pairs (“just a little bit different but still different”).</p>
          <p>There were five blocks of trials, and in all five the interstimulus interval
(ISI) between the offset of sound 1 and the onset of sound 2 was 500-msec.
Participants were required to report whether the two sounds were the “same”
or “different”. Stimulus sounds were recorded from a master tape on an
Otari MX5050 reel-to-reel tape recorder with Ampex 631 tape onto TDK
SA (Type II) cassette tapes. A Marantz portable cassette recorder was used to
present the sounds.</p>
          <p>There were three blocks of speech sound stimuli, one block of
nonspeech stimuli, and an auditory post-test block, always presented last. The
three speech sound blocks consisted of natural speech tokens of consonants
paired with the [a:] vowel. Each of these three speech sound blocks contained
two speech contrasts: one which was phonologically-relevant for English
language environment listeners (produced by a male native English speaker)
and one which was phonologically irrelevant for English language listeners
(produced by a male native Hindi speaker). The productions of the English
and Hindi speaker were selected and edited to ensure that intonation contour,
pitch, and duration of the tokens were perceptually equivalent via initial
screening by a panel of experienced judges, and further acoustic screening
with a speech editor. Two different tokens of each phone were used to ensure
acoustic variability, while maintaining phonetic identity. Sounds used in the
five blocks are described below and acoustic and phonetic details of native
and non-native sounds are given in Appendix 1A, 1B, and 1C for blocks A,
B, and C, respectively.</p>
          <p>Block A – bilabial voicing contrasts. Native – voiceless unaspirated [pa:]
vs voiceless aspirated [pha:] bilabial stops: This contrast is
phonologicallyrelevant in both Hindi and English. The two sounds are categorised by English
speakers as the phonemes /b/ and /p/. Non-native – voiced [ba:] vs voiceless
[pa:] unaspirated bilabial stops: This contrast is relevant in Hindi but English
listeners categorise both as /b/.</p>
          <p>Block B – alveolar/dental voicing contrasts. Native – voiceless unaspirated
[ta:] vs voiceless aspirated [tha:] alveolar/dental stops: This contrast is
phonologically relevant in both Hindi and English. The sounds are
categorised as /d/ and /t/ in English. Non-native – breathy prevoiced [dha:] vs
aspirated voiceless [tha:] alveolar/dental stops: This contrast is
phonologically relevant in Hindi but in English both sounds tend to be categorised as
/t/.</p>
          <p>Block C – place contrasts. Native – bilabial [pha:] vs alveolar/dental [tha:]
voiceless stops: This contrast is phonologically-relevant in both Hindi and
English, being represented in the latter by the phonemes /p/ and /t/.
Nonnative – unvoiced unaspirated dental [ a:] vs unvoiced unaspirated retroflex
[ a:] stops: This Hindi contrast is not phonologically relevant in English, with
both tending to be categorised by English language listeners as /d/.
Block D – non-speech (TOT) analogues of voicing contrasts. This block
consisted of tone onset time (TOT) stimuli, considered to be non-speech
analogues of VOT contrasts because they are composed of a high frequency
(1500 Hz) component modelled on the high frequency broad-band burst
in stop consonants and a low frequency (500 Hz) component modelled on
the low frequency voice bar in stop consonants (Pisoni, 1977); and because
they tend to be perceived categorically by adults (Pisoni, 1977) and infants
(Jusczyk, Pisoni, Walley &amp; Murray, 1980).2 Positive TOT Contrast, 0 msec vs
+70 msec TOT: These sounds are used as analogues of voiceless unaspirated
0 msec and voiceless aspirated +70 msec VOT stop consonant contrasts (see
native voicing contrasts, Block A and B above). For the 0 msec stimulus,
onset of the two sinusoidal tones, one of 500 Hz, and another 1500 Hz,
was simultaneous and each lasted for 245 msec. For the +70 msec stimulus,
the duration of the 500 Hz tone was 245 msec, and its onset preceded the
175 msec 1500 Hz tone by 70 msec. In both stimulus sounds the offset of
the two tones was simultaneous, with the total duration of each stimulus
being 245 msec. Negative TOT Contrast, 0 msec vs –70 msec TOT: These
sounds are used as analogues of 0 msec voiceless unaspirated and –70 msec
voiced unaspirated VOT stops (see non-native voicing contrasts in Blocks
A, B above). The 0 msec stimulus was described above. For the –70 msec
stimulus, the duration of the low frequency 500 Hz tone was 315 msec and
its onset preceded that of the 245 msec 1500 Hz tone by 70 msec, so the total
duration of this sound was 315 msec.</p>
          <p>Block structure. In blocks A, B, C and D, 16 AX pairs were presented. For
each pair the ISI was 500 msec, employed to ensure that subjects processed
sounds at a phonetic level (Werker &amp; Logan, 1985; Werker &amp; Tees, 1984b).
Of the 16 pairs in each block, 8 were of the appropriate native contrast and
8 were of the appropriate non-native contrast (positive and negative TOT
contrasts respectively for Block D). Within contrasts half (4) were pairs of the
same phone (or TOTs) and half (4) were pairs of different phones (or TOTs).
For the same pairs half (2) were the same phones (or TOTs) for one member
of the contrast (AA pairs) and half (2) were the same phones (or TOTs) for
the other member of the contrast (BB pairs). For “same” pairs in Blocks A,
B, and C different tokens of the same phone were used to ensure acoustic but
not phonetic variability. For the different pairs half (2) were presented in each
order (AB or BA) and within each order the tokens of each phone type varied
across trials.
Auditory post-test. To ensure that children were applying the same/different
labels correctly and that their hearing was adequate, a series of eight AX pairs
of harmonic tones was presented at the end of the four test blocks. There was
a high harmonic tone (based on 1500 Hz), and a low harmonic tone (based
on 500 Hz). Four of the AX trials were same stimuli (two low-low and two
high-high pairs) and 4 were different (high-low pairs with counterbalanced
order).</p>
          <p>Phoneme segmentation test
The phoneme segmentation test consisted of 24 items in which the targeted
phoneme occurred either initially or finally, and as a singleton or in a cluster,
such that there were 6 items in each initial/final × singleton/cluster subgroup.
Two versions of the test were given: a receptive deletion task and a productive
identification task. In the former, children were told for example, “Say ‘ice’
without the /s/ sound”. In the latter they were asked, “What sound is in ‘ice’
but not in ‘eye’?”. Six practice items were given.
Each child was tested individually in a quiet room at their school. Children sat
on a small chair at a table facing the experimenter. Each child was the given
speech perception, phoneme segmentation, and reading tests with order of
presentation counterbalanced between subjects. Children mostly completed
all tests in one sitting ranging between 40 and 50 minutes. Breaks were given
when the child required them and one experimenter gave the speech tests and
another the reading and phoneme segmentation tests to provide some variety.
The adults were only given the speech perception tests.</p>
          <p>Speech perception test
Training with the visual same/different training materials always occurred
first. Children were shown one card with two red squares and one with a blue
and red square and asked to identify which was “same” and “different”. These
were then put face up on the table, one on each side of the child. Children
were then asked to place pairs of nonsense animals in the “same” or the
“different” pile. When the child categorized the animals correctly they then
proceeded to the four auditory blocks with order of block presentation
counterbalanced between subjects. At the end of each block two more nonsense
animal pairs (one same, one different) were presented to ensure continued
understanding. Following the fourth block, the auditory post-test was given.
Subjects were excluded from later analysis if they did not score at least 6
correct on the 8 items in the auditory post-test. Adults were tested in a similar
fashion except that the same/different training materials were not used.
Phoneme segmentation test
Children were first presented with the six practice items, and did not proceed
to the test items until they had responded correctly to at least 5 of these, and/or
until the experimenter considered that the child understood the task. Half of
the children in each age group were given the receptive deletion form and half
were given the productive identification form of the task.</p>
          <p>Intelligence
For the purpose of accounting for variability in regression analyses, each child
was given an estimate of general intelligence by their teacher. This was a
simple coarse-grained measure of “Above Average”, “Average” or “Below
Average”, and these were converted to scores of 3, 2 and 1 respectively. More
detailed intelligence tests could not be given due to the policy of the schools
that participated in the study.</p>
          <p>Scoring
For the speech perception test discriminative index (DI) scores were
calculated, given by DI = (Correct ‘Different’ responses on Different Trials “Hits”
– Incorrect ‘Different’ responses on Same Trials “False Positives”)/(Number
of Different (AB + BA) trials), with a denominator of 4 for all contrasts. Eight
such DI scores were calculated for each subject: a native and the non-native
score for Blocks A, B, and C, and an index each for the positive TOT contrast
and the negative TOT contrast in Block D. The maximum DI score is 1 and
chance level is 0.3</p>
          <p>Items in the phoneme segmentation test were scored as correct or incorrect
with a possible maximum of 24. For the reading test the scoring protocol
given by Daniels and Diack (1974), with a maximum possible score of 128
was used. Both phoneme segmentation and reading scores were converted to
percentages.
Preliminary analysis revealed that there were no significant differences in DI
scores as a function of order of block presentation, F(3,168) = 0.52, MSE =
1.133. Mean DIs for each of the four sets of two contrasts are plotted against
age in Figures 3a, b, c, and d, and were analysed by planned contrasts in
an age × (speech contrasts × native/non-native), 7 × (4 × 2) analysis of
variance with repeated measures on the speech contrast and native/non-native
factors.</p>
          <p>Bilabial stop voicing contrasts. For the bilabial stop voicing contrasts the
native contrast was more easily discriminated than the non-native contrast,
F(1,189) = 750.18, MSE = 0.06 (Xnative = 0.91, Xnon-native = 0.24). There was
a significant interaction of native versus non-native contrasts with the linear
age trend, F(1,189) = 24.73, and of native versus non-native contrasts with
the quadratic age trend, F(1,189) = 22.99, MSE = 0.06. These significant
interactions in conjunction with inspection of Figure 3a indicate that the age
trend for the non-native contrast was more linear and quadratic than for the
native contrast, with a trough centred on the Grade 1 children. These results
are similar to the age trends with the synthetic versions of these contrasts in
Experiment 1 here, and in Burnham et al. (1991).</p>
          <p>Alveolar/dental stop voicing contrasts. For the dental voicing contrasts
similar results were found. The native contrast was discriminated more easily
than the non-native contrast, F(1,189) = 764.55 (Xnative = 0.93, Xnon-native =
0.25); and there were interactions of speech contrast with linear F(1,189) =
45.29, and quadratic age trends F(1,189) = 4.20, MSE = 0.06. Consideration
of Figure 3b indicates that, as for the bilabial voicing contrasts, the age trend
for the non-native contrast was more linear and more quadratic than for the
native contrast. The quadratic trough here seems more focussed than for the
bilabials and is centred on the Kindergarten group.</p>
          <p>Place contrasts. Similar results were also found for the place contrasts. The
native contrast was discriminated more easily than the non-native contrast,
F(1,189) = 326.36, MSE = 0.07 (Xnative = 0.89, Xnon-native = 0.42), though
the native / non-native difference was not as great here as for the bilabial and
alveolar stop consonants, F(1,189) = 44.45, MSE = 0.06, especially for the
adults, F(1,189) = 4.15. Figure 3c, in conjunction with the significant contrast
× linear age interaction, F(1,189) = 41.63, MSE = 0.07, and the significant
contrast × quadratic age interaction F(1,189) = 5.38, MSE = 0.07, shows that
the trend for the non-native contrasts is both more linear and more quadratic
with a trough centred on the Kindergarten group.</p>
          <p>Non-speech contrasts. In contrast to the results for the speech contrasts, there
was no significant difference in discrimination ability for the positive and
negative TOT contrast, F(1,189) = 1.34, MSE = 0.07 (Xpositive = .38, Xnegative
= .35), and no significant difference between the quadratic age trends for the
two contrasts, F(1,189) = 0.09, MSE = 0.07, both showing a trough centred
on Kindergarten (see Figure 3d). However, there was a difference in the linear
component of the age trends, with the age trend for the negative TOT contrast
being flatter than that for the positive TOT contrast, F(1,189) = 11.53, MSE =
0.069 (see Figure 3d).4
Speech vs non-speech differences. The results for the three sets of speech
contrasts were strikingly similar, and quite different to those for the
nonspeech contrasts. Language specific speech perception measured by (N-NN)
scores generally peaked around the end of Kindergarten year / start of Grade 1
though there was a significant bilabial/alveolar × native/non-native ×
quadratic age trend, F(1,189) = 4.64, MSE = 0.05, reflecting slightly different
peaks for the bilabial and alveolar contrast sets (see Figure 4). This
relatively common peak in (N-NN) scores presumably reflects children’s focus
on native language sounds as a function of age or schooling, although it
is possible that this peak may be a product of some acoustic quirk of
the particular native and non-native sounds we used. If this were indeed
the case, then speech analogue sounds with similar acoustic characteristics
should show a similar “language specific” peak. To investigate this,
(NNN) language specific speech perception scores were calculated for each
subject for the three speech contrasts, along with positive minus negative</p>
          <p>Young K Kinder Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4
(P-N) TOT native bias scores.5 The resultant mean native bias scores for
speech contrasts were significantly greater than the positive TOT (P-N)
bias scores, F(1,189) = 339.79, MSE = 0.07 (see Figure 4), and while the
speech (N-NN) showed a peak in the early years of schooling, the TOT
(P-N) scores showed no such peak, Fspeech/non-speech×linear age(1,189) = 59.81,
Fspeech/non-speech×quadratic age(1,189) = 7.19, MSE = 0.07. These results strongly
support the notion that there is an accentuation of language specific speech
perception around late kindergarten to Grade 1, and that this is specifically
due to the phonological relevance of the speech contrasts, rather than any
particular acoustic characteristics.</p>
          <p>Phoneme segmentation and reading tests
Percent correct phoneme segmentation and reading scores are shown in
Table 2. For the phoneme segmentation scores, there was a general increase
over age, Flinear(1,144) = 179.23, a general levelling out in Years 1, 2, 3,
and 4, Fquadratic(1,144) = 30.89, and sharper rises at earlier (Young
Kindergarten to Year 1) and later (Year 3 to Year 4) than in the middle age ranges,
Fcubic(1,44) = 4.74. Within the phoneme segmentation task, productive
identification (X = 46.17%) was more difficult than the receptive deletion version
of the task (X = 55.88%) F(1,144) = 6.41, MSE = 2.9, but this did not interact
with age. Further details of the phoneme awareness test and detailed results
can be found in Burnham and Tam (in preparation).</p>
          <p>For reading there was a significant increase over age Flinear(1,156) =
621.61, a significant levelling out at the older ages Fquadratic(1,156) = 19.38,
and a less rapid improvement between Year 1 and 3 than between late
Kindergarten and Year 1, Fcubic trend(1,156) = 9.6. Generally, girls had higher mean
reading scores than boys (77.36% vs 66.41%), F(1,156) = 8.51, but this
difference was ameliorated by Grades 3 and 4, F(1,156) = 7.17, MSE = 568.75.
Thus for both reading and phoneme segmentation there was, as expected, a
general improvement over age, with performance asymptoting at the older
ages.

Four regression analyses were conducted in which the outcome measures
were language specific speech perception scores (N-NN) for each of the three
sets of speech contrasts, and positive TOT bias (P-N) scores for the
nonspeech contrasts. The predictor variables in each were rated intelligence, sex,
age, phoneme segmentation, and reading. As significant relationships were
found between (N-NN) and age and language variables in Experiment 1,
here intelligence and sex were entered first to partial them out, and then the
contribution of age, phoneme segmentation, and reading was ascertained. The
results of these analyses, R2, F-values and coefficients are shown in Table 3
for the three speech contrasts and the non-speech contrast, and the results are
summarised below.</p>
          <p>Speech contrasts. For all three speech contrasts, sex and intelligence did not
significantly predict the (N-NN) dependent variable, whereas the subsequent
addition of age and the language variables did. The coefficients are presented
in Table 3. Applying the same interpretive device as in Experiment 1
(DeSarbo et al., 1982; Harris, 1985), the results for each contrast can be
described as follows. For the bilabials, (N-NN) = Reading – Age, which
is the same solution as was found for synthetic versions of these same
contrasts in the identification task in Experiment 1, except that language
comprehension (not measured here) appeared in the equation there. A similar
verbal description is applicable, children who have a high degree of language
specific speech perception tend to be good readers for their age. For the
alveolars, (N-NN) = Phoneme Segmentation – Reading – Age, so for these
contrasts children with a high degree of language specific speech
perception are those who are relatively good segmenters for their age and level of
reading ability. This is a similar but not identical result as that for bilabials and
suggests that under some conditions a relationship between language specific
speech perception and phoneme segmentation may be observed. For the place
contrasts, (N-NN) = – Age. This significant relationship does not include
either of the linguistic factors, reading or phoneme segmentation.6 However,
it is in the same spirit as the other solutions, for there is a negative relationship
with age, i.e., older children have greater language specific speech perception
scores.</p>
          <p>Non-speech contrasts. For the non-speech contrasts the regression for sex
and intelligence was not significant, and additionally age and the language
variables did not add significantly to the prediction. Thus applying the same
analysis rationale as for the speech contrasts led to no significant relationship
between any of the predictor variables and the dependent variable here, TOT
(P-N). The only individual variable which even approached significance was
intelligence (P = 0.053), and the positive beta weight (see Table 3) shows
that (P-N) scores were positively related to intelligence (whereas for all the
speech contrasts beta weights for intelligence were negligible). Thus it can
be concluded (P-N) scores for the TOT contrasts are unaffected by linguistic
variables (phonological segmentation and reading). This is in direct contrast
to the speech perception results, which show a relationship between (N-NN)
and linguistic variables, and/or a negative relationship with age.
Non-native speech vs non-speech. Given the better discrimination of native
over non-native contrasts, it is of interest to determine the relationship
between perception of non-native speech and non-speech. Mean
discrimination indices for the three native contrasts, the three non-native contrasts,
and the two non-speech contrasts are plotted against age in Figure 5. Overall
discrimination of native contrasts was better than for non-native and
nonspeech contrasts combined, F(1,189) = 1548.51, MSE = 0.08, and there
was a significant interaction of native versus non-native and non-speech
combined with the linear F(1,189) = 104.34, quadratic F(1,189) = 22.18,
and cubic F(1,189) = 4.53, MSE = 0.08, age trends. Discrimination of the
non-native contrasts was better than for the non-speech contrasts, F(1,189) =
7.21, MSE = 0.11, but age trends for the two did not differ. To
investigate the non-native speech versus non-speech effect further post-hoc tests
at each age revealed that discrimination of non-native speech and non-speech
was statistically equivalent in Kindergarten and Grade 1 children, and also
for adults. However, discrimination of non-speech was significantly greater
than non-native speech in Young Kindergarten, F(1,189) = 4.16, P &lt; 0.05,
Grade 2, F(1,189) = 13.25, P &lt; 0.01, and Grade 4, F(1,189) = 5.28, P &lt;
0.01, but despite a similar trend, failed to reach significance in Grade 3,
F(1,189) = 3.17. This pattern of results could be described as a general
superiority of non-speech over non-native speech, which is ameliorated around
Kindergarten and Grade 1.
The results are discussed with respect to the four aims of this experiment.
Ontogenetic locus of language specific speech perception
In Australian schools instruction in sound-symbol correspondences, phoneme
segmentation, recognition of simple high-frequency words and so on, begins
in Kindergarten year, while reading instruction proper begins in Grade 1. Here
we found a sharp increase in reading and phoneme segmentation scores from
the beginning to the end of Kindergarten year (see Table 2). For each of the
three sets of speech contrasts language specific speech perception intensifies
at the end of the Kindergarten year, subsequently to be attenuated at the end
of the first (Kindergarten) or second (Grade 1) year of school. Peak levels
of language specific speech perception thus occur just when reading and
phoneme segmentation are rapidly improving, after the start of schooling.
Relationship between language specific speech perception and reading
While there was a slightly different regression solution for the place versus
the two voicing contrasts,6 it can generally be concluded that the results
support the notion that there is a significant relationship between language
specific speech perception and skills associated with the onset of reading
instruction.
Nature of language specific speech perception
Peaks in language specific speech perception were found for the speech
contrasts after the onset of schooling, but for the non-speech TOT contrasts
there is a distinctively different developmental trend. This, plus the fact
that the (N-NN) language specific speech perception is positively related to
reading ability whereas positive (P-N) TOT bias is not, strongly implies that
language specific speech perception is a specifically linguistic phenomenon.
Generalisability of language specific speech perception
Similar results to those in Experiment 1 were found here, despite a number of
procedural differences: natural rather than synthetic speech sounds, a
discrimination rather than an identification task, and two further sets of speech
contrasts – alveolar stops, and a bilabial versus alveolar/dental place contrast.
For all three speech contrasts, similar results regarding the locus of language
specific speech perception were obtained, in all three a negative relationship
with age was found, and in two of the three a relationship between reading
and language specific speech perception was obtained. The similar results in
Experiments 1 and 2 here and in Burnham et al. (1991) point to the
pervasiveness of heightened language specific speech perception following the onset of
reading.
Together the results of the two experiments show that language specific
speech perception is a specifically linguistic phenomenon, and that
heightened language specific speech perception is related to the onset of
reading.</p>
          <p>The nature of language specific speech perception
Building upon previous research, the results of Experiment 1 and especially
Experiment 2 (see Figure 5) suggest that language specific speech perception
is comprised of three components, as follows.</p>
          <p>There is facilitation of the perception of native speech sounds due to
linguistic experience. There is attenuation of the perception of all other
sounds, both non-native speech and non-speech. There is additional
attenuation of the perception of non-native speech sounds below the normal level of
perceptual acuity. These first two processes are evident throughout
development, at least after the onset of phonemic speech perception in infancy (Kuhl,
1991; Kuhl et al., 1992; Tees &amp; Werker, 1984; Werker et al., 1981; Werker &amp;
Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker, 1994), and are certainly
evident over the ages studied here. The third process is generally evident over
the ages studied here; though around the onset of reading perception of both
non-native speech sounds and non-speech sounds are equally and maximally
suppressed. This may be described as a floor effect, but it may be more
heuristic to characterise this as an efficient strategy whereby incoming sounds are
best assigned to orthographically defined categories if perceptual attention to
all sounds which are not native speech is equally attenuated. (Discrimination
of non-native speech and non-speech is also equal for adults, and this could
be due to adults being better able to adopt strategies to perform a particular
laboratory task.) Clearly these explanations are ad hoc, but they highlight the
need for further investigation of the dynamic interaction of speech perception
processes such as facilitation and attenuation right across development, in
infants, children, and adults (Aslin, 1981; Gottlieb, 1976).</p>
          <p>Language specific speech perception and the onset of reading
What happens to language specific speech perception with the onset of
reading? Heightened language specific speech perception in the early years
of schooling has now been found in three separate experiments (Burnham
et al., 1991; Experiments 1 and 2 here), and to be significantly related to
reading acquisition in Experiments 1 and 2 here. This is consistent with the
notion that reading instruction in an alphabetic language directs perceptual
attention to matching graphemes to phonemes, which in turn requires
efficient phoneme segmentation, and efficient assignment of allophonic variants
to strictly defined phoneme categories. The continued ability to perceive
the phonetic characteristics which distinguish native speech phonemes and
selectively suppress just those phonetic characteristics which distinguish
nonnative speech phones from each other (Werker, 1994; Burnham, 1986), and
from similar native phones (Best, 1994), that is, language specific speech
perception, would be very useful at this time. What we have found here is
that there is heightened language specific speech perception after children
begin school, and this is related to the onset of reading. Results here suggest
that around reading onset children may adopt a strategy in which perception
of all contrasts that are not phonologically relevant is suppressed, while both
before and after this time perceptual performance for non-native speech is
additionally suppressed.</p>
          <p>To the extent that the evidence presented here suggests that the additional
suppression for non-native speech contrasts is based on their phonetic
characteristics rather than any acoustic characteristics they share with non-speech
sounds, there is a prima facie argument against the involvement of a
lowlevel auditory deficit as a precursor to reading difficulties (Tallal, 1980).
Moreover, it is clear that language specific speech perception is in place in
early infancy, and thus is a likely candidate to play a role in the acquisition
of later linguistic abilities (Kuhl, 1991; Kuhl et al., 1992; Tees &amp; Werker,
1984; Werker et al., 1981; Werker &amp; Tees, 1983, 1984a; Werker, 1994).
Indeed, the results of Experiment 1 here suggest that around 4 years language
specific speech perception is related to articulation ability. Nevertheless, there
is not yet sufficient evidence to make definitive judgements on this issue;
it remains possible that underlying individual differences in speech
production, speech perception, general cognitive ability (Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995),
and even auditory perception (Tallal, 1980) could contribute to more sharply
defined phonological categories in some pre-school children than in others.
Longitudinal studies from preschool through to post-reading age are clearly
required.</p>
          <p>Language specific speech perception in infancy and childhood
The heightened language specific speech perception uncovered here around
reading onset is additional to, and in no way diminishes the importance of the
well-documented perceptual reorganisation between 6 and 12 months (Polka
&amp; Werker, 1994; Kuhl et al., 1992; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker &amp; Tees,
1992; Werker, 1994; Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995). One main difference between
earlier “phonemic” and the later “orthographic” periods (Burnham, Tyler &amp;
Horlyck, 2002) is that while in infancy perceptual reorganisation occurs due
to the natural ontogenetic processes of perceiving and producing speech, in
the later period, heightened language specific speech perception results from
the imposition of the “unnatural” requirement to read an alphabetic language.</p>
          <p>It is the similarities between these two periods that are of most interest. In
both periods language specific speech perception does not involve any loss of
speech perception ability. Werker and colleagues showed that if the ISI in an
AX discrimination task is shortened to allow phonetic or acoustic processing
(Werker &amp; Tees, 1984b; Werker &amp; Logan, 1985), or if extensive exposure
is given (Werker &amp; Logan, 1985), adults can discriminate non-native speech
contrasts which under normal circumstances they appear unable to
discriminate. Thus, there is no sensori-neural loss of speech perception; exposure to
a particular language results in perceptual selectivity rather than perceptual
loss. In a similar vein, the orthographic language specific speech perception
uncovered here is transitory, occurring specifically around the onset of formal
language instruction, and relinquishing hold around Grade 2 to Grade 3,
possibly due to reading becoming more proficient.</p>
          <p>Another important similarity between these two periods relates to the
work of Lalonde and Werker (1995), who suggest that there is an initial
perceptual analysis underlying all speech perception, which is untouched by
specific linguistic experience or general cognitive ability. The output of such
perceptual analysis then is redescribed at increasingly complex and abstract
levels throughout development (Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995; Karmiloff-Smith,
1991). So, according to Lalonde and Werker, the same phonetic detail is
available to infants before and after the six- to nine-month reorganisation
period, but during this period there is a redescription of the output from
phonetic analysers in order to reflect native speech categories. “The
redescription results in a second representation superimposed on the first, leaving
the original detail of language-general discrimination intact . . .” (Lalonde
&amp; Werker, 1995: 472). In this way Lalonde and Werker’s model allows the
infant’s ability for redescription to be related to general cognitive abilities,
even if underlying phonetic or acoustic abilities are more or less equivalent.
This model may be expanded if more were known about how the processes
of speech perception interact with other linguistic processes occurring at the
time of redescription. For example, does perceptual assimilation (Best, 1994)
operate equivalently at all periods of development, and do particular
phonetic characteristics of speech sounds (Burnham, 1986; Stevens &amp; Keyser,
1989) differentially affect perceptual performance in different developmental
contexts?</p>
          <p>The orthographic period uncovered here could be seen to be a further
redescription, which is superimposed on the earlier redescription (see Burnham et
al., 2002, for elaboration). And like the earlier redescription, there appear
to be later vestiges of this. For instance, in auditory phoneme deletion and
addition tasks, Tyler and Burnham (2000) found adults had longer reaction
times for orthographic interference items, such as WORTH-EARTH – “add
/w/ to / θ/” or “delete /w/ from /w θ/”, than for non-interfering items, such
as FACT-ACT – “add /f/ to /aekt/” or “delete /f/ from /faekt/” (see also Taft &amp;
Hambly, 1985).
There are important implications of these results for reading instruction.
Three of these are set out below.</p>
          <p>Is reading instruction in an alphabetic language a necessary condition
for the intensification of language specific speech perception? In order to
test this, six-year-old children who were not being taught to read (either
due to a later onset or absence of schooling; Morais et al., 1979), and
sixyear-olds being taught to read a non-alphabetic script (Read et al., 1986)
should be compared on native and non-native speech perception.
Additionally, given the supposed role of phoneme-to-grapheme correspondences in
language specific speech perception, it would be of interest to investigate
the degree of language specific speech perception when children learn a
language with a transparent orthography such as Spanish or Turkish, in which
phoneme-to-grapheme conversion rules are both feedforward and feedback
consistent, versus an opaque language such as English or Irish, with irregular
grapheme-to-phoneme mappings.</p>
          <p>Does phonics reading instruction result in greater language specific
speech perception than whole word reading instruction? Our arguments
above support the use of phonic rather than whole word methods of early
reading instruction, because the phonics method should facilitate
acquisition of the arbitrary language-specific phoneme-to-grapheme conversion rule
conventions. If, as we would predict, children taught with phonics-based
methods (see Liberman &amp; Liberman, 1992; Byrne &amp; Fielding-Barnsley, 1993;
Schwartz, 1988) show greater language specific speech perception
independent of reading ability (Andrews, 1992a, b) than children taught with a
whole word method (Goodman &amp; Goodman, 1979; Goodman, 1986), then
this would suggest that heightened language specific speech perception is
not only a consequence of learning to read, but also an index of reading
instruction efficacy.</p>
          <p>Is heightened language specific speech perception the result of reading
instruction or maturation? The heightened language specific speech
perception found here in Experiments 1 and 2 appears to be related to both age
and reading ability. It is not yet clear whether ‘reading ability’ relates to the
amount of reading instruction, the type of reading instruction, the child’s
ability to benefit from reading instruction, pre-reading skills that children
bring to school, each child’s ability for graphemic redescription of the speech
input, or children’s general cognitive ability (Lalonde &amp; Werker, 1995). These
need to be investigated in a design in which reading instruction and age are
independently manipulated. Such a study is currently being conducted in our
laboratory.

        <title>4. This difference in the linear components is underscored by a shift over age in relative</title>
        <p>performance on the two contrasts: at the younger ages there is superior performance
on the negative contrast (Young Kindergarten &amp; Kindergarten combined: Xpositive =

Xnegative = 0.18), while at the older ages performance is better on the positive contrast
(Grades 2, 3, 4, and adults: Xpositive = 0.56, Xnegative = 0.46). This latter result confirms
adults’ superiority for positive region contrasts found by Pisoni (1977), and extends it to
children as young as about 7 years. The opposite effect for the four- and five-year-old
Kindergarten children, i.e., superior performance on the negative region contrast and the
crossover in Grade 1, is intriguing and deserves further study.</p>

        <title>6. A possible reason for this may be that the non-native place contrast was the easiest of the</title>
        <p>non-native contrasts to discriminate (see Figure 3c). Of the three sets of speech contrasts
the place contrasts had the lowest mean N-NN scores for the combined child groups
(Xbilabials = 0.72, Xalveolars = 0.77, Xplace = 0.53) and this was attributable to the fact
that while the native contrasts were equally difficult in each of the three pairs (Xbilabials =
0.90, Xalveolars = 0.94, Xplace = 0.90), the non-native contrast was considerably easier
for the place contrasts (Xbilabials = 0.18, Xalveolars = 0.17, Xplace = 0.37). It is thus
quite likely that the relationship between language specific speech perception and related
reading skills is only evident when difficult to perceive non-native speech contrasts are
used.</p>
