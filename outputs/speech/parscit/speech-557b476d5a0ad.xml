Abstract. This article examines a teaching package that
was designed to cover the progression of skills agreed to
by clinicians and educators as being pertinent to interpreting Videofluoroscopy Swallowing Studies (VFSSs).
Sessions taught included knowledge of anatomy and
physiology of swallowing, examination and identification of structures and landmarks from radiographs, and
the use of an assessment scale such as the Bethlehem
Assessment Scale (BAS) to interpret VFSSs. The ability
to interpret eight VFSSs using the BAS was used as the
final assessment. ANOVA for repeated measures and
post hoc tests using Tukey’s HSD statistic revealed that
there was a statistically significant correlation between
students’ knowledge of anatomy and physiology and
their knowledge of radiographic anatomy. There was a
statistically significant correlation between their knowledge of radiographic anatomy and their ability to interpret videofluoroscopic examinations, as assessed using
the BAS. There was also a statistically significant correlation between their knowledge of anatomy and physiology and their ability to interpret videofluoroscopic examinations using the BAS.
Key words: Student teaching — Dysphagia — Fluoroscopy — Deglutition — Deglutition disorders.
Videofluoroscopy Swallowing Studies (VFSSs) are
widely used in clinical settings to determine the nature
and extent of swallowing problems. Little data are available to inform what leads to good inter- and intrarater
reliability when interpreting results of this technique [1].
Kuhlemeier et al. [2] indicated that, even when using

experienced clinicians, inter- and intrarater reliability in
VFSSs was adequate only for evaluating oral stage, laryngeal penetration and aspiration, and pharyngeal retention, but it was questionable for the evaluation of functional components. This article examines methods of
achieving reliability when interpreting VFSSs and ways
of teaching this skill to student speech pathologists.
In Australia, dysphagia is seen as part of a standard university undergraduate course in speech pathology. However, there are still many differences in teaching students the interpretation of videofluoroscopic examinations. These differences include the number of
hours spent on teaching dysphagia and videofluoroscopy
and the year level at which these subjects are introduced
to the students (Table 1).
In 1994, the Australian Association of Speech
and Hearing (AASH) established Competency-Based
Occupational Standards (C-BOS). This document outlined the relevant minimal professional standards required of a newly qualified speech pathologist in the
assessment and management of various speech, language, and swallowing disorders [3]. In the area of dysphagia assessment and management, these standards include the following: clinicians need to examine the nature of the client’s difficulty using a variety of methods
including case history, observational techniques, and investigative techniques; clinicians should be involved in
the decision to investigate dysphagia further, using radiographic and other techniques; and clinicians should be
aware of the use and interpretation of videofluoroscopic
investigation (with reference to a senior or supervising
speech pathologist for assistance when appropriate).
Currently there is no agreed on structured method
for teaching the interpretation of videofluoroscopic examinations. There is a need to teach this technique because of its wide use in varied clinical settings. Accuracy
and clinical rigor in interpreting VFSSs are vital in clinical diagnosis. This project sought to examine the optimal

way of teaching students to interpret videofluoroscopic
examinations accurately. This problem is not unique to
Australia. As Jarchow [4] indicated in her survey of
graduates in the United States, many graduates were being certified for a position when they may not have had
courses in an area which constituted 40%–50% of their
caseload.
The Bethlehem Assessment Scale (BAS)
The Bethlehem Assessment Scale (BAS), developed by
Scott [1] for evaluating dysphagia in motor neuron disease subjects, involves interpreting dynamic VFSSs
guided by a 4-point rating scale, with clear verbal descriptors and printed radiological examples of the scalar
points. Developed from the Charing Cross profile [5], the
BAS has established validity and reliability data from
studies of experienced clinicians’ use of the scale. Specific parameters allow the evaluation of individual functions that contribute to the dynamic process of swallowing. These parameters include: labial function, lingual
function, jaw function, velar function, swallow reflex,
hyoid elevation, pooling in valleculae, pooling in pyriform sinuses, aspiration, pharyngeal wall function, and
cricopharyngeal function [6].
In using the BAS for assessing students’ skills,
this article examines teaching and learning paradigms in
the interpretation of videofluoroscopic examinations. We
hypothesized that there would be a relationship between
the students’ knowledge of the anatomy and physiology
of swallowing, their knowledge of radiographic landmarking, and their competence in the interpretation of
videofluoroscopic examinations using the BAS. This
would be demonstrated by their ability to obtain a 75%
agreement on (i) anatomy and physiology assessment
and (ii) radiographic landmarking assessment, and by
examining kappa coefficients for agreement using the
BAS.
We further hypothesized that there would be a
relationship between the interpretation of structure (as
ascertained by identification of landmarks on “still” radiographic images) and function (interpretation of videofluoroscopic examinations using the BAS).

Female subjects (38) were recruited in 1998 from the third year of the
four-year speech pathology undergraduate course at La Trobe University. They had no previous specific training in the interpretation of
videofluoroscopic examinations and had no known hearing or visual
impairment. The rationale for using only female participants was to
eliminate the confounding factor that gender might have on the results.
In addition, the speech pathology course is very much femaledominated and it would have been difficult to obtain an equal number
of male participants.

The five structured teaching sessions were as follows:
Session 1 covered materials relating to the normal anatomy and
physiology of swallowing. This included the normal process of swallowing, the anatomical structures and muscles involved in swallowing,
and the innervation of these muscles. Teaching was didactic with quality overheads and handouts provided to augment the session. Following
this session, all subjects were required to complete and submit a worksheet to assess knowledge gained.
Session 2 was to teach radiographic anatomy and landmarking.
Subjects were taught by the researcher how to identify structures and
landmarks on “still” radiographic images. Following this teaching session, subjects were required to complete and submit a worksheet relating to the topic covered. The worksheet consisted of radiographs
with arrows labeling structures to be identified. Students were required
to identify and correctly label by writing the names alongside the
anatomical areas outlined.
Sessions 3 and 4 taught subjects how to interpret and rate the
parameters in the oral and the pharyngeal phase of the swallow in
VFSSs using the BAS. Parameters in the oral phase were labial function, lingual function, and jaw function; parameters in the pharyngeal
phase were velar elevation, swallow reflex, hyoid elevation, residue in
the valleculae, residue in the pyriform sinuses, aspiration, pharyngeal
wall function, and cricopharyngeal function. Subjects were provided
with visual examples of normal and abnormal swallows (in the form of
VFSSs). Subjects were also taught what viewing mode (i.e., normal
play mode, pause mode, or frame-by-frame mode) to use when rating
each of the parameters and the levels of function for each parameter
using the BAS descriptors (which included visual examples of each of
the four points on the scale).
In session 5, subjects were given the opportunity to practice (as
a group) using the BAS for interpreting differing videofluoroscopic
examinations in class.

Procedure
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998035142857143">
Five hours of carefully structured teaching was developed. In order to
assess knowledge gained, worksheets were given after each specific
skill had been covered in the training sessions (namely, the anatomy
and physiology of swallowing, radiographic anatomy of the swallowing
mechanism, and interpretation of dynamic videofluoroscopic examinations using the BAS), and all subjects agreed to complete the final
assessment.
The teaching package was designed in this way for a number of
reasons. First, it was agreed that students would need an understanding
of “normal” anatomy and physiology before they could understand
abnormalities in the swallowing process. Second, swallowing, being a
complex and integrated process, needed to be divided into its component phases so that students could gain a fuller understanding of the
different aspects. In addition, the BAS divides the areas to be interpreted into the oral phase and pharyngeal phase. Therefore, it was
essential that students learn where each phase began and ended so that
they could use the BAS reliably. Finally, it was necessary to teach the
students to interpret radiographs so that they could identify structures
and spaces that are in the swallowing process. The BAS refers to a
number of structures and spaces in the ratings of some specified parameters. It was also assumed that this would follow the progression of
skills that are necessary in the interpretation of dynamic VFSSs.
Subjects agreed to attend all 5 teaching sessions and complete
and return all assessments. The subjects were given one week to complete and submit each worksheet example (see Appendix 1) and another
week to complete and submit the final assessment which consisted of
M. Wooi et al.: Teaching Videofluoroscopy to Students
8 VFSSs recorded on videocassette for subjects to take home and
complete, using the BAS. In order to discount any practice effect, the
sequence of the 8 VFSSs was randomized so that the order of the
swallows was different from tape to tape. The 8 VFSSs chosen had no
identifying information on them which minimized the possibility that
subjects would compare their responses among themselves.

<bodyText confidence="0.9961754375">
Normal Anatomy and Physiology of Swallowing
Using worksheet 1 (see Appendix 2), all participants got
at least 75% of the answers correct. The mean score was
87.5% and the range of scores was between 79% and
100%. The results for worksheet 1 are summarized in
Tables 2 and 3. These results are categorized into question topics examining knowledge of structures and question topics examining knowledge of functions. The tables
are also ranked according to scores in terms of percentage correct. The questions that did not reach the 75%
correct criterion are in italics. Of the 40 individual aspects that were covered in worksheet 1, there were 9
aspects that did not achieve the 75% correct criterion.
The overall of mean correct answers was 83.3%, the
standard deviation was 19%, and the range was between
31.6% and 100% of students’ correctly answering individual aspects. The individual aspects where subjects
were unable to attain the required 75% correct score were
complex concepts involving several structures; a series
of diagrams might have aided subjects to understand better. It may have been that subjects did not understand
these concepts or the wording of the question.

In worksheet 2, subjects were required to label 8 diagrams of radiographic still images with a total of 71
structures (Figs. 1 and 2). The subjects scored in the
range of 94.4%–100% correct for this worksheet. The
mean score was 98.6% with a standard deviation of 1.6.
Table 4 summarizes the results of worksheet 2, with
individual aspects ranked in terms of scores. The table
shows that all structures that were to be labeled were
done so correctly, with all above 75% correct. The range
of accurate labeling was between 90.4% and 100%.
Teeth, vallecula, and the first cervical vertebrae were
labeled accurately 100% of the time. The following items
had relatively low frequencies of occurrence (i.e., the
number of times that students were requested to label
structures): teeth (frequency ‫ ס‬2), laryngeal opening
(frequency ‫ ס‬3), trachea (frequency ‫ ס‬3), vallecula

areas. The lowest percentages of correct labeling were
for the position of the laryngeal opening (93.0%) and the
position of the trachea (90.4%). These structures are
close to each other which may explain the results. The
frequency for these two items was low which may indicate that further testing for these two items is required.
The reproduction of the diagrams used was not ideal
because of the inferior quality of photocopied images.
However, the cost and time involved in printing the
worksheet on a printer would have been far greater than
just photocopying the images.
Interpretation of Videofluoroscopic Examinations
Using the BAS
Kappa coefficients were calculated for each of the 11
parameters in the BAS. This analysis showed that poorto-good interrater reliability was obtained. The range of
the kappa coefficient ⌲ ranged from 0.2 to 0.55. Using
the kappa coefficients, obtained z values and their corresponding p values were calculated. Table 5 summarizes the parameters ranked in terms of their obtained z
values. All the z scores were above that which would be
expected from ?? for all 11 parameters tested.
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated
measures was performed to allow the comparion of the
scores in the knowledge of the anatomy and physiology
of swallowing (worksheet 1), the ability to identify structures and landmarks in still radiographic images (worksheet 2), and the 8 trials at interpreting dynamic videofluoroscopic examinations using the BAS (final assessment). Table 6 summarizes the ANOVA for repeated
measures. It shows that the obtained value of F is 40.11.
From the F distribution, F(critical) ‫ ס‬4.90, df ‫ ס‬2 and
74 (␣ ‫ ס‬0.01). The obtained value of F (40.11) exceeds
the critical value of F (4.90) at the decision level of ␣ ‫ס‬
0.01. There is a demonstrated correlation between the
knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of swallowing
(worksheet 1), the ability to identify structures and landmarks in still radiographic images (worksheet 2), and the
8 trials at interpreting dynamic videofluoroscopic examinations using the BAS (final assessment).
Since the obtained F ratio is significant, post hoc
testing using Tukey’s HSD enabled the determination of
which factors in the progression of skills required to
interpret videofluoroscopic examinations were more important. Table 7 illustrates the statistical comparison between the knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of
swallowing (worksheet 1), the ability to identify structures and landmarks in still radiographic images (worksheet 2), and the 8 trials at interpreting dynamic video-

specified parameters in the BAS).
There was also a relationship between the interpretation of structures (as ascertained by identification of
structures and landmarks on still radiographic images)
and functions (interpretation of VFSSs using the BAS).
This confirms the link between knowledge of anatomy,
radiological landmarking, and success at interpreting
VFSSs.

Discussion
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9976594">
In worksheet 1 (normal anatomy and physiology of swallowing), all participants got at least 75% of the answers
correct. One cannot discount that pre-existing knowledge
probably contributed to this good result since all students
study general anatomy in year 1 of their course.
Of the 40 individual aspects that were covered in
worksheet 1, the criterion of 75% correct was not obtained in 10 aspects. This may have been a result of the
way the questions were worded or the required number
of points per question was not included as a cue in the
worksheet to remind the students of the extent of the
answer required. Alternatively, these aspects may have
been taught inadequately. The use of serial diagrams and
models could have aided subjects to better understand
these aspects. It may also have been the researcher’s
inexperience at teaching that contributed to the poor result in these areas.
In assessing radiographic anatomy and landmarking, all subjects scored in the range of 94.4%–100% for
this worksheet. The mean score was 98.6%. This result
was particularly high. Further testing is needed to determine the subjects’ true ability to identify structures and
landmarks in radiographs, perhaps in the absence of any
guided instruction.
Some areas (i.e., the position of the laryngeal
opening and the position of the trachea) were relatively
more difficult for the subjects to label accurately as reflected by the poorer results in these areas. These structures are close to each other and the position of the label
line may have been misleading or ambiguous. This may
have contributed to the poor results. The diagrams in the

inadequate.
Finally, 11 subjects who first volunteered did not
return the final assessment to the researcher, which negated their contribution to the study. This may have been
because the final assessment was too difficult. In our

must reflect on the design and delivery of their training courses and help their graduates meet accredited

C-BOS should outline the universally acceptable skill
performance level for new graduates, and university
courses need to reflect how these skills should be demonstrated. Until these issues are addressed, it may be
necessary for accredited postgraduate training to be

The results of this research reinforce the necessity of
Australian clinicians adhering to C-BOS. C-BOS states
that “Clinicians should be aware of the use and interpretation of videofluoroscopic investigation with reference
to a senior or supervising speech pathologist for assistance when appropriate” (our italics). With the current
level of teaching of the interpretation of videofluoroscopic examinations, we cannot assume new graduates
can interpret videofluoroscopic examinations as reliably
as might be desired [7]. Our work also reinforces the
belief that accredited postgraduate training should be
made available for new graduates to improve and refine
their skills at interpreting videofluoroscopic examinations and hence achieve more accurate assessment in
dysphagia.
6. Describe what structures are involved in collecting and containing
the bolus in a cohesive form in the second phase of swallowing.
7.
Name the structures involved in the third phase of swallowing.
8. Describe how complete airway protection is achieved in the third
phase of the swallow.
Conclusions
9. Describe the postures, movements, and functions of the soft palate
in the second and third phases of the swallow.
Recent literature has shown that dysphagia assessment
and management forms a significant part of a speech
pathologist’s caseload. The issues raised by our study
highlight that we may not be providing adequate knowlege, skill, and practice as part of the undergraduate training program. There is a need for educators to
10. Describe the process by which the cricopharyngeus opens to allow the transit of the bolus from the pharynx into the oesophagus.
