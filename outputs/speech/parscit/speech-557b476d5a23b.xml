<bodyText confidence="0.973464395348837">
Background: The Bercow review found a high level of public dissatisfaction with speech and language services for
children. Children with speech, language, and communication needs (SLCN) often have chronic complex
conditions that require provision from health, education, and community services. Speech and language therapists
are a small group of Allied Health Professionals with a specialist skill-set that equips them to work with children
with SLCN. They work within and across the diverse range of public service providers. The aim of this review was
to explore the applicability of Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) to the case of speech and language therapy.
Methods: A review of qualitative research on a successfully embedded speech and language therapy intervention
was undertaken to test the applicability of NPT. The review focused on two of the collective action elements of
NPT (relational integration and interaction workability) using all previously published qualitative data from both
parents and practitioners’ perspectives on the intervention.
Results: The synthesis of the data based on the Normalisation Process Model (NPM) uncovered strengths in the
interpersonal processes between the practitioners and parents, and weaknesses in how the accountability of the
intervention is distributed in the health system.
Conclusions: The analysis based on the NPM uncovered interpersonal processes between the practitioners and
parents that were likely to have given rise to successful implementation of the intervention. In previous qualitative
research on this intervention where the Medical Research Council’s guidance on developing a design for a
complex intervention had been used as a framework, the interpersonal work within the intervention had emerged
as a barrier to implementation of the intervention. It is suggested that the design of services for children and
families needs to extend beyond the consideration of benefits and barriers to embrace the social processes that
appear to afford success in embedding innovation in healthcare.
Background
In his review of the services for children with speech,
language, and communication needs (SLCN) in England
and Wales, Bercow [1] said that, ‘The requirements of
children and young people with SLCN and their families
will be met when, and only when, appropriate services to
support them, across the age range and spectrum of
need, are designed and delivered in a way that is

accessible to them.’ Over one-half of the 1,000 families
who participated in the consultation said that speech and
language therapy services were poor. Whilst families indicated that improvements in services could come from
enhanced resourcing, their evidence also showed that
there is an imperative for change in the design and delivery of speech and language therapy. In response, the
Department for Children Schools and Families published
an action plan for improvement in public services [2]
that committed to a series of initiatives, many funded, to
improve services for children with speech language and

communication needs. If services are going to change to
be more family-centred, then we need to know more
about what families want from services at different points
in their trajectory of service involvement [3]. Bercow
placed a high priority on early identification and early
intervention for children with SLCN. However, Lindsay
et al.’ [4] primary qualitative research showed that wide
variation exists across health and educational providers
with regards to the practice of identification of children
with SLCN as well as the provision of services to meet
their needs. It is an opportune time to consider the complex context in which speech and language interventions
are delivered to explore: how intervention research
should be designed so that interventions can be integrated across and within the diverse public service delivery context; and how interventions can be designed to
better meet the specific needs and expectations of the
families themselves.
To date, there are only a handful of studies on the parental perspective on speech and language therapy [5-13],
and only three of these studies have used the type of qualitative methodology that is needed to explore the
parents’ frame of reference [6,7,11]. Given the priority for
early intervention, the focus on the transition into speech
and language therapy is a good place to start to deepen
understanding of the perspectives of the main participants. The discussions at transition points are considered
to be opportune times to engage all stakeholders as active
participants to help keep the child and family at the centre of the healthcare system [14]. Getting active participation of patients in healthcare is known to be associated
with higher treatment compliance [15]. The achievement
of active participation is crafted in large part within the
conversational encounters between clinicians and
patients [16]. There has been limited exploration of these
concepts in speech and language therapy, but the results
of the Bercow review suggest that these are priority areas
for speech and language therapy research and practice.
Speech and language therapy interventions are good
examples of complex interventions. They do not typically
involve drug or surgical interventions; rather, the interventions are most often behaviourally based and delivered
through discourse between the practitioner and the
patient. Second, the allied health professions are small
groups within healthcare systems, and this means that
they usually work in distributed teams within healthcare
services. Finally, the evidence base for speech and language
therapy interventions is still developing. A systematic
review of speech and language therapy for children found
25 randomised controlled trials since the 1960s [17].
Whilst the impact of speech and language therapy for children with some types of speech/language problems was
concluded to be positive, there was high heterogeneity
across the studies included in the review with subsequent

impact on the confidence intervals of the effect sizes from
the meta-analysis. The UK speech and language profession
is considered to have a relatively strong research base in
terms of quality of publications and percentage of international published contributions in biomedical scientific
journals [18], however, we can see from the work of Law
et al. that the evidence base of randomised controlled
trails is small, and this has an impact on the nature of the
conclusions that can be drawn from meta-analyses. Thus,
we have a situation where the profession is comparatively
research-engaged, but the evidence base for the interventions delivered by the profession is weak. Public dissatisfaction with services is well documented. With new postBercow funding for intervention research, it is especially
important that the potential implementation of new interventions is explored at an early stage so that, if found to
be efficacious, new interventions can be quickly embedded
within existing practice.
The complex nature of the interventions and the
diverse delivery conditions of those interventions across
a range of public services provides a challenging context
in which to design new interventions that can be
embedded in practice for patient benefit. Murray et al.
[19] suggested that Normalisation Process Theory
(NPT) provides a framework that can be used to design
and evaluate complex interventions to improve potentiality for implementation of research interventions in
practice.
Normalisation process theory
The NPT [20] grew out of the Normalisation Process
Model (NPM) [21] and May’s interest in understanding
the work that is done by individuals and collectives of people to get innovation normalised as part of everyday practice in the context of healthcare delivery. An original
concept of the NPM concerned the way healthcare interventions are co-constructed between different agents in
the intervention (patient, provider, and other healthcare
workers). The role of collective action was characterised as
one of four main types of work in the subsequent NPT.
The NPM offers a set of explanatory propositions of how
different internal intervention elements and external intervention elements support the embedding of the intervention in practice. The model was been built on qualitative
data on the introduction of new technologies in healthcare
and the management of chronic illness in primary care in
the UK. It has four main categories: professional-patient
relationships; new modalities for delivering care; social
construction and production of evidence; and social organisation of clinical work. According to the model, interventions will be likely to be embedded if they afford a high
level of flexibility in the internal elements of the intervention. This includes elements such as establishing the
meaning of the intervention, agreeing the way in which

the intervention will be delivered, and evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention between the participants.
According to the NPM, interventions that develop evaluation protocols based on how all the participants attribute
meaning to the intervention will tend to be more successful in their ability to become embedded in practice.
Applying Normalisation Process Model to speech and
language therapy
Despite the influence of the Medical Research Council’s
guidance for designing complex interventions [22], there is
an acknowledgement that results from intervention
research, specifically randomised controlled trials, often
fail to provide useful information [19]. Campbell et al.
attribute this to a lack of theoretically motivated groundwork in the initial stages of the intervention design [23].
They highlight the opportunity to draw on health psychology and social theory to fully explore and model the multiple and complex mechanisms of change in intervention
design. If the time-limited opportunity for more intervention research in speech and language therapy is to have
maximum effect in public services, then raising the profile
of the role of health psychology and social theory to the
research designers in the field is warranted. There is a call
for the application of more social theory in speech and
language therapy research [24], but there is currently a
very limited amount of qualitative research in the field.
Research question
The primary aim of this study was to test the applicability
of the propositions on the role of collaborative work laid
out in the NPM and NPT to the context of speech and
language therapy so that, if found to be applicable, the
NPT could be used to inform the design of new intervention research in the field. Specifically, I set out to test the
theory according to the requirements a theory as set out
by May et al. [25]. I wanted to find out: whether the definitions as described within the original version of the
NPM could be applied to a new data set based on a synthesis of qualitative research from previously published
research on a successfully embedded speech and language
intervention (see below); whether the application of the
model could uncover new understanding of how the interpersonal work done by the participants of the intervention
gave rise to its successful embedding in practice; and
whether new testable propositions could be made about
the factors that are likely to support the potential for
embedding new interventions in the context of speech and
language therapy. At the time when I undertook the analysis for this study, the NPM was in use, and the NPT was in
its final development. Testing the applicability of the NPT
and the generalisability of its explanatory power in understanding implementation and embedding of interventions
within healthcare has been approached using a range of
Page 3 of 10
study methodologies and healthcare contexts [26,27], but
so far, its applicability to the context of service delivery by
Allied Health Professionals has not been tested. The study
adopted a case study approach using qualitative data on a
successfully embedded speech and language intervention
to address research questions above. The third aim of the
study will be addressed in the discussion to this paper.

Methods
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985172875">
The study began with a search for a pediatric speech and
language therapy intervention that was used in practice
across the UK and was the topic of published qualitative
research on the parents’ and professionals’ perspectives of
the intervention. The pediatric speech and language therapy intervention that was commonly used the UK and had
the most number of published studies of qualitative
research as identified. The Hanen Parent Programme
(HPP) originated in the US [28] and it has become
embedded in practice throughout the UK during the past
ten to fifteen years. The intervention uses an indirect
method of therapy, which means that the practitioner
works through another agent in order to achieve change
in the child. In this case, the agent of therapy is the
mother or caregiver. The practitioner uses video footage
to help parents, who attend in groups, to see how they
could adapt their own interaction to support the development of communication in their child. The communication targets can be verbal or non-verbal, making this a
useful intervention for a wide range of children who present with different types of communication difficulties.
Most speech and language therapy departments in the UK
have a parent group based on the Hanen principles. The
principles of the Hanen intervention are commonly found
on all pre-registration speech and language therapy degree
courses in the UK.
A literature search was conducted to find all research
that had been published on the parental views of the HPP.
In the first instance databases were searched using all
search terms associated with the HPP (Hanen, Hanen
Parent Programme, It Takes Two To Talk). This search
identified approximately 20 papers. All these papers were
downloaded and read in full to find all research that had
included information on either the parental views of the
intervention or the speech and language therapists’ views
on the intervention. There were five papers that presented
data on the parents’ or therapists’ views. Three of these
papers used semi-structured interviews or focus groups to
elicit participants’ views on the intervention. Two of the
papers presented data from questionnaires that were used
to elicit parental views of speech and language therapy.
These studies were included because they explored parental views on direct (traditional) versus indirect (such as the
HPP) approaches with children and families. The papers
are summarised in Table 1.

Defining method for secondary analysis
The first step in the analysis was to identify the important and recurrent themes that arose in the five studies
in the review. The next step was to map the recurrent
themes on to the constructs of the NPM [20]. The
existing published research on the HPP did not contain
data that was relevant to the two exogenous components of the NPM, but there were recurrent themes
that mapped on to the two endogenous constructs of
the model. The next step was to isolate all the quotations that were reported in the three papers that
included data from semi-structured interviews of focus
groups. All the direct quotations were taken out of the
thematic context in which they had been grouped in
the original research. They were read and then considered for inclusion into a construct map of the NPM
endogenous factors.
The first endogenous process in the NPM concerns the
professional-patient relations, the interpersonal context
for normalisation, named Interaction Workability. The
specific elements of Interaction Workability and the relationship between these elements are summarised in
Table 2. According to May, an intervention that gets
embedded in practice is likely to be one that allows flexible accomplishment of both congruence and disposal.
The emphasis is on the flexibility needed for parties to
combine their ideas and beliefs (congruence) and make
them concrete in outcomes that are meaningful to both
parties (disposal). According to the proposition in the
model, the successfully embedded HPP should reveal

Thematic analysis
evidence of flexible interpersonal work between practitioner and parent.
The second endogenous process defined by May [20],
named Relational Integration, covers the network of relations in which the clinical work is embedded. According
to May, this network of relations is how the knowledge
and practice of the intervention is defined and mediated.
This is comprised of two dimensions, accountability and
confidence. Accountability refers to internal network and
has three components. These are: validity of the knowledge associated with the intervention, which includes
ways in which disputes about that knowledge are minimised and the distribution of the knowledge within the
hierarchies in the network; expertise, beliefs about the
expertise entailed in the intervention; and dispersal, the
distribution of knowledge and practice within the network. Confidence refers to the external network and has
three components. These are: credibility, the development of a shared understanding of the credibility of the
intervention, the ways in which disagreements about the
intervention are handled, agreement about how credibility of the intervention should be measured; utility, beliefs
about the source of knowledge and about the utility of
those sources of knowledge; and expectations about the
authority of the dispersion of knowledge in the external
network. According to the proposition in the model, the
successfully embedded HPP should reveal evidence of
shared accountability and wide distribution of accountability across the agents involved in the intervention. The
secondary analysis searched for evidence to test these

Research question one
Are the definitions as described within the original version
of the NPM applicable to a new data set based on a synthesis of qualitative research from previously published
research on the HPP?
The findings of the synthesis of the qualitative research
against the NPM propositions were checked by both of
the NPM main authors (May and Finch) to search for
inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the allocation of qualitative research to aspects of the model. No discrepancies
were found. The allocation of direct quotations to the
NPM was relative straightforward, and there were no discrepancies in the allocation between the first author of
this paper and the NMP’s main authors, however, it was
important to consider the degree to which the NPM provided an inclusive framework for the main thematic findings in the original articles. The quotations as well as the
main thematic findings from the original studies were
used to populate the NPM framework (endogenous processes). The findings of the secondary data analysis was
presented to academic speech and language therapists at
Newcastle University who considered the findings to be
congruent with their own experience of working with the
HPP.
Research question two
Can the application of the model uncover new understanding of how the interpersonal work done by the participants of the intervention gave rise to its successful
embedding in practice? This was approached by testing
the findings against the main propositions in the NPM
on the endogenous factors of an intervention.
Is there evidence of flexible interpersonal work between
practitioner and parent? The data in Table 3 show several
areas of flexibility, and this is particularly evident in the
parents. Parents start off expecting the child to be the
focus of therapy (co-operation, legitimacy, and conduct),
but the data on disposal (goals and meaning) show that
parents have accepted that they are the legitimate target of
therapy in the HPP. In focus groups with speech and language therapists, Pennington and Thompson [29] reported
that the speech and language therapists valued how the
parents had been able to adopt a totally different
approach, they related this change in parents’ communicative style positively, and they attributed the change to the
content and delivery of the programme. The evidence of
flexibility in practitioners is less noticeable, but there is
evidence that they adjust the components of therapy
according to parental feedback (see Goals). From the data
in Table 3, it is evident that the speech and language
Page 5 of 10
therapists appear to carry the knowledge of the limits of
the research evidence for the intervention with them.
However, there is evidence in the data that the therapists
focus on the theoretical principles that underpins the
rationale for the intervention. They use these principles to
theorise about change in the child. Furthermore, they
assess outcomes of the therapy using primary data on the
parent/child interaction. The data on conduct of both parent and practitioners show that both parties had similar
expectations that the intervention would produce change,
that the expert agent in this change would be the practitioner, and that the parent would follow the advice of the
practitioner. It is possible that the flexibility in parents’
perspective on their role in the intervention was facilitated
by the explicit first-principle-theorising by the practitioners on how change will happen in the child as a result
of changes made by the parents.
We might assume that the professional competency of
speech and language therapists means that they are highly
skilled in supporting the types of flexible co-construction
that May says supports the normalisation of an intervention. If this is the case, then we might always expect to
find evidence of flexible construction of agency in the context of speech and language therapy. Data from Baxendale
et al. [8] suggest that this is not the case. They compared
parental perspectives on the HPP with traditional clinicbased therapy following a randomised control trial of the
two interventions. The expectations of all parents prior to
speech and language therapy was that the therapy would
be provided on a one-to-one basis with the practitioner
providing the therapy in a clinic environment, and that the
work would involve some direct elicitation procedures,
such as helping the child imitate sounds or repeat sounds.
The authors note that the parents who went on to receive
the HPP found this expectation difficult to assimilate with
reality of the indirect approach, ‘But I was very much
against it. I thought Eddie was going to be more like individual speech therapy sessions .... and I thought no it’s
Eddie that needs the speech therapy not us.’ However,
parents who were assigned to the HPP adopted the programme philosophy over the course of the intervention.
Parents were positive about the indirect approach and, as
we have seen, could attribute change in the child to their
own intervention. In contrast, Baxendale et al. found that
the parents who received the direct, traditional clinicbased therapy could state how they had changed their
interaction, but did not see themselves as being responsible for outcomes. Therefore, it is not the case that practitioners are always successful in helping parents change
their perspective on their role in the intervention. One
conclusion from this analysis is that the HPP is an intervention that is particularly good at helping practitioners
theorise about, discuss, and evaluate the mechanisms of
change in the intervention.

Note HPP - Hanen Parent Programme
Pennington and Thompson [29] also reported that the
practitioners perceived increased confidence and empowerment in the parents who took part in the HPP. The
practitioners in this study often attributed this change to
the group delivery of the programme. However, practitioners also reported that they found the group work particularly difficult and that parents were apprehensive and
insecure in the group. In congruence with this, it was
often the group delivery aspect of the intervention that
was dropped by the practitioners. The parents did not
attribute any change in their own learning or feelings of
confidence to other parents in the group. They often
reported that they disliked the group delivery aspect of
the programme. The practitioners attributed positive
change in parents to other parent participants, even
though this ran contrary to their own observations of
how parent groups made the participants feel. In summary, the practitioners are aware that the intervention is
about helping parents understand why they are targets of
therapy; the practitioners are successful in doing this and
they are aware of their success in this regard, but they do
not attribute the changed state in parents (i.e., increased
confidence) to their own interpersonal work within the
intervention.
There was no evidence of flexibility in the area of outcomes of the intervention and how they were measured.
There was an indication that the practitioners in Pennington and Thomson’s study had ranked or analysed
the pre-intervention communication style in the parents
and were monitoring parents’ progression. The primary
outcome was change in parental communicative style,
and the process was speech and language therapists’
individual planning for each parent with a theory of
what would bring about change in this primary outcome. The practitioners did not talk about how parents
were active participants in the planning or measurement
of their own outcome.
Is there evidence for flexibility in accountability and confidence in the intervention? The analysis on proposition is
in Table 4. Despite the observation that parents want
speech and language therapists to impart their specialist
knowledge to them, the only evidence of any change in
role in terms of accountability and confidence is found in
the statement that after the intervention parents are willing to act as parent advocates for the intervention. Their
continued requirement for speech and language therapy at
the end of the intervention, the belief that the expertise in
the intervention remains with the speech and language
therapist, and the limited role that parents place in co-parents as co-learners shows that for parents the authority
and expertise remains with the speech and language therapists. The analysis also showed up clear differences

mapped on to the two exogenous processes of the NPM
need to be considered prior to the discussion of the findings. In part, the small number of studies is representative of the status of qualitative research in the field of
speech and language therapy. In a field that aligns itself
culturally with the medical profession, the generation of
evidence has relied primarily on quantitative research
designs. There were no other interventions, which are
widely used in routine paediatric speech and language
therapy practice, that had a qualitative research literature
suitable for this review. The absence of exploration of the
wider stakeholders’ views on the intervention and the
absence of data that could have been mapped on to the
exogenous factors in the qualitative research on the HPP
is a product of the intentions of the primary investigators
and their motivations for exploring the intervention. The
production of the qualitative evidence base on the HPP
was in large generated by academic speech and language
therapists. The clinical academics’ interest might explain
the predominance of intervention-specific data from
SLTs are responsible for assessing outcome of the HPP
Assessment is based on expert-knowledge of parent-child
interaction which is located in the SLT
qualitative research. The absence of data on the exogenous constructs of the model does not imply that skill-set
of workers and the organisational integration of the intervention is not relevant to the intervention. The HPP is an
intervention that can only be delivered by qualified
speech and language therapists, and is only delivered by
therapists who attend special training in HPP and pass
quality benchmarks for its use in clinical practice. Therefore, the intervention has a recognisable, well-bounded
location within the speech and language therapy work
force, which is suggestive of high potential towards
embedding within routine practice (mapping on to the
third construct of the NPM, that of skill-set workability).
In relation to the integration within the wider organisation, to date, the work force of speech and language therapy within the wider healthcare work force could be
described as having a well-defined and resourced responsibility for children with SLCN, and thus high potential
for this intervention to be integrated in the institution’s
work force. We might find that the changes in healthcare
commissioning and delivery in the UK and Bercow’s
recommendations for a wider distribution of the work to
support children with SLCN (with the implication that
this should extend well beyond speech and language
therapists) that future qualitative intervention research in
this field will probe the constructs that map on to the
exogenous processes of the NPM. This remains to be
seen.

Whilst the scope of the original research limits the
strength to which this study can test the applicability of
the NPM to speech and language therapy, the small number of papers does not appear to impact on the ability to
address the research questions on the applicability of the
endogenous constructs. The first testable component was
to find out whether the definitions, as set out in the earlier version of NPT, the NPM, could be used as a basis
for coding qualitative data on the successfully embedded
HPP. The results from the reflexive work with the main
authors of the NPM suggest that the qualitative data
were accurately coded using the endogenous constructs
within the NPM.
Having found that the constructs of the NPM provided
usable coding definitions for the qualitative data, the second step was to find out whether the application of the
model could uncover new understanding of how the
interpersonal work done by the participants of the intervention gave rise to its successful embedding in practice.
This review identified evidence of flexibility on the part
of the parents and practitioners. Speech and language
therapists adapted the intervention delivery on the basis
of the users’ perspective, and parents changed their
beliefs about the legitimate targets of the intervention;
they started with a belief that the practitioner should
work directly with the child, but accepted that the practitioner would work directly with them in order to achieve
change in the child. The concept of flexibility as a result
of collaborative work between parents and professionals
was not evident in any of the primary papers in the
review. It appears that the application of the NPM has
given rise to new way of thinking about the properties of
the intervention in supporting the flexible collective work
in the participants. In addition to the emergence of this
new concept, the application of the NPM also opened up
areas of incongruence between parents and practitioners’
views on how the outcome of the intervention should be
measured. Parents were more likely to rate success based
on a positive change in their child’s behaviour in a social
context, whereas practitioners were likely to measure
effectiveness by evaluating the specific linguistic behaviours of the parents. The proposition that arose from
this review was that greater congruence between parents’
and professionals’ goals could be built into the intervention with the likelihood of enhancing parental satisfaction
with intervention. Given the limited number of papers
currently available in the context of the HPP, judgements
about the full applicability of the NPT as an explanatory
framework for work being conducted within this field
remain tentative, however this early exploration of NPT
within this context shows promise because it could help
to shape the direction of the design and evaluation of
complex interventions as the field develops.

Evidence for testable propositions arising from this
review?
The third aim for this study was to find out whether new
testable propositions could be made about the factors
that are likely to support the potential for embedding
new interventions in the context of speech and language
therapy. In this review, there is evidence of wide discrepancy in perspectives of the parent and practitioner and
the network of other healthcare workers in relation to
the intervention. The HPP has become successfully
embedded in the UK; therefore, the finding of limited
flexibility in accountability and confidence runs contrary
to the predictions made by NPM. One reason could be
that parents and practitioners are happy to have relatively
passive parental roles within the clinical relationship and,
therefore, no work on this aspect of the intervention is
needed. In a qualitative study on parents’ views of speech
and language therapy in children with the most severe
speech and language difficulties, Rannard [5] found that
parents rate a partnership approach to their child’s needs
very positively. A partnership approach in educational
provision was identified as a process that helped parents
to change their initially negative opinion about special
educational provision when they had a preference for
mainstream education. We can learn from this that partnership working is valued by parents, they see it as a
mechanism that will bring about change in their child,
and there is evidence that team working by professionals
can enable parents to feel more satisfied with providerbased recommendations for their child. Having an intervention with distributed accountability that is demonstrable to parents appears to result in more parental
satisfaction. It seems that the issues of flexibility in
accountability and distribution of the intervention rests
with the healthcare provider side of the partnership.
When parents talk about getting a referral to speech
and language therapy services in the UK, they frequently
use words like ‘fight’ and ‘battle’ [1,5,6]. Rannard [5]
sampled 40 families and found an average time lag of two
years between the point when parents first had concerns
about their child and the point of referral to a speech and
language practitioner. Although some parents reported
that they had delayed seeking help because they thought
the child might grow out of the problem, in most other
cases parents said that delayed referral was due to problems in getting the primary healthcare professional to
refer to speech and language therapy. Like some parents,
primary care workers might also delay referral because of
their knowledge of wide variation in normal language
development, they might think that the child will eventually catch up. Alternatively, primary care workers
might delay referral due to more general beliefs about
speech and language therapy services, such as optimal

time for referral or the effectiveness of the intervention.
Primary care workers might also delay referral in order
to ration what is perceived to be a limited resource.
These are speculations, and at the present time we have
no data on which to build a proposition to explore the
primary care workers’ ‘gate keeping’ behaviour that parents find so frustrating. However, this review suggests
that more work on the distribution of speech and language interventions in paediatrics might be one design
component that, if improved, could give rise to more
satisfaction amongst parents over the speech and language therapy interventions that they receive. Thus, parental satisfaction may not only rely on the interpersonal
factors within the consultation that are considered to be
related to reported outcomes in primary care, such as
achieving therapeutic alliance and power sharing [30,31],
rather the distribution of the intervention within the
healthcare system should also be considered as a design
factor, amenable to change, that could enhance parents’
satisfaction with speech and language therapy.
This review suggests that the successful embedding of
this intervention has been largely due to the nature of the
interpersonal work that has been conducted within the
practitioner/parent relationship. However, within this construct it was clear that improvements could be made
within the intervention on the flexible accomplishment of
outcomes between practitioners and parents. The outcomes are considered to be negotiated within the interpersonal construct and, given the relative strength in that
area, the chances of improving outcome negotiation are
probably quite high. If the practitioners and parents could
establish meaningful parental outcomes from the intervention, this might also help them distribute the intervention
within the wider healthcare networks–a construct where
the intervention has relatively limited evidence of success.
Intervention outcomes that are aligned to the real-world
needs of the parents might provide data for non-specialists
healthcare workers with information that they would see
as valuable to the parents. This would be expected to
enhance confidence in the intervention. Additionally, parents might take on a more active role in establishing the
intervention within the network of health workers and
become more active parent advocates for the intervention.
We can see that parents attribute change to themselves as
a result of the intervention, if they were able to explain
how the changes they had made resulted in meaningful
changes for their child this would likely result in compelling case-study evidence for other healthcare workers and
other parents. Parents with this type of knowledge and
power base might be able to act as a gateway to the intervention for families who practitioners have found ‘hard to
reach.’ It would also provide practice-based evidence that
therapists could use to increase their own confidence in
Page 9 of 10
an intervention that has a relatively limited research evidence base.
Conclusion
This review demonstrates that the propositions within the
NPM and NPT can be applied to non-medical interventions within health such as the interventions of the allied
health professions. It could be used to help designers of
intervention research, who themselves are not specialists in
social theory, to explore the dynamic social processes that
are associated with embedding research innovations in
practice. At the current time, public dissatisfaction of the
wider context of service delivery to children with speech
language and communication needs is quite high. This
review uncovered new knowledge of the internal components of the intervention that were likely to have led to the
successful embedding of the HPP. It also found that the
intervention itself was poorly disturbed within the wider
health services. This raises a couple of questions. Are all
speech and language interventions poorly diffused within
the wider public services? If so, is the poor distribution of
speech and language therapy within public services a cause
of the more general public’s dissatisfaction with speech and
language therapy? I have proposed that working towards
greater congruence in the meaning of the intervention (by
working towards the family’s desired outcomes) could lead
to parents becoming greater advocates for the intervention
which itself could lead to better diffusion within the healthcare system thus generating a more fertile context into
which new innovation in speech and language therapy
could be expected to take root. This proposition could be
used in future design of interventions in speech and language therapy, and could also be tested in development
work in pre-phase one trials of new interventions.

Having an intervention with distributed accountability that is demonstrable to parents appears to result in more parental satisfaction. It seems that the issues of flexibility in accountability and distribution of the intervention rests with the healthcare provider side of the partnership. When parents talk about getting a referral to speech and language therapy services in the UK, they frequently use words like ‘fight’ and ‘battle’ [1,5,6]. Rannard [5] sampled 40 families and found an average time lag of two years between the point when parents first had concerns about their child and the point of referral to a speech and language practitioner. Although some parents reported that they had delayed seeking help because they thought the child might grow out of the problem, in most other cases parents said that delayed referral was due to problems in getting the primary healthcare professional to refer to speech and language therapy. Like some parents, primary care workers might also delay referral because of their knowledge of wid</context>

We might assume that the professional competency of speech and language therapists means that they are highly skilled in supporting the types of flexible co-construction that May says supports the normalisation of an intervention. If this is the case, then we might always expect to find evidence of flexible construction of agency in the context of speech and language therapy. Data from Baxendale et al. [8] suggest that this is not the case. They compared parental perspectives on the HPP with traditional clinicbased therapy following a randomised control trial of the two interventions. The expectations of all parents prior to speech and language therapy was that the therapy would be provided on a one-to-one basis with the practitioner providing the therapy in a clinic environment, and that the work would involve some direct elicitation procedures, such as helping the child imitate sounds or repeat sounds.

<context position="8263" citStr="[19]" startWordPosition="1217" endWordPosition="1217">. Public dissatisfaction with services is well documented. With new postBercow funding for intervention research, it is especially important that the potential implementation of new interventions is explored at an early stage so that, if found to be efficacious, new interventions can be quickly embedded within existing practice. The complex nature of the interventions and the diverse delivery conditions of those interventions across a range of public services provides a challenging context in which to design new interventions that can be embedded in practice for patient benefit. Murray et al. [19] suggested that Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) provides a framework that can be used to design and evaluate complex interventions to improve potentiality for implementation of research interventions in practice. Normalisation process theory The NPT [20] grew out of the Normalisation Process Model (NPM) [21] and May’s interest in understanding the work that is done by individuals and collectives of people to get innovation normalised as part of everyday practice in the context of healthcare delivery. An original concept of the NPM concerned the way healthcare interventions are co-constructe</context>

According to the NPM, interventions that develop evaluation protocols based on how all the participants attribute meaning to the intervention will tend to be more successful in their ability to become embedded in practice. Applying Normalisation Process Model to speech and language therapy Despite the influence of the Medical Research Council’s guidance for designing complex interventions [22], there is an acknowledgement that results from intervention research, specifically randomised controlled trials, often fail to provide useful information [19]. Campbell et al. attribute this to a lack of theoretically motivated groundwork in the initial stages of the intervention design [23]. They highlight the opportunity to draw on health psychology and social theory to fully explore and model the multiple and complex mechanisms of change in intervention design. If the time-limited opportunity for more intervention research in speech and language therapy is to have maximum effect in public services, then raising the profile of the role of health psychology and social theory to the research designers in the field is warranted.

The next step was to map the recurrent themes on to the constructs of the NPM [20]. The existing published research on the HPP did not contain data that was relevant to the two exogenous components of the NPM, but there were recurrent themes that mapped on to the two endogenous constructs of the model. The next step was to isolate all the quotations that were reported in the three papers that included data from semi-structured interviews of focus groups. All the direct quotations were taken out of the thematic context in which they had been grouped in the original research. They were read and then considered for inclusion into a construct map of the NPM endogenous factors. </context>

According to May, an intervention that gets embedded in practice is likely to be one that allows flexible accomplishment of both congruence and disposal. The emphasis is on the flexibility needed for parties to combine their ideas and beliefs (congruence) and make them concrete in outcomes that are meaningful to both parties (disposal). According to the proposition in the model, the successfully embedded HPP should reveal Focus Groups with SLTs Thematic analysis evidence of flexible interpersonal work between practitioner and parent. The second endogenous process defined by May [20], named Relational Integration, covers the network of relations in which the clinical work is embedded. According to May, this network of relations is how the knowledge and practice of the intervention is defined and mediated. This is comprised of two dimensions, accountability and confidence. Accountability refers to internal network and has three components. These are: validity of the knowledge associated with the intervention, which includes ways in which disputes about that knowledge are minimised and the distribution of the knowledge within the hierarchies in the network; expertise, belie</context>

The complex nature of the interventions and the diverse delivery conditions of those interventions across a range of public services provides a challenging context in which to design new interventions that can be embedded in practice for patient benefit. Murray et al. [19] suggested that Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) provides a framework that can be used to design and evaluate complex interventions to improve potentiality for implementation of research interventions in practice. Normalisation process theory The NPT [20] grew out of the Normalisation Process Model (NPM) [21] and May’s interest in understanding the work that is done by individuals and collectives of people to get innovation normalised as part of everyday practice in the context of healthcare delivery. An original concept of the NPM concerned the way healthcare interventions are co-constructed between different agents in the intervention (patient, provider, and other healthcare workers). The role of collective action was characterised as one of four main types of work in the subsequent NPT. The NPM offers a set of explanatory propositions of how different internal intervention elements and external</context>

The pediatric speech and language therapy intervention that was commonly used the UK and had the most number of published studies of qualitative research as identified. The Hanen Parent Programme (HPP) originated in the US [28] and it has become embedded in practice throughout the UK during the past ten to fifteen years. The intervention uses an indirect method of therapy, which means that the practitioner works through another agent in order to achieve change in the child. In this case, the agent of therapy is the mother or caregiver. The practitioner uses video footage to help parents, who attend in groups, to see how they could adapt their own interaction to support the development of communication in their child. The communication targets can be verbal or non-verbal, making this a useful intervention for a wide </context>

Is there evidence of flexible interpersonal work between practitioner and parent? The data in Table 3 show several areas of flexibility, and this is particularly evident in the parents. Parents start off expecting the child to be the focus of therapy (co-operation, legitimacy, and conduct), but the data on disposal (goals and meaning) show that parents have accepted that they are the legitimate target of therapy in the HPP. In focus groups with speech and language therapists, Pennington and Thompson [29] reported that the speech and language therapists valued how the parents had been able to adopt a totally different approach, they related this change in parents’ communicative style positively, and they attributed the change to the content and delivery of the programme. The evidence of flexibility in practitioners is less noticeable, but there is evidence that they adjust the components of therapy according to parental feedback (see Goals).
