Abstract Altered nasality influences speech intelligibility. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has proved
suitable for quantifying speech intelligibility in patients
with different degrees of nasal emissions. We investigated
the influence of hyponasality on the results of speech recognition before and after nasal surgery using ASR. Speech
recordings, nasal peak inspiratory flow and self-perception
measurements were carried out in 20 German-speaking
patients (8 women, 12 men; aged 38 ± 22 years) who
underwent surgery for various nasal and sinus pathologies.
The degree of speech intelligibility was quantified as the
percentage of correctly recognized words of a standardized
word chain by ASR (word recognition rate; WR). WR was
measured 1 day before (t1), 1 day after with nasal packings
(t2), and 3 months after (t3) surgery; nasal peak flow on t1
and t3. WR was calculated with program for the automatic
evaluation of all kinds of speech disorders (PEAKS). WR
as a parameter of speech intelligibility was significantly
decreased immediately after surgery (t1 vs. t2 p \ 0.01)
but increased 3 months after surgery (t2 vs. t3 p \ 0.01).

WR showed no association with age or gender. There was
no significant difference between WR at t1 and t3, despite a

measurements. The results show that ASR is capable of
quantifying the influence of hyponasality on speech; nasal
obstruction leads to significantly reduced WR and nasal

Introduction
Speech is a superior achievement of human communication, demonstrating the ability to present thoughts with
articulation and voice [1]. Voice is itself determined by two
factors, the voice source and the vocal tract. Anatomically,
the larynx serves as tone generator [2]. This primary signal
is further modulated by characteristics of the cross-sectional area of the vocal tract, involving the supraglottic
space, including the pharynx, nasal cavity, and paranasal
sinuses [2]. Even minor alterations in these structures may
lead to changes in voice and thereby influence speech
intelligibility.
Research in this field has focused on various factors that
influence speech intelligibility. Studies have been undertaken to assess speech quality in patients with cleft palate,
motor speech disorders, and hearing impairment [3–5].
However, the relationship between speech intelligibility,
nose and sinus pathologies, as well as the effects of surgical
treatments, has not been adequately explored [6]. In contrast, several studies have investigated sinus symptoms
such as nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, loss of smell etc.,
</bodyText>

in attempts to identify the most suitable techniques for
surgery to nose and paranasal sinuses [7–11].
Research on the function of the sinuses themselves has
been carried out for many years [12–14]. In addition to the
important functions of air-conditioning, olfaction, and filtering, pneumatisation may serve to decrease the weight of
the head, and sinuses are assumed an important acoustic
resonator modulating voice [6, 15]. The secretory mucosal
function, with active convection of water into the sinuses,
leads to saturation of the inspiratory air with water [16].
One of the main functions of surgery on pathologies of
nose and paranasal sinuses is to increase aeration, in order
to reduce inflammation in these cavities [17].
Changes in nasality are thought to influence speech
intelligibility [6]. Nasal obstruction, especially of the nasal
cavity, is one of the main factors in decreasing nasality [5].
Often the presence of hyponasality is of minor interest in
clinical evaluations, even though it is of major interest for
patients—especially with high demands on their speech.
However, speech evaluation prior to endonasal surgery is
neither routinely performed nor standardized. Perceptual
evaluation by several listeners is presently accepted as an
‘‘objective’’ assessment of nasality. Here, nasal vowels
such as /m/, /n/, and /ng/ are altered or replaced by
pre-nasal plosives. It appears as decreased nasal resonance
with a dull, obstructed-sounding voice. If consonants,
especially voiced plosives, are substituted with correspondent nasalized consonants, hypernasality is present.
Air leaks through the nose, the intraoral pressure of air is
reduced, and the acuity of oral consonants is decreased [18]
by changing resonance functions and altered formant
structure of the phoneme [19]. MRI studies of the spectral
characteristics of human nasal sounds showed that the
paranasal sinuses have an important role in shaping these
functions [20]. Further investigation of the effects of sinus
surgery supported this assumption [6, 21].
Recently, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system was used for the objective assessment of speech
intelligibility and showed very good concordance with
perceptual evaluation [3, 4, 22].
ASR is usually used for automatic communication systems in order to recognize speech, e.g., for telephone or
dictating systems. It relies on the analysis of acoustic
properties of speech and often includes phonetic and
linguistic knowledge using stochastic methods [23, 24]. ASR
is now increasingly being used to quantify speech alterations
for medical purposes [25]. For the ASR system presented
here, the percentage of correctly recognized words of a
known sequence (word recognition rate; WR) corresponds to
speech intelligibility. Thus, the method can be used to
evaluate global speech quality. In previous investigations, it
has shown a diminished degree of intelligibility in children
with increased nasality due to cleft palate [26].

It is important to learn more about the effects of nose
and sinus surgery on speech intelligibility and also to
investigate short-, as well as long-term changes after surgery. Here we present the first data on the use of an ASR
system to measure the speech intelligibility of patients with
pathology of nose and paranasal sinuses.

speech training. Patients were admitted for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), septal deviation, rhinoplasty, and combinations of these diseases.
All patients underwent endoscopy of the nose, nasopharynx, and larynx prior to standardized speech recordings immediately before surgery (t1), on the first
postoperative day with nasal packings (t2), and 3 months
after surgery (t3). On each occasion, patients were also
asked about their general health, sinus condition, and
condition of nasal resonance, that were both recorded using
a visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS scale included
scores from 1 (excellent) to 10 (extremely bad), respectively. Surgery consisted of either rhinoplasty and/or
endoscopic sinus surgery, using the surgical techniques of
Wigand [17, 27, 28]. All patients had bilateral nasal
packing on the first postoperative day (t2).
Nasal peak inspiratory flow measurements
Nasal flow was measured using the nasal peak inspiratory flow meter (nPIF) (In Check; Clement Clarke,
Harlow, UK) at voice recording sessions, t1 and t3. Total
nasal inspiratory flow was measured with a peak
flow device while closing the mouth with an adjusted
naso-oral mask.
Automatic speech recognition
Standardized speech recordings of the patients were performed digitally with a dnt Call4you head-set (16 kHz/16
bit) at t1–t3 as described earlier and analyzed using
PEAKS [4, 29–31]. The ASR system used a unigram
speech model excluding syntactic knowledge, in order to
emphasize acoustic characteristics of speech. It was polyphone-based, including co-articulatory phonetic properties.
WR was calculated as the percentage of correctly recognized words of the standard text ‘‘Der Nordwind und die
Sonne’’. It is a phonetically balanced text with 71 different
words.

The WR at the time of each speech recording session was
calculated. The mean WR for the pre-operative speech
recording (t1) was 65.7 ± 16.5% (47.2% min, 78.7% max)
(Table 1). At t1, one patient reached a WR of only 4.6%
due to microphone problems during recording and that
information was excluded from further calculations.
Female patients had a slightly higher WR at t1 (mean
71.2 ± 5.5%) than males (mean 67.2 ± 9.9%), with a
smaller range of results (Table 1; Fig. 1). Age showed no
influence on WR (Table 2).
The mean WR at the second speech recording session on
the first post-operative day (t2), still with nasal packing,
was 55.7 ± 12.8% (32.4% min, 80.6% max) for the whole
study group (Table 1). For female patients, the mean WR
was 61.7 ± 13.4% and for male patients 51.6 ± 11.1%
(Table 1; Fig. 1). Results in female patients tended to show
greater scatter than in males.
Three months postoperatively (t3), mean WR had
increased to 68 ± 5.3% (57.4% min, 75.9% max) and the
degree of scatter was non-significantly lower compared
with t1 and t2 (Table 1). In this context the lowest WR
result at t3 measured about 10 points higher than at t1 and
also the whole study group showed fewer outliers, so the
degree of scatter of WR results became lower in t3. Gender
had no relevant influence on WR results, with a mean of
69.8 ± 3.3% for female and 66.8 ± 6.1% for male
patients. The range of WR results was again smaller in
women than in men (Table 1; Fig. 1).
Comparison of the results between the first (t1) and the
last (t3) speech recording sessions did not show a significant difference in mean WR (p = 1.0). However, there was

measured with the nasal peak inspiratory flow meter
(nPIF). The mean preoperative nasal peak flow was

and after surgery of nose and paranasal sinuses. Measurements during total nasal obstruction with bilateral nasal
packing were performed to demonstrate the influence of
changes in nasality on ASR. The study group consisted of
consecutively admitted patients for nasal/sinus surgery.
A broad spectrum of diseases was included in order to
measure a wide range of speech characteristics as shown in
Fig. 2 and Tables 1 and 2. Data included 59 speech samples (WR at t1 was excluded from one patient for reasons
described earlier) and 40 measurements of nasal inspiratory
flow using the nasal peak inspiratory flow meter from 20
patients.
The generation of universal parameters for reporting
speech outcomes in individuals has been the aim of a
number of studies focusing on different components of
speech [5, 33, 34].
The quality of phonetic implementation of words, and
therefore the evaluation of speech intelligibility, serves as
global evaluation of quality of speech. The percentage of
correctly identified words is a measure of speech intelligibility [26]. Of course, a speech recognition system does
not understand the speech as a human listener would. The
subjective factor—meaning the interpretation and processing of perceived speech in the respective brain areas—
is also a relevant criterion for a human observer. Voice
quality, phonetic and morpho-syntactic structure, background noises, loudness, and rate of speech all influence
perception. Context and prosodic elements in particular
contribute to a better understanding of a human listener.
That is why speech intelligibility is often rated differently
by differently experienced and competent listeners and
limits the reliability of the perceptual evaluation of speech.
It is also known that other factors such as the speaker
and his native tongue, the speaking style, vocabulary,
grammatical complexity, and acoustic properties of the
recording system can greatly affect ASR. In the present
study, a standardized procedure was used in order to
exclude the above-mentioned confounding factors and
others such as perplexity of speech and free- versus read
Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol (2010) 267:1719–1725
speech [35]. By using a standard text (‘‘Der Nordwind und
die Sonne’’) and stable recording conditions, the impact of
most of these factors on ASR and the subsequent analysis
of results was minimized.
The percentage of correctly identified words of a word
sequence, which is defined as the WR, has been shown to
correspond to speech intelligibility—as demonstrated previously for children and adults with phonetic disorders
[4, 22]. Moreover, since the system excludes semantic and
syntactic knowledge, the method is more precise and
accurate than the usually used perceptual evaluations
summarized from several listeners. Of course, no information about acceptability or esthetic appearance of speech
can be provided by ASR.
The ASR system is trained with 6.9 h of adult speech in
order to model a ‘‘standard’’ listener. Unlike perceptual
evaluation by human listeners, it is not affected by perceptual and subjective influences [3]. Evaluation of the
same speech data will always lead to the same result.
Therefore, speech recognition is an objective and accurate
tool for the measurement of speech intelligibility [22]. ASR
is based on the statistical modeling of the acoustic and
linguistic features of human speech. In this study we
focussed on the acoustic features of speech [36].
The results of WR in this study population never
reached 100%, which one might expect for normal
speakers. However, similar results were obtained in previous studies with the same ASR system where the WR
also did not reach 100% [4]. This is due to limitations of
the method and these consistent results show there is nonsystematic influences.
Given that there is still no gold standard for the perception of spoken speech rather than merely vowels, we
consider ASR to be the best method in that regard. The
ASR system used here has already been employed in
several previous studies. Of course, as an objective method,
the intention is for this system to be used in other
languages. Ongoing tests with different languages have
already produced promising preliminary results [37].
Age had no significant influence on WR in this study
because the study population was rather small. However,
the effects of age on WR have recently been demonstrated
by Wilpon [38], for children [26, 39]. In adults, similar
results were found after total laryngectomy [4] and in
patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma [22].
An increase of hyponasality and decrease of speech
intelligibility is generally assumed to occur as the severity
of sinus diseases and obstruction-inducing nasal deformities increases [15]. Surgical interventions aiming to relieve
such conditions ought to improve speech intelligibility
[40]. However, the population in the present study was too
small to allow further statistic evaluations. Previous
investigations of a similar design also had small study
</bodyText>

populations and varying surgical interventions [6, 21, 40].
Those evaluations primarily focused on speech analysis
based on single vocals and consonant variations [6, 21].
However, the main aim of this study was to evaluate
speech intelligibility using the ASR system for the first
time in a study population as defined above. Consistency
regarding the extent of surgery of nose and sinuses lay
outside the primary focus of this study, but led us to the
initiation of further studies looking specifically at different
surgical interventions. An interesting study done by Yue
et al. [41] studied changes in resonance characteristics of
the nasal cavity and nasal airway resistance after endoscopic sinus surgery, with pre-operative staging of the
chronic sinusitis. They concluded that nasality cannot be
ameliorated immediately after surgery, to which we would
agree.
Comparison of speech intelligibility in this study measured by ASR at t1 and t3 showed minimal differences in
WR rates. A significant reduction in speech intelligibility
was only demonstrated at t2 when participants had nasal
packings—a situation only tolerated in the context of nose/
sinus surgery. Total obstruction of the nasal cavity with
nasal packings caused maximal hyponasality analogous to
nasal obstruction caused by nasal and sinus pathologies. It
can be concluded that hyponasality induced by total
obstruction of the nasal cavity significantly influences
speech intelligibility. Hence the ASR system does help to
evaluate speech intelligibility. Similar results have been
shown for spectral properties of consonants and nasalized
vowels before and after surgery [21] and the testing of
nasalance with nasalized sentences [15].
Nevertheless, our results may be interpreted in different
ways. First, an insignificant difference between pre- and
post-operative speech intelligibility results may reassure
patients that they do not need to expect major voice
changes. On the other hand, expectations to improve
hyponasality as the main intention for surgery need to be
lowered. It may also be argued that the ASR system used
was incapable of detecting small changes in nasality.
There are reports in the literature of similar studies that
attempted to establish methods and parameters to determine, for example, if there is a relationship between
chronic sinusitis and dysphonia. However, these studies
demonstrated that, due to the small changes, more effort
needs to be directed at increasing the size of the study
population [42].
Interestingly in the clinical daily routine, patients often
present with massive nasal polyposis or septal deviation,
whose hyponasality is less prominent than in patients with
acute onset of rhinosinusitis. Hence, changes in nasal flow
and pressure in the nasal cavity and sinuses may be less
relevant for speech when they are chronic and persistent,
whereas acute changes are more significant. Other

components such as the velopharyngeal opening may play
an important role [43].
Measurement of the degree of nasal obstruction by
nasal inspiratory peak flow demonstrated that no patient
had complete obstruction of the nasal cavity, either at
time point t1 or t3. We found no correlation of speech
intelligibility and nasal inspiratory peak flow. Studies on
nasal flow and the percentage of laminar and turbulent
nasal flow have been carried out using various models
[44–46]. These studies led to a primarily functional
approach in septal surgery, but no evaluation of speech
was undertaken.
Conclusion
Automatic speech recognition can quantify the influence of
hyponasality on speech. Nasal obstruction leads to significantly reduced WR. Nasal peak flow cannot replace
evaluation of nasality. Furthermore, the consequences of
different nasal diseases or surgical procedures on nasality
and speech need to be investigated.

MRI studies of the spectral characteristics of human nasal sounds showed that the paranasal sinuses have an important role in shaping these functions [20]. Further investigation of the effects of sinus surgery supported this assumption [6, 21]. Recently, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system was used for the objective assessment of speech intelligibility and showed very good concordance with perceptual evaluation [3, 4, 22]. ASR is usually used for automatic communication systems in order to recognize speech, e.g., for telephone or dictating systems. It relies on the analysis of acoustic properties of speech and often includes phonetic and linguistic knowledge using stochastic methods [23, 24].

Moreover, since the system excludes semantic and syntactic knowledge, the method is more precise and accurate than the usually used perceptual evaluations summarized from several listeners. Of course, no information about acceptability or esthetic appearance of speech can be provided by ASR. The ASR system is trained with 6.9 h of adult speech in order to model a ‘‘standard’’ listener. Unlike perceptual evaluation by human listeners, it is not affected by perceptual and subjective influences [3]. Evaluation of the same speech data will always lead to the same result. Therefore, speech recognition is an objective and accurate tool for the measurement of speech intelligibility [22]. ASR is based on the statistical modeling of the acoustic and linguistic features of human speech. In this study we focussed on the acoustic features of speech [36]. The results of WR in this study population never reached 100%, which one might expect for normal speakers. However, similar results were obtained in previous studies with the same ASR system where the WR also did not reach 100% [4]. This is due </context>

The ASR system used here has already been employed in several previous studies. Of course, as an objective method, the intention is for this system to be used in other languages. Ongoing tests with different languages have already produced promising preliminary results [37]. Age had no significant influence on WR in this study because the study population was rather small. However, the effects of age on WR have recently been demonstrated by Wilpon [38], for children [26, 39]. In adults, similar results were found after total laryngectomy [4] and in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma [22]. An increase of hyponasality and decrease of speech intelligibility is generally assumed to occur as the severity of sinus diseases and obstruction-inducing nasal deformities increases [15]. Surgical interventions aiming to relieve such conditions ought to improve speech intelligibility [40]. However, the population in the present study was too small to allow further statistic evaluations.

The secretory mucosal function, with active convection of water into the sinuses, leads to saturation of the inspiratory air with water [16]. One of the main functions of surgery on pathologies of nose and paranasal sinuses is to increase aeration, in order to reduce inflammation in these cavities [17]. Changes in nasality are thought to influence speech intelligibility [6]. Nasal obstruction, especially of the nasal cavity, is one of the main factors in decreasing nasality [5]. Often the presence of hyponasality is of minor interest in clinical evaluations, even though it is of major interest for patients—especially with high demands on their speech. However, speech evaluation prior to endonasal surgery is neither routinely performed nor standardized. Perceptual evaluation by several listeners is presently accepted as an ‘‘objective’’ assessment of nasality. Here, nasal vowels such as /m/, /n/, and /ng/ are altered or replaced by pre-nasal plosives. It appears as decreased nasal resonance with a dull, obstructed-sounding voice.

A broad spectrum of diseases was included in order to measure a wide range of speech characteristics as shown in Fig. 2 and Tables 1 and 2. Data included 59 speech samples (WR at t1 was excluded from one patient for reasons described earlier) and 40 measurements of nasal inspiratory flow using the nasal peak inspiratory flow meter from 20 patients. The generation of universal parameters for reporting speech outcomes in individuals has been the aim of a number of studies focusing on different components of speech [5, 33, 34]. The quality of phonetic implementation of words, and therefore the evaluation of speech intelligibility, serves as global evaluation of quality of speech. The percentage of correctly identified words is a measure of speech intelligibility [26]. Of course, a speech recognition system does not understand the speech as a human listener would. The subjective factor—meaning the interpretation and processing of perceived speech in the respective brain areas— is also a relevant criterion for a human observer.

Research in this field has focused on various factors that influence speech intelligibility. Studies have been undertaken to assess speech quality in patients with cleft palate, motor speech disorders, and hearing impairment [3–5]. However, the relationship between speech intelligibility, nose and sinus pathologies, as well as the effects of surgical treatments, has not been adequately explored [6]. In contrast, several studies have investigated sinus symptoms such as nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, loss of smell etc., 123 1720 in attempts to identify the most suitable techniques for surgery to nose and paranasal sinuses [7–11]. Research on the function of the sinuses themselves has been carried out for many years [12–14]. In addition to the important functions of air-conditioning, olfaction, and filtering, pneumatisation may serve to decrease the weight of the head, and sinuses are assumed an important acoustic resonator modulating voice [6, 15].

However, the effects of age on WR have recently been demonstrated by Wilpon [38], for children [26, 39]. In adults, similar results were found after total laryngectomy [4] and in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma [22]. An increase of hyponasality and decrease of speech intelligibility is generally assumed to occur as the severity of sinus diseases and obstruction-inducing nasal deformities increases [15]. Surgical interventions aiming to relieve such conditions ought to improve speech intelligibility [40]. However, the population in the present study was too small to allow further statistic evaluations. Previous investigations of a similar design also had small study 1723 populations and varying surgical interventions [6, 21, 40].

Total obstruction of the nasal cavity with nasal packings caused maximal hyponasality analogous to nasal obstruction caused by nasal and sinus pathologies.

Hence the ASR system does help to evaluate speech intelligibility. Similar results have been shown for spectral properties of consonants and nasalized vowels before and after surgery [21] and the testing of nasalance with nasalized sentences [15]. Nevertheless, our results may be interpreted in different ways. First, an insignificant difference between pre- and post-operative speech intelligibility results may reassure patients that they do not need to expect major voice changes. On the other hand, expectations to improve hyponasality as the main intention for surgery need to be lowered. It may also be argued that the ASR system used was incapable of detecting small changes in nasality.

On each occasion, patients were also asked about their general health, sinus condition, and condition of nasal resonance, that were both recorded using a visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS scale included scores from 1 (excellent) to 10 (extremely bad), respectively. Surgery consisted of either rhinoplasty and/or endoscopic sinus surgery, using the surgical techniques of Wigand [17, 27, 28]. All patients had bilateral nasal packing on the first postoperative day (t2).

By using a standard text (‘‘Der Nordwind und die Sonne’’) and stable recording conditions, the impact of most of these factors on ASR and the subsequent analysis of results was minimized. The percentage of correctly identified words of a word sequence, which is defined as the WR, has been shown to correspond to speech intelligibility—as demonstrated previously for children and adults with phonetic disorders [4, 22]. Moreover, since the system excludes semantic and syntactic knowledge, the method is more precise and accurate than the usually used perceptual evaluations summarized from several listeners. Of course, no information about acceptability or esthetic appearance of speech can be provided by ASR. The ASR system is trained with 6.9 h of adult speech in order to model a ‘‘standard’’ listener. Unlike perceptual evaluation by human listeners, it is not affected by perceptual and subjective influences [3]. Evaluation of the same speech data will always lead to the same result.

ASR is now increasingly being used to quantify speech alterations for medical purposes [25]. For the ASR system presented here, the percentage of correctly recognized words of a known sequence (word recognition rate; WR) corresponds to speech intelligibility. Thus, the method can be used to evaluate global speech quality. In previous investigations, it has shown a diminished degree of intelligibility in children with increased nasality due to cleft palate [26]. 123 Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol (2010) 267:1719–1725 It is important to learn more about the effects of nose and sinus surgery on speech intelligibility and also to investigate short-, as well as long-term changes after surgery. Here we present the first data on the use of an ASR system to measure the speech intelligibility of patients with pathology of nose and paranasal sinuses. Participants and methods Twenty adult patients, who were admitted to an academic tertiary referral center from April to July 2007 for surgery of the nose and/or paranasal sinuses, were included in this study (Table 1</context>

The generation of universal parameters for reporting speech outcomes in individuals has been the aim of a number of studies focusing on different components of speech [5, 33, 34]. The quality of phonetic implementation of words, and therefore the evaluation of speech intelligibility, serves as global evaluation of quality of speech. The percentage of correctly identified words is a measure of speech intelligibility [26]. Of course, a speech recognition system does not understand the speech as a human listener would. The subjective factor—meaning the interpretation and processing of perceived speech in the respective brain areas— is also a relevant criterion for a human observer. Voice quality, phonetic and morpho-syntactic structure, background noises, loudness, and rate of speech all influence perception.

In adults, similar results were found after total laryngectomy [4] and in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma [22].

It is also known that other factors such as the speaker and his native tongue, the speaking style, vocabulary, grammatical complexity, and acoustic properties of the recording system can greatly affect ASR. In the present study, a standardized procedure was used in order to exclude the above-mentioned confounding factors and others such as perplexity of speech and free- versus read Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol (2010) 267:1719–1725 speech [35]. By using a standard text (‘‘Der Nordwind und die Sonne’’) and stable recording conditions, the impact of most of these factors on ASR and the subsequent analysis of results was minimized. The percentage of correctly identified words of a word sequence, which is defined as the WR, has been shown to correspond to speech intelligibility—as demonstrated previously for children and adults with phonetic disorders [4, 22].

The ASR system is trained with 6.9 h of adult speech in order to model a ‘‘standard’’ listener. Unlike perceptual evaluation by human listeners, it is not affected by perceptual and subjective influences [3]. Evaluation of the same speech data will always lead to the same result. Therefore, speech recognition is an objective and accurate tool for the measurement of speech intelligibility [22]. ASR is based on the statistical modeling of the acoustic and linguistic features of human speech. In this study we focussed on the acoustic features of speech [36]. The results of WR in this study population never reached 100%, which one might expect for normal speakers. However, similar results were obtained in previous studies with the same ASR system where the WR also did not reach 100% [4]. This is due to limitations of the method and these consistent results show there is nonsystematic influences. Given that there is still no gold standard for the perception of spoken speech rather than merely vowels, we consider ASR to be the best method in that regard.
