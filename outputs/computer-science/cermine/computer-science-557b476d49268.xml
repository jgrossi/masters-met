        <p>-The C Programming Language is one of the most popular teaching programming languages. It is generally considered that the computer programming time that a student spent on his homework directly affects his grade of the C Programming Language. There is little research regarding the correlation of students' computer programming time and their test grades. The computer programming time, grades of final test and the Zhejiang Computer Grade Test Band II (ZCGTBII) of students from a teaching class are collected. The students are divided into two groups based on their programming time. The T-Test is employed to analyze grades of final test and the ZCGTBII of the two groups. Analysis results show that the mean and the passing rates of final test and the ZCGTBII of Group I are greater than those of Group II. Therefore, we conclude that the amount of time students spend practicing programming on computers plays a very important role towards mastering the C Programming Language.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The C programming language is one of the most widely
used programming languages in industry [1][2]. It is also one
of the most popular teaching programming languages [3]-[7].
Harry H. Cheng listed ten good reasons to teach and learn the
C programming language [7]. To learn the C programming
language, a student needs to practice programming on
computers. It is generally considered that the computer
programming time of a student directly affects his
performance on the course of the C programming language.
There is little research regarding the effects of computer
programming time and a student's progress learning the C
programming language. Some experimental teaching
systems and reforms were presented in [8][9]. Educational
data mining methods were reviewed in [10]-[12].</p>
      <p>In this paper, the computer programming time on
homework, final grades and grades of the Zhejiang
Computer Grade Test Band II (ZCGTBII) of students from a
teaching class are collected. The Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit
Test is used to verify that final grades and ZCGTBII grades
of this teaching class subject to the normal distribution. This
is what we expect to be. Students of this teaching class are
divided into two groups based on students’ computer
programming time on homework and minimum computer
programming time on homework that the course of the C
programming language syllabus prescribed for a student to
learn this course. Group I is the students whose total
computer programming time on homework is greater than or
equal to the minimum computer programming time on
homework. Group II is the students whose total computer
programming time on homework is less than the minimum
total computer programming time on homework. The
TwoSample Pooled T-Test is employed to analyze the final
grades and the ZCGTBII grades of the two groups of
students.</p>
      <p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
gives an overview of some hypothesis tests that will be used
in following sections. Section III introduces how to collect
the analysis data. Section IV presents students’ grades
analysis methods. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section
V.</p>

      <title>HYPOTHESIS TEST OVERVIEW</title>
      <p>The Chi-square Goodness-of-Fit Test is used to test if a
sample of data comes from a population with a specific
distribution [13]. Given a random samples of measurements,</p>
      <p>X n , The chi-square test is defined for the
H0: The data follow a specified distribution.
* This work is partially supported by Zhejiang new century higher education reform project under Grant No. yb2010023, the Bilingual
Education Model Curriculum of Ministry of Education of China.
Ha: The data do not follow the specified distribution.</p>
      <p>Test Statistic: For the chi-square goodness-of-fit
computation, the data are divided into k bins and the test
statistic is defined as</p>
      <p>(Oi − Ei ) 2 / Ei</p>
      <p>Where Oi is the observed frequency for bin i and Ei is
the expected frequency for bin i . The expected frequency is
calculated by</p>
      <p>Ei = N (F (Yu ) − F (Yl ))</p>
      <p>Where F is the cumulative distribution function for the
distribution being tested, Yu is the upper limit for class i , Yl
is the lower limit for class i and N is the sample size.</p>
      <p>The test statistic follows, approximately, a chi-square
distribution with (k − r − 1) degrees of freedom where k is
the number of non-empty cells and r is the number of
estimated parameters.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the hypothesis that the data are from a
population with the specified distribution is rejected if</p>
      <p>Where χ (2α ,k −r−1) is the chi-square percent point function
with (k − r − 1) degrees of freedom and a significance level
ofα .</p>

n1 i =1
S1 =
(Yi − Y )2 , S2 =</p>
      <p>(Zi − Z )2</p>
      <p>The test statistic F follows F-distribution with the
numerator degrees of freedom v1 = n − 1 and denominator</p>
      <p>1
degrees of freedom v2 = n2 − 1 . Therefore, the hypothesis
H0 is rejected if:
n2 i =1
F ≥ Fα / 2,v1,v2 or F ≤ F1−α / 2,v1,v2</p>
      <p>Where Fα / 2,v1,v2 , F1−α / 2,v1,v2 are the F-value with
v1 = n − 1 and v2 = n2 − 1 degrees of freedom and a</p>

      <title>DATA COLLECTION</title>
      <p>According to teaching syllabus of the course of the C
Programming Language revised in 2008 [15], teaching
activities include 16 lectures and 16 computer programming
classes. Each lecture has two class hours and each computer
programming class has three class hours. There is homework
after each computer programming class. Students are asked
to spend at least three hours working on a programming
assignment in our public computer centers.</p>
      <p>In order to analyze the relation between students’ grades
and the time that students spent on programming after
classes, one of C programming teaching classes is selected.
This teaching class has 84 students. Students’ final grades
and grades of the Zhejiang Computer Grade Test Band II
(ZCGTBII) are collected, as shown in column two and three
of TABLE I. The statistics graph of students’ final grades
and the ZCGTBII grades are made, as shown in Figure 1 and
Figure 2, respectively.</p>
      <p>Students programming time can be divided into two
parts. One is the time of computer programming classes. The
other, which is called the computer programming
time on</p>
      <p>GRADES AND HOMEWORK PROGRAMMING TIME OF A</p>
      <p>TEACHING CLASS.</p>
      <p>Homework Programming Time</p>
      <p>(Min.)
homework, is the time that students used to do their
homework after classes. The former is the same to each
student, thus when analyzing students programming time,
this part will be subtracted.</p>
      <p>In our university, students do their C Programming
Language homework in our public computer centers. Thus
the computer programming time on homework of a student
can be extracted from the Homework System that is
developed to collect students’ homework online, and the
Computer Laboratory Management System (CLMS) which
is installed in our public computer centers to manage the
usage of the computers. Because there has a record when a
student commits his homework in the Homework System,
and there has a record when a student starts using a computer
and how long does it last in the CLMS. The computer
programming time on homework of a student is summed
from each time period that he (or she) uses a computer in
public computer centers between the ends of each computer
programming class and the moment that he (or she) commits
his (or her) homework.</p>
      <p>The total computer programming time on homework is a
student spending on all homework assignments of the course
of the C Programming Language. Because there have 16
homework assignments for the C Programming Language,
thus, the total computer programming time on homework is a
sum of each computer programming time on homework. The
total computer programming time on homework of each
student is listed in column four of TABLE II.</p>
      <p>STUDENTS’ GRADES ANALYSIS METHOD</p>
      <p>Different students have different final grades and
ZCGTBII grades, because they have different efforts on the
course of the C Programming Language. Thus students’ final
grades and ZCGTBII grades are considered random
variables. The hypothesis tests that mentioned in section II
can be employed to analyze students’ grades. Firstly the
ChiSquare goodness-of-fit test is employed to test if students’
final grades and ZCGTBII grades are following the normal
distribution, which is expected to be. Then the Two-Sample
Pooled T-Test is used to test if students who spend more
computer programming time on homework get better scores
than those of who spend less computer programming time on
homework.</p>
      <p>A. Grades distribution hypothesis testing
1) Students’ final grades distribution hypothesis testing
The hypothesis is:</p>
      <p>Ha: the students’ final grades X do not follow the</p>
      <p>deviation of X , respectively.</p>
      <p>The test statistic is calculated in TABLE II.
Here, n = 84 , k = 4 , r = 2 . The significance level α is
select toα = 0.01 . Thus, if H0 is true, the test statistic
follows, approximately, a chi-square distribution with
(k − r − 1) = 1 degrees of freedom.</p>
      <p>As shown in TABLE II:</p>
      <p>Thus, hypothesis H0 is accepted. The students’ final
grades X follow normal distribution</p>
      <p>2) Students’ ZCGTBII grades distribution hypothesis
testing</p>
      <p>Using the same method as shown in last subsection, the
test statistic is calculated in TABLE III.</p>
      <p>Thus, The students’ ZCGTBII grades follow normal
B. Spending more computer programming time on
homework versus spending less computer programming
time on homework: “Effects” on score</p>
      <p>Do students who spend more computer programming
time on homework receive higher scores than those who
spending less computer programming time on homework?
This question arises when instructors consider encouraging
students to spend more programming time on the course of C
programming Language. It is supposed to get higher grades
if you spend more time to practice C programming. Does it
true? The Two-Sample Pooled T-Test is employed to test it.</p>
      <p>Based on teaching syllabus of the course of C
Programming Language revised in 2008, students are asked
to spend no less than three class hours to do each of their
homework assignments. Thus the total computer
programming time on homework of a student is supposed to
be no less than 48 class hours, which is 2160 minutes.
However, some students spend much more than the
suggested time on homework assignments, and some
students spend much less than the suggested time working on
their assignments. Using this time, students are divided into
two groups. One is the group of students whose total
computer programming time on homework is greater than or
equal to this time, denoted as Group I. The other is the group
of students whose total computer programming time on
homework is less than this time, denoted as Group II. Based
on this classification principle, there are 68 students in Group
I and 16 students in Group II. Students’ final grades and
ZCGTBII grades are used to test if the Group I receives
higher grades than the Group II.</p>
      <sec id="3-1">
        <title>1) Comparing the passing rate of two groups of students</title>
        <p>We define the passing rate of a group in an exam as
number of students who pass the exam divide by total
number of students in that group. The passing rates of final
test and ZCGTBII of the two groups of students are shown in
TABLE iv. From TABLE iv, we know that the passing rates
of final test and ZCGTBII of Group I are greater than those
of Group II by 18.75 and 19.54 percentage points,
respectively.</p>

        <title>2) Hypothesis test on two groups of students’ final</title>
        <p>grades</p>
        <p>In order to use the Two-Sample Pooled T-Test to test if
two groups of students’ final grades have the same mean, the
variances of two groups of students’ final grades are
variances σ I 2 and σ II 2 to denote the mean and the
variances of the two group respectively. Thus the first
hypothesis is:</p>
        <p>2
and σ II are not equivalent.</p>
        <p>Relevant statistics of two groups of students’ final grades
are calculated in TABLE V. The test statistic F is
F = 0.324
Thus, the hypothesis H0 is accepted with a significance level
ofα = 0.01.</p>
        <p>Because the variances of two groups of students’ final
grades are equivalent, the Two-Sample Pooled T-Test can be
used to test if the mean of students’ final grades of Group I is
greater than that of Group II. Thus, the second hypothesis is:
From TABLE V, the test statistic t is
t = 0.288 &gt; −t0.01,82 = −2.375</p>
        <p>Thus, the hypothesis H0 is accepted with a significance
level ofα = 0.01, i.e. the mean of group I of students’ final
grades is greater than or equal to that of group II by 9.0
points.</p>

      <sec id="3-3">
        <title>3) Hypothesis test on two groups of students’ ZCGTBII</title>
        <p>grades</p>
        <p>Because two students did not take the ZCGTBII, the total
sample size is 82 students in this hypothesis test.</p>
        <p>Using the same methodology as shown in last subsection,
relevant statistics of two groups of students’ ZCGTBII
grades are calculated in TABLE VI.</p>
        <p>From TABLE VI, the test statistic F is
F = 1.215
we can conclude that the variances of two groups of
students’ ZCGTBII grades are equivalent with a significance
level ofα = 0.01.</p>
        <p>The following hypothesis test is used to test the relation
of the two groups of students’ ZCGTBII grades.
From TABLE VI, the test statistic t is
t = 0.201 &gt; −t0.01,80 = −2.373</p>
        <p>Thus, the hypothesis H0 is accepted with a significance
level ofα = 0.01 , i.e. the mean of group I of students’
ZCGTBII grades is greater than or equal to that of group II
by 7.0 points.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="4">
      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>Based on students’ computer programming time on
homework and the minimum computer programming time
on homework that the C programming language syllabus
prescribed for a student to learn this course, students of a
teaching class are divided into two groups. Group I is the
students whose total computer programming time on
homework is greater than or equal to the minimum computer
programming time on homework. Group II is the students
whose total computer programming time on homework is
less than the minimum computer programming time on
homework. Hypothesis tests are employed to analyze the
final grades and the ZCGTBII grades of the two groups of
students. Analysis results show that the mean of the final
grades and the mean of ZCGTBII grades of Group I are
greater than those of Group II by 9.0 and 7.0 points,
respectively. Analysis results also show that the passing rates
of final test and ZCGTBII of Group I are greater than those
of Group II by 18.75 and 19.54 percentage points,
respectively. Thus we can conclude that the time that a
student practicing programming on computers plays a very
important role in their C Programming Language learning.
Therefore, in teaching process of the course of the C
Programming Language, In addition to normal classroom
teaching, teachers/instructors should encourage students to
use computers to do an appropriate amount of homework.</p>
