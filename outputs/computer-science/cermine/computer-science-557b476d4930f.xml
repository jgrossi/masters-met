        <p>a b s t r a c t Being able to use information communication technology (ICT) effectively has become an essential element of participation within an increasingly digital culture. However, there are differences in participation within this digital culture. Prenatal testosterone exposure is thought to influence the development of numeric capabilities and relate to levels of anxiety, both of which contribute towards engagement with ICT. This study examined whether an index of prenatal exposure to testosterone, digit ratio (2D:4D), is related to successful involvement within a computer-technology context - performance in a Java programming course. Three studies (N = 73,75,65) identified a consistent negative correlation between 2D:4D digit ratio and attainment (r 0.2). A fourth study (N = 119) found that 2D:4D digit ratio positively correlated with two indices of computer-related anxieties, as well as anxiety sensitivity (r = 0.32/0.51). These results suggest that males and females who have been exposed to higher levels of testosterone within the womb perform better upon academic assessments of Java-related programming ability within computer science education, and have lower levels of computer-related anxieties outside computer science education. Thus, the 2D:4D index of prenatal testosterone exposure correlated with the two factors that directly impact upon ICT engagement, which is increasingly essential to effectively participate within educational and occupational environments. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The use of information communication technology (ICT – for
example desktop or laptop computers) permeates almost all
aspects of educational, occupational and leisure environments in
modern industrial societies. Being able to use ICT effectively has
become an essential element of the skill-base required to
participate within an increasingly digital culture. The two predominant
factors that consistently predict engagement with ICT are
technological capability, specifically programming ability, and
computer-related anxieties (Brosnan, 1998a for review). Reasons why
differences in ICT use exist are multifaceted, and certainly include
socialization and cultural influences. However, it is also likely that
hormonal factors may play a role. Prenatal exposure to sex
hormones, such as testosterone and oestrogen, has important
organisational effects upon the brain, which in turn is thought to
influence a range of behaviors (Collear &amp; Hines, 1995). These
organisational effects may play a significant role in influencing
engagement with ICT.</p>
      <p>2D:4D digit ratio (hereafter DR) is the relative length of the 4th
digit compared to the 2nd digit and has been argued to be a marker

for prenatal testosterone exposure relative to prenatal
oestrogen exposure (Manning, Scutt, Wilson, &amp; Lewis-Jones, 1998).
Lutchmaya, Baron-Cohen, Raggatt, Knickmeyer, and Manning
(2004) report a significant correlation between DR in 2-year-olds
and their prenatal testosterone relative to prenatal oestrogen in
samples obtained from amniocentesis, suggesting that DR is a
direct correlate of prenatal sex steroid exposure. Typically males
are exposed to higher levels of prenatal testosterone than females
and, consistent with this, a sex difference in DR has been identified.
Manning et al. (1998) report a mean DR for males of 0.98 (4th digit
longer than the 2nd digit) and 1.0 for females (4th and 2nd digits of
equal length). Additionally, DRs generally show a negative
correlation with behaviors which typically demonstrate a male advantage
(e.g. mental rotation) and a positive correlation with behaviors
which typically demonstrate a female advantage (e.g. location
memory: for reviews see Cohen-Bendahan, van de Beek, &amp;
Berenbaum, 2005; McIntyre, 2006; Putz, Gaulin, Sporter, &amp; McBurney,
2004; Voracek &amp; Loibl, 2009).</p>
      <p>Of particular relevance to the current study, DR has been related
to numerical competency, which might impact on engagement and
success working with ICT. A lower DR (more male-typical,
reflecting greater prenatal testosterone exposure) has been associated
with higher ability in some numeric competencies such as
counting and problem solving (Fink, Brookes, Neave, Manning, &amp; Geary,
2006), subitizing (Brookes, Neave, Hamilton, &amp; Fink, 2007) as well
as numeric IQ (Kempel et al., 2005; Luxen &amp; Buunk, 2005). Brosnan
(2008) also reported negative correlations between DR and
numerical SAT scores in 7-year-old school children. This suggests that the
relationship between DR and numeric capabilities may relate to
academic attainment. There are to date, however, no data
exploring the potential relationship between DR and numerical capability
in university-level students. This is interesting as such a
relationship would be consistent with the argument that the
organisational effects of sex hormones on the brain influence aspects of
academic attainment. Java programming is widely used within
UK university computer science courses which draw upon numeric
competencies, such as problem-solving (see Prechelt, 2000). We
therefore sought to examine whether DR (as an index of
organisational testosterone/oestrogen) was related to an independent
assessment of numerically-oriented capability, within a
technology-based context. A preliminary study of 23 postgraduate
students found a significant negative correlation between DR and
programming ability (Brosnan, 2004).</p>
      <p>Within modern industrial societies, university computer
science courses are typically male-dominated (see Brosnan, 1998b).
Although sex differences in technology-based engagement might
be related to hormonally-mediated differences in numeric abilities,
an alternative explanation could be due to sex differences in
anxiety, especially with computers (in addition to other potential
differences such as differential encouragement from parents and
educators). Females generally report higher levels of anxiety than
males (e.g. Pigott, 2003) and studies have consistently found that
females report more computer-related anxieties than males (e.g.
Brosnan, 1998a; Rosen &amp; Weil, 1995; Thorpe &amp; Brosnan, 2007 for
review). Thorpe and Brosnan (2007) identified levels of computer
anxiety that were considered comparable to clinical levels of
anxiety (spider phobia) and analyses of the correlates of
computer-related anxieties suggested that social/performance issues underpin
such concerns. Despite the evidence of a sex difference in anxiety,
to date there have been only two studies examining the
relationship between DR and anxiety. Evardone and Alexander (2009)
identified a positive relationship between 2D:4D and anxiety for
male undergraduate students, but not females. de Bruin, Verheij,
Wiegman, and Ferdinand (2004) also suggest that males with
anxiety disorders might have been exposed to lower prenatal
testosterone levels, indexed through higher DRs (females were not
assessed).</p>
      <p>Taken together, it seems that sex differences in
technologybased activities might be hormonally mediated. Prenatal exposure
to sex hormones could manifest their influence behaviorally in
two ways: cognitively (through better ability on computer-based
tasks) and/or emotionally (though heightened computer-based
anxiety). However, no study to date has examined these
possibilities. This paper, therefore, sought to examine the relationship
between an indirect measure of prenatal hormone exposure, DR,
and (1) computer-related attainment, and (2) computer-related
anxiety. Within the findings described above there are
discrepancies as to whether these relationships are identified for males
and/or females as well as for the right and/or left hand. Those
who have selected university courses are likely to have done so
based upon their academic strengths and have been found to be
reflected in their DRs (Brosnan, 2006; see also Romano, Leoni, &amp;
Saino, 2006). Thus, we anticipate that those who have numeric
strengths and have selected computer science may tend towards
a more male-typical DR than the normal population. Typically,
those within university education who have selected
programming courses do not display computer-related anxiety. It is,
therefore, possible that those who select courses that have little
computer programming may be more likely to exhibit computer
anxiety. We therefore studied two groups, firstly
computerrelated attainment in those who had selected programming,</p>

        <title>2.1. Participants</title>
        <p>73 students taking an undergraduate first year (first semester)
course in Java programming. There were 60 males and 13 females,
aged 18–41 (mean = 20.6 years, S.D. = 5.2 years). As a prerequisite
to take the course all students had achieved an A grade in A-level
mathematics (the top grade for UK examinations typically taken at
age 18 to enter university at the time of the study1). A replication
study the following year (study 1b, see below) recruited 75 students
taking the same undergraduate first year (first semester) course in
Java programming. There were 53 males and 22 females, aged
18–41 (mean = 20.9 years, S.D. = 3.7 years). A second course (Java
programming II) ran in the second semester and forms the basis of
a third study. 65 (49 males and 16 females) students (from the 75
in study 1b) took the second semester unit (study 1c).</p>

        <title>2.2. Design and procedure</title>
        <p>The second and fourth digits of both the right and left hand
were measured using transparent rulers, accurate to 1 mm.
Selfmeasurement of DR was used in these studies, and has been
validated against digital calliper measurements (Brosnan, 2006).
Discrepancies have been reported between direct measurement of
DR and measurement from a photocopy (Caswell &amp; Manning,
2009; Manning, Fink, Neave, &amp; Caswell, 2005) which need to be
borne in mind when interpreting the results. The DRs were
calculated for the left and right hands and then averaged (e.g. Brosnan,
2008). In addition, the difference in right and left DRs was
calculated (right DR – left DR: Dr-l). Four variables were therefore
calculated for DR: right hand DR, left hand DR, averaged (mean) DR and
the difference between right and left hand DR (Dr-l).</p>
        <p>Java was selected as the programming language of study as it
is currently widely taught within UK universities and therefore
represents an ecologically valid task. The numerical capability
most explicitly addressed within the programming course was
problem solving. The course introduced students to problem
analysis and provided the practical skills of reading and writing
programs and producing programs to solve real world problems.
Students were provided with domain specific problem-solving
techniques which were formally assessed through examination
at the end of the semester. The course ran for a 12-week semester
and the DR assessment took place around halfway through the
course. After the semester course was assessed, the examination
grades were obtained. The authors were not involved in the
assessment of the course. One-tailed tests were conducted for a
directional prediction that lower DR (indicative of higher prenatal
testosterone) would correlate with higher grades (i.e., a negative
correlation).</p>
        <p>Data were collected at three time points. The study described
above (study 1a) was followed by two studies the following year
(studies 1b &amp;1c). Study 1b replicated study 1a, the only difference
was the inclusion of a question that sought to gauge if
programming experience was a factor. Students were therefore asked to
estimate on average, how many hours per day they spent
programming e.g., using Visual Basic, Java, C++, etc. The assessment for the
study 1b course was a variant of the assessment for study 1a. Study
1c was a replication of study 1b, following up the students from
study 1b who selected a further Java programming course in the</p>

      <title>3. Results and discussion</title>
      <p>There were no significant sex differences in age, grades
obtained nor digit ratio variables for studies 1a–c (all t71 &lt; 0.8, ns),
see Table 1. Consequently the sexes were collapsed into a single
group. For study 1a, a Pearson’s correlation revealed a significant
negative relationship between average DR and Java grades (r73 =
0.20, p = 0.04). This indicated that the lower the DR (indicating
higher prenatal testosterone exposure) the higher the Java grades.
Whilst both DRs showed the same direction of results as the
averaged DR, only the right hand reached statistical significance (right
hand r = 0.22, p = 0.034; left hand r = 0.13, ns). The left and right
hand DRs significantly correlated with each other (r = 0.46;
p &lt; 0.01). Dr-l showed no relationship with grades obtained
(r73 = 0.09, ns). Although non-significant, there was a small effect
of sex for digit ratio (Cohen’s d = 0.2, see Table 1). To control for this
potential small effect, partial correlations were rerun, controlling
for sex. The relationship between average and right hand DR with
attainment retained significance (r70 = 0.21, p = 0.04; r70 = 0.22,
p = 0.033, respectively).</p>
      <p>For studies 1b and 1c, a significant negative correlation was
identified again between average DR and Java programming marks
for semester 1 (r75 = 0.20, p = 0.04) and semester 2 (r65 = 0.25,
p = 0.02). This pattern was repeated for right and left hand DRs
respectively (semester 1: r75 = 0.10, p = 0.20; r75 = 0.23, p =
0.02; semester 2: r65 = 0.21, p = 0.046; r65 = 0.20, p = 0.056).
The DRs of the right and left hands significantly correlated with
each other (r75 = 0.33, p = 0.002) and the difference between the
DRs (Dr-l) did not correlate with grades (semester 1: r75 = 0.10,
ns; semester 2: r65 = 0.03, ns). Although the second semester
grades were lower than the first semester grades (see Table 1),
there was a strong correlation between the grades for semester 1
and semester 2 (r65 = 0.57, p &lt; 0.001).</p>
      <p>Females indicated that they spent slightly longer programming
per day than males (females: 1.7 h/day, S.D. = 2.6; males: 1.3 h/day,
S.D. = 1.2; t27 = 0.7, ns; equal variances not assumed). DR did not
correlate with programming per day (r75 = 0.04, ns). A partial
correlation controlling for both sex and daily programming
experience retained significance for average DR and semester 1 grades
(r71 = 0.21, p = 0.04) and for average DR and semester 2 grades
(r61 = 0.27, p = 0.018).</p>

        <title>3.1. Meta-analysis of digit ratio (2D:4D) and Java scores</title>
        <p>All the data points from studies 1a–c were combined into a
single grouping to allow for a meta-analysis of the relationship
between DR and Java scores (acknowledging that different
Javabased assessments were taken over different time points). This
provided an opportunity to explore the relationships over 213 data
points (73 from study 1a, 75 from study 2b and 65 from Study 2c) –
162 from males and 51 from females. Despite the uneven groups,
Levine’s test for equality of variance was not violated and a t-test
revealed a significant sex difference in right hand DR (t211 = 1.99,
p = 0.024) with a small effect size. A mean difference in left hand
DR was not found between males and females see Table 1,
resulting in a small effect size for the average of the left and right DRs.
There was also a small (non-significant) effect for Dr-l, males
tending to have a relatively lower DR on their right hand, females
having a relatively lower DR on the left hand. For males, the left and
right DRs significantly correlated (r162 = 3.1, p &lt; 0.001) and did
not differ significantly (t161 = 1.52, p = 0.13) and the same pattern
was evident for females (r51 = 0.67, p &lt; 0.001; t50 = 1.84, p = 0.07).
Java marks correlated with average DR (r213 = 0.20, p = 0.002),
right hand DR (r213 = 0.15, p = 0.015) and left hand DR (r213 =
0.16, p = 0.011). Partial correlations controlling for sex did not
impact upon these relationships.</p>
        <p>Study 1 (a–c) and the combined meta-analysis provided
consistent, if weak, evidence that DR correlated with success within
computer science Java programming attainment. The final study
examined relationships between DR and computer-related
anxieties. As noted above, those who self-select into programming
courses typically have low levels of computer-related anxiety,
and so for this study we recruited students who had not selected
computer science as their major.</p>

showing some sex differences (Keogh, 2004). The ASI is comprised
of 16 items designed to assess the fear of anxiety-related
sensations (e.g., ‘when I notice that my heart is beating rapidly, I worry
that I might have a heart attack’). Respondents indicate the degree

      <p>As sex differences were identified, partial correlations were
conducted (controlling for sex), so that comparable analyses could
be undertaken between the first set of studies and this study.
Average, right hand and left hand DRs significantly correlated with
computer anxiety (r116 = 0.41, p &lt; 0.001; r116 = 0.33, p &lt; 0.001;
r116 = 0.42; p &lt; 0.001) clinical computer anxiety (r116 = 0.34,

p &lt; 0.001). All the correlations were positive, indicating that a
greater DR (lower prenatal testosterone) related to higher anxiety.
A correlation between DR and computer-related anxiety was also
conducted controlling for anxiety sensitivity (in addition to sex)
to investigate whether there may be a relationship between DR
and computer-related anxiety specifically. Average, right hand

computer anxiety (r115 = 0.17, p = 0.03; r115 = 0.07, p = 0.24; r115 = 0.24;
p = 0.005) to varying degrees. There were no significant

      <title>6. General discussion</title>
      <p>DR is argued to index prenatal testosterone exposure which has
been found to relate to an advantage in numeric capabilities and
lower levels of anxiety. These studies have identified that a
significant relationship exists between DR and academic attainment on a
university Java programming course – a higher index of prenatal
testosterone exposure was associated with higher attainment. In
addition in undergraduate students, who had not selected
computer science, DR correlated with computer-related anxiety
(including anxiety sensitivity) – a higher index of prenatal
testosterone exposure was associated with lower levels of anxiety. Taken
together, these studies are suggestive of a role of prenatal
testosterone exposure in both attainment within computer science and
anxiety concerning the use of ICT, as well as susceptibility to panic.
This is significant as attainment and anxiety have been identified
as the two major factors impacting upon effective use of ICT within
educational, occupational and leisure environments (Brosnan,
1998a).</p>
      <p>Importantly, the DR relationships retained significance when
controlling for sex and self-reported programming activity
suggesting that these factors were not mediating the relationship
between DR and attainment. The relationship between DR and
attainment was found for two separate cohorts of students and,
for the second cohort, two separate assessments of Java
programming ability. The meta-analysis highlighted correlations that were
largely around 0.2 indicating that, although significant, this is a
small effect. However, this is consistent with research that
indicates a relationship between DR and numerical abilities and
educational attainment (Brookes et al., 2007; Brosnan, 2008; Bull &amp;
Benson, 2006; Fink et al., 2006; Luxen &amp; Buunk, 2005).</p>
      <p>In terms of anxiety, three different measures of anxiety
significantly correlated with DR, indicating that higher exposure to
prenatal testosterone was associated with lower anxiety. This is
consistent with the previous two studies exploring the relationship
between DR and anxiety (de Bruin et al., 2004; Evardone &amp;
Alexander, 2009). The correlations between DR and anxiety sensitivity are
interesting, and could suggest that DR is simply related to anxiety
more generally, rather than specifically to computer-related events
(the relatively low internal validity of the computer anxiety scales
should be borne in mind). However, what is notable about anxiety
sensitivity is that it is related to the fear of anxiety-related
sensation and as well as fearing cardiovascular sensations, also includes
items pertaining to the fear of losing mental/cognitive control, as
well as fearful of more socially-related anxiety sensations (e.g.,
sweating, embarrassment). Controlling for anxiety sensitivity
dramatically reduced the significance of the relationship between DR
and computer-related anxiety, although a significant relationship
was retained for the left hand. Given that social/performance
anxiety is particularly associated with computer-related anxiety
(Thorpe &amp; Brosnan, 2007), it would be interesting to consider in
future research the potentially protective role that prenatal
testosterone may have with respect to sensitivity to anxiety. Thus,
prenatal testosterone may exert influence upon the uptake of
ICT-based activities through both cognitive and emotional
mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Of course there are some limitations that need to be considered
with the current study. The self-measurement of DR could be open
to measurement error and this should be borne in mind when
interpreting the results (see Caswell &amp; Manning, 2009). The
meta-analysis also highlighted the relative strength of the
relationship between averaged (mean of left and right hand) DR and
attainment when compared to left and right DR, which is
consistent with previous research. Brosnan (2008) also identified a
stronger relationship between average DR and attainment than either
left or right hand DR and attainment in the school children.
Typically, relationships tend to be stronger for the right DR than the left
DR. In the present study, however, relationships were stronger for
the left hand – particularly for study 2. The lack of any significant
correlations for the difference between right and left hand DRs
(Drl) across all four studies indicates that the difference between
hands per se is not relevant. Overall the pattern of correlations
was consistent for averaged, right and left hand DRs. Why an
average of right and left DR represents the strongest relationship with
academic attainment remains to be determined. This may be a
valuable avenue of research as it has been proposed that as a
consequence of these relationships, DR may influence subsequent
professional fields of interest (Romano et al., 2006).</p>
