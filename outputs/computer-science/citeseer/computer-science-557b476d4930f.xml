			<abstract>
				<p>Being able to use information communication technology (ICT) effectively has become an essential element of participation within an increasingly digital culture. However, there are differences in participation within this digital culture. Prenatal testosterone exposure is thought to influence the development of numeric capabilities and relate to levels of anxiety, both of which contribute towards engagement with ICT. This study examined whether an index of prenatal exposure to testosterone, digit ratio (2D:4D), is related to successful involvement within a computer-technology context – performance in a Java programming course. Three studies (N = 73,75,65) identified a consistent negative correlation between 2D:4D digit ratio and attainment (r % À0.2). A fourth study (N = 119) found that 2D:4D digit ratio positively correlated with two indices of computer-related anxieties, as well as anxiety sensitivity (r = 0.32/0.51). These results suggest that males and females who have been exposed to higher levels of testosterone within the womb perform better upon academic assessments of Java-related programming ability within computer science education, and have lower levels of computer-related anxieties outside computer science education. Thus, the 2D:4D index of prenatal testosterone exposure correlated with the two factors that directly impact upon ICT engagement, which is increasingly essential to effectively participate within educational and occupational environments.</p>

Design and procedure The second and fourth digits of both the right and left hand were measured using transparent rulers, accurate to 1 mm. Selfmeasurement of DR was used in these studies, and has been validated against digital calliper measurements (Brosnan, 2006). Discrepancies have been reported between direct measurement of DR and measurement from a photocopy (Caswell &amp; Manning, 2009; Manning, Fink, Neave, &amp; Caswell, 2005) which need to be borne in mind when interpreting the results. The DRs were calculated for the left and right hands and then averaged (e.g. Brosnan, 2008). In addition, the difference in right and left DRs was calculated (right DR – left DR: Dr-l). Four variables were therefore calculated for DR: right hand DR, left hand DR, averaged (mean) DR and the difference between right and left hand DR (Dr-l). Java was selected as the programming language of study as it is currently widely taught within UK universities and therefore represents an ecologically vali</context>

Thorpe and Brosnan (2007) identified levels of computer anxiety that were considered comparable to clinical levels of anxiety (spider phobia) and analyses of the correlates of computer-related anxieties suggested that social/performance issues underpin such concerns. Despite the evidence of a sex difference in anxiety, to date there have been only two studies examining the relationship between DR and anxiety. Evardone and Alexander (2009) identified a positive relationship between 2D:4D and anxiety for male undergraduate students, but not females. de Bruin, Verheij, Wiegman, and Ferdinand (2004) also suggest that males with anxiety disorders might have been exposed to lower prenatal testosterone levels, indexed through higher DRs (females were not assessed). Taken together, it seems that sex differences in technologybased activities might be hormonally mediated.

This paper, therefore, sought to examine the relationship between an indirect measure of prenatal hormone exposure, DR, and (1) computer-related attainment, and (2) computer-related anxiety. Within the findings described above there are discrepancies as to whether these relationships are identified for males and/or females as well as for the right and/or left hand. Those who have selected university courses are likely to have done so based upon their academic strengths and have been found to be reflected in their DRs (Brosnan, 2006; see also Romano, Leoni, &amp; Saino, 2006). Thus, we anticipate that those who have numeric strengths and have selected computer science may tend towards a more male-typical DR than the normal population. Typically, those within university education who have selected programming courses do not display computer-related anxiety. It is, therefore, possible that those who select courses that have little 372 M. Brosnan et al. / Personality and Incomputer programming may be more likely to exhibit computer anxiety.

In terms of anxiety, three different measures of anxiety significantly correlated with DR, indicating that higher exposure to prenatal testosterone was associated with lower anxiety. This is consistent with the previous two studies exploring the relationship between DR and anxiety (de Bruin et al., 2004; Evardone &amp; Alexander, 2009).

Although sex differences in technology-based engagement might be related to hormonally-mediated differences in numeric abilities, an alternative explanation could be due to sex differences in anxiety, especially with computers (in addition to other potential differences such as differential encouragement from parents and educators). Females generally report higher levels of anxiety than males (e.g. Pigott, 2003) and studies have consistently found that females report more computer-related anxieties than males (e.g. Brosnan, 1998a; Rosen &amp; Weil, 1995; Thorpe &amp; Brosnan, 2007 for review).

This paper, therefore, sought to examine the relationship between an indirect measure of prenatal hormone exposure, DR, and (1) computer-related attainment, and (2) computer-related anxiety. Within the findings described above there are discrepancies as to whether these relationships are identified for males and/or females as well as for the right and/or left hand. Those who have selected university courses are likely to have done so based upon their academic strengths and have been found to be reflected in their DRs (Brosnan, 2006; see also Romano, Leoni, &amp; Saino, 2006). Thus, we anticipate that those who have numeric strengths and have selected computer science may tend towards a more male-typical DR than the normal population. Typically, those within university education who have selected programming courses do not display computer-related anxiety. It is, therefore, possible that those who select courses that have little 372 M. Brosnan et al. / Personality and Incomputer programming may be more likely to exhibit computer anxiety. We therefore studied two groups, firstly computerrelated attainment in those who had selected programming,and computer-related </context>

Although sex differences in technology-based engagement might be related to hormonally-mediated differences in numeric abilities, an alternative explanation could be due to sex differences in anxiety, especially with computers (in addition to other potential differences such as differential encouragement from parents and educators). Females generally report higher levels of anxiety than males (e.g. Pigott, 2003) and studies have consistently found that females report more computer-related anxieties than males (e.g. Brosnan, 1998a; Rosen &amp; Weil, 1995; Thorpe &amp; Brosnan, 2007 for review). Thorpe and Brosnan (2007) identified levels of computer anxiety that were considered comparable to clinical levels of anxiety (spider phobia) and analyses of the correlates of computer-related anxieties suggested that social/performance issues underpin such concerns. Despite the evidence of a sex difference in anxiety, to date there have been only two studies examining the relationship between DR and anxiety.

These organisational effects may play a significant role in influencing engagement with ICT. 2D:4D digit ratio (hereafter DR) is the relative length of the 4th digit compared to the 2nd digit and has been argued to be a marker which typically demonstrate a female advantage (e.g. location memory: for reviews see Cohen-Bendahan, van de Beek, &amp; Berenbaum, 2005; McIntyre, 2006; Putz, Gaulin, Sporter, &amp; McBurney, 2004; Voracek &amp; Loibl, 2009). Of particular relevance to the current study, DR has been related to numerical competency, which might impact on engagement and success working with ICT. A lower DR (more male-typical, reflecting greater prenatal testosterone exposure) has been associated with higher ability in some numeric competencies such as counting and problem solving (Fink, Brookes, Neave, Manning, &amp; Geary, 2006), subitizing (Brookes, Neave, Hamilton, &amp; Fink, 2007) as well * Corresponding author.
