				<p>—The C Programming Language is one of the most popular teaching programming languages. It is generally considered that the computer programming time that a student spent on his homework directly affects his grade of the C Programming Language. There is little research regarding the correlation of students' computer programming time and their test grades. The computer programming time, grades of final test and the Zhejiang Computer Grade Test Band II (ZCGTBII) of students from a teaching class are collected. The students are divided into two groups based on their programming time. The T-Test is employed to analyze grades of final test and the ZCGTBII of the two groups. Analysis results show that the mean and the passing rates of final test and the ZCGTBII of Group I are greater than those of Group II. Therefore, we conclude that the amount of time students spend practicing programming on computers plays a very important role towards mastering the C Programming Language.</p>

DATA COLLECTION According to teaching syllabus of the course of the C Programming Language revised in 2008 [15], teaching activities include 16 lectures and 16 computer programming classes. Each lecture has two class hours and each computer programming class has three class hours. There is homework after each computer programming class. Students are asked 1585 ThE3.7 to spend at least three hours working on a programming assignment in our public computer centers. In order to analyze the relation between students’ grades and the time that students spent on programming after classes, one of C programming teaching classes is selected. This teaching class has 84 students. Students’ final grades and grades </context>
