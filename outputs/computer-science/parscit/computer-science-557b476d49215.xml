Abstract— In this paper, a problem of visual programming of
PLC (programmable logic controller) devices is described. A
programming by demonstration method is developed so that a
problem-domain expert can program such devices without
computer programming skill. The method is novel in the sense
that, unlike other programming-by-demonstration methods, it
requires little a priori knowledge of the controlled system model,
nor it needs to interact with a real system. A simulation model,
which captures the laws of nature governing the system behavior,
is jointly programmed with a control device (PLC). A PLC
programming tool, developed based on the proposed joint
controller-simulator programming by demonstration paradigm,
can generate a high-level structure text program code, from the
demonstrated actions as performed by a user.

operating electronic apparatus which uses a programmable
memory for the internal storage of instructions. It includes
functions such as logic sequencing, timing, counting, and
arithmetic operations, to control various types of machines or
processes. PLCs programs are generally written by a
specialized programming language as specified by the IEC
1131-3 standard. It is thus not possible for an end user to
program the devices. Programming by demonstration (PBD)
concerns with providing a non-programmer tools and
techniques to control, automate, and customize the software
applications or intelligent physical devices. PBD technique is
simpler than procedural programming because there is no need
to learn a language syntax and rules. This concept has been
applied for various purposes such as those listed below.

One of the most important limitations of those existing
programming-by-demonstration methods, when applied to a
problem of PLC programming, is the need for an existence of a
real system to accompany a demonstration. Alternatively,
without a real system, a complete simulation model of the
system must be available so that a user can perform a
demonstration on a system simulator instead. In this paper, a
programming-by-demonstration method is developed to avoid
such limitation. Without the need for a priori knowledge on the
system simulation model, the method shares a similar
generality property of standard programming languages.
The paper is divided into two parts. First, PLC
programming paradigms are described. Next, the proposed
joint controller-simulator programming by demonstration
method is detailed in Sections 3 and 4. Use of the PLC
programming tool, developed based on the proposed
programming paradigm, is described using a simple water tank
system as a case study. Finally, concluding remarks are given.

PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS FOR PLC DEVICES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972912047619048">
Programming paradigm is a paradigmatic style of
programming. It provides and determines the view that the
programmer has of the execution of the program. For
examples, in object-oriented programming, programmers can
think of a program as a collection of interacting objects, while
in functional programming it can be thought of as a sequence
of stateless function evaluations. The common PLC
programming paradigms are described below.
1) Conventional programming paradigm: This is a
programming paradigm based upon the concept of procedures,
also known as routines, subroutines, methods, or functions, that
contain a series of computational steps. Examples of PLC
languages under this conventional programming paradigm
category are mnemonic and ST (Structure text) language.
CIS 2006
The programming by demonstration paradigm is generally
applicable only when the full functional system (to be
programmed) is available. Therefore, applicability of PBD to
program a new system that has not yet existed is questionable.
Similarly, applying PBD concept to PLC programming
requires the existence of a controlled system to be interacted

programming paradigm
2) Visual programming paradigm: This is a programming
language that uses a visual representation such as graphics,
drawing, animation or icons, partially or completely. It views
program construction as a visual task similar to the solving of
jigsaw puzzles. Example of the language that uses this
programming paradigm includes the ladder diagram, the
function block, and the sequential function chart.

In this paper, the above problem is solved by a joint
controller-simulator programming by demonstration method.
This technique combines visual programming and PBD for
jointly programming of controller devices and a simulation
model of the controlled devices. A joint controller-simulator

method is composed of four parts as follows (see Figure 4):
•
Model builder: This module is responsible for building
relationships among controller devices and controlled
system.
•
System simulator: This module provides an animated
display of the controlled system dynamics in response
to a controller action.
•
User action recorder: This module records a user action
for the purpose of both programming the controlled
system simulation model and the controller.
•
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.933253230769231">
Compiler: This module is used to transform a recorded
user action into an actual PLC programming code. The
code can be in a high level language such as a structure
text, or a low-level one such as a mnemonic code.
Programming by Demonstrations (PBD) is the most recent
approach to programming and is largely used at present for
end-user programming. The essential notion is that the user
demonstrates a program to the system by working through one
or more examples. The system then generalizes the users’
sequence of actions to produce a general program. One of the
best known such systems is Cypher’s EAGER system which
can automatically detect repetitions in user’s actions and build
a program to perform the use task. [11]

controlled device and the corresponding properties can be
defined. In addition, through visual programming, general
relationship among controlled devices, and between controlled
devices and the controller devices can be declared (visually).
2) Simulator programming mode: Under this mode, a
system simulation model, which captures the relationship
among controlling and controlled devices, can be programmed
through user demonstration. A user programs the model by
demonstrating how controlled device’s properties change in
response to a controller action, as well as to changes in other
controlled devices’ properties.
3) Controller programming mode: In this mode, a user is
allowed to define a controller action in response to a particular
system state. As for the case of the simulator programming
mode, a controller is programmed through user demonstration
of actions.
4) Simulation mode: In this mode, a programming tool
demonstrates to a user how a system state changes in response
to a controller action and vice versa. The simulation is provided
based on a system simulation model, constructed from previous
user actions under Mode 2. Therefore, the model may be
incomplete and the simulation may be inaccurate. System
model and simulation accuracy can be corrected, however,
through iteratively re-programming.
5) Compiler mode: When in this mode, the tool transforms
user actions into an actual PLC programming code. For
example, the tool developed in this study chooses ST (Structure

In this section, design of the tool developed based on the
proposed method as described in Section 3 is described below.
1) Model builder: This module is active when the tool is in
the system initialization mode. It is used for system model
construction. Using a visual programming paradigm, a
controlled and/or controller device is defined by the selection
of icons from the tool palette. Each device’s properties are
defined through the object inspector (see Figure6).

<bodyText confidence="0.966369066666667">
To illustrate how the tool is used for PLC programming, a
simple water tank controlling system shown in Figure 7 is used
as a case study. To create a simulator model, relationship
between controlling device and controlled device as well as the
relation between controlled device and controlled device need
to be defined. Through the language of visual programming,
two types of relationship can be defined.
a) Association relationship: Once defined, allows the
associated objects to exchange message (parameters,
commands, etc.) with each other. For examples, in our case
study, when Valve1 is connected with Tank1 through the
connector device, opening or closing of Valve1 can have an
effect on the properties (such as a water level) of Tank1. The
direction of the connector’s arrow head is used to identify the
direction of message flow.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.91752">
Figure 8. Defining the association relationship
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.986536878787879">
b) Dependency relationship: Is applied to define a partof relationship between two or more controlled devices, or
between a controlled device and one or more controller
devices. For example, in our case study, to install a controller
sensor to measure a tank’s water level, the sensor is placed
inside the container Tank1 to establish the required
relationship. In Figure 9, two such sensors, L1 and L2, are
defined with this type of relationship with Tank1, so that two
(low and high) water levels can be sensed.
2) User action recorder: This module is responsible to
recording a user action. It operates in one of the two modes, the
simulator and controller programming modes. The two modes,
along with the simulation mode, can be inter-changed.
Generally, the simulator programming mode is activated when
a user changes the state of a controlling device of which the
corresponding system response is not known yet. Once a
system state change in response to the controller action is
defined during the simulation programming mode, the tool
should be switched to the simulation mode. From then, when a
particular system state occurs, a user can switch to the
controller programming mode so that an appropriate controller
action can be defined.
To illustrate how to program a system simulation mode,
consider our case when Valve1 or Pump1 is turned on/off
(Figure 10).
a) In response to the controller state change when the
status of Pump1 is turned to “ON”, a user switches to the
mode. Based on the association relationship between Pump1
and Tank1 as established through visual programming during
system model initialization, the tool prompts for a change to
any of Tank1’s properties. A user can then program the
simulation model by raising the tank’s water level. The tool
records the action, with a dialogue for the user to define the
rate of water level increase.

b) Consider then the case where Valve1 is turned on.
When switched to the simulator programming mode, Tank1 is
highlighted as a result of the established relationship between
Valve1 and Tank1.To drain the water level in the tank, a user
select the tank’s property that is affected by this controller
action and then lowering the water level. The tool then records
the action (see Figure 11).
Figure 11. Using the tool to program the system model when Valve1 is turned
on
3) Controller Porgramming: To illustrate how to program
a controller through demonstration, consider the following
scenarios.
a) While in a simulation mode, a user notices that a
water level is increasing. Once the level arrives at the point
specified by Sensor 1, the simulator then prompts a user for a
controller action by switching to a controller programming
mode. The user informs the tool to continue the simulation.
When the level arrives at the point specified by Sensor 2, the
simulator prompts for the action again. This time, however,
the user defines the action by visually turning Pump1 off. The
tool then records that action (and if no other action, the tool
switches to the simulator programming mode).
b) While in a simulation mode, the water level is
decreasing. When it passes the level below that specified by
Sensor1, a user can proactively turns the tool into a controller
programming mode himself. He then can program the
controller by visually turning Pump1 on (see Figure 12).
Figure 12. Programming the controller during the controller programming
mode
Figure 13 describes the sequence of user actions to program
both the simulator and the controller. From the figure, note the
iterative nature of the joint-programming process.

PBD technique is simpler than procedural programming because there is no need to learn a language syntax and rules. This concept has been applied for various purposes such as those listed below. • Automation of repetitive tasks using software functions. For example, a macro recorder learns patterns of user’s activity and can then execute those patterns autonomously. [1, 5] • User interface customization and personalization. Here, PBD is applied to change interface appearance to optimize access to frequently used functions. [6] 1-4244-0023-6/06/$20.00 ©2006 IEEE • PBD is also applied to robotic manipulation. In [2, 4], a PBD technique is proposed. so that a robot arm movement can be programmed through demonstration. One of the most important limitations of those existing programming-by-demonstration methods, when applied to a problem of PLC programming, is the need for an existence of a real system to accompany a demonstration. Alternatively, without a real system, a complete simulation model of the system must be available so that a user can perform a demonstration on a system simulator instead.

Programming by Demonstrations (PBD) is the most recent approach to programming and is largely used at present for end-user programming. The essential notion is that the user demonstrates a program to the system by working through one or more examples. The system then generalizes the users’ sequence of actions to produce a general program. One of the best known such systems is Cypher’s EAGER system which can automatically detect repetitions in user’s actions and build a program to perform the use task. [11] Figure 4. Main modules of the joint controller-simulator programming method Conceptually, the system as shown in Figure 4 operates in one of five modes (states) as explained below (see Figure 5). Figure 3. A conceptual view of the programming by demonstration paradigm 1) System initialization mode: In this mode, a controlled system is created by a user through visual interface. Each controlled device and the corresponding properties can be defined. In addition, through visual programming, general relationship among controlled devices, and between controlled devices and the controller devices </context>
