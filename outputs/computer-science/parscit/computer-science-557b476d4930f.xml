Being able to use information communication technology (ICT) effectively has become an essential element of participation within an increasingly digital culture. However, there are differences in participation within this digital culture. Prenatal testosterone exposure is thought to inﬂuence the development of
numeric capabilities and relate to levels of anxiety, both of which contribute towards engagement with
ICT. This study examined whether an index of prenatal exposure to testosterone, digit ratio (2D:4D), is
related to successful involvement within a computer-technology context – performance in a Java programming course. Three studies (N = 73,75,65) identiﬁed a consistent negative correlation between
2D:4D digit ratio and attainment (r % À0.2). A fourth study (N = 119) found that 2D:4D digit ratio positively correlated with two indices of computer-related anxieties, as well as anxiety sensitivity
(r = 0.32/0.51). These results suggest that males and females who have been exposed to higher levels
of testosterone within the womb perform better upon academic assessments of Java-related programming ability within computer science education, and have lower levels of computer-related anxieties outside computer science education. Thus, the 2D:4D index of prenatal testosterone exposure correlated
with the two factors that directly impact upon ICT engagement, which is increasingly essential to effectively participate within educational and occupational environments.

The use of information communication technology (ICT – for
example desktop or laptop computers) permeates almost all aspects of educational, occupational and leisure environments in
modern industrial societies. Being able to use ICT effectively has
become an essential element of the skill-base required to participate within an increasingly digital culture. The two predominant
factors that consistently predict engagement with ICT are technological capability, speciﬁcally programming ability, and computer-related anxieties (Brosnan, 1998a for review). Reasons why
differences in ICT use exist are multifaceted, and certainly include
socialization and cultural inﬂuences. However, it is also likely that
hormonal factors may play a role. Prenatal exposure to sex hormones, such as testosterone and oestrogen, has important organisational effects upon the brain, which in turn is thought to
inﬂuence a range of behaviors (Collear &amp; Hines, 1995). These
organisational effects may play a signiﬁcant role in inﬂuencing
engagement with ICT.
2D:4D digit ratio (hereafter DR) is the relative length of the 4th
digit compared to the 2nd digit and has been argued to be a marker

for prenatal testosterone exposure relative to prenatal oestrogen exposure (Manning, Scutt, Wilson, &amp; Lewis-Jones, 1998).
Lutchmaya, Baron-Cohen, Raggatt, Knickmeyer, and Manning
(2004) report a signiﬁcant correlation between DR in 2-year-olds
and their prenatal testosterone relative to prenatal oestrogen in
samples obtained from amniocentesis, suggesting that DR is a direct correlate of prenatal sex steroid exposure. Typically males
are exposed to higher levels of prenatal testosterone than females
and, consistent with this, a sex difference in DR has been identiﬁed.
Manning et al. (1998) report a mean DR for males of 0.98 (4th digit
longer than the 2nd digit) and 1.0 for females (4th and 2nd digits of
equal length). Additionally, DRs generally show a negative correlation with behaviors which typically demonstrate a male advantage
(e.g. mental rotation) and a positive correlation with behaviors
which typically demonstrate a female advantage (e.g. location
memory: for reviews see Cohen-Bendahan, van de Beek, &amp; Berenbaum, 2005; McIntyre, 2006; Putz, Gaulin, Sporter, &amp; McBurney,
2004; Voracek &amp; Loibl, 2009).
Of particular relevance to the current study, DR has been related
to numerical competency, which might impact on engagement and
success working with ICT. A lower DR (more male-typical, reﬂecting greater prenatal testosterone exposure) has been associated
with higher ability in some numeric competencies such as counting and problem solving (Fink, Brookes, Neave, Manning, &amp; Geary,
2006), subitizing (Brookes, Neave, Hamilton, &amp; Fink, 2007) as well

as numeric IQ (Kempel et al., 2005; Luxen &amp; Buunk, 2005). Brosnan
(2008) also reported negative correlations between DR and numerical SAT scores in 7-year-old school children. This suggests that the
relationship between DR and numeric capabilities may relate to
academic attainment. There are to date, however, no data exploring the potential relationship between DR and numerical capability
in university-level students. This is interesting as such a relationship would be consistent with the argument that the organisational effects of sex hormones on the brain inﬂuence aspects of
academic attainment. Java programming is widely used within
UK university computer science courses which draw upon numeric
competencies, such as problem-solving (see Prechelt, 2000). We
therefore sought to examine whether DR (as an index of organisational testosterone/oestrogen) was related to an independent
assessment of numerically-oriented capability, within a technology-based context. A preliminary study of 23 postgraduate students found a signiﬁcant negative correlation between DR and
programming ability (Brosnan, 2004).
Within modern industrial societies, university computer science courses are typically male-dominated (see Brosnan, 1998b).
Although sex differences in technology-based engagement might
be related to hormonally-mediated differences in numeric abilities,
an alternative explanation could be due to sex differences in anxiety, especially with computers (in addition to other potential differences such as differential encouragement from parents and
educators). Females generally report higher levels of anxiety than
males (e.g. Pigott, 2003) and studies have consistently found that
females report more computer-related anxieties than males (e.g.
Brosnan, 1998a; Rosen &amp; Weil, 1995; Thorpe &amp; Brosnan, 2007 for
review). Thorpe and Brosnan (2007) identiﬁed levels of computer
anxiety that were considered comparable to clinical levels of anxiety (spider phobia) and analyses of the correlates of computer-related anxieties suggested that social/performance issues underpin
such concerns. Despite the evidence of a sex difference in anxiety,
to date there have been only two studies examining the relationship between DR and anxiety. Evardone and Alexander (2009)
identiﬁed a positive relationship between 2D:4D and anxiety for
male undergraduate students, but not females. de Bruin, Verheij,
Wiegman, and Ferdinand (2004) also suggest that males with
anxiety disorders might have been exposed to lower prenatal testosterone levels, indexed through higher DRs (females were not
assessed).
Taken together, it seems that sex differences in technologybased activities might be hormonally mediated. Prenatal exposure
to sex hormones could manifest their inﬂuence behaviorally in
two ways: cognitively (through better ability on computer-based
tasks) and/or emotionally (though heightened computer-based
anxiety). However, no study to date has examined these possibilities. This paper, therefore, sought to examine the relationship between an indirect measure of prenatal hormone exposure, DR,
and (1) computer-related attainment, and (2) computer-related
anxiety. Within the ﬁndings described above there are discrepancies as to whether these relationships are identiﬁed for males
and/or females as well as for the right and/or left hand. Those
who have selected university courses are likely to have done so
based upon their academic strengths and have been found to be
reﬂected in their DRs (Brosnan, 2006; see also Romano, Leoni, &amp;
Saino, 2006). Thus, we anticipate that those who have numeric
strengths and have selected computer science may tend towards
a more male-typical DR than the normal population. Typically,
those within university education who have selected programming courses do not display computer-related anxiety. It is,
therefore, possible that those who select courses that have little
computer programming may be more likely to exhibit computer
anxiety. We therefore studied two groups, ﬁrstly computerrelated attainment in those who had selected programming,
and computer-related anxiety in those who had not selected
programming.

course in Java programming. There were 60 males and 13 females,
aged 18–41 (mean = 20.6 years, S.D. = 5.2 years). As a prerequisite
to take the course all students had achieved an A grade in A-level
mathematics (the top grade for UK examinations typically taken at
age 18 to enter university at the time of the study1). A replication
study the following year (study 1b, see below) recruited 75 students
taking the same undergraduate ﬁrst year (ﬁrst semester) course in
Java programming. There were 53 males and 22 females, aged
18–41 (mean = 20.9 years, S.D. = 3.7 years). A second course (Java
programming II) ran in the second semester and forms the basis of
a third study. 65 (49 males and 16 females) students (from the 75
in study 1b) took the second semester unit (study 1c).
2.2. Design and procedure
The second and fourth digits of both the right and left hand
were measured using transparent rulers, accurate to 1 mm. Selfmeasurement of DR was used in these studies, and has been validated against digital calliper measurements (Brosnan, 2006). Discrepancies have been reported between direct measurement of
DR and measurement from a photocopy (Caswell &amp; Manning,
2009; Manning, Fink, Neave, &amp; Caswell, 2005) which need to be
borne in mind when interpreting the results. The DRs were calculated for the left and right hands and then averaged (e.g. Brosnan,
2008). In addition, the difference in right and left DRs was calculated (right DR – left DR: Dr-l). Four variables were therefore calculated for DR: right hand DR, left hand DR, averaged (mean) DR and
the difference between right and left hand DR (Dr-l).
Java was selected as the programming language of study as it
is currently widely taught within UK universities and therefore
represents an ecologically valid task. The numerical capability
most explicitly addressed within the programming course was
problem solving. The course introduced students to problem analysis and provided the practical skills of reading and writing programs and producing programs to solve real world problems.
Students were provided with domain speciﬁc problem-solving
techniques which were formally assessed through examination
at the end of the semester. The course ran for a 12-week semester
and the DR assessment took place around halfway through the
course. After the semester course was assessed, the examination
grades were obtained. The authors were not involved in the
assessment of the course. One-tailed tests were conducted for a
directional prediction that lower DR (indicative of higher prenatal
testosterone) would correlate with higher grades (i.e., a negative
correlation).
Data were collected at three time points. The study described
above (study 1a) was followed by two studies the following year
(studies 1b &amp;1c). Study 1b replicated study 1a, the only difference
was the inclusion of a question that sought to gauge if programming experience was a factor. Students were therefore asked to
estimate on average, how many hours per day they spent programming e.g., using Visual Basic, Java, C++, etc. The assessment for the
study 1b course was a variant of the assessment for study 1a. Study

There were no signiﬁcant sex differences in age, grades obtained nor digit ratio variables for studies 1a–c (all t71 &amp;lt; 0.8, ns),
see Table 1. Consequently the sexes were collapsed into a single
group. For study 1a, a Pearson’s correlation revealed a signiﬁcant
negative relationship between average DR and Java grades (r73 =
À0.20, p = 0.04). This indicated that the lower the DR (indicating
higher prenatal testosterone exposure) the higher the Java grades.
Whilst both DRs showed the same direction of results as the averaged DR, only the right hand reached statistical signiﬁcance (right
hand r = À0.22, p = 0.034; left hand r = À0.13, ns). The left and right
hand DRs signiﬁcantly correlated with each other (r = 0.46;
p &amp;lt; 0.01). Dr-l showed no relationship with grades obtained
(r73 = À0.09, ns). Although non-signiﬁcant, there was a small effect
of sex for digit ratio (Cohen’s d = 0.2, see Table 1). To control for this
potential small effect, partial correlations were rerun, controlling
for sex. The relationship between average and right hand DR with
attainment retained signiﬁcance (r70 = À0.21, p = 0.04; r70 = À0.22,
p = 0.033, respectively).
For studies 1b and 1c, a signiﬁcant negative correlation was
identiﬁed again between average DR and Java programming marks
for semester 1 (r75 = À0.20, p = 0.04) and semester 2 (r65 = À0.25,
p = 0.02). This pattern was repeated for right and left hand DRs
respectively (semester 1: r75 = À0.10, p = 0.20; r75 = À0.23, p =
0.02; semester 2: r65 = À0.21, p = 0.046; r65 = À0.20, p = 0.056).
The DRs of the right and left hands signiﬁcantly correlated with
each other (r75 = 0.33, p = 0.002) and the difference between the
DRs (Dr-l) did not correlate with grades (semester 1: r75 = À0.10,
ns; semester 2: r65 = 0.03, ns). Although the second semester

3.1. Meta-analysis of digit ratio (2D:4D) and Java scores
All the data points from studies 1a–c were combined into a single grouping to allow for a meta-analysis of the relationship between DR and Java scores (acknowledging that different Javabased assessments were taken over different time points). This
provided an opportunity to explore the relationships over 213 data
points (73 from study 1a, 75 from study 2b and 65 from Study 2c) –
162 from males and 51 from females. Despite the uneven groups,
Levine’s test for equality of variance was not violated and a t-test
revealed a signiﬁcant sex difference in right hand DR (t211 = 1.99,
p = 0.024) with a small effect size. A mean difference in left hand
DR was not found between males and females see Table 1, resulting in a small effect size for the average of the left and right DRs.
There was also a small (non-signiﬁcant) effect for Dr-l, males tending to have a relatively lower DR on their right hand, females having a relatively lower DR on the left hand. For males, the left and
right DRs signiﬁcantly correlated (r162 = 3.1, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and did
not differ signiﬁcantly (t161 = 1.52, p = 0.13) and the same pattern
was evident for females (r51 = 0.67, p &amp;lt; 0.001; t50 = 1.84, p = 0.07).
Java marks correlated with average DR (r213 = À0.20, p = 0.002),
right hand DR (r213 = À0.15, p = 0.015) and left hand DR (r213 =
À0.16, p = 0.011). Partial correlations controlling for sex did not
impact upon these relationships.
Study 1 (a–c) and the combined meta-analysis provided consistent, if weak, evidence that DR correlated with success within computer science Java programming attainment. The ﬁnal study
examined relationships between DR and computer-related anxieties. As noted above, those who self-select into programming
courses typically have low levels of computer-related anxiety,
and so for this study we recruited students who had not selected
computer science as their major.

The following three anxiety-related questionnaires were also
completed:
4.2.1. Computer anxiety rating scale (CARS; Rosen &amp; Weil, 1995)
The CARS contains 20 items (e.g. ‘Sitting in front of a home computer’) rated to indicate ‘how anxious (nervous) each activity
would make you at this point in your life’. The CARS items are rated
on a 5-point scale (5 = ‘very much’, 4 = ‘a fair amount’, 3 = ‘a little’,
2 = ‘not much’ and 1 = ‘not at all’) yielding a total possible score
ranging from 20 to 100, with higher scores indicating more computer anxiety. Cronbach’s Alpha for this sample was 0.58.
4.2.2. Clinical computer anxiety (CCA; Thorpe &amp; Brosnan, 2007)
The CCA was derived from 6 DSM-IV criteria for a speciﬁc phobia (e.g. ‘I always feel anxious when using computers’). Respondents respond on a Likert-type scale from strongly agree (5) to
strongly disagree (1). Scores could range from 6 through to 30
(highly anxious). Cronbach’s Alpha for this sample was 0.53.
4.2.3. Anxiety sensitivity index (ASI; Reiss, Peterson, Gursky, &amp;
McNally, 1986)
In addition to speciﬁc measures associated with computer-related fear, we also felt it useful to include a more general measure
of anxiety. We chose to include the ASI as this is a good measure of
fear of anxiety-related sensation, and has been shown to be a good
predictor of the development of panic-like sensations, as well as
showing some sex differences (Keogh, 2004). The ASI is comprised
of 16 items designed to assess the fear of anxiety-related sensations (e.g., ‘when I notice that my heart is beating rapidly, I worry
that I might have a heart attack’). Respondents indicate the degree
to which each item applies to them on a 5-point scale ranging from
‘very little’ (1) to ‘very much’ (5). Items on the ASI can be summated to give an overall anxiety sensitivity score ranging from
16 to 80 (higher anxiety sensitivity). Cronbach’s Alpha for this
sample was 0.88.

DR is argued to index prenatal testosterone exposure which has
been found to relate to an advantage in numeric capabilities and
lower levels of anxiety. These studies have identiﬁed that a significant relationship exists between DR and academic attainment on a
university Java programming course – a higher index of prenatal
testosterone exposure was associated with higher attainment. In
addition in undergraduate students, who had not selected
computer science, DR correlated with computer-related anxiety
(including anxiety sensitivity) – a higher index of prenatal testosterone exposure was associated with lower levels of anxiety. Taken
together, these studies are suggestive of a role of prenatal testosterone exposure in both attainment within computer science and
anxiety concerning the use of ICT, as well as susceptibility to panic.
This is signiﬁcant as attainment and anxiety have been identiﬁed
as the two major factors impacting upon effective use of ICT within
educational, occupational and leisure environments (Brosnan,
1998a).
Importantly, the DR relationships retained signiﬁcance when
controlling for sex and self-reported programming activity suggesting that these factors were not mediating the relationship between DR and attainment. The relationship between DR and
attainment was found for two separate cohorts of students and,
for the second cohort, two separate assessments of Java programming ability. The meta-analysis highlighted correlations that were
largely around 0.2 indicating that, although signiﬁcant, this is a
small effect. However, this is consistent with research that indicates a relationship between DR and numerical abilities and educational attainment (Brookes et al., 2007; Brosnan, 2008; Bull &amp;
Benson, 2006; Fink et al., 2006; Luxen &amp; Buunk, 2005).
In terms of anxiety, three different measures of anxiety signiﬁcantly correlated with DR, indicating that higher exposure to prenatal testosterone was associated with lower anxiety. This is
consistent with the previous two studies exploring the relationship
between DR and anxiety (de Bruin et al., 2004; Evardone &amp; Alexander, 2009). The correlations between DR and anxiety sensitivity are
interesting, and could suggest that DR is simply related to anxiety
more generally, rather than speciﬁcally to computer-related events
(the relatively low internal validity of the computer anxiety scales
should be borne in mind). However, what is notable about anxiety
sensitivity is that it is related to the fear of anxiety-related sensa-
M. Brosnan et al. / Personality and Individual Differences 51 (2011) 371–375
tion and as well as fearing cardiovascular sensations, also includes
items pertaining to the fear of losing mental/cognitive control, as
well as fearful of more socially-related anxiety sensations (e.g.,
sweating, embarrassment). Controlling for anxiety sensitivity dramatically reduced the signiﬁcance of the relationship between DR
and computer-related anxiety, although a signiﬁcant relationship
was retained for the left hand. Given that social/performance anxiety is particularly associated with computer-related anxiety
(Thorpe &amp; Brosnan, 2007), it would be interesting to consider in future research the potentially protective role that prenatal testosterone may have with respect to sensitivity to anxiety. Thus,
prenatal testosterone may exert inﬂuence upon the uptake of
ICT-based activities through both cognitive and emotional
mechanisms.
Of course there are some limitations that need to be considered
with the current study. The self-measurement of DR could be open
to measurement error and this should be borne in mind when
interpreting the results (see Caswell &amp; Manning, 2009). The
meta-analysis also highlighted the relative strength of the relationship between averaged (mean of left and right hand) DR and
attainment when compared to left and right DR, which is consistent with previous research. Brosnan (2008) also identiﬁed a stronger relationship between average DR and attainment than either
left or right hand DR and attainment in the school children. Typically, relationships tend to be stronger for the right DR than the left
DR. In the present study, however, relationships were stronger for
the left hand – particularly for study 2. The lack of any signiﬁcant
correlations for the difference between right and left hand DRs (Drl) across all four studies indicates that the difference between
hands per se is not relevant. Overall the pattern of correlations
was consistent for averaged, right and left hand DRs. Why an average of right and left DR represents the strongest relationship with
academic attainment remains to be determined. This may be a
valuable avenue of research as it has been proposed that as a consequence of these relationships, DR may inﬂuence subsequent professional ﬁelds of interest (Romano et al., 2006).

Of particular relevance to the current study, DR has been related to numerical competency, which might impact on engagement and success working with ICT. A lower DR (more male-typical, reﬂecting greater prenatal testosterone exposure) has been associated with higher ability in some numeric competencies such as counting and problem solving (Fink, Brookes, Neave, Manning, &amp; Geary, 2006), subitizing (Brookes, Neave, Hamilton, &amp; Fink, 2007) as well 372 M.

This paper, therefore, sought to examine the relationship between an indirect measure of prenatal hormone exposure, DR, and (1) computer-related attainment, and (2) computer-related anxiety. Within the ﬁndings described above there are discrepancies as to whether these relationships are identiﬁed for males and/or females as well as for the right and/or left hand. Those who have selected university courses are likely to have done so based upon their academic strengths and have been found to be reﬂected in their DRs (Brosnan, 2006; see also Romano, Leoni, &amp; Saino, 2006). Thus, we anticipate that those who have numeric strengths and have selected computer science may tend towards a more male-typical DR than the normal population. Typically, those within university education who have selected programming courses do not display computer-related anxiety. It is, therefore, possible that those who select courses that have little computer programming may be more likely to exhibit computer anxiety. We therefore studied two groups, ﬁrstly computerrelated attainment in those who had selected programming, and computer-related anx</context>

Brosnan (2008) also identiﬁed a stronger relationship between average DR and attainment than either left or right hand DR and attainment in the school children. Typically, relationships tend to be stronger for the right DR than the left DR. In the present study, however, relationships were stronger for the left hand – particularly for study 2.

The two predominant factors that consistently predict engagement with ICT are technological capability, speciﬁcally programming ability, and computer-related anxieties (Brosnan, 1998a for review). Reasons why differences in ICT use exist are multifaceted, and certainly include socialization and cultural inﬂuences. However, it is also likely that hormonal factors may play a role. Prenatal exposure to sex hormones, such as testosterone and oestrogen, has important organisational effects upon the brain, which in turn is thought to inﬂuence a range of behaviors (Collear &amp; Hines, 1995). These organisational effects may play a signiﬁcant role in inﬂuencing engagement with ICT. 2D:4D digit ratio (hereafter DR) is the relative length of the 4th digit compared to the 2nd digit and has been argued to be a marker * Corresponding author.

Thorpe and Brosnan (2007) identiﬁed levels of computer anxiety that were considered comparable to clinical levels of anxiety (spider phobia) and analyses of the correlates of computer-related anxieties suggested that social/performance issues underpin such concerns. Despite the evidence of a sex difference in anxiety, to date there have been only two studies examining the relationship between DR and anxiety. Evardone and Alexander (2009) identiﬁed a positive relationship between 2D:4D and anxiety for male undergraduate students, but not females. de Bruin, Verheij, Wiegman, and Ferdinand (2004) also suggest that males with anxiety disorders might have been exposed to lower prenatal testosterone levels, indexed through higher DRs (females were not assessed). Taken together, it seems that sex differences in technologybased activities might be hormonally mediated.

We chose to include the ASI as this is a good measure of fear of anxiety-related sensation, and has been shown to be a good predictor of the development of panic-like sensations, as well as showing some sex differences (Keogh, 2004). The ASI is comprised of 16 items designed to assess the fear of anxiety-related sensations (e.g., ‘when I notice that my heart is beating rapidly, I worry that I might have a heart attack’). Respondents indicate the degree to which each item applies to them on a 5-point scale ranging from ‘very little’ (1) to ‘very much’ (5). Items on the ASI can be summated to give an overall anxiety sensitivity score ranging from 16 to 80 (higher anxiety sensitivity). Cronbach’s Alpha for this sample was 0.88. 5.

The relationship between DR and attainment was found for two separate cohorts of students and, for the second cohort, two separate assessments of Java programming ability. The meta-analysis highlighted correlations that were largely around 0.2 indicating that, although signiﬁcant, this is a small effect. However, this is consistent with research that indicates a relationship between DR and numerical abilities and educational attainment (Brookes et al., 2007; Brosnan, 2008; Bull &amp; Benson, 2006; Fink et al., 2006; Luxen &amp; Buunk, 2005). In terms of anxiety, three different measures of anxiety signiﬁcantly correlated with DR, indicating that higher exposure to prenatal testosterone was associated with lower anxiety. This is consistent with the previous two studies exploring the relationship between DR and anxiety (de Bruin et al., 2004; Evardone &amp; Alexander, 2009). The correlations between DR and anxiety sensitivity are interesting, and could suggest that DR is simply related to anxiety more generally, rather than speciﬁcally to computer-related events (the relatively low internal validity of the computer anxiety scales shou</context>

Design and procedure The second and fourth digits of both the right and left hand were measured using transparent rulers, accurate to 1 mm. Selfmeasurement of DR was used in these studies, and has been validated against digital calliper measurements (Brosnan, 2006). Discrepancies have been reported between direct measurement of DR and measurement from a photocopy (Caswell &amp; Manning, 2009; Manning, Fink, Neave, &amp; Caswell, 2005) which need to be borne in mind when interpreting the results. The DRs were calculated for the left and right hands and then averaged (e.g. Brosnan, 2008). In addition, the difference in right and left DRs was calculated (right DR – left DR: Dr-l). Four variables were therefore calculated for DR: right hand DR, left hand DR, averaged (mean) DR and the difference between right and left hand DR (Dr-l). Java was selected as the programming language of study as it is currently widely taught within UK universities and therefore represents an ecologically valid task.

We therefore sought to examine whether DR (as an index of organisational testosterone/oestrogen) was related to an independent assessment of numerically-oriented capability, within a technology-based context.

This paper, therefore, sought to examine the relationship between an indirect measure of prenatal hormone exposure, DR, and (1) computer-related attainment, and (2) computer-related anxiety. Within the ﬁndings described above there are discrepancies as to whether these relationships are identiﬁed for males and/or females as well as for the right and/or left hand. Those who have selected university courses are likely to have done so based upon their academic strengths and have been found to be reﬂected in their DRs (Brosnan, 2006; see also Romano, Leoni, &amp; Saino, 2006). Thus, we anticipate that those who have numeric strengths and have selected computer science may tend towards a more male-typical DR than the normal population. Typically, those within university education who have selected programming courses do not display computer-related anxiety. It is, therefore, possible that those who select courses that have little computer programming may be more likely to exhibit computer anxiety. We therefore studied two groups, ﬁrstly computerrelated attainment in those who had selected programming, and computer-related anxiety in those who had not selected prog</context>

Controlling for anxiety sensitivity dramatically reduced the signiﬁcance of the relationship between DR and computer-related anxiety, although a signiﬁcant relationship was retained for the left hand. Given that social/performance anxiety is particularly associated with computer-related anxiety (Thorpe &amp; Brosnan, 2007), it would be interesting to consider in future research the potentially protective role that prenatal testosterone may have with respect to sensitivity to anxiety. Thus, prenatal testosterone may exert inﬂuence upon the uptake of ICT-based activities through both cognitive and emotional mechanisms. Of course there are some limitations that need to be considered with the current study.

(1998) report a mean DR for males of 0.98 (4th digit longer than the 2nd digit) and 1.0 for females (4th and 2nd digits of equal length). Additionally, DRs generally show a negative correlation with behaviors which typically demonstrate a male advantage (e.g. mental rotation) and a positive correlation with behaviors which typically demonstrate a female advantage (e.g. location memory: for reviews see Cohen-Bendahan, van de Beek, &amp; Berenbaum, 2005; McIntyre, 2006; Putz, Gaulin, Sporter, &amp; McBurney, 2004; Voracek &amp; Loibl, 2009). Of particular relevance to the current study, DR has been related to numerical competency, which might impact on engagement and success working with ICT. A lower DR (more male-typical, reﬂecting greater prenatal testosterone exposure) has been associated with higher ability in some numeric competencies such as counting and problem solving (Fink, Brookes, Neave, Manning, &amp; Geary, 2006), subitizing (Brookes, Neave, Hamilton, &amp; Fink, 2007) as well 372 M.
