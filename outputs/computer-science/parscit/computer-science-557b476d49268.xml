Abstract—The C Programming Language is one of the most
popular teaching programming languages. It is generally
considered that the computer programming time that a student
spent on his homework directly affects his grade of the C
Programming Language. There is little research regarding the
correlation of students’ computer programming time and their
test grades. The computer programming time, grades of final
test and the Zhejiang Computer Grade Test Band II
(ZCGTBII) of students from a teaching class are collected. The
students are divided into two groups based on their
programming time. The T-Test is employed to analyze grades
of final test and the ZCGTBII of the two groups. Analysis
results show that the mean and the passing rates of final test
and the ZCGTBII of Group I are greater than those of Group
II. Therefore, we conclude that the amount of time students
spend practicing programming on computers plays a very
important role towards mastering the C Programming
Language.

INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.979649175">
The C programming language is one of the most widely
used programming languages in industry [1][2]. It is also one
of the most popular teaching programming languages [3]-[7].
Harry H. Cheng listed ten good reasons to teach and learn the
C programming language [7]. To learn the C programming
language, a student needs to practice programming on
computers. It is generally considered that the computer
programming time of a student directly affects his
performance on the course of the C programming language.
There is little research regarding the effects of computer
programming time and a student&amp;apos;s progress learning the C
programming language. Some experimental teaching
systems and reforms were presented in [8][9]. Educational
data mining methods were reviewed in [10]-[12].
In this paper, the computer programming time on
homework, final grades and grades of the Zhejiang
Computer Grade Test Band II (ZCGTBII) of students from a
teaching class are collected. The Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit
Test is used to verify that final grades and ZCGTBII grades
of this teaching class subject to the normal distribution. This
is what we expect to be. Students of this teaching class are
divided into two groups based on students’ computer
programming time on homework and minimum computer
programming time on homework that the course of the C
programming language syllabus prescribed for a student to
learn this course. Group I is the students whose total
computer programming time on homework is greater than or
equal to the minimum computer programming time on
homework. Group II is the students whose total computer
programming time on homework is less than the minimum
total computer programming time on homework. The TwoSample Pooled T-Test is employed to analyze the final
grades and the ZCGTBII grades of the two groups of
students.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
gives an overview of some hypothesis tests that will be used
in following sections. Section III introduces how to collect
the analysis data. Section IV presents students’ grades
analysis methods. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section
V.

According to teaching syllabus of the course of the C
Programming Language revised in 2008 [15], teaching
activities include 16 lectures and 16 computer programming
classes. Each lecture has two class hours and each computer
programming class has three class hours. There is homework

In order to analyze the relation between students’ grades
and the time that students spent on programming after
classes, one of C programming teaching classes is selected.
This teaching class has 84 students. Students’ final grades
and grades of the Zhejiang Computer Grade Test Band II
(ZCGTBII) are collected, as shown in column two and three
of TABLE I. The statistics graph of students’ final grades
and the ZCGTBII grades are made, as shown in Figure 1 and

homework, is the time that students used to do their
homework after classes. The former is the same to each
student, thus when analyzing students programming time,
this part will be subtracted.
In our university, students do their C Programming
Language homework in our public computer centers. Thus
the computer programming time on homework of a student
can be extracted from the Homework System that is
developed to collect students’ homework online, and the
Computer Laboratory Management System (CLMS) which
is installed in our public computer centers to manage the
usage of the computers. Because there has a record when a
student commits his homework in the Homework System,
and there has a record when a student starts using a computer
and how long does it last in the CLMS. The computer
programming time on homework of a student is summed
from each time period that he (or she) uses a computer in
public computer centers between the ends of each computer
programming class and the moment that he (or she) commits
his (or her) homework.
The total computer programming time on homework is a
student spending on all homework assignments of the course
of the C Programming Language. Because there have 16
homework assignments for the C Programming Language,
thus, the total computer programming time on homework is a
sum of each computer programming time on homework. The
total computer programming time on homework of each
student is listed in column four of TABLE II.

Different students have different final grades and
ZCGTBII grades, because they have different efforts on the
course of the C Programming Language. Thus students’ final
grades and ZCGTBII grades are considered random
variables. The hypothesis tests that mentioned in section II

final grades and ZCGTBII grades are following the normal

B. Spending more computer programming time on
homework versus spending less computer programming
time on homework: “Effects” on score
Do students who spend more computer programming
time on homework receive higher scores than those who
spending less computer programming time on homework?
TABLE II.
Bin NO
This question arises when instructors consider encouraging
students to spend more programming time on the course of C
programming Language. It is supposed to get higher grades
if you spend more time to practice C programming. Does it
true? The Two-Sample Pooled T-Test is employed to test it.
Based on teaching syllabus of the course of C
Programming Language revised in 2008, students are asked
to spend no less than three class hours to do each of their
homework assignments. Thus the total computer
programming time on homework of a student is supposed to
be no less than 48 class hours, which is 2160 minutes.
However, some students spend much more than the
suggested time on homework assignments, and some
students spend much less than the suggested time working on
their assignments. Using this time, students are divided into
two groups. One is the group of students whose total
computer programming time on homework is greater than or
equal to this time, denoted as Group I. The other is the group
of students whose total computer programming time on
homework is less than this time, denoted as Group II. Based
on this classification principle, there are 68 students in Group
I and 16 students in Group II. Students’ final grades and
ZCGTBII grades are used to test if the Group I receives
higher grades than the Group II.
1) Comparing the passing rate of two groups of students
We define the passing rate of a group in an exam as
number of students who pass the exam divide by total
number of students in that group. The passing rates of final
test and ZCGTBII of the two groups of students are shown in
TABLE iv. From TABLE iv, we know that the passing rates
of final test and ZCGTBII of Group I are greater than those
of Group II by 18.75 and 19.54 percentage points,
respectively.

prescribed for a student to learn this course, students of a
teaching class are divided into two groups. Group I is the
students whose total computer programming time on
homework is greater than or equal to the minimum computer
programming time on homework. Group II is the students
whose total computer programming time on homework is
less than the minimum computer programming time on
homework. Hypothesis tests are employed to analyze the
final grades and the ZCGTBII grades of the two groups of
students. Analysis results show that the mean of the final
grades and the mean of ZCGTBII grades of Group I are
greater than those of Group II by 9.0 and 7.0 points,
respectively. Analysis results also show that the passing rates
of final test and ZCGTBII of Group I are greater than those
of Group II by 18.75 and 19.54 percentage points,
respectively. Thus we can conclude that the time that a
student practicing programming on computers plays a very
important role in their C Programming Language learning.
Therefore, in teaching process of the course of the C
Programming Language, In addition to normal classroom
teaching, teachers/instructors should encourage students to
use computers to do an appropriate amount of homework.
