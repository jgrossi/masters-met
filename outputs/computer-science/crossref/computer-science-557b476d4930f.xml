(ICT - for example desktop or laptop computers) permeates almost all aspects of
educational, occupational and leisure environments in modern industrial societies.
Being able to use ICT effectively has become an essential element of the skill-base
required to participate within an increasingly digital culture. The two predominant
factors that consistently predict engagement with ICT are technological capability,
specifically programming ability, and computer-related anxieties (Brosnan, 1998a for
review). Reasons why differences in ICT use exist are multifaceted, and certainly
include socialization and cultural influences. However, it is also likely that
hormonal factors may play a role. Prenatal exposure to sex hormones, such as
testosterone and oestrogen, has important organisational effects upon the brain,
which in turn is thought to influence a range of behaviors (Collear &amp; Hines,
1995). These organisational effects may play a significant role in influencing
engagement with ICT. 2D:4D digit ratio (hereafter DR) is the relative length of the
4th digit compared to the 2nd digit and has been argued to be a marker<component

prenatal oestrogen exposure (Manning, Scutt, Wilson, &amp; Lewis-Jones, 1998).
Lutchmaya, Baron-Cohen, Raggatt, Knickmeyer, and Manning (2004) report a significant
correlation between DR in 2-year-olds and their prenatal testosterone relative to
prenatal oestrogen in samples obtained from amniocentesis, suggesting that DR is a
direct correlate of prenatal sex steroid exposure. Typically males are exposed to
higher levels of prenatal testosterone than females and, consistent with this, a sex
difference in DR has been identified. Manning et al. (1998) report a mean DR for
males of 0.98 (4th digit longer than the 2nd digit) and 1.0 for females (4th and 2nd
digits of equal length). Additionally, DRs generally show a negative correlation with
behaviors which typically demonstrate a male advantage (e.g. mental rotation) and a
positive correlation with behaviors which typically demonstrate a female advantage
(e.g. location memory: for reviews see Cohen-Bendahan, van de Beek, &amp; Berenbaum,
2005; McIntyre, 2006; Putz, Gaulin, Sporter, &amp; McBurney, 2004; Voracek &amp;
Loibl, 2009). Of particular relevance to the current study, DR has been related to
numerical competency, which might impact on engagement and success working with ICT.
A lower DR (more male-typical, reflecting greater prenatal testosterone exposure) has
been associated with higher ability in some numeric competencies such as counting and
problem solving (Fink, Brookes, Neave, Manning, &amp; Geary, 2006), subitizing
(Brookes, Neave, Hamilton, &amp; Fink, 2007) as well as numeric IQ (Kempel et al.,
2005; Luxen &amp; Buunk, 2005). Brosnan (2008) also reported negative correlations
between DR and numerical SAT scores in 7-year-old school children. This suggests that
the relationship between DR and numeric capabilities may relate to academic
attainment. There are to date, however, no data exploring the potential relationship
between DR and numerical capability in university-level students. This is interesting
as such a relationship would be consistent with the argument that the organisational
effects of sex hormones on the brain influence aspects of academic attainment. Java
programming is widely used within UK university computer science courses which draw
upon numeric competencies, such as problem-solving (see Prechelt, 2000). We therefore
sought to examine whether DR (as an index of organisational testosterone/oestrogen)
was related to an independent assessment of numerically-oriented capability, within a
technology-based context. A preliminary study of 23 postgraduate students found a
significant negative correlation between DR and programming ability (Brosnan, 2004).
Within modern industrial societies, university computer science courses are typically
male-dominated (see Brosnan, 1998b). Although sex differences in technology-based
engagement might be related to hormonally-mediated differences in numeric abilities,
an alternative explanation could be due to sex differences in anxiety, especially
with computers (in addition to other potential differences such as differential
encouragement from parents and educators). Females generally report higher levels of
anxiety than males (e.g. Pigott, 2003) and studies have consistently found that
females report more computer-related anxieties than males (e.g. Brosnan, 1998a; Rosen
&amp; Weil, 1995; Thorpe &amp; Brosnan, 2007 for review). Thorpe and Brosnan (2007)
identified levels of computer anxiety that were considered comparable to clinical
levels of anxiety (spider phobia) and analyses of the correlates of computer-related
anxieties suggested that social/performance issues underpin such concerns. Despite
the evidence of a sex difference in anxiety, to date there have been only two studies
examining the relationship between DR and anxiety. Evardone and Alexander (2009)
identified a positive relationship between 2D:4D and anxiety for male undergraduate
students, but not females. de Bruin, Verheij, Wiegman, and Ferdinand (2004) also
suggest that males with anxiety disorders might have been exposed to lower prenatal
testosterone levels, indexed through higher DRs (females were not assessed). Taken
together, it seems that sex differences in technologybased activities might be
hormonally mediated. Prenatal exposure to sex hormones could manifest their influence
behaviorally in two ways: cognitively (through better ability on computer-based
tasks) and/or emotionally (though heightened computer-based anxiety). However, no
study to date has examined these possibilities. This paper, therefore, sought to
examine the relationship between an indirect measure of prenatal hormone exposure,
DR, and (1) computer-related attainment, and (2) computer-related anxiety. Within the
findings described above there are discrepancies as to whether these relationships
are identified for males and/or females as well as for the right and/or left hand.
Those who have selected university courses are likely to have done so based upon
their academic strengths and have been found to be reflected in their DRs (Brosnan,
2006; see also Romano, Leoni, &amp; Saino, 2006). Thus, we anticipate that those who
have numeric strengths and have selected computer science may tend towards a more
male-typical DR than the normal population. Typically, those within university
education who have selected programming courses do not display computer-related
anxiety. It is, therefore, possible that those who select courses that have little
computer programming may be more likely to exhibit computer anxiety. We therefore
studied two groups, firstly computerrelated attainment in those who had selected
programming, and computer-related anxiety in those who had not selected
programming.<component x="311.53" y="65.8" width="251.09" height="259.05" page="1"

students had achieved an A grade in A-level mathematics (the top grade for UK
examinations typically taken at 1 age 18 to enter university at the time of the study
). A replication study the following year (study 1b, see below) recruited 75 students

and left hand were measured using transparent rulers, accurate to 1 mm.
Selfmeasurement of DR was used in these studies, and has been validated against
digital calliper measurements (Brosnan, 2006). Discrepancies have been reported
between direct measurement of DR and measurement from a photocopy (Caswell &amp;
Manning, 2009; Manning, Fink, Neave, &amp; Caswell, 2005) which need to be borne in
mind when interpreting the results. The DRs were calculated for the left and right
hands and then averaged (e.g. Brosnan, 2008). In addition, the difference in right
and left DRs was calculated (right DR - left DR: Dr-l). Four variables were therefore
calculated for DR: right hand DR, left hand DR, averaged (mean) DR and the difference
between right and left hand DR (Dr-l). Java was selected as the programming language
of study as it is currently widely taught within UK universities and therefore
represents an ecologically valid task. The numerical capability most explicitly
addressed within the programming course was problem solving. The course introduced
students to problem analysis and provided the practical skills of reading and writing
programs and producing programs to solve real world problems. Students were provided
with domain specific problem-solving techniques which were formally assessed through
examination at the end of the semester. The course ran for a 12-week semester and the
DR assessment took place around halfway through the course. After the semester course
was assessed, the examination grades were obtained. The authors were not involved in
the assessment of the course. One-tailed tests were conducted for a directional
prediction that lower DR (indicative of higher prenatal testosterone) would correlate
with higher grades (i.e., a negative correlation). Data were collected at three time
points. The study described above (study 1a) was followed by two studies the
following year (studies 1b &amp;1c). Study 1b replicated study 1a, the only
difference was the inclusion of a question that sought to gauge if programming
experience was a factor. Students were therefore asked to estimate on average, how
many hours per day they spent programming e.g., using Visual Basic, Java, C++, etc.
The assessment for the study 1b course was a variant of the assessment for study 1a.
Study 1c was a replication of study 1b, following up the students from study 1b who

test for equality of variance was not violated and a t-test revealed a significant
sex difference in right hand DR (t = 1.99, 211 p = 0.024) with a small effect size. A
mean difference in left hand DR was not found between males and females see Table 1,
resulting in a small effect size for the average of the left and right DRs. There was
also a small (non-significant) effect for Dr-l, males tending to have a relatively
lower DR on their right hand, females having a relatively lower DR on the left hand.
For males, the left and right DRs significantly correlated (r = 3.1, p &lt; 0.001)

correlated with success within computer science Java programming attainment. The
final study examined relationships between DR and computer-related anxieties. As
noted above, those who self-select into programming courses typically have low levels
of computer-related anxiety, and so for this study we recruited students who had not

questionnaires were also completed: 4.2.1. Computer anxiety rating scale (CARS; Rosen

computer') rated to indicate 'how anxious (nervous) each activity would make you at
this point in your life'. The CARS items are rated on a 5-point scale (5 = 'very
much', 4 = 'a fair amount', 3 = 'a little', 2 = 'not much' and 1 = 'not at all')
yielding a total possible score ranging from 20 to 100, with higher scores indicating
more computer anxiety. Cronbach's Alpha for this sample was 0.58. 4.2.2. Clinical
computer anxiety (CCA; Thorpe &amp; Brosnan, 2007) The CCA was derived from 6 DSM-IV
criteria for a specific phobia (e.g. 'I always feel anxious when using computers').
Respondents respond on a Likert-type scale from strongly agree (5) to strongly
disagree (1). Scores could range from 6 through to 30 (highly anxious). Cronbach's
Alpha for this sample was 0.53. 4.2.3. Anxiety sensitivity index (ASI; Reiss,
Peterson, Gursky, &amp; McNally, 1986) In addition to specific measures associated
with computer-related fear, we also felt it useful to include a more general measure
of anxiety. We chose to include the ASI as this is a good measure of fear of
anxiety-related sensation, and has been shown to be a good predictor of the
development of panic-like sensations, as well as showing some sex differences (Keogh,
2004). The ASI is comprised of 16 items designed to assess the fear of
anxiety-related sensations (e.g., 'when I notice that my heart is beating rapidly, I
worry that I might have a heart attack'). Respondents indicate the degree to which
each item applies to them on a 5-point scale ranging from 'very little' (1) to 'very
much' (5). Items on the ASI can be summated to give an overall anxiety sensitivity
score ranging from 16 to 80 (higher anxiety sensitivity). Cronbach's Alpha for this

exposure which has been found to relate to an advantage in numeric capabilities and
lower levels of anxiety. These studies have identified that a significant
relationship exists between DR and academic attainment on a university Java
programming course - a higher index of prenatal testosterone exposure was associated
with higher attainment. In addition in undergraduate students, who had not selected
computer science, DR correlated with computer-related anxiety (including anxiety
sensitivity) - a higher index of prenatal testosterone exposure was associated with
lower levels of anxiety. Taken together, these studies are suggestive of a role of
prenatal testosterone exposure in both attainment within computer science and anxiety
concerning the use of ICT, as well as susceptibility to panic. This is significant as
attainment and anxiety have been identified as the two major factors impacting upon
effective use of ICT within educational, occupational and leisure environments
(Brosnan, 1998a). Importantly, the DR relationships retained significance when
controlling for sex and self-reported programming activity suggesting that these
factors were not mediating the relationship between DR and attainment. The
relationship between DR and attainment was found for two separate cohorts of students
and, for the second cohort, two separate assessments of Java programming ability. The
meta-analysis highlighted correlations that were largely around 0.2 indicating that,
although significant, this is a small effect. However, this is consistent with
research that indicates a relationship between DR and numerical abilities and
educational attainment (Brookes et al., 2007; Brosnan, 2008; Bull &amp; Benson, 2006;
Fink et al., 2006; Luxen &amp; Buunk, 2005). In terms of anxiety, three different
measures of anxiety significantly correlated with DR, indicating that higher exposure
to prenatal testosterone was associated with lower anxiety. This is consistent with
the previous two studies exploring the relationship between DR and anxiety (de Bruin
et al., 2004; Evardone &amp; Alexander, 2009). The correlations between DR and
anxiety sensitivity are interesting, and could suggest that DR is simply related to
anxiety more generally, rather than specifically to computer-related events (the
relatively low internal validity of the computer anxiety scales should be borne in
mind). However, what is notable about anxiety sensitivity is that it is related to
the fear of anxiety-related sensation and as well as fearing cardiovascular
sensations, also includes items pertaining to the fear of losing mental/cognitive
control, as well as fearful of more socially-related anxiety sensations (e.g.,
sweating, embarrassment). Controlling for anxiety sensitivity dramatically reduced
the significance of the relationship between DR and computer-related anxiety,
although a significant relationship was retained for the left hand. Given that
social/performance anxiety is particularly associated with computer-related anxiety
(Thorpe &amp; Brosnan, 2007), it would be interesting to consider in future research
the potentially protective role that prenatal testosterone may have with respect to
sensitivity to anxiety. Thus, prenatal testosterone may exert influence upon the
uptake of ICT-based activities through both cognitive and emotional mechanisms. Of
course there are some limitations that need to be considered with the current study.
The self-measurement of DR could be open to measurement error and this should be
borne in mind when interpreting the results (see Caswell &amp; Manning, 2009). The
meta-analysis also highlighted the relative strength of the relationship between
averaged (mean of left and right hand) DR and attainment when compared to left and
right DR, which is consistent with previous research. Brosnan (2008) also identified
a stronger relationship between average DR and attainment than either left or right
hand DR and attainment in the school children. Typically, relationships tend to be
stronger for the right DR than the left DR. In the present study, however,
relationships were stronger for the left hand - particularly for study 2. The lack of
any significant correlations for the difference between right and left hand DRs (Drl)
across all four studies indicates that the difference between hands per se is not
relevant. Overall the pattern of correlations was consistent for averaged, right and
left hand DRs. Why an average of right and left DR represents the strongest
relationship with academic attainment remains to be determined. This may be a
valuable avenue of research as it has been proposed that as a consequence of these
relationships, DR may influence subsequent professional fields of interest (Romano et
al., 2006).<component x="301.72" y="38.3" width="251.1" height="415.92" page="4"

(ICT - for example desktop or laptop computers) permeates almost all aspects of
educational, occupational and leisure environments in modern industrial societies.
Being able to use ICT effectively has become an essential element of the skill-base
required to participate within an increasingly digital culture. The two predominant
factors that consistently predict engagement with ICT are technological capability,
specifically programming ability, and computer-related anxieties (Brosnan, 1998a for
review). Reasons why differences in ICT use exist are multifaceted, and certainly
include socialization and cultural influences. However, it is also likely that
hormonal factors may play a role. Prenatal exposure to sex hormones, such as
testosterone and oestrogen, has important organisational effects upon the brain,
which in turn is thought to influence a range of behaviors (Collear &amp; Hines,
1995). These organisational effects may play a significant role in influencing
engagement with ICT. 2D:4D digit ratio (hereafter DR) is the relative length of the
4th digit compared to the 2nd digit and has been argued to be a marker<component

prenatal oestrogen exposure (Manning, Scutt, Wilson, &amp; Lewis-Jones, 1998).
Lutchmaya, Baron-Cohen, Raggatt, Knickmeyer, and Manning (2004) report a significant
correlation between DR in 2-year-olds and their prenatal testosterone relative to
prenatal oestrogen in samples obtained from amniocentesis, suggesting that DR is a
direct correlate of prenatal sex steroid exposure. Typically males are exposed to
higher levels of prenatal testosterone than females and, consistent with this, a sex
difference in DR has been identified. Manning et al. (1998) report a mean DR for
males of 0.98 (4th digit longer than the 2nd digit) and 1.0 for females (4th and 2nd
digits of equal length). Additionally, DRs generally show a negative correlation with
behaviors which typically demonstrate a male advantage (e.g. mental rotation) and a
positive correlation with behaviors which typically demonstrate a female advantage
(e.g. location memory: for reviews see Cohen-Bendahan, van de Beek, &amp; Berenbaum,
2005; McIntyre, 2006; Putz, Gaulin, Sporter, &amp; McBurney, 2004; Voracek &amp;
Loibl, 2009). Of particular relevance to the current study, DR has been related to
numerical competency, which might impact on engagement and success working with ICT.
A lower DR (more male-typical, reflecting greater prenatal testosterone exposure) has
been associated with higher ability in some numeric competencies such as counting and
problem solving (Fink, Brookes, Neave, Manning, &amp; Geary, 2006), subitizing
(Brookes, Neave, Hamilton, &amp; Fink, 2007) as well as numeric IQ (Kempel et al.,
2005; Luxen &amp; Buunk, 2005). Brosnan (2008) also reported negative correlations
between DR and numerical SAT scores in 7-year-old school children. This suggests that
the relationship between DR and numeric capabilities may relate to academic
attainment. There are to date, however, no data exploring the potential relationship
between DR and numerical capability in university-level students. This is interesting
as such a relationship would be consistent with the argument that the organisational
effects of sex hormones on the brain influence aspects of academic attainment. Java
programming is widely used within UK university computer science courses which draw
upon numeric competencies, such as problem-solving (see Prechelt, 2000). We therefore
sought to examine whether DR (as an index of organisational testosterone/oestrogen)
was related to an independent assessment of numerically-oriented capability, within a
technology-based context. A preliminary study of 23 postgraduate students found a
significant negative correlation between DR and programming ability (Brosnan, 2004).
Within modern industrial societies, university computer science courses are typically
male-dominated (see Brosnan, 1998b). Although sex differences in technology-based
engagement might be related to hormonally-mediated differences in numeric abilities,
an alternative explanation could be due to sex differences in anxiety, especially
with computers (in addition to other potential differences such as differential
encouragement from parents and educators). Females generally report higher levels of
anxiety than males (e.g. Pigott, 2003) and studies have consistently found that
females report more computer-related anxieties than males (e.g. Brosnan, 1998a; Rosen
&amp; Weil, 1995; Thorpe &amp; Brosnan, 2007 for review). Thorpe and Brosnan (2007)
identified levels of computer anxiety that were considered comparable to clinical
levels of anxiety (spider phobia) and analyses of the correlates of computer-related
anxieties suggested that social/performance issues underpin such concerns. Despite
the evidence of a sex difference in anxiety, to date there have been only two studies
examining the relationship between DR and anxiety. Evardone and Alexander (2009)
identified a positive relationship between 2D:4D and anxiety for male undergraduate
students, but not females. de Bruin, Verheij, Wiegman, and Ferdinand (2004) also
suggest that males with anxiety disorders might have been exposed to lower prenatal
testosterone levels, indexed through higher DRs (females were not assessed). Taken
together, it seems that sex differences in technologybased activities might be
hormonally mediated. Prenatal exposure to sex hormones could manifest their influence
behaviorally in two ways: cognitively (through better ability on computer-based
tasks) and/or emotionally (though heightened computer-based anxiety). However, no
study to date has examined these possibilities. This paper, therefore, sought to
examine the relationship between an indirect measure of prenatal hormone exposure,
DR, and (1) computer-related attainment, and (2) computer-related anxiety. Within the
findings described above there are discrepancies as to whether these relationships
are identified for males and/or females as well as for the right and/or left hand.
Those who have selected university courses are likely to have done so based upon
their academic strengths and have been found to be reflected in their DRs (Brosnan,
2006; see also Romano, Leoni, &amp; Saino, 2006). Thus, we anticipate that those who
have numeric strengths and have selected computer science may tend towards a more
male-typical DR than the normal population. Typically, those within university
education who have selected programming courses do not display computer-related
anxiety. It is, therefore, possible that those who select courses that have little
computer programming may be more likely to exhibit computer anxiety. We therefore
studied two groups, firstly computerrelated attainment in those who had selected
programming, and computer-related anxiety in those who had not selected
programming.<component x="311.53" y="65.8" width="251.09" height="259.05" page="1"

Selfmeasurement of DR was used in these studies, and has been validated against
digital calliper measurements (Brosnan, 2006). Discrepancies have been reported
between direct measurement of DR and measurement from a photocopy (Caswell &amp;
Manning, 2009; Manning, Fink, Neave, &amp; Caswell, 2005) which need to be borne in
mind when interpreting the results. The DRs were calculated for the left and right
hands and then averaged (e.g. Brosnan, 2008). In addition, the difference in right
and left DRs was calculated (right DR - left DR: Dr-l). Four variables were therefore
calculated for DR: right hand DR, left hand DR, averaged (mean) DR and the difference
between right and left hand DR (Dr-l). Java was selected as the programming language
of study as it is currently widely taught within UK universities and therefore
represents an ecologically valid task. The numerical capability most explicitly
addressed within the programming course was problem solving. The course introduced
students to problem analysis and provided the practical skills of reading and writing
programs and producing programs to solve real world problems. Students were provided
with domain specific problem-solving techniques which were formally assessed through
examination at the end of the semester. The course ran for a 12-week semester and the
DR assessment took place around halfway through the course. After the semester course
was assessed, the examination grades were obtained. The authors were not involved in
the assessment of the course. One-tailed tests were conducted for a directional
prediction that lower DR (indicative of higher prenatal testosterone) would correlate
with higher grades (i.e., a negative correlation). Data were collected at three time
points. The study described above (study 1a) was followed by two studies the

combined into a single grouping to allow for a meta-analysis of the relationship
between DR and Java scores (acknowledging that different Javabased assessments were
taken over different time points). This provided an opportunity to explore the
relationships over 213 data points (73 from study 1a, 75 from study 2b and 65 from
Study 2c) - 162 from males and 51 from females. Despite the uneven groups, Levine's
test for equality of variance was not violated and a t-test revealed a significant
sex difference in right hand DR (t = 1.99, 211 p = 0.024) with a small effect size. A
mean difference in left hand DR was not found between males and females see Table 1,
resulting in a small effect size for the average of the left and right DRs. There was
also a small (non-significant) effect for Dr-l, males tending to have a relatively
lower DR on their right hand, females having a relatively lower DR on the left hand.
For males, the left and right DRs significantly correlated (r = 3.1, p &lt; 0.001)
and did 162 not differ significantly (t = 1.52, p = 0.13) and the same pattern 161
was evident for females (r = 0.67, p &lt; 0.001; t = 1.84, p = 0.07). 51 50 Java

correlations controlling for sex did not ( impact upon these relationships. Study 1
(a-c) and the combined meta-analysis provided consistent, if weak, evidence that DR
correlated with success within computer science Java programming attainment. The
final study examined relationships between DR and computer-related anxieties. As
noted above, those who self-select into programming courses typically have low levels
of computer-related anxiety, and so for this study we recruited students who had not

questionnaires were also completed: 4.2.1. Computer anxiety rating scale (CARS; Rosen
&amp; Weil, 1995) The CARS contains 20 items (e.g. 'Sitting in front of a home
computer') rated to indicate 'how anxious (nervous) each activity would make you at
this point in your life'. The CARS items are rated on a 5-point scale (5 = 'very
much', 4 = 'a fair amount', 3 = 'a little', 2 = 'not much' and 1 = 'not at all')
yielding a total possible score ranging from 20 to 100, with higher scores indicating
more computer anxiety. Cronbach's Alpha for this sample was 0.58. 4.2.2. Clinical
computer anxiety (CCA; Thorpe &amp; Brosnan, 2007) The CCA was derived from 6 DSM-IV
criteria for a specific phobia (e.g. 'I always feel anxious when using computers').
Respondents respond on a Likert-type scale from strongly agree (5) to strongly
disagree (1). Scores could range from 6 through to 30 (highly anxious). Cronbach's
Alpha for this sample was 0.53. 4.2.3. Anxiety sensitivity index (ASI; Reiss,
Peterson, Gursky, &amp; McNally, 1986) In addition to specific measures associated
with computer-related fear, we also felt it useful to include a more general measure
of anxiety. We chose to include the ASI as this is a good measure of fear of
anxiety-related sensation, and has been shown to be a good predictor of the
development of panic-like sensations, as well as showing some sex differences (Keogh,
2004). The ASI is comprised of 16 items designed to assess the fear of
anxiety-related sensations (e.g., 'when I notice that my heart is beating rapidly, I
worry that I might have a heart attack'). Respondents indicate the degree to which
each item applies to them on a 5-point scale ranging from 'very little' (1) to 'very
much' (5). Items on the ASI can be summated to give an overall anxiety sensitivity
score ranging from 16 to 80 (higher anxiety sensitivity). Cronbach's Alpha for this
sample was 0.88.<component x="32.71" y="707.78" width="251.05" height="18.39"

exposure which has been found to relate to an advantage in numeric capabilities and
lower levels of anxiety. These studies have identified that a significant
relationship exists between DR and academic attainment on a university Java
programming course - a higher index of prenatal testosterone exposure was associated
with higher attainment. In addition in undergraduate students, who had not selected
computer science, DR correlated with computer-related anxiety (including anxiety
sensitivity) - a higher index of prenatal testosterone exposure was associated with
lower levels of anxiety. Taken together, these studies are suggestive of a role of
prenatal testosterone exposure in both attainment within computer science and anxiety
concerning the use of ICT, as well as susceptibility to panic. This is significant as
attainment and anxiety have been identified as the two major factors impacting upon
effective use of ICT within educational, occupational and leisure environments
(Brosnan, 1998a). Importantly, the DR relationships retained significance when
controlling for sex and self-reported programming activity suggesting that these
factors were not mediating the relationship between DR and attainment. The
relationship between DR and attainment was found for two separate cohorts of students
and, for the second cohort, two separate assessments of Java programming ability. The
meta-analysis highlighted correlations that were largely around 0.2 indicating that,
although significant, this is a small effect. However, this is consistent with
research that indicates a relationship between DR and numerical abilities and
educational attainment (Brookes et al., 2007; Brosnan, 2008; Bull &amp; Benson, 2006;
Fink et al., 2006; Luxen &amp; Buunk, 2005). In terms of anxiety, three different
measures of anxiety significantly correlated with DR, indicating that higher exposure
to prenatal testosterone was associated with lower anxiety. This is consistent with
the previous two studies exploring the relationship between DR and anxiety (de Bruin
et al., 2004; Evardone &amp; Alexander, 2009). The correlations between DR and
anxiety sensitivity are interesting, and could suggest that DR is simply related to
anxiety more generally, rather than specifically to computer-related events (the
relatively low internal validity of the computer anxiety scales should be borne in
mind). However, what is notable about anxiety sensitivity is that it is related to
the fear of anxiety-related sensation and as well as fearing cardiovascular
sensations, also includes items pertaining to the fear of losing mental/cognitive
control, as well as fearful of more socially-related anxiety sensations (e.g.,
sweating, embarrassment). Controlling for anxiety sensitivity dramatically reduced
the significance of the relationship between DR and computer-related anxiety,
although a significant relationship was retained for the left hand. Given that
social/performance anxiety is particularly associated with computer-related anxiety
(Thorpe &amp; Brosnan, 2007), it would be interesting to consider in future research
the potentially protective role that prenatal testosterone may have with respect to
sensitivity to anxiety. Thus, prenatal testosterone may exert influence upon the
uptake of ICT-based activities through both cognitive and emotional mechanisms. Of
course there are some limitations that need to be considered with the current study.
The self-measurement of DR could be open to measurement error and this should be
borne in mind when interpreting the results (see Caswell &amp; Manning, 2009). The
meta-analysis also highlighted the relative strength of the relationship between
averaged (mean of left and right hand) DR and attainment when compared to left and
right DR, which is consistent with previous research. Brosnan (2008) also identified
a stronger relationship between average DR and attainment than either left or right
hand DR and attainment in the school children. Typically, relationships tend to be
stronger for the right DR than the left DR. In the present study, however,
relationships were stronger for the left hand - particularly for study 2. The lack of
any significant correlations for the difference between right and left hand DRs (Drl)
across all four studies indicates that the difference between hands per se is not
relevant. Overall the pattern of correlations was consistent for averaged, right and
left hand DRs. Why an average of right and left DR represents the strongest
relationship with academic attainment remains to be determined. This may be a
valuable avenue of research as it has been proposed that as a consequence of these
relationships, DR may influence subsequent professional fields of interest (Romano et
al., 2006).<component x="301.72" y="38.3" width="251.1" height="415.92" page="4"
