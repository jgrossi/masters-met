one of the most Abstract popular teaching programming languages. It is generally
considered that the computer programming time that a student spent on his homework
directly affects his grade of the C Programming Language. There is little research
regarding the correlation of students' computer programming time and their test
grades. The computer programming time, grades of final test and the Zhejiang Computer
Grade Test Band II (ZCGTBII) of students from a teaching class are collected. The
students are divided into two groups based on their programming time. The T-Test is
employed to analyze grades of final test and the ZCGTBII of the two groups. Analysis
results show that the mean and the passing rates of final test and the ZCGTBII of
Group I are greater than those of Group II. Therefore, we conclude that the amount of
time students spend practicing programming on computers plays a very important role
towards mastering the C Programming Language. C Programming language, Grade, Index

programming language is one of the most widely used programming languages in industry
[1][2]. It is also one of the most popular teaching programming languages [3]-[7].
Harry H. Cheng listed ten good reasons to teach and learn the C programming language
[7]. To learn the C programming language, a student needs to practice programming on
computers. It is generally considered that the computer programming time of a student
directly affects his performance on the course of the C programming language. There
is little research regarding the effects of computer programming time and a student's
progress learning the C programming language. Some experimental teaching systems and
reforms were presented in [8][9]. Educational data mining methods were reviewed in

their homework after classes. The former is the same to each student, thus when
analyzing students programming time, this part will be subtracted. In our university,
students do their C Programming Language homework in our public computer centers.
Thus the computer programming time on homework of a student can be extracted from the
Homework System that is developed to collect students' homework online, and the
Computer Laboratory Management System (CLMS) which is installed in our public
computer centers to manage the usage of the computers. Because there has a record
when a student commits his homework in the Homework System, and there has a record
when a student starts using a computer and how long does it last in the CLMS. The
computer programming time on homework of a student is summed from each time period
that he (or she) uses a computer in public computer centers between the ends of each
computer programming class and the moment that he (or she) commits his (or her)
homework. The total computer programming time on homework is a student spending on
all homework assignments of the course of the C Programming Language. Because there
have 16 homework assignments for the C Programming Language, thus, the total computer
programming time on homework is a sum of each computer programming time on homework.
The total computer programming time on homework of each student is listed in column
four of TABLE II. TUDENTS GRADES ANALYSIS METHOD ' IV. S Different students have
different final grades and ZCGTBII grades, because they have different efforts on the
course of the C Programming Language. Thus students' final grades and ZCGTBII grades
are considered random variables. The hypothesis tests that mentioned in section II
can be employed to analyze students' grades. Firstly the ChiSquare goodness-of-fit
test is employed to test if students' final grades and ZCGTBII grades are following
the normal distribution, which is expected to be. Then the Two-Sample Pooled T-Test
is used to test if students who spend more computer programming time on homework get
better scores than those of who spend less computer programming time on
homework.<component x="306.25" y="406.38" width="239.5" height="334.99" page="3"

instructors consider encouraging students to spend more programming time on the
course of C programming Language. It is supposed to get higher grades if you spend
more time to practice C programming. Does it true? The Two-Sample Pooled T-Test is
employed to test it. Based on teaching syllabus of the course of C Programming
Language revised in 2008, students are asked to spend no less than three class hours
to do each of their homework assignments. Thus the total computer programming time on
homework of a student is supposed to be no less than 48 class hours, which is 2160
minutes. However, some students spend much more than the suggested time on homework
assignments, and some students spend much less than the suggested time working on
their assignments. Using this time, students are divided into two groups. One is the
group of students whose total computer programming time on homework is greater than
or equal to this time, denoted as Group I. The other is the group of students whose
total computer programming time on homework is less than this time, denoted as Group
II. Based on this classification principle, there are 68 students in Group I and 16
students in Group II. Students' final grades and ZCGTBII grades are used to test if
the Group I receives higher grades than the Group II. 1) Comparing the passing rate
of two groups of students We define the passing rate of a group in an exam as number
of students who pass the exam divide by total number of students in that group. The
passing rates of final test and ZCGTBII of the two groups of students are shown in
TABLE iv. From TABLE iv, we know that the passing rates of final test and ZCGTBII of
Group I are greater than those of Group II by 18.75 and 19.54 percentage points,
respectively.<component x="306.25" y="340.99" width="239.5" height="400.38" page="4"

We use &#x3BC; &#x3BC; I II 2 2 and to denote the mean and the variances &#x3C3;

groups. Group I is the students whose total computer programming time on homework is
greater than or equal to the minimum computer programming time on homework. Group II
is the students whose total computer programming time on homework is less than the
minimum computer programming time on homework. Hypothesis tests are employed to
analyze the final grades and the ZCGTBII grades of the two groups of students.
Analysis results show that the mean of the final grades and the mean of ZCGTBII
grades of Group I are greater than those of Group II by 9.0 and 7.0 points,
respectively. Analysis results also show that the passing rates of final test and
ZCGTBII of Group I are greater than those of Group II by 18.75 and 19.54 percentage
points, respectively. Thus we can conclude that the time that a student practicing
programming on computers plays a very important role in their C Programming Language
learning. Therefore, in teaching process of the course of the C Programming Language,
In addition to normal classroom teaching, teachers/instructors should encourage
students to use computers to do an appropriate amount of homework.<component

one of the most Abstract popular teaching programming languages. It is generally
considered that the computer programming time that a student spent on his homework
directly affects his grade of the C Programming Language. There is little research
regarding the correlation of students' computer programming time and their test
grades. The computer programming time, grades of final test and the Zhejiang Computer
Grade Test Band II (ZCGTBII) of students from a teaching class are collected. The
students are divided into two groups based on their programming time. The T-Test is
employed to analyze grades of final test and the ZCGTBII of the two groups. Analysis
results show that the mean and the passing rates of final test and the ZCGTBII of
Group I are greater than those of Group II. Therefore, we conclude that the amount of
time students spend practicing programming on computers plays a very important role
towards mastering the C Programming Language. C Programming language, Grade, Index

Harry H. Cheng listed ten good reasons to teach and learn the C programming language
[7]. To learn the C programming language, a student needs to practice programming on
computers. It is generally considered that the computer programming time of a student
directly affects his performance on the course of the C programming language. There
is little research regarding the effects of computer programming time and a student's
progress learning the C programming language. Some experimental teaching systems and

their homework after classes. The former is the same to each student, thus when
analyzing students programming time, this part will be subtracted. In our university,
students do their C Programming Language homework in our public computer centers.
Thus the computer programming time on homework of a student can be extracted from the
Homework System that is developed to collect students' homework online, and the
Computer Laboratory Management System (CLMS) which is installed in our public
computer centers to manage the usage of the computers. Because there has a record
when a student commits his homework in the Homework System, and there has a record
when a student starts using a computer and how long does it last in the CLMS. The
computer programming time on homework of a student is summed from each time period
that he (or she) uses a computer in public computer centers between the ends of each
computer programming class and the moment that he (or she) commits his (or her)
homework. The total computer programming time on homework is a student spending on
all homework assignments of the course of the C Programming Language. Because there
have 16 homework assignments for the C Programming Language, thus, the total computer
programming time on homework is a sum of each computer programming time on homework.
The total computer programming time on homework of each student is listed in column
four of TABLE II. TUDENTS GRADES ANALYSIS METHOD ' IV. S Different students have
different final grades and ZCGTBII grades, because they have different efforts on the
course of the C Programming Language. Thus students' final grades and ZCGTBII grades
are considered random variables. The hypothesis tests that mentioned in section II
can be employed to analyze students' grades. Firstly the ChiSquare goodness-of-fit
test is employed to test if students' final grades and ZCGTBII grades are following
the normal distribution, which is expected to be. Then the Two-Sample Pooled T-Test
is used to test if students who spend more computer programming time on homework get
better scores than those of who spend less computer programming time on
homework.<component x="306.25" y="406.38" width="239.5" height="334.99" page="3"

instructors consider encouraging students to spend more programming time on the
course of C programming Language. It is supposed to get higher grades if you spend
more time to practice C programming. Does it true? The Two-Sample Pooled T-Test is
employed to test it. Based on teaching syllabus of the course of C Programming
Language revised in 2008, students are asked to spend no less than three class hours
to do each of their homework assignments. Thus the total computer programming time on
homework of a student is supposed to be no less than 48 class hours, which is 2160
minutes. However, some students spend much more than the suggested time on homework
assignments, and some students spend much less than the suggested time working on
their assignments. Using this time, students are divided into two groups. One is the
group of students whose total computer programming time on homework is greater than
or equal to this time, denoted as Group I. The other is the group of students whose
total computer programming time on homework is less than this time, denoted as Group
II. Based on this classification principle, there are 68 students in Group I and 16
students in Group II. Students' final grades and ZCGTBII grades are used to test if
the Group I receives higher grades than the Group II. 1) Comparing the passing rate
of two groups of students We define the passing rate of a group in an exam as number
of students who pass the exam divide by total number of students in that group. The
passing rates of final test and ZCGTBII of the two groups of students are shown in
TABLE iv. From TABLE iv, we know that the passing rates of final test and ZCGTBII of
Group I are greater than those of Group II by 18.75 and 19.54 percentage points,
respectively.<component x="306.25" y="340.99" width="239.5" height="400.38" page="4"

We use &#x3BC; &#x3BC; I II 2 2 and to denote the mean and the variances &#x3C3;

Hypothesis test on two groups of students' ZCGTBII grades Because two students did
not take the ZCGTBII, the total sample size is 82 students in this hypothesis test.
Using the same methodology as shown in last subsection, relevant statistics of two
groups of students' ZCGTBII grades are calculated in TABLE VI.<component x="52.5"

Based on students' computer programming time on homework and the minimum computer
programming time on homework that the C programming language syllabus prescribed for
a student to learn this course, students of a teaching class are divided into two
groups. Group I is the students whose total computer programming time on homework is
greater than or equal to the minimum computer programming time on homework. Group II
is the students whose total computer programming time on homework is less than the
minimum computer programming time on homework. Hypothesis tests are employed to
analyze the final grades and the ZCGTBII grades of the two groups of students.
Analysis results show that the mean of the final grades and the mean of ZCGTBII
grades of Group I are greater than those of Group II by 9.0 and 7.0 points,
respectively. Analysis results also show that the passing rates of final test and
ZCGTBII of Group I are greater than those of Group II by 18.75 and 19.54 percentage
points, respectively. Thus we can conclude that the time that a student practicing
programming on computers plays a very important role in their C Programming Language
learning. Therefore, in teaching process of the course of the C Programming Language,
In addition to normal classroom teaching, teachers/instructors should encourage
students to use computers to do an appropriate amount of homework.<component
