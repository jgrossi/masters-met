        <p>Duncan (1937) provided detailed information that has been widely used to date names of new taxa described in early volumes of the Proceedings. The examinations reported here suggest that at least at the point where the year of publication is important Duncan was usually correct, and although exceptions are reported they are not of great consequence (although 14 of 42 volumes are anomalous). These exceptions relate to cases where the published pages differed from a multiple of the signature size by a couple of pages or so. Over the 41 volumes examined, two or more techniques were used to provide, economically, text needed to complete an article that would have over-run the number of signatures planned for the issue. The importance of retaining wrappers and binding them in is demonstrated by what can be learned from them.</p>

      <p>INTRODUCTION
Nomenclature is a cornerstone of communication in
zoology. Today, the way in which names are used
is governed by the International Code of Zoological
Nomenclature (ICZN, 1999). In essence the Code
governing binomial nomenclature requires that the names
we attach to taxa must have four elements (a generic name,
a name in the ‘species-group’, one or more authors –
or describers – and the date of description). Special
importance is attached to the date due to the Principle
of Priority (Art. 23, ICZN, 1999). Only by using the
Article applicable to dating (Art. 21, ICZN, 1999) do we
determine between two names separately bestowed upon
the same taxon.</p>
      <p>The Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London
was, for much of the 19th century, the English language
journal of choice for the description of new animals.
Dating the name then given is not quite as simple as
we might like it to be. Researchers are well aware that
the volume year of the Proceedings of the Zoological
Society of London should not be cited lightly as the date
of publication. For years it was routine practice for the
papers read at meetings late one year to be published
next spring within the volume year based for the period
when the paper was read. There were also years when
publication fell behind schedule. From the calendar years
1831 to 1858 we do not know the dates of publication; the
records show when the printers delivered printed parts to
the Society but not when these were published (Duncan,
1937). From 1859 to 1900, and on through to 1926, the
dates of publication of the parts were brought together
and explained by Duncan (1937) and his dates are now
generally relied upon. Only the parts for 1859 and 1860
suffer from dating to a period of several months, rather to
a precise month. Duncan also set out the page limits to
the published parts, with some gaps for the 1872 and 1874
volumes, and these we also rely upon. Since then, Cowan
(1973) was able to provide some missing pagination data
for the 1872 and 1874 volumes. The work reported here
shows that Duncan’s information on the pagination of parts
is extremely accurate, but not faultless.</p>
      <p>Recently details were set out (Dickinson, 2004) that
confirmed from the 1887 volume that the Proceedings,
at times at least, appeared in two states. One as printed
when concluding an issue, and the second as reprinted as
part of the complete signature with which a new issue was
commenced.</p>
      <p>It has now been possible to examine the volumes and
wrappers for each year from 1859 to 1900 and further
information is here provided that should satisfy future
needs for precision in cases where two states of publication
seemed likely to have occurred at the end of the last issue
within a calendar year and the beginning of the final issue
in the same volume. Happily such cases are rare.</p>
      <p>No attempt has been made to deal with the
monthcritical cases where it may be necessary to decide on a
similar matter in the context of prior issues in a volume as
these are not date critical to the year. However, the cases
explained below, and the table naming a library where
wrappers will be found for that volume, will familiarize
readers with what to look for if they need to date
monthcritical cases more definitely and thus have to examine
earlier numbers in the volumes.</p>
      <p>The reader may assume that a volume between 1859 and
1900 that is not discussed below has a clean and obvious
break between the two issues that concern us and that is
wholly unambiguous and consistent with Duncan (1937).
It will be recalled that there were three issues a year from
1859 to 1873 and four issues a year from 1874 to 1900.
SIGNATURE NUMBERS
It was suggested that in the course of this work that
understanding the signature numbering system might be helpful.
At this period the pages of the Proceedings were octavo,
and the standard signature was therefore 16 pages. In
several cases explored below the signature numbers that were
apparent did not tally with what would be expected by
dividing by 16; this anomaly has not been explored further.</p>
      <p>The signature numbers were originally in Roman
numerals, but were changed to Arabic numerals following
a period when they appeared in both Roman and Arabic
numerals; here, to simplify, only Arabic numerals are
mentioned.</p>
      <p>The Proceedings is one of several journals of the period
in which one finds a repetition of the signature number two
pages later with an asterisk added; this is due to printers
wishing to be sure that the correct eight pages have been
printed on the reverse side of the sheet.
In Table 1 the years examined are listed with a simple
two-column guide to the page split between years as
given by Duncan. The location is given of a volume with
wrappers.</p>
      <p>In the early 1860s it was apparently the practice to
print extra pages to complete a paper, probably inserting
just a page or two, and to accept that these pages would
be reprinted so that each issue began with a complete
signature, but from 1865 to 1881 problems of this type did
not occur, or at least did not occur at the break between the
calendar years. From 1882 space was made available on
wrappers to absorb text overflow and it was not necessary
to use part of an extra signature.
Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be
between pages 336 and 337 and this is the first page of
signature 438 (this volume begins with signature number
417). The wrapper for issues 1 and 2 lists the closing article
as ‘On some hybrid ducks’ (p. 336). This article indeed
began on that page, but it runs to p. 338. It would seem
that pp. 337 and 338 were printed twice; in this instance
the two states may only be distinguished in cases where
the parts have been bound without excising the duplicate
page.</p>
      <p>Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be
between pages 208 and 209. The table of contents for issue

a Volumes comprised four parts (three intended within the calendar

b Duncan erred in citing a left-hand page as beginning the part; see
text for detailed corrections.
numbers started each time from 1) and therefore this is 1887
the second state of this page; this text was not found on
the wrapper and it is unclear how this page was provided
in its first state; it seems that a short signature must have
been used with all pages except for page 209 blank.</p>
      <p>Duncan (1937) suggested that the page break should be
between pages 336 and page 337; this is the first page
of signature 22. The article that fills page 336 continues
through to the top of page 339. It is apparent that page 339,
and very probably 337 and 338, were printed twice. The
content of the final part will have begun part way through
page 339.</p>
      <p>Duncan (1937) again suggested that the page break should
be between pages 336 and page 337, and page 337 is the
first page of signature 22, but the last article in the previous
issue finishes at the foot of page 338. Pages 337 and 338
again appear to have been printed twice; the wrappers do
not include text from these pages.</p>
      <p>Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be
between pages 590 and 591. It seems, oddly, that page 591
is the first page of signature 40; on it however one finds
the description by Sharpe of a new flycatcher Muscicapa
ussheri that was introduced on page 590. The wrappers
show that the use of extra paper stock for reprinting the
minimum amount of extra print on page 591 was avoided
by the expedient of completing this text on the inside back
of the wrapper itself, using 3/4 of the page. When printing
the fourth issue page 591 thus contains 3/4 of a page of
reprinted text and 1/4 of a page starts paper 12 from the
June meeting.
Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be
between pages 460 and 461, which purports to be the first
page of signature 31. The third issue of the year concludes
with a long article on the birds of Yucatan and this will be
seen to end on page 462. It seems clear that the content of
the final issue began on page 463 (which is the Secretary’s
Report on Additions to the Menagerie), as supported by
the wrapper for the final part. Pages 461 and 462 will thus
have been reprinted.</p>
      <p>Dickinson (2004) explained that pages 557 and 558 had
been printed twice, the second of them being completed
with the opening text of the final issue. Furthermore,
the problem was compounded because the article with
the description of the broadbill Calyptomena whiteheadi
appeared not just on the wrapper for Part III as stated, but
also on the wrapper for Part IV.
Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be
between pages 392 and 393; this is the first page of
signature 27. Part III, however, ends with an article by
Bates on the Coleoptera of Mount Kinabalu and this
article only finishes on page 393. In this instance the small
amount of extra text was first printed on the inside back
of the wrapper for Part III and then reprinted on good
paper when Part IV appeared. The description of the genus
Eusynthela might, to one not seeing the wrapper, seem to
have been half printed in 1889 and half in 1890.</p>
      <p>Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be
between pages 464 and 465, but page 463 appears to be
the first page of signature 32. The evidence in this case
shows that page 463 and the first seven lines on page 464
were reprinted and issued with Part IV.
Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be
between pages 598 and 599, which appears to be the
first page of signature 41 (although in its original state
no number appears on that page). In fact the text of
Part III ran on to page 599. The bound copy in the
Mammal Department at The Natural History Museum,
South Kensington has these two parts bound in, as does
one of two copies at The Natural History Museum, Tring.
This is the first of three cases where Duncan suggested
that a new part began with an even numbered page (594).
Inside the back of the wrapper for Part III the bulk (7/8ths)
of page 593 is printed with the last eighth of the page
blank. In its final state, at the start of the fourth issue,
page 593 appears as the first page of signature 40, and a
short horizontal line splits, or ‘uses’, the last eighth of the
page.</p>
      <p>Here Duncan suggested Part IV began with page 686. The
wrapper for Part III has no text printed inside the back.
It is apparent that pages 685 and 686 were reprinted and
that page 686 must have existed in two states, being only
two-thirds filled in its first state. A set at The Natural
History Museum, Tring shows both states. The header in
state one dates the page June 18, and in state two it is dated
November 19.</p>
      <p>This is the third instance where Duncan reported the final
Part beginning with an even page number (810). In this
case all page 809, the first page of signature 54, was first
printed inside the back cover of Part III.
Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be
between pages 584 and 585 (the first page of signature
40). The wrapper of Part III reveals that the top two-thirds
of page 585 was first printed inside its back.</p>
      <p>Acknowledgements
The information appended in Table 1 has been made
possible mainly through the help of the authorities at
The Natural History Museum (NHM), South Kensington
and Tring. Paula Jenkins was extremely helpful in
providing access to the Mammal Department set which
is particularly rich in bound-in wrappers. Gina Douglas
at the Linnean Society of London kindly made the 1881
volume available for inspection. Several earlier attempts
were made to locate this and the last remaining volume
and Linda Birch (Oxford) kindly made enquiries of the
Hope Librarian in the Entomology Department of Oxford
University but found wrappers to be lacking in these two
volumes as did Clair Castle at the Balfour and Newton
Library (Cambridge), June Harvey in the Entomology
Library at the NHM (South Kensington), Ronald de Ruiter
(Naturalis, Leiden) and Ante Strand (Stockholm). The
final and most elusive of the volumes to be traced was
found at the Central Science Library, Cambridge thanks
to Kees Rookmaaker; the library staff kindly made this
available. Finally special thanks are owed to Nigel Roche
at the Printing Library, St Brides, London, for guidance
regarding signatures, an understanding of which helped in
making sense of the evidence.</p>
