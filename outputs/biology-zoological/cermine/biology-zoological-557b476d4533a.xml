      <p>Comparative biogerontology evaluates cellular, molecular,
physiological, and genomic properties that distinguish short-lived
from long-lived species. These studies typically use maximum
reported lifespan (MRLS) as the index with which to compare
traits, but there is a general awareness that MRLS is not ideal
owing to statistical shortcomings that include bias resulting
from small sample sizes. Nevertheless, MRLS has enough
species-specific information to show strong associations with many
other species-specific traits, such as body mass, stress
resistance, and codon usage. The major goal of this study was to
see if we could identify surrogate measures with better
statistical properties than MRLS but that still capture inter-species
differences in extreme lifespan. Using zoological records of 181
bird and mammal species, we evaluated 16 univariate metrics
of aging and longevity, including nonparametric quantile-based
measures and parameters derived from demographic models of
aging, for three desirable statistical properties. We wished to
identify those measures that: (i) correlated well with MRLS
when the biasing effects of sample size were removed; (ii)
correlated weakly with population size; and (iii) were highly
robust to the effects of sampling error. Nonparametric
univariate descriptors of the distribution of lifespans clearly
outperformed the measures derived from demographic analyses.</p>
      <p>Mean adult lifespan and quantile-based measures, and in
particular the 90th quantile of longevity, performed particularly well,
demonstrating far less sensitivity to small sample size effects
than MRLS while preserving much of the information contained
in the maximum lifespan measure. These measures should take
the place of MRLS in comparative studies of lifespan.</p>
      <p>Key words: aging; biogerontology; captive; demography;
maximum lifespan; senescence.
Aging is a process that gradually impairs vigorous mature adults and
renlders them more susceptible to a wide range of diseases and disabilities,
lleading to a progressive increase in mortality risk. Maximum recorded
lifespan (MRLS) is the standard comparative metric used in experimental
and observational research into the causes of aging (Comfort, 1979;
Austad &amp; Fischer, 1991; Holmes &amp; Austad, 1995; Wilkinson &amp; South,
2002; Hulbert et al., 2007), and it is often taken as the key endpoint in
comparisons among species, genotypes, or groups exposed to different
environmental manipulations. Comparative biogerontologists have long
made use of MRLS as a surrogate for species-specific aging rates, and
much effort has gone into compiling tables of MRLS values for this
purpose (Finch, 1990; Carey &amp; Judge, 2000; de Magalhaes &amp; Costa, 2009).</p>
      <p>It is widely appreciated, however, that MRLS is a problematic indicator
for several reasons. First, MRLS is a downwardly biased indicator of
extreme lifespan. As sample sizes increase, expected MRLS values are
expected to increase as well. Second, the sample variance associated with
estimates of population MRLS may be high, especially with small sample
sizes. These two issues may present serious problems in comparative
studies involving rare nonlaboratory animals. Consequently, MRLS may
differ across species owing to differences in the number of species
records used to determine longevity as well as to inherent differences in
the physiology and ecology of the species. Third, MRLS does not use data
effectively in situations where records are incomplete, which is often the
case in many observational studies where the terminal recorded event for
an individual may not be death (i.e., right censoring). Lastly, it reflects
lifespan of a single individual per species, grossly underestimating the
characteristics of other members of the species. Given the concern that
some record-breaking lifespans may be exaggerated (Steven Austad,
personal communication), such extreme dependence on single outliers is
undesirable.</p>
      <p>Other metrics have been introduced in attempts to improve upon MRLS
by applying multivariate demographic models of aging, such as Gompertz
or Weibull functions, to survival data (Promislow, 1991; Wilson, 1994;
Ricklefs &amp; Scheuerlein, 2002). In some cases, these parameters have been
assigned controversial biological interpretations, as, for example, when
the slope of a Gompertz plot is interpreted as a measure of the rate at
which aging occurs (Finch et al., 1990; Pletcher et al., 2000; Bronikowski
et al., 2011), and the intercept of a Gompertz plot is interpreted as the
inherent frailty of the members of the population (Spencer &amp; Promislow,
2005; Maklakov et al., 2006; Flatt &amp; Kawecki, 2007). In other cases,
parameter estimates derived from these models are combined, for
example, by multiplication, to arrive at a univariate summary of aging rates
(Ricklefs, 1998; Ricklefs &amp; Scheuerlein, 2001). Nonparametric methods
have also been proposed that summarize the lifespan distribution of an
elite subset of the population into quantiles and ⁄ or means (Wang et al.,
2004; Gao et al., 2008). One significant advantage of these alternative
methods over MRLS is that their application is not limited to the empirical
distributions of complete lifespans; they can benefit from the use of the
Kaplan–Meier estimator, which allows the use of censored data. Each of
these estimators, and their combinations, has only an indirect relationship
to the underlying biological processes of aging, and it is unclear how well
these longevity metrics perform compared to MRLS as an index of
differences of the pace of age-related change among biologically interesting
populations.</p>
      <p>Questions about the evolution of different aging rates and the
cellular and molecular processes that can lead to striking differences in
longevity among related species are the central arena for comparative
biogerontology. Within orders of mammals, MRLS values among species
of rodents or primates can vary four- to eightfold. Many evaluations of
hypotheses about comparative aging among species have depended on
MRLS as the index of inter-species differences in aging rate, despite the
measure’s well-known defects. Our goal in this project was to make use
of population data, obtained from zoo populations of nearly 200 bird and
mammal species, to explore the sampling properties of various univariate
aging and longevity metrics. Some of these metrics have been proposed
by others, but some have not previously been applied to questions in the
comparative biology of aging. We wished to understand how well each
measure indicates extreme lifespan across a phylogenetically diverse
range of species that differ in life history and data quality. In addition, we
wanted to understand how robust each metric is to sampling effects,
namely sampling variance and bias arising from small population sizes.</p>
      <p>A major goal of this study was to understand the limitations of MRLS as a
comparative longevity metric and, if possible, identify an alternative
measure for MRLS that minimizes the sampling issues and data-use
restrictions associated with that measure.</p>
      <p>The datasets available to test hypotheses in the comparative biology of
aging differ in the proportion of missing values and in the extent of
erroneous data. The data often combine records from wild and captive
populations that differ in environmental factors (housing conditions, food
availability, reproductive histories, predation, infection levels, etc.) that
can have strong effects on mortality risks through both age-dependent
and age-independent pathways. Although tables of MRLS values across
species contain a good deal of information critical to testing ideas about
the biology of aging, there is a pressing need to develop improved
demographic endpoints for biogerontology.
Onset of aging
Although it is not clear whether the aging process begins at any defined
life history transition (birth, puberty, age at first reproduction), we assume
here that deaths at the earliest ages, for example perinatal deaths and
deaths of juveniles, are unlikely to be informative about inter-population
variances in aging rates. We therefore used two methods to determine
the age before which mortality should be ignored, and we report the
results derived from both methods. We analyzed the subset of individuals
from each species with events (deaths or last observations) that met or
exceeded one of two species-specific truncation ages: (i) T1, the age of
reproductive maturity for that species, or (ii) T2, the age at which the
mortality rate reaches a minimum (see Table S1 for species, relevant life
history information, and T estimates). Across the 163 species that had at
least 50 adults defined by both threshold definitions (T1 and T2), the
truncation ages correlated reasonably well (q = 0.53, P &lt; 0.0001,
Spearman’s rank correlation; see Fig. 1). Nearly two-thirds of the species with
both T1 and T2 estimates had an age at minimal mortality that exceeded
the age at reproductive onset (108 of 163 species). This pattern is
consistent with Promislow’s (1991) earlier analysis of a much smaller set of
species records in which he showed T1 &lt; T2 in 75% (18 of 24) of cases
where age at maturity and age at minimal mortality differed. More recent
life history analyses also show that the onset of aging tends to follow the
timing of reproductive maturity (Jones et al., 2008; Peron et al., 2010).</p>
      <p>The correlation between T1 and T2 estimates strengthened slightly when
the collection of species was reduced to include only the 125 species with
150 or more adults (q = 0.58, P &lt; 0.0001). While the positive correlation
was encouraging, it seemed prudent to analyze the sampling properties
of the various metrics using each T-definition independently. As we show

below, however, the choice of T-definition had little effect on the
sampling properties of the metrics.</p>
      <p>Metric estimates
Using both threshold definitions, we estimated 16 univariate longevity
values (defined in Table 1) for each of the 175 (T1) and 165 (T2) species,
respectively, that had at least 50 adult individuals (as defined by each
T-definition) with recorded events (Tables S2A and S2B). For a few cases
of the T1 treatment, the Weibull function failed to converge. This may
have resulted from too few adult deaths in the dataset (Ricklefs, 1998) or
from inclusion of part of the early age range typified by elevated mortality
(by definition, this would not be a problem using the T1 criterion).</p>
      <p>Correlations among metrics
We correlated estimates across species using both truncation methods
(Table 2) holding population size constant (a full correlation matrix, in
which sample size is not corrected for, is presented in Table S3). In
general, the nonparametric measures of lifespan were highly correlated
among each other (0.869 or better). Except for the mean (e0) and median
lifespan (Q50), the lowest partial correlations among nonparametric
estimators were between MRLS and Q90 (0.950 for T1 and 0.941 for T2). The
partial correlation between MRLS and Q95 was also 0.950 using the T1
criterion but higher (0.957) for T2. With the exception of the Weibull
intercept, WA, and X (a function of the slope and intercept of the Weibull
model), parametric measures of mortality correlated negatively with
MRLS and the other nonparametric measures of longevity. This is to be
expected, because these are aging parameters, and aging and longevity
are negatively associated. Of these, only the Gompertz and Weibull
intercepts (GA and WA) correlated reasonably well with MRLS ()0.789 and
)0.698 for GA and )0.928 and )0.938 for WA). Slopes and intercepts
were poorly correlated for both the Gompertz and Weibull models.
Independence between GA and GB estimates has been recently reported
across eight primate species (Bronikowski et al., 2011).</p>

      <p>Correlations between metrics and population sizes
We correlated metric estimates with population sizes (n) using both T1
and T2 criteria (Fig. 2). In most cases, metrics that were estimated using
T1 were less strongly associated with n than those estimated using T2. As
expected, we found positive correlations between n and MRLS (+0.105
and +0.162). Positive correlations increased with increasing x in MxLS
(the mean lifespan of the x longest-lived individuals), reaching +0.276
and +0.312 with M32LS. For these metrics, the T2 treatment yielded
slightly greater correlations than the T1 treatment. With the exception of
WA, parametric measures were very sensitive to the choice of T. The
Weibull and Gompertz slopes, as well as the Weibull omega measure, yielded
moderately negative correlations with n in the T2 treatment ()0.358,
)0.480, and )0.480, respectively). Using T1, however, these correlations
remained negative but markedly decreased in magnitude ()0.039,
)0.127, and )0.089). The Weibull and Gompertz intercepts were weakly
and positively correlated with population size, except for GA estimated
with T2, which was the highest correlation that we observed (+0.313).</p>
      <p>Table 2 Partial correlations using ISIS species data, holding sample size constant
Promislow et al. (1999) also report little association between Gompertz
parameters and population size in simulated populations using a defined
age of onset (similar to our T1 treatment). The more extreme
quantilebased measures (Q90, Q95, e90, and e95) showed the weakest associations
with sample size (correlations ranged between )0.037 and +0.018). The
measures of central tendency (Q50 and e0) correlated weakly and
negatively with n using T1 ()0.066 for both) and correlated more strongly with
T2 ()0.174 and )0.147). Correlations involving these measures, and
using either T1 or T2, most closely resembled those generated from the
extreme quantile-based measures.</p>
      <p>Rank persistence
We next asked how finite population size affected the ranking of lifespan
metrics across all study species. Every population (for our purposes, a
population was considered the worldwide collection of animals of the
same species, and we use species and population interchangeably) was
re-sampled ni times with replacement, where ni was each species’ sample
size, and each species was ranked in order of each longevity value
(resulting in 16 metric-specific ranking vectors). For example, a MRLS vector
may be ordered species A &gt; species B &gt; species C &gt; species D and a WA
vector may rank species B &gt; D &gt; A &gt; C. This procedure was repeated,
and each pair of metric-specific ranking vectors was analyzed for stability.</p>
      <p>Rank persistence, as inferred by a low Spearman’s footrule distance D
and a high Spearman’s ranked correlation coefficient q, quantified how
robust each measure was to sampling variation. We investigated four
population size treatments. The n ‡ 50 treatment included all species
populations with at least 50 observed adult deaths (nT1,50 = 175,
nT2,50 = 165). We performed three other rank persistence analyses using
the same re-sampling approach, except that we made the minimal
sample size requirement more stringent each time. We considered species
with n ‡ 150 (nT1,150 = 147, nT2,150 = 126), n ‡ 500 (nT1,500 = 66,
nT2,500 = 56), and n ‡ 1500 (nT1,1500 = 15, nT2,1500 = 13). Note that the
treatments differed only in the choice of which species to use; any species
chosen for a treatment had all of its individuals included in the analysis.</p>
      <p>Rank persistence averaged over 1000 re-sampled population pairs
is described in Table 3. For each treatment, robustness measure, and

between these measures is 0.991. Shaded cells indicate metric pairs where the absolute value of the partial correlation coefficient is at least 0.95.

      <p>In general, the nonparametric estimators outperformed the parametric
estimators in nearly every treatment. The sole exception was that the
Weibull intercept WA was a frequent top-five performer. The Gompertz
intercept GA performed well at the highest population size treatment
Table 3 Rank persistence analysis (fixed population size)
using the T2 definition. GB, WB, and X were always among the least
persistent metrics. Of the nonparametric estimators, the quantile-based
approaches demonstrated the most persistence. This was especially
evident in the metrics that described central tendency (e0 and, to a lesser
degree, Q50). More extreme values of longevity, Q90 and e90, also
performed very well across all treatments. The M32LS method performed
very well at low sample sizes but less so at the n ‡ 500 and n ‡ 1500
treatments.</p>
      <p>All of the metrics under consideration are subject to sample size bias.</p>
      <p>For this reason, we reasoned that the species rankings reflected both
inherent differences in the biology of species as well as variation in the
size of the pooled zoo animal population datasets provided by
International Species Information System (ISIS). We note that datasets available
for testing hypotheses about species differences in aging and longevity
are also likely to contain a preponderance of small populations, similar in
this way to the datasets available through ISIS. We attempted to remove
the latter source of variation from our rank persistence analysis by
randomizing sample size. As before, a rank persistence analysis was
performed using populations with adult numbers of at least 50, 150, 500,
and 1500 individuals. In this treatment, however, the re-sampling
procedure was changed. Instead of taking ni samples from each species i, the
number of samples was randomized; the exponential of some uniformly
distributed number of samples xi was drawn with replacement over the
interval ln(50) £ ln(xi) £ ln(ni) (this sets the range at between 50 and ni
with most samples near the low end of the range). As before, adults were
those individuals with terminal events (deaths or last observations)
defined by T1 or T2 and rank persistence was quantified by D and q. Mean
persistence values are shown in Table 4.
Graphs in Tables 3 and 4 correspond to the D-values for each metric specific to each treatment (lowest values are best). Within each graph, the values correspond in
order, from left to right, with the metrics defined in the first column on the table (e.g., starting with MRLS and ending with e95). Values are standardized in terms of
the largest D for the treatment. Open circles are values for MxLS metrics, open triangles are values for parametric longevity measures, and sold circles are
quantilebased measures. Bold-faced values are top-five performers, and the shaded boxes indicate bottom-five performers.</p>

      <p>Table 4 Rank persistence analysis (randomized population size)

      <p>The randomized treatments demonstrated weaker rank persistence.</p>
      <p>This is what we would expect if randomizing sample size eliminated that
component of the fixed species rank determined by population size. This
was consistent with our goal of removing sample size as predictor of
longevity. In general, the quantile-based nonparametric estimators appeared
to preserve rank best, although the Weibull intercept WA again showed
relatively high rank persistence. Interestingly, the relative advantage of
these nonparametric estimators over the alternatives appeared to be
greater with randomized population sizes. This finding suggests that
sample size variation has a greater effect on parametric measures of longevity
than on nonparametric measures. As before, WA and the more
intermediate quantile measures, Q50 and e0, performed best and Q90 and e90
performed next best. As a group, parametric methods continued to appear
to be the worst performers (excepting WA). At high sample sizes,
however, the Gompertz intercept GA performed relatively well, providing
species ranks that were roughly as persistent as the quantile-based
measures. The largest change in relative performance involved
nonparametric measures M16LS and M32LS; these were middling-to-good
performers with fixed populations sizes but very poor performers when
sample sizes are randomized. It appeared that for metrics MxLS,
increasing x made for better metrics when samples sizes were fixed but worse
metrics when sample sizes varied. This makes sense when we consider
that, in terms of population lifespan quantiles, MxLS has different
meanings as population size changes. Using unrealistically low population sizes
to illustrate this point, MRLS is Q95 in a population of 20 but equal to Q50
(the longevity median) in a population of two.</p>
      <p>Results were largely unaffected by our choice of T-definitions and
persistence metric (D or q). In no case did altering these choices change a
topfive performing metric (in terms of rank persistence) into a bottom-five
performer. Ranked correlations between D and q values were very high in
all population size treatments and using both T-definitions, with ranked
correlation coefficients among persistence measures ranging between
0.941 and 0.988 (Table 5, ‘fixed’ and ‘D and q’ headings; ‘fixed’ refers to
the condition of this treatment where population sizes are preserved and
not randomized, as in the following treatment). Likewise, persistence
values were highly correlated across T-definitions. Ranked correlations
ranged from 0.950 to 0.994 (Table 5, ‘fixed’ and ‘T1 and T2’ headings) in the
three treatments with lowest population sizes. In the highest population
size treatment, n ‡ 1500, the ranked correlations ranged somewhat
lower, 0.721 and 0.812.
A wide range of bird and mammal species have evolved that differ widely
in life histories, including variation in the rate at which aging leads to
increased risks of mortality owing to disease and infirmity. This rich set of
related species could, in principle, be used to generate and evaluate
hypotheses about the cellular and physiological factors that time the
aging process, factors that make it very unlikely that a particular mouse
will survive 5 years, a dog survive 20 years, and a human survive
110 years. Lifespan is a convenient, if flawed, surrogate for addressing
hypotheses about the biological basis for aging rates because many
factors besides age change can lead to death, and because aging leads to
many consequences in addition to changes in mortality risk. Ideally,
hypotheses about the distribution of aging rates and age-dependent
changes across species could be tested by a database in which multiple
age-sensitive traits had been tested in hundreds of individuals across a
wide range of diverse species. In practice, however, physiological data of
this kind are available only for a handful of species, and for most species
the only available data relevant to questions of comparative aging rate
are in the form of survival tables. The obvious problem is to determine the
best way to summarize these population-specific tables and provide a
Table 5 Sensitivity of metric performance to treatment and assessment changes
comparative metric that preserves relevant biological information relating
to lifespan while disregarding the effects of extraneous or confounding
factors, such as population size.</p>
      <p>Despite the widespread appreciation of its statistical association with
population size, the MRLS is favored by comparative biologists because it
is believed to measure an individuals’ intrinsic potential for long life. The
degree to which the other metrics measured this maximum, without
regard for the biasing effects of small sample size, is quantified by the
partial correlations between candidate metrics and MRLS, holding
population size constant. Population size bias is addressed more directly by the
total correlation between sample size and metric value. Ideally, the best
measures of extreme lifespan are those with the greatest magnitude of
partial correlations with MRLS and the least magnitude of the total
correlation between the measure and sample size. By these criteria, the best
are those that nonparametrically define some well-defined elite fraction
of the population: Q90, Q95, e90, and e95. Given that adult lifespans are
typically right-skewed, we expected that measures of central tendency
should be affected least by sample size. Instead, we found negative
correlations between these measures and n that were slightly stronger than
those obtained from Q90, Q95, e90, and e95. Good evidence has been
collected to suggest that animal size and lifespan are positively associated. If
zoos favor larger collections of smaller animals (a feasible expectation
given resource limitations), then these negative correlations between n
and mean and median lifespans may reflect true associations between
intrinsic aging and population size and not simply bias. Such associations
would cause effects that act in opposition to the effects of sample size
bias on MRLS estimates. Put differently, maximum recorded lifespan
would be more sensitive to n than reflected by our correlation estimate.</p>
      <p>We note, however, that regardless of whether we choose the ideal
correlation to be zero or slightly negative, Q90, Q95, e90, and e95 still appear to
best satisfy these criteria for best longevity metrics.</p>
      <p>Because MRLS observations depend upon the identification of single
individuals, it seemed reasonable to expect that estimates would suffer
from high sampling error. Indeed, our re-sampling analysis indicated that
MRLS had a larger sampling variance than the quantile-based measures
at all sample sizes. The difference intensified when species were
disassociated from population sizes, suggesting that small sample bias may
contribute to the sampling error for MRLS. Most parametric estimates
suffered from high sample variance. The quantile-based measures
produced the most reliable estimates, especially when population sizes were
allowed to vary. Excluding those that describe the central tendency, we
see that the least extreme measures Q90 and e90 are the least variable.</p>
      <p>The 90th quantile of adult lifespan, Q90, and the average of the top
10th percentile of adult lifespan, e90, appear to be the best alternatives to
using MRLS as a comparative metric for extreme lifespan. Both correlate
well with MRLS when sample size is corrected for, correlate weakly with
population size, and demonstrate relatively little sampling variance.
Furthermore, both can accommodate right-censored data. Neither measure
seems to have a clear advantage over the other based upon the sampling
characteristics analyzed here. However, one may prefer Q90 over e90 if
extreme lifespan exaggeration was considered to be a problem, because
Q90 is expected to be more robust to this effect than e90. We recommend
that future aging studies consider using the 90th quantile lifespan as a
comparative metric.</p>
      <p>The metrics that took the average of a set number of elite individuals
(MxLS) performed poorly as candidate metrics for extreme lifespan. Not
surprisingly, MxLS measures correlated extremely well with MRLS when
population size was held constant. However, the positive correlation
between the measure and population size increased for this family of
measures. Our rank persistence analysis illustrated problems inherent in
the use of MxLS as a comparative metric. When population sizes were
not randomized, MRLS and the closely related M4LS performed well, as
indicated by high rank persistence to re-sampling. Similar methods that
correlate well to MRLS (M16LS and M32LS) also performed well under
these conditions. However, when population sizes were randomized to
decouple the effects of biology and animal collection size, these
performed very poorly compared to other measures. The reason for this is
evident if we recognize that MxLS is the mean of the top 1 ) (n ) x) ⁄ n
percentile of the population. Because the threshold for inclusion is
sensitive to population size, variation in population size varies the lifespans of
the individuals included in the measure.</p>
      <p>Judged as univariate descriptors of longevity, measures based upon
parameterized demographic models performed poorly as a group, with
the exception of the Weibull intercepts, WA. Estimates of these metrics
seemed to be more sensitive to our choice of method for delineating
the aging and nonaging segments of each species life history. These
metrics correlated poorly with MRLS, holding population size constant.</p>
      <p>With respect to the Weibull-based omega values, our results (using T1
as our definition of adulthood, the partial correlation was )0.238 and
the total correlation was )0.464) contrast sharply with a full correlation
between and MRLS of )0.83 across 150 captive vertebrate species
recently reported by Ricklefs (2010b). At least two reasons may account
for this discrepancy. First, our analytical methods differ: Ricklefs uses
least-squares regression to fit a three-parameter Weibull model to
death records at all ages (we use maximum likelihood to fit a
twoparameter model to adult events) and he does not consider
right-censored observations (we do). Second, the numbers of animal records per
species tend to be far greater in our study. If small sample sizes
upwardly bias estimates of omega (this is speculation on our part), then
the variance in sample size across species (such as both studies find) will
generate excess negative correlations between omega and MRLS. The
results from the rank persistence analyses suggested that the
demographic parameters, especially those that describe the slopes of
mortality functions, are subject to high sampling variance. The Weibull
intercept, however, demonstrated high partial correlations with MRLS
and low sampling variances. Our only reason for not recommending</p>
      <p>this measure is that it correlated more strongly with population size,
which suggests that it is a more biased measure than some of the
nonparametric alternatives.</p>
      <p>While much attention in comparative biogerontology focuses on
measures of extreme lifespan, investigators might consider using measures of
central tendencies instead. There are at several reasons for doing so. First,
as we show here, mean adult lifespan exhibits the least amount of
sampling variance. It is the most repeatable measure that we investigated.
Second, compared to MRLS, there is far less association between population
size and metric estimates. As we have argued, there is reason to believe
that mean lifespan should be the measure that is least biased by small
sample size. Third, mean lifespan is highly correlated with MRLS (correcting for
population size), with a partial correlation coefficient of between 0.91 and
0.93. Other measures, such as Q90, may perform better in this respect, but
it appears that a great deal of the biological information that is
parameterized by maximum lifespan is also expressed by the mean lifespan of those
animals that live at least as long as the ages measured by T1 and T2. Last,
the most familiar definitions and predictions of the evolutionary change of
phenotypes from one generation to the next are expressed as changes in
the means (Robertson, 1966; Price, 1970, 1972; Lande &amp; Arnold, 1983).</p>
      <p>In evolutionary biology, it is changes in the means, and occasionally the
variances, of phenotypes that are nearly always the subject of study. We
note, though, that the means and medians used for our calculations are
for samples that exclude perinatal and a high proportion of juvenile
mortality, and cannot be used to evaluate issues related to life expectancy at
birth or proportions of offspring surviving to reproductive age.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the choice of whether to compare means or extremes may
depend upon the nature of the comparative question that is under study.</p>
      <p>We recommend, however, that this decision is made explicit and justified
by each study. Comparative biogerontologists have prepared extensive
compilations of MRLS data, and for many meta-analyses MRLS may,
unfortunately, be the only available measure currently available.
Compilation of similar lists of Q90 values and mean lifespans of animals surviving
at least to T1 or T2 would be a worthwhile project for field biologists and
zoo consortia to tackle as a service to aging research, and we recommend
that such statistics be routinely included in reports about lifespan and
aging in wild, captive, and experimental populations. In this respect, our
study makes an important contribution by providing these estimates for
nearly 200 bird and mammal species.</p>
      <p>Experimental procedures
Obtaining animal records
We obtained records for 200 species of captive-born birds and
mammals from the ISIS, an international nonprofit membership
organization of zoos and aquariums. ISIS maintains an extensive database
derived from over 800 zoological institutions in 77 countries,
including life history information on over 2.4 million individual animals, of
which over 1.5 million have exactly recorded birthdates. International
Species Information System data have contributed to previous studies
of demographic parameters related to lifespan evolution (Ricklefs,
2000, 2010a,b), in which the absence of predation in zoological
settings was believed to be an advantage in determining intrinsic
mortality rates. Because information in the ISIS database differs greatly
among species in the number of individuals, the degree of right
censoring, the extent of missing data, and the pooling of information
from zoos of varying size and environmental characteristics, these
data provide an excellent opportunity to compare statistical estimates
of extreme longevity in a realistic context.</p>
      <p>Animal records included sex, birth dates, and death dates (or last
recorded observations). Animals with unknown or estimated birth dates
were removed from the analysis. We also removed all animals with
lifespans that exceeded 120% of the maximum recorded lifespan as
reported by AnAge (de Magalhaes &amp; Costa, 2009). We chose this value
to allow for the possibility that the ISIS records included valid ages of
animals that exceeded the AnAge values (many record-breaking individuals
were identified), but we did not want to include records of animals that
were suspiciously old. We used two methods (explained below) to
determine the initial age of our analysis of aging (T) for each species. Most
(181 species) had 50 or more individuals (n ‡ 50) with ages at death that
exceeded T values determined by one or both methods. These species
(Table S1) were chosen for further analysis.
Populations from the ISIS datasets exhibited U-shaped mortality
functions of age. The close monitoring of individual animals in the
zoological setting, especially starting with birth or hatch, generates data on
early mortality. As we were only interested in the distribution of
lifespans that are associated with senescence, we discarded deaths that
occurred before the onset of aging (T). This age was determined in
two different ways: First, we ignored all deaths that occurred before
the age of first reproduction as determined by the literature (see
Table S1). When sex-specific ages of first reproduction were available
and different, we took the greater of the two ages to be the
truncation age (T1) for both sexes.</p>
      <p>The second method found the age at which mortality was minimized
(T2). For each reduced population, we used a simple iterative routine to
find T2:</p>
      <sec id="1-1">
        <title>1 We calculated LX values using the ‘Survival’ package in R 2.11.0</title>
        <p>(R Development Core Team 2011; Therneau &amp; Lumley, 2011). Individuals
with known death dates (complete) and dates of last observation
(rightcensored) were used. We binned the population into groups of similar
lifespans, defined by regular age intervals. The bin number is defined by
the ‘Sturges’ algorithm (Sturges, 1926), where the number of classes is a
function of sample size, N ¼ 1 þ log2ðnÞ. This function is commonly used
to construct histograms. Cumulative survival rates were converted to
mortality rates.</p>

        <p>value (Table S1).</p>
        <p>Estimating metrics
We estimated longevity using the post-T (aging) populations. Longevity
metrics were of two types. Nonparametric estimates were functions of
longevity quantiles, based upon survival curves generated from the
survival analysis described above. Parametric estimates derived from
functions of Gompertz or Weibull parameters fit to each aging population.
Model fitting was accomplished using the ‘Survomatic’ package in
R 2.11.0 (Bokov &amp; Gelfond, 2010; R Development Core Team 2011).
Metrics are described in detail in Table 1, and estimates are presented
in Table S2 (Supporting information).
Rank persistence
We were interested in discriminating between populations represented
by their longest-lived individuals. One way to evaluate the merits of
candidate metrics is to perform rank persistence analyses of re-sampled
species-specific populations. We began with a collection of P species, each of
size Np. We re-sampled each species twice with replacement, taking Np
draws from each population p. For each metric m, there was a ranking
sequence specific to each sample set. For example, the MRLS rankings for
five sample species (p = 1–5) may have been</p>
        <p>R1ðm ¼ MRLSÞ ¼ f1; 2; 3; 4; 5g</p>
        <p>R2ðm ¼ MRLSÞ ¼ f1; 3; 4; 2; 5g:
In this case, species 1 always has the longest-lived individual and species 5
always has the lowest maximum aged individual. Species 2, 3, and 4
exchange rank. Using the same re-sampled data, a metric other than
MRLS might return rankings that are more persistent:</p>
        <p>R1ðm ¼ XÞ ¼ f1; 3; 2; 4; 5g</p>
        <p>R2ðm ¼ XÞ ¼ f1; 2; 3; 4; 5g:
We can quantify rank persistence using two slightly different
measures. The first measure is Spearman’s footrule distance:
Dij ¼ Pkn¼1 xik xjk , where i and j are R1 and R2, x is the rank, and
k is the population. For the examples above, DR1R2ðMRLSÞ ¼ 4 and
DR1R2 (X) = 2. Persistence increases with decreased D (low values are
superior to high values). The second measure is rij, the rank correlation
across the samples, which increases with rank persistence (high values
are superior to low values). In our example, rR1R2ðMRLSÞ ¼ þ0:7 and
rR1R2ðXÞ ¼ þ0:9. Note that the measures are very similar; the only
fundamental difference between the two measures is that r weights
changes in rank by the square of the change and D scales the changes
linearly. By both measures, the rankings derived using metric X would
seem to more robust to changes in the populations resulting from
resampling. In terms of rank persistence alone, we would conclude that
X is a superior longevity metric to MRLS.</p>
