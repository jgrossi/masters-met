        <p>In response to work demonstrating a negative correlation between human staff activity and parturition in laboratory-managed primates, this study examined the distribution of 231 captive chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) births that occurred in accredited American zoological institutions by the day of the week on which the birth was discovered. We hypothesized that if chimpanzee parturition patterns displayed sensitivity to human presence, then fewer births per day would be reported during the weekend period, when the visitor density was high, as compared with the lower density working week. Analyses indicated that chimpanzee births were randomly distributed throughout the week. In the context of the questionable sensitivity of primate parturition to external influence, results suggest that variations in human presence do not affect the fine-level timing of birth in chimpanzees managed in a zoological setting.

      <p>At the moment of birth, maternal and infant
fitness is affected by a range of ecological variables:
predation, availability and quality of food resources,
social and environmental factors, and the energetic
cost of delivery [Bicca-Marques &amp; Gomes, 2005; De
Lathouwers &amp; Van Elsacker, 2005; Whittle et al.,
2001]. Sensitivity to these factors has shaped
patterns of parturition in which birth is
synchronized with periods of (1) high food availability and (2)
low conspecific and predator activity levels [Alford
et al., 1992; Bicca-Marques &amp; Gomes, 2005; Chism
et al., 1978; McGrew &amp; McLuckie, 1984; Schino
&amp; Troisi, 2005].</p>
      <p>These shaping forces are substantially altered in
captivity: food resources are consistently available,
predation threats are eliminated, and other
environmental factors are stabilized [De Lathouwers &amp; Van
Elsacker, 2005; Hosey, 2005]; however, some
speciestypical patterns of birth timing persist across captive
context, including the tendency for diurnal and
nocturnal primates to give birth during the night
and day, respectively [Bicca-Marques &amp; Gomes,
2005]. In examining this consistency, investigators
have questioned whether a unique factor in captivity
—presence of and interactions with humans—affects
the timing of the birthing process on a secondary,
fine-grained level, beyond these circadian-related
rhythms [Cook et al., 2003; McGrew &amp; McLuckie,
1984]. In support of this potential influence, human
activity has been associated with a range of
behavioral and physiological effects on captive primates
[Davis et al., 2005; Hosey, 2000, 2005; Lambeth et al.,
1997; Mitchell et al., 1992; Wells, 2005]. Many of
these reports link human presence to an increase in
arousal, as indicated by increased levels of activity
[Chamove et al., 1988; Mitchell et al., 1992; Wells,
2005] and agonism, often with an accompanying
decrease in conspecific affiliation [Chamove et al.,
1988; Wells, 2005] and an increase in cortisol levels
[Davis et al., 2005].</p>
      <p>To assess whether these apparent effects extend
to parturition, McGrew and McLuckie [1984] and
Alford et al. [1992] examined the distribution of
captive primate births over the course of the week,
postulating that primates respond to
human-associated stimuli in captivity by suppressing
components of the parturition process to effectively delay
birth. Consistent with this hypothesis, in two
laboratory populations of callitrichidae (common
marmosets, Callithrix j. jacchus and cotton top tamarins,
Saguinus o. oedipus), McGrew and McLuckie found a
greater occurrence of births during the period of low
human activity on the weekend (Friday–Sunday)
compared with the working week
(Monday–Thursday). However, this ‘‘weekend effect’’ diminished
among larger, similarly managed populations of the
same species, suggesting that the birth distribution
may have been skewed by the low number of births
examined. Alford et al. followed with an analysis of
birth timing among a cross-institution population of
laboratory chimpanzees. In three of the five
populations exposed to a large differential in weekly staff
activity, significantly more births occurred during
the low-activity weekend (Sunday–Monday) as
compared with the week (Tuesday–Saturday). The
fewest births occurred in the late week, which the
authors suggested is associated with an
accumulation of arousal over consecutive days of exposure to
human presence. Although Alford et al. interpreted
these findings as indicative of a captive-based,
species-wide phenomenon, several management or
site-related factors may have exerted wide-ranging
effects on the timing of birth events. For instance,
the reported separation of some of the pregnant
subjects from the social group may have changed
ambient arousal levels and the nature of interaction
with human staff that in turn affected perinatal
physiology.</p>
      <p>Alford et al. [1992] advocated a similar analysis
on birth patterns in the zoological environment,
where visitor presence provides the critical weekly
variation in human exposure. This study addresses
this question by assessing the distribution of 20
years of recorded chimpanzee births occurring in
zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and
Aquariums (AZA). Contrary to the weekly cycles of
staff presence in the previous laboratory settings,
management activity in the zoological context
remains relatively consistent throughout the week,
whereas visitor density demonstrates a predictable
increase during the weekend period. If chimpanzee
parturition exhibited sensitivity to human activity,
then fewer births per day were expected during the
weekend, as compared with the weekday period;
conversely, the null hypothesis predicted a random
distribution of births across days of the week. These
findings have the potential to further describe the
effect of human visitors on captive primates, inform
captive management protocols, and hold implications
for conservation breeding programs that seek to
optimize conditions under which successful births
may occur.</p>

      <title>METHODS Subjects</title>
      <p>Distribution of births was assessed among the
238 captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) born in
the 27 accredited American zoological institutions
between 1985 and 2005 by using data from the 2006
North American Regional Studbook [Ross, 2006]. For
each subject, studbook number and the date of
discovery of birth (designated in the studbook as
date of birth) were recorded. Twin (five sets) and
triplet (one set) births were treated as single events,
bringing the total number of births to 231. Subjects
were maintained in a variety of social and caretaking
contexts, but all institutions met the husbandry
standards of the AZA as assessed in the accreditation
process. This standardized accreditation process
permits the assumption of comparable management
settings and a consistent relationship between the
day of birth and the day of its discovery in each
subject institution.</p>
      <p>Records were sorted according to day of week
within each of the 27 institutions of birth. To assess
day-related clustering in the distribution of births,
the week was divided into weekday and weekend
periods. The weekend was defined as the period
lasting from Saturday to Sunday, in accordance with
increases in visitor levels. Weekday and weekend-day
blocks were compared using the goodness-of-fit log
likelihood test statistic (G).</p>
      <p>Each of the 27 focal institutions recorded
between 1 and 47 birth events. To assess
population-wide trends, records were combined across
institution regardless of differences in the size of
each institutional sample. In this pooled set, births in
the population were recorded on every day of the
week and in every month of the year. Table I lists the
number and frequency of births encompassed by the
day groups as well as the G-value indicating the
degree of similarity between the complementary
groupings.
Saturday–Sunday
Monday–Friday</p>
      <p>In the day-group comparison (weekend vs.
weekday), the number of births recorded as
occurring during the weekend period was not
significantly different from that expected in a random
distribution.</p>
      <p>To address potential variation in patterns of
visitor activity, birth numbers were also compared
within weekend/weekday-blocks and institution.
Analyses again indicated a random distribution of
births across the week and between weekday and
weekend blocks in the 11 zoos reporting seven or
more births.</p>
      <p>The random distribution of births across days of
the week indicates that the timing of chimpanzee
parturition in zoological parks seems not to be
affected by changes in visitor activity levels. It is
possible that the contrast with the Alford et al.
[1992] and McGrew and McLuckie [1984] findings
may result from a complex of institution- and
species-typical characteristics [Alford et al., 1992;
Bicca-Marques &amp; Gomes, 2005; Hosey, 2005;
McGrew &amp; McLuckie, 1984]. In the zoological
setting, the behavioral and physiological effects of
human exposure may be less pronounced than in a
laboratory setting as a result of the lower differential
in presence (with weekend visitor access) and the
inclusion of secluded areas (with naturalistic
elements and enrichment structures) from which
humans (and conspecifics) are visually occluded [Hosey,
2000, 2005]. These factors may have also served to
confound a clear relationship in the current data set,
given the large time range of birth events and
corresponding changes in zoological management
[Davis et al., 2005; Hosey, 2005; Wells, 2005]. The
absence of significant differences in birth
distributions within institutions tempers this argument, but
future analyses may include exhibit type
(naturalistic vs. laboratory) and days of public access as
additional variables.</p>
      <p>In concert with these habitat-based factors, a
high species-typical ‘‘nervousness’’ [Alford et al.,
1992; McGrew &amp; McLuckie, 1984] (i.e. disposition to
arousal) may enhance reactivity to visitor presence.
Such species may exhibit the most robust
birthtiming sensitivities [Chamove et al., 1988; Hosey,
2000], a possibility suggested by McGrew and
McLuckie [1984] in describing observed interspecies
differences in birth distribution among the
callitrichidae and a stump-tailed macaque (Macaca
arctoides) population and supported in the current
chimpanzee results. In this analysis, species-specific
social and cognitive traits may differentiate
chimpanzees from callitrichidae in the nature of the
reaction to human presence [Wells, 2005] to suppress
a significant response—perhaps involving
parturition—in the former species. An examination of birth
cycles in other, zoologically housed species is needed
before the influence of setting and species traits in
the two tamarin and marmoset species and
chimpanzee populations studied can be fully addressed.</p>
      <p>We also considered that an interaction between
human-associated arousal and parturition might be
expressed in terms of infant viability [Debyser, 1995;
Newell-Morris et al., 1989]. Using the same data set,
which included recorded dates of death, we assessed
the association between length of infant survival and
the day of week on which the individual was born
(weekday vs. weekend). Supporting the general
analysis, there was no relationship between the day
of birth and survivability; in each survival category
examined (1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3
months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years) infants that
survived were no more likely to be born on a
weekday (or weekend) than those that did not
survive to reach those specific benchmarks.</p>
      <p>In sum, the observed random distribution of
captive chimpanzee births, supported by the absence
of a link between day of birth and survival, is
consistent with previous work demonstrating a
finegrained control of birth timing by intrinsic factors
including circadian rhythms [Cook et al., 2003;
Reppert, 1988; Whittle et al., 2001], rather than by
recurring captive-based stimuli such as levels of
human activity. The relationship between human
presence and parturition reported in other studies
may be more likely to stem from interactions of
facility- and species-specific characteristics, as those
authors have suggested. However, though other
dimensions of the reproductive process (e.g. mating
and development) may be affected by specific
components of the external environment, the
current results suggest that the temporal patterns of
chimpanzee parturition events do not seem to be
directly associated with a single factor unique to the
typical zoological environment, including one as
salient as visitor activity.</p>
