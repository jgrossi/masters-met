        <p>Previous research found that a sun safety program for visitors at 1 zoo increased sun safety behaviors. This randomized study compared the effects of tailored dissemination materials plus 2 brief follow-up phone calls (tailored group) versus generic materials (basic group) on implementation by other zoos of the previously evaluated sun safety program. Education directors of 126 zoos completed surveys several months following initial dissemination and 1 year later. During Summer 1, 40% of tailored group zoos and 24% of basic group zoos offered visitors at least 1 sun safety activity (odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.0 - 4.8). During Summer 2, these rates were 34% and 44%, respectively (ns). The pattern of findings suggests that tailoring had no incremental long-term impact and that the generic materials produced a good level of dissemination.</p>

      <p>Skin cancer rates are increasing throughout the United States. In
2003, more than 1 million people were diagnosed with
nonmelanoma skin cancers and 54,000 with melanoma (American Cancer
Society, 2003). Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure is a key skin
cancer risk factor (Elwood, 1993; Friedman, Rigel, Berson, &amp;
Rivers, 1991; Marks, 1995; Singletary &amp; Balch, 1991), and
outdoor recreational settings such as zoological parks, where
numerous visitors typically are exposed to long bouts of solar UVR, are
high-risk environments. In the United States, zoos alone are visited
by more than 100 million people annually (American Zoo and
Aquarium Association, 2003). In 1998, we surveyed U.S. zoos
accredited by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA)
to evaluate their current sun safety practices for visitors (Talosig et
al., 2000). Results indicated that although only 5% of the zoos
offered any sun safety-related advice or activities to visitors, the
majority indicated they would be interested in providing sun safety
activities in the future. The current study compared two strategies
for disseminating sun safety activities to U.S. zoos.</p>
      <p>Much of the current thinking about dissemination began with
the work of Everett Rogers and his colleagues; this framework
provided general guidance for developing our dissemination
strategies. According to Rogers (1983, 1995; Rogers &amp; Shoemaker,
1971), technological and behavioral innovations are often
experimented with and adopted by certain individuals in a community
who are seen by “late adopters” as trendsetters. The process of
diffusion of innovations includes knowledge acquisition,
persuasion, decision, and reinforcement (Rogers, 1983). Once success is
achieved with a smaller group of early adopters, dissemination to
other organizations, communities, and regions should prove much
easier. The change agent should aim for a critical mass of
individuals to adopt a single or limited number of changes in order to
make a large-scale impact.</p>
      <p>Initially, diffusion theory emphasized how workers adopted
innovations (Rogers, 1983). Subsequently, researchers
acknowledged that individuals often adopt innovations as members of
organizations and that such individuals seldom adopt an
innovation until it is first accepted by the organization (Steckler,
Goodman, &amp; Kegler, 2002). Diffusion within and dissemination
between organizations is a complex process, requiring consideration
of multiple factors, such as the organization’s goals, authority
structure, decision-making mechanisms, rules, regulations, and
informal norms. Diffusion may depend on involving multiple
entities, such as an organization’s administrators, staff, and
clientele (Parcel, Perry, &amp; Taylor, 1990).</p>
      <p>To date, only a few studies have been published describing
controlled evaluations of dissemination strategies for health
promotion programs (Oldenburg, Sallis, Ffrench, &amp; Owen, 1999).
Brink et al. (1995) used a quasi-experimental two-group design to
evaluate the dissemination of a tobacco prevention program to
Texas school districts. The dissemination strategies were based on
Rogers’s (1983) diffusion of innovation model and Bandura’s
(1986) social– cognitive theory. Opinion leaders were asked to
introduce the program to their school district using videotapes and
print materials. Intervention school districts and control districts
(which received no information on the tobacco prevention
program) did not differ on readiness to adopt a tobacco prevention
program.</p>
      <p>Similar to the present study, three other studies have compared
less intensive with more intensive dissemination strategies. Cooke,
Mattick, and Campbell (1999) disseminated a smoking cessation
program to antenatal clinics. They compared a mailing only with
a mailing plus personal contact from a program representative.
Although the sample was too small for statistical analysis (N
23), clinics in the intensive dissemination group had adopted or
were planning to adopt more of the program components than
those in the simple dissemination group. Lock and Kaner (2000)
compared mailing, telemarketing, and personal marketing
strategies to disseminate a brief alcohol intervention to general
practitioners (N 614). Personal marketing (in-person contacts) were
the most effective, but telemarketing was the most cost effective.
Schofield, Edwards, and Pearce (1997) compared two strategies
for disseminating a sun-protection policy kit to primary and
secondary schools (N 781). They compared a mailed kit alone and
a mailed kit plus staff development module strategy. Statistically
significant between-groups differences were found among primary
schools: 44% of schools that received the intensive dissemination
strategy adopted the sun-protection policies as compared with 21%
of schools in the mailing-only group. In sum, although the number
of studies is small, the available evidence suggests that relatively
more (vs. less) intensive dissemination strategies are more likely to
increase adoption of a health promotion program by the recipient
organization. In the current study, the more intensive strategy that
was evaluated was based on tailoring.</p>
      <p>Health promotion specialists increasingly have used
interventions tailored specifically for individuals using information
provided by the individual or from existing records. These tailored
interventions typically consist of brochures, newsletters, and/or
telephone counseling sessions. In a review of the literature
regarding tailored interventions, C. S. Skinner, Campbell, Rimer, Curry,
and Prochaska (1999) concluded that tailored materials and
interventions were superior to nontailored materials and interventions
in the majority of studies. The tailored materials were both more
salient (read, remembered, and viewed as credible) and more
effective in promoting behavior change. In recent years, tailored
materials have been used in studies focusing on a variety of
behaviors, such as mammography screening (Champion et al.,
2002; Lipkus, Rimer, Halabi, &amp; Strigo, 2000), physical activity
(Bull, Kreuter, &amp; Scharff, 1999; Clark et al., 2002), and smoking
cessation (Lipkus, Lyna, &amp; Rimer, 1999). In all of these studies the
recipient was an individual person. The present study is novel with
respect to tailoring materials to address the unique characteristics
of individual organizations rather than individual persons.</p>
      <p>Our research group developed the Sunwise Stampede project to
reduce UVR exposure by zoo visitors and employees. In Phase 1,
we developed an intervention package geared toward children and
their parents that aimed to reduce zoo visitors’ solar UVR risk
during the zoo visit. We also developed an intervention component
for zoo employees (although it was not systematically evaluated,
owing to limited resources). In 1999 we evaluated the zoo visitor
intervention package at the World-Famous San Diego Zoo and the
San Diego Wild Animal Park in a winter study and then replicated
it in the summer. The two sites served as intervention and control
sites, respectively. Intervention components, which were based on
operant learning principles (B. F. Skinner, 1953), social– cognitive
theory (Bandura, 1986), and an ecological framework (Sallis &amp;
Owen, 2002), included sun safety tip sheets for parents, children’s
activities, a variety of prompts, and discounted hats and sunscreen
in zoo gift shops. The majority of the content used animal
adaptations to illustrate desirable sun safety behaviors, such as
elephants dusting their skin with dirt to prevent sunburn. Results,
reported in an earlier article (Mayer et al., 2001), indicated that the
intervention site showed significantly larger increases in the sales
of both hats (summer study only) and sunscreen (both studies)
relative to the control site, and in the winter study, hat use by
children (as they exited the zoo) was significantly higher at the
intervention site.</p>
      <p>This article describes Phase 2 of the project, whose goal was to
encourage other zoos throughout the United States to implement at
least one strategy from the Sunwise Stampede menu. We packaged
the materials evaluated in Phase 1 (Mayer et al., 2001) and
compared two dissemination strategies: basic versus tailored. Zoos in
the basic group received a binder of generic materials, and zoos in
the tailored group received a tailored binder and brief telephone
calls from project staff. We hypothesized that zoos receiving the
tailored package would be more likely to adopt the Sunwise
Stampede program than those that received generic materials.</p>
      <p>As noted, our primary objective in the dissemination phase was to
encourage zoos to adopt at least one sun safety strategy for zoo visitors and
at least one for zoo employees. Inclusion criteria for this study were that a
zoo (a) was accredited by the AZA and (b) had completed our baseline
survey in 1998. Because the AZA was collaborating with us in recruiting
zoos and disseminating our program and would have credibility with zoos,
the first criterion was viewed as important. The second criterion was used
to ensure that we would be able to obtain outcome data for the zoos; four
zoos (3%) had not responded in the 1998 baseline survey after repeated
attempts.</p>
      <p>The 126 zoos meeting the inclusion criteria were stratified on two factors
and randomly assigned to one of two dissemination groups: basic and
tailored, with 63 zoos in each. The stratification factors were the estimated
number of visitors per year, dichotomized (500,000 or less vs. over
500,000) and region of country (i.e., Northeast, Southeast, Plains, Midwest,
Central Pacific, Southwest, and Northwest).</p>
      <p>In the spring of 2000, each of the 126 zoos was mailed an introductory
letter and a binder consisting of project-related materials. The package
typically was addressed to the zoo’s education director. The basic group
materials (a) explained the Sunwise Stampede goals and strategies, (b)
described the features and benefits of participating, (c) summarized data
from San Diego Zoo’s experience with the program, (d) provided
information about each element or strategy of the program, and (e) provided our
contact information (should the recipient have questions or comments). We
also provided samples and masters related to the intervention strategies,
including, for example, camera-ready copies of sunscreen application
reminders for restrooms, camera-ready point-of-purchase signs for gift
shops, and a script for an employee sun safety in-service presentation.</p>
      <p>Zoos in the tailored group received content similar to that described
above, with the following modifications: (a) UVR and skin cancer data
were provided for the state; (b) existing sun protective features of the zoo
were highlighted (e.g., shade trees or other shade structures); (c)
descriptions for each element of the program were tailored according to an
individual zoo’s resources (e.g., animal adaptations for only the animals in
that zoo were provided); (d) irrelevant information was deleted (e.g., if a
zoo did not have a gift shop, the gift shop incentive element was not
described); and (e) photographs of various locations in the zoo were
included to demonstrate implementation opportunities by digitally
superimposing an animal adaptation fact over one of the animal exhibits. Prior
to creating the materials, project staff had visited each of the zoos in the
tailored group to evaluate relevant aspects of their environments and obtain
digital photographs. The information obtained during the site visits enabled
us to tailor the materials appropriately. Additionally, the Sunwise
Stampede representative who had site visited a particular zoo phoned the
education director twice— once approximately 10 working days after the
binder was mailed and again around the middle of the first summer. Each
call lasted 5 min or less. The objectives of the calls were to inquire whether
the education directors had reviewed the materials, offer advice or
recommendations (as needed) regarding which activities may be the most feasible
for their zoo, and praise any plans they had made to offer activities.</p>
      <p>Zoos in both groups were informed via the binder and an e-mail message
about two Sunwise Stampede Web sites. The zoo staff site contained
content similar to the basic group’s binder content and had downloadable
materials (http://www.foundation.sdsu.edu/sunwisestaff). The zoo visitor
site targeted zoo visitors irrespective of their geographic location and
presented tips for a sunwise visit and sunwise activities, animal facts, and
a Web game (http://www.foundation.sdsu.edu/sunwisestampede).</p>
      <p>Following the short-term survey, which was conducted several months
after the distribution of the initial materials described above but prior to the
long-term survey, additional materials were mailed. New materials
included additional children’s activities, Spanish language translations of
previous visitor-oriented materials, and a hippopotamus–person sun safety
adaptation poster. These supplemental materials did not differ by group; no
special tailoring for individual zoos occurred.</p>
      <p>A survey was conducted between Fall 2000 and Winter 2001 to assess
the short-term impact of disseminating the materials, and a follow-up
(long-term) survey was conducted approximately 1 year later. For each
survey, initially questionnaires were mailed to the education director at
each zoo, followed by a second mailing and subsequently a phone
interview for initial nonresponders. Phone surveys were conducted by trained
data collectors who had had no previous contact with respondents. The
short- and long-term survey instruments were similar and included items
that assessed whether specific strategies had been implemented. On both
surveys, respondents were asked about whether the activities had been
offered the previous summer and specified the year (i.e., 2000 for
shortterm survey and 2001 for long-term survey). The main outcomes,
computed from respondents’ answers to whether each activity on the menu had
been offered, were (a) whether a zoo offered at least one activity to zoo
visitors, (b) whether a zoo offered an activity to zoo staff, and (c) the
number of activities offered to visitors. The total number of visitor
activities was 17. The number of activities offered to staff was not used as an
outcome, because only one activity targeting staff was promoted by the
project (i.e., offering the sun safety in-service presentation).</p>
      <p>Process data included (a) description of the specific activities that zoos
were most likely to implement (based on survey responses), (b)
selfreported exposure to and perceptions of the materials, and (c) description
of the unsolicited contacts Sunwise Stampede received from nonstudy zoos
or other organizations and individuals (based on notes written at the time
of each contact).</p>
      <p>Assessment of randomization was examined for number of zoo visitors
using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test and for geographic location using a
chi-square test for contingency tables. Statistical analyses were performed
at each of the time periods, short term and long term, and treated short and
long term as repeated measures using generalized estimating equations
(GEE). At each time period, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were
calculated for dichotomous outcomes and rate ratios for number of
activities. Repeated measures analyses were carried out using GEE to correctly
estimate the standard errors for calculating p values when testing the
Group Time interaction and the group main effect.</p>

    <sec id="2">
      <title>Response Rates and Randomization</title>
      <p>The response rate of the zoo education directors for the
shortterm survey was 100%; 41% responded to the mailed version, and
the others were surveyed by phone. One hundred fourteen of the
126 zoos responded to the long-term follow-up survey (90.4%). Of
these, 47% responded to the mailed questionnaire, and the others
were phoned. On the first survey, the majority (70%) of
respondents were women and between the ages of 30 and 49 (71%).</p>
      <p>These proportions were comparable on the second survey (72%
and 73%, respectively).</p>
      <p>The differences between the two groups with respect to annual
number of zoo visitors and distribution of geographic location
were assessed. The median number of zoo visitors in the tailored
group was 380,000 and in the basic group was 355,000; results of
a Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed no significant group difference
(Z 0.08, p .94). As shown in Table 1, groups did not differ
on distribution of geographic location, suggesting that
randomization also balanced out this characteristic.</p>
      <p>Outcome Data</p>
      <p>Table 2 displays the descriptive statistics by group and time and
the GEE analysis. None of the comparisons between the groups
was significant at the .05 level. However, results approaching
significance can be seen for offered activities to visitors (odds ratio</p>
      <p>2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.0 – 4.8, p .01) in the short
term. For this variable, a higher percentage of tailored group zoos

offered at least one visitor activity as compared with the basic
group short term. However, this difference disappeared long term.</p>
      <p>This differential change over time was demonstrated by a
significant Group Time interaction ( p .01). More specifically, for
offered activities to visitors, the interaction effect reflects the
differential pattern of differences in percentages between tailored
and basic groups seen short term versus long term. This is evident
in Table 2. It appears that the tailored group had an initial higher
percentage of zoos offering visitor activities, which stayed
relatively constant over time (with a slight, nonstatistically significant
decay), whereas the basic group had a near doubling of
percentages over time. As can be seen in Table 2, the group main effects
for the other outcomes are not significant.</p>
      <p>Exploratory Analysis</p>
      <p>To examine potential associations between long-term
implementation of at least one visitor activity and select zoo
characteristics, chi-square tests were performed (with conditions
combined). Zoo characteristics, obtained during the 1998 baseline
survey (Talosig et al., 2000), included location (urban, rural, etc.),
U.S. geographic area (Northeast, etc.), number of annual visitors,
number of employees, and number of animal species featured by
Sunwise Stampede having sun-protective adaptations; data for the
last three variables were dichotomized using a median split.
Sample sizes ranged from 86 to 104, owing to missing data for one
or both variables. None of the associations was statistically
significant.</p>
      <p>Process Data</p>
      <p>Activities offered by zoos. Survey respondents reported
whether their zoo had offered each of the 17 Sunwise Stampede
visitor activities the previous summer. Table 2 presents the mean
number of activities for all zoos in each group. For zoos that had
implemented at least one activity (groups combined), the mean
number of activities in 2001 was 2.85 (SD 1.72) and in 2002
was 3.17 (SD 1.74). Activities that were most likely to be
offered during the first summer continued to be the ones most
offered the second summer. These activities consisted of (a)
adding Sunwise Stampede messages to guided tours (18 zoos in 2001
and 17 zoos in 2002), (b) offering paper-and-pencil activities to
children (n 15 and 17, respectively), (c) offering art activities to
children (n 14 and 15, respectively), (d) distributing the tip sheet
(n 15 and 15, respectively), and (e) posting the
point-ofpurchase signs (promoting sunscreen or hats) in the gift shop (n
13 and 13, respectively). The numbers of zoos selling sunscreen in
2001 and 2002 were 40 and 43, respectively, and the number
selling hats was 60 in both summers. However, selling sunscreen
and selling hats were not used as activities when computing our
outcome variables, because they could not be directly linked to our
intervention.</p>
      <p>Exposure to the materials. As noted, all 126 zoos initially
were mailed binders with descriptions of the program and
activities, along with ready-to-use materials. The proportions of
respondents in the tailored and basic groups reporting they had read at
least some of the binder were approximately 93% and 90%,
respectively. The proportions in these groups reporting they had
read more than half of the binder were 59% and 42%, respectively.</p>
      <p>Of those who reported having read at least some of the binder, the
distribution of usefulness ratings in the tailored group was not
useful 5%, somewhat useful 49%, and very useful 45%.</p>
      <p>The distribution of ratings for this variable for the basic group was
11%, 48%, and 41%, respectively. Results of chi-square tests
indicated that there were no statistically significant associations
between group assignment and (a) amount of binder read or (b)
perception of usefulness. The mailed version of the survey sent to
tailored group zoos at the short-term follow-up assessed
perceptions about the tailoring. Of 27 tailored group respondents, 25
(93%) noticed that the materials in the binder had been tailored
specifically for their zoo. When asked how important it was to
them that the materials were tailored, 13% responded not
important, 29% responded somewhat important, and 58% responded
very important. Only 9 (7.7%) of the respondents (groups
collapsed) reported visiting the zoo staff Web site on the short-term
survey.</p>
      <p>Dissemination beyond the study sites. Since implementing the
zoo visitor Web site, 35 persons not involved with study zoos or
the study itself have contacted the project (unsolicited by us). The
types of organizations most often represented were medical
centers, hospitals, or cancer centers (n 8); state or local health
departments (n 6); schools or colleges (n 4); and businesses
related to sun safety clothing or equipment (n 4). The purpose
of the contact typically was to request materials (n 16), obtain
information about partnering with a local zoo (n 5), get
permission to use or reproduce project materials (n 3), or link to our
Web site or include our Web game on their Web site (n 3).</p>
      <p>The results regarding the impact of tailored materials plus
follow-up calls on a zoo’s likelihood of implementing sun safety
activities were mixed. Specifically, the more intensive intervention
appeared to increase the likelihood that a zoo would offer activities
for visitors the summer that immediately followed initial program
dissemination, but this increase was not found for the zoo
employee activity. The next summer, zoos in the basic group had
levels of activities for both visitors and staff that were comparable
to the tailored group’s levels. In general, between Summers 1 and
2 the levels decreased slightly in the tailored group and increased
in the basic group. The intervention strategies that were used for
each group differed only during the period prior to the short-term
survey; in Year 2 of the program, both groups received the same
(nontailored) materials, and neither group received phone calls.</p>
      <p>Thus, given our design, it is not possible to determine whether (a)
providing tailored materials plus phone calls over a longer interval
would have maintained higher levels of zoo visitor activities
(relative to providing generic materials); (b) providing tailored
materials plus calls simply may have prompted those zoos to offer
visitor activities earlier; or (c) the increase between the two
summers in the level of activities at basic group zoos was due to a
delayed reaction to the initial intervention or due to the receipt of
additional materials and contacts during Year 2 of the intervention.</p>
      <p>Another key finding was that 31% (39/126) of participating zoos
had implemented at least one visitor activity by the first summer,
and this proportion was 33% (41/126) the following summer.</p>
      <p>Although our design did not include a no-treatment control group,
the activities that we assessed were specific to the Sunwise
Stampede program. Consequently, we believe it is unlikely that zoos
would have implemented these activities in the absence of our
program. Additionally, the base rates of any sun safety activities
for zoo visitors had been negligible in our earlier national survey
(Talosig et al., 2000). The data from the current study suggest that
our menu of activities, which had been developed at one zoo, was
attractive to a respectable number of other zoos. The development
of the initial Sunwise Stampede activities tested in San Diego
(Mayer et al., 2001), as well as the dissemination strategies and
materials, was informed by the results of extensive formative
evaluation with zoo and AZA personnel.</p>
      <p>Although no formal cost analyses were performed, the site visits
to the tailored group zoos required more resources than typically
would be available. To reduce costs, information about zoo
characteristics could be obtained via phone interviews of relevant zoo
personnel, and digital photographs (of key exhibits, etc.) could be
provided by zoo staff or volunteers. The majority of respondents in
both groups reported having read at least some of the binder and
finding it useful. In contrast, very few accessed the zoo staff Web
site. However, this likely occurred because (a) many zoos did not
have computer resources at that time, and (b) the Web site content
mirrored the content of the binder, and the binder was introduced
first.</p>
      <p>We also were encouraged by the contacts we received about
Sunwise Stampede from those who were not study participants;
most of these contacts were stimulated by people accessing the zoo
visitor Web site. The number of contacts we received likely
underestimates the degree of dissemination that occurred naturally.</p>
      <p>Methodological strengths include (a) inclusion of nearly all
AZA-accredited zoos in the sample, (b) high response rates in both
surveys, and (c) random assignment to groups using number of
visitors and geographical region as stratification factors. A key
methodological weakness is that all outcomes were based on
verbal report. We did not attempt to validate the data by directly
observing whether the activities were being offered or by
interviewing multiple staff at each zoo. Thus, it is possible that because
of social demand or other biases, respondents overestimated the
number of activities their zoo adopted; this bias may have been
stronger in the tailored group. Second, as noted earlier, a study
design in which the tailored group received tailoring in Year 2 of
the intervention (as well as in Year 1) would have allowed clearer
interpretations of the long-term group comparisons. Furthermore,
the tailored group received two phone calls, whereas the basic
group received no calls. Thus, direct comparisons cannot be made
between tailored versus generic materials per se. Finally, we did
not measure the impact of the Sunwise Stampede activities (at zoos
that implemented them) on visitor and employee behaviors; this
type of evaluation was beyond the project’s scope and budget.</p>
      <p>Our decision to compare two dissemination strategies of
different intensities rather than compare one strategy to no strategy (i.e.,
a true control group) was influenced by our goal to expose as many
AZA zoos as possible to the Sunwise Stampede program. Only two
conditions were compared because of our sample size constraints.</p>
      <p>Our decision to evaluate the additive impact of tailoring was based,
in part, on (a) the diffusion criteria of “adoptability,” presuming
that a tailored intervention would enhance adoptability by making
it easier to both “sell” and implement within the organization; (b)
the success of interventions tailored to individuals in improving
health outcomes (C. S. Skinner et al., 1999); and (c) the plethora
of studies within the “two paths to persuasion” literature (Chaiken,
1987; Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986a, 1986b) showing that increased
personal relevance of communication (via tailoring) heightens
persuasion. We had reasoned that tailored materials would be more
persuasive, resulting in a higher likelihood of a decision by key
zoo personnel to adopt Sunwise Stampede activities. This was
confirmed by the Year 1 finding that zoos in the tailored condition
were significantly more likely to adopt the intervention. The
finding that tailoring encouraged greater rates of adoption, but not
maintenance of the intervention in Year 2, may mean that zoo
program implementers did not realize significant additional
benefits from implementing the tailored intervention. Given the
importance of maintenance in the diffusion process, the numerous
factors that could account for this phenomenon should be explored in
future process and impact evaluation studies.</p>
      <p>Initially in brainstorming our interventions, we considered (a)
maximizing the cross-talk among zoos directly and via AZA
communications and (b) soliciting national, mass-media publicity
about the program. These strategies likely would have enhanced
the adoption process in both groups through increasing shared
knowledge, mutual persuasion, or reinforcing adopters for already
implementing part or all of the intervention (Rogers, 1983, 1995).</p>
      <p>However, we ruled them out because they may have caused
contamination between the study groups. Thus, we potentially
weakened our intervention in an attempt to strengthen a study
design typically used in efficacy and effectiveness research.
Ironically, the “contamination” and “cross-talk” one seeks to reduce in
controlled efficacy and effectiveness trials are the very goals of the
dissemination process. This catch-22 indicates that different
paradigms (as well as different criteria for funding and publication)
will be needed for dissemination intervention research if we wish
to develop the most effective strategies.</p>
      <p>In summary, the combination of tailoring printed dissemination
materials and providing two brief phone contacts had a marginally
significant short-term impact (relative to generic print materials)
on a zoo’s likelihood of offering a sun safety activity to visitors;
this effect was not found for the zoo employee activity. However,
during the subsequent summer, the proportion of basic group zoos
offering visitor activities had increased substantially, and there
were no between-group differences. By the second summer, one
third of all participant zoos were offering at least one Sunwise
Stampede visitor activity. We conclude that the mailed, print
materials that targeted the “typical” zoo environment were
sufficient for a diffusion of this innovation to occur, namely, to
encourage a moderately high number of zoos to offer sun safety
activities to their visitors.</p>
      <p>Additional research is needed to address systematically whether
a larger “dose” or longer duration of tailoring would be more
effective (and cost effective) for promoting long-term
implementation. Moreover, the impact on visitor and employee behavior due
to implementing Sunwise Stampede activities should be evaluated
across multiple zoos to replicate our initial effectiveness study
(Mayer et al., 2001). The number of activities that is sufficient to
modify sun safety behavior, and which activities are the most
powerful, also should be addressed. Finally, as noted earlier, we
warn investigators to avoid the design-hygiene trap we succumbed
to. Rather, we would endorse innovative designs for evaluating
dissemination strategies that build on the cross-talk and diffusion
that occur naturally within and across zoos.
