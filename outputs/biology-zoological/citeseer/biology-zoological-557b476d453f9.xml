Although generally thought of as a nocturnal solitary species [Williams and Petrides, 1980], recent evidence suggests that the Malayan tapir is more social than first thought [Diz, 2006]. Currently classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (due to anthropogenic pressures and disturbance of its natural habitat leading to fragmented populations), Malayan tapir is known to exist in Malaysia, Sumatra (Indonesia), Thailand, and Burma [Lynam et al., 2008]. Malayan tapir is maintained in numerous animal collections around the world generally being termed easy-to-keep [e.g. Barongi, 1999; Shoemaker et al., 2004]. As intermediate feeders, Malayan tapirs select fruits, grasses, and browse trees dependent upon season [Janssen, 2003], an important fact to consider when evaluating captive diets.

Wild Malayan tapirs occupy large home ranges, from 12 km2 [Eisenberg, 1997] to over 25 km2 [Traeholt, 2004] and as such, captive enclosures need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational stimulation for the inhabitants. The results show that collections provided some form of enrichment for their tapirs to increase enclosure utilization and activity in their animals. Current research states that tapirs are generally inactive, due to inappropriate diets causing obesity and altered time budgets [Clauss et al., 2009]; similarly, Green et al. [2007] show that presentation of feed to captive tapirs can affect total activity budgets and behavioral repertoire diversity. Wild tapirs expend the majority of their energy consuming vegetation [Oliveiro-Santos et al., 2010], and calculated times spent foraging range from 8.5 [Novarino, 2005] to 15 hr/ day [Holden et al., 2003], depending on habitat type. Therefore, to promote “great welfare” [as per Melfi, 2009], increased opportunities for foraging could be offered.

Behavioral observations on the same animal noted that enrichment had a significant effect on foraging and locomotory behaviors in this individual [Rose et al., 2008]. Work performed by Zenzinger [2003] has shown that browse is the enrichment artifact most used by tapirs, and the one that alters behavior patterns to the greatest extent; a fact that is to be expected as being browsing ungulates, tapirs spend the greatest proportion of their time foraging [e.g. Henry et al., 2000]. Wild Malayan tapirs occupy large home ranges, from 12 km2 [Eisenberg, 1997] to over 25 km2 [Traeholt, 2004] and as such, captive enclosures need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational stimulation for the inhabitants. Indeed, Foerster and Vaughan’s [2004] research highlights the seasonal nature of tapir habitat use, indicating the complexity of wild tapir activity budgets.

The large size, shy character, and potential for aggressive behavior in this species may cause zoos to be reluctant to attempt MSE. However, as zoo exhibit design becomes more adventurous and sophisticated, the potential for MSE with difficult species is increased. Added interest in the enclosure, with species from a similar geographic area to the Malayan tapir or inclusion of active or visually attractive animals (as per those included in zoo 9), helps draw in the public and tell a specific conservation and/ or educational message [e.g. Hosey et al., 2009]. Interspecific interaction can be used to diversify the behaviors of Malayan tapir in captivity (see zoo 1 in Table 8) and provides another form of enrichment to stimulate and interest captive individuals. It may be that such an exhibit is not feasible in many current collections, due to space and budget demands, and also the potentially volatile nature of the species [e.g. see Janssen, 2003] causing zoo personnel to be wary of multispecies incorporation. What is encouraging is that many of the tapirs in this sample population are housed in enclosures that allow access to a conspecific but t</context>

Although generally thought of as a nocturnal solitary species [Williams and Petrides, 1980], recent evidence suggests that the Malayan tapir is more social than first thought [Diz, 2006]. Currently classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (due to anthropogenic pressures and disturbance of its natural habitat leading to fragmented populations), Malayan tapir is known to exist in Malaysia, Sumatra (Indonesia), Thailand, and Burma [Lynam et al., 2008]. Malayan tapir is maintained in numerous animal collections around the world generally being termed easy-to-keep [e.g. Barongi, 1999; Shoemaker et al., 2004]. As intermediate feeders, Malayan tapirs select fruits, grasses, and browse trees dependent upon season [Janssen, 2003], an important fact to consider when evaluating captive diets.

Wild Malayan tapirs occupy large home ranges, from 12 km2 [Eisenberg, 1997] to over 25 km2 [Traeholt, 2004] and as such, captive enclosures need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational stimulation for the inhabitants. Indeed, Foerster and Vaughan’s [2004] research highlights the seasonal nature of tapir habitat use, indicating the complexity of wild tapir activity budgets. The research presented here is of prime importance as the current census from the IUCN Red List 2011.1 shows that Malayan tapir numbers are decreasing in the wild [Lynam et al., 2008]. As such, the ex situ conservation of this species will require support from specific management guidelines and accurate knowledge on the species’ individual captive requirements. The slow reproductive rate of Malayan tapirs plus their low wild population density [Eisenberg, 1997] makes the establishment and future continuation of a sustainable captive population an essential conservation strategy.

Current research states that tapirs are generally inactive, due to inappropriate diets causing obesity and altered time budgets [Clauss et al., 2009]; similarly, Green et al. [2007] show that presentation of feed to captive tapirs can affect total activity budgets and behavioral repertoire diversity. Wild tapirs expend the majority of their energy consuming vegetation [Oliveiro-Santos et al., 2010], and calculated times spent foraging range from 8.5 [Novarino, 2005] to 15 hr/ day [Holden et al., 2003], depending on habitat type. Therefore, to promote “great welfare” [as per Melfi, 2009], increased opportunities for foraging could be offered. Indeed, Seitz [1998] and Barongi [2000] state that activity of captive tapirs is predominantly influenced by dietary provision and the presence of conspecifics, highlighting links between husbandry and social enrichment. Encouraging keepers to use low-energy feed items would be highly beneficial as the positive relationship between resting and limited forage opportunity would be reversed.

Rose et al. [2006] note a similar activity budget in a lone female Malayan tapir when provided with a range of enrichments across different periods of the day. When comparing the findings of Rose et al. with Mahler’s [1984] research into captive Brazilian tapir time budgets, similarities do appear; thus, suggesting that well thoughtout, evidence-based enrichment [e.g. Rose and Roffe, 2008, 2010] is the optimum way of providing beneficial enrichment to captive ungulates, including tapirs. Kinahan [2001] states that the overall fundamental difference between captive and wild tapir activity budgets concerns time spent actively moving around, or investigating or being able to forage in, the animal’s immediate environment. It would appear that certain facets of tapir management impair the species’ ability to perform a “wild-type” time budget. It is important to remember that the zoo environment, when compared to a natural habitat, is often controlled and predictable [Kinahan, 2001;</context>

Dietary change not only would benefit welfare but also the public’s image of the tapir in the zoo. Seitz [2002] states that the zoo-going public do not find tapirs particularly interesting animals to observe. Similarly, anecdotal evidence collected by the authors of this paper show that the public are generally not very interested in ungulates as a group and find tapirs “boring” due to their inactivity. An objective of an earlier study [Rose et al., 2006] involving Malayan tapir at Twycross Zoo was designed to “make” tapirs more interesting to the public by encouraging the animal to be more active via the use of enrichment. Steiz [1998] supports the idea that tapir can be “made” more interesting to zoo visitors via alterations to exhibit layout and planned use of enrichment, thus directly impacting the conservation/education value of the exhibit. Only one zoo surveyed attempted an MSE and while the authors know of several collections that mix Brazilian tapir with other species, research suggests that MSE with Malayan tapir to be limited.

One collection reported poor acceptance of feed balls and specifically that the use of a feed ball depended on the “personality” of the individual tapir, whereas in another collection that employed this form of enrichment, all tapirs u</context>

Kinahan [2001] states that the overall fundamental difference between captive and wild tapir activity budgets concerns time spent actively moving around, or investigating or being able to forage in, the animal’s immediate environment. It would appear that certain facets of tapir management impair the species’ ability to perform a “wild-type” time budget. It is important to remember that the zoo environment, when compared to a natural habitat, is often controlled and predictable [Kinahan, 2001; Shepherdson, 1998], and not all wild behaviors can be performed exactly for evolutionary purpose. There are key appetitive behavior patterns that fundamentally link to good welfare [e.g. Swaisgood, 2007]; infringement on these behaviors will deprive individuals of the opportunity to best cope with their situation and can lead to stress. The effects of stress on captive tapirs, due to inappropriate housing, husbandry and management are well documented [Janssen, 2003] and hence, stressors should be minimized or removed where possible. The tapir is evidently a difficult animal to exhibit with regard to nutritiona</context>

Behavioral observations on the same animal noted that enrichment had a significant effect on foraging and locomotory behaviors in this individual [Rose et al., 2008]. Work performed by Zenzinger [2003] has shown that browse is the enrichment artifact most used by tapirs, and the one that alters behavior patterns to the greatest extent; a fact that is to be expected as being browsing ungulates, tapirs spend the greatest proportion of their time foraging [e.g. Henry et al., 2000]. Wild Malayan tapirs occupy large home ranges, from 12 km2 [Eisenberg, 1997] to over 25 km2 [Traeholt, 2004] and as such, captive enclosures need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational stimulation for the inhabitants. Indeed, Foerster and Vaughan’s [2004] research highlights the seasonal nature of tapir habitat use, indicating the complexity of wild tapir activity budgets. The research presented here is of prime importance as the current census from the IUCN Red List 2011.1 shows that Malayan tapir numbers are decreasing in the wild [Lynam et al., 2008]. As such, the ex situ conservation of this species will require support from specific management guidelines and accurate knowledge on</context>

DISCU SSION Using Shoemaker et al.’s [2004] husbandry guide as a baseline, results highlight numerous areas of good practice in the keeping and exhibition of Malayan tapirs in different zoos around the world. It appears that the zoos surveyed meet Hall’s [2007] guidelines for tapirs held socially whereby animals need to be separated during calving and calf rearing, potentially due to the chance of dangerous and unpredictable behavior being performed. Wild Malayan tapirs occupy large home ranges, from 12 km2 [Eisenberg, 1997] to over 25 km2 [Traeholt, 2004] and as such, captive enclosures need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational stimulation for the inhabitants. The results show that collections provided some form of enrichment for their tapirs to increase enclosure utilization and activity in their animals. Current research states that tapirs are generally inactive, due to inappropriate diets causing obesity and altered time budgets [Clauss et al., 2009]; similarly, Green et al. [2007] show that presentation of feed to captive tapirs can affect total activity budgets and behavioral repertoire diversity. Wild tapirs expend the m</context>
