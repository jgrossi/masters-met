			<abstract>
				<p>Duncan (1937) provided detailed information that has been widely used to date names of new taxa described in early volumes of the Proceedings. The examinations reported here suggest that at least at the point where the year of publication is important Duncan was usually correct, and although exceptions are reported they are not of great consequence (although 14 of 42 volumes are anomalous). These exceptions relate to cases where the published pages differed from a multiple of the signature size by a couple of pages or so. Over the 41 volumes examined, two or more techniques were used to provide, economically, text needed to complete an article that would have overrun the number of signatures planned for the issue. The importance of retaining wrappers and binding them in is demonstrated by what can be learned from them.</p>

Researchers are well aware that the volume year of the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London should not be cited lightly as the date of publication. For years it was routine practice for the papers read at meetings late one year to be published next spring within the volume year based for the period when the paper was read. There were also years when publication fell behind schedule. From the calendar years 1831 to 1858 we do not know the dates of publication; the records show when the printers delivered printed parts to the Society but not when these were published (Duncan, 1937). From 1859 to 1900, and on through to 1926, the dates of publication of the parts were brought together and explained by Duncan (1937) and his dates are now E-mail: asiaorn@tiscali.co.uk generally relied upon.

However, the cases explained below, and the table naming a library where wrappers will be found for that volume, will familiarize readers with what to look for if they need to date monthcritical cases more definitely and thus have to examine earlier numbers in the volumes. The reader may assume that a volume between 1859 and 1900 that is not discussed below has a clean and obvious break between the two issues that concern us and that is wholly unambiguous and consistent with Duncan (1937). 428 EDWARD C. DICKINSON It will be recalled that there were three issues a year from 1859 to 1873 and four issues a year from 1874 to 1900. SIGNATURE NUMBERS It was suggested that in the course of this work that understanding the signature numbering system might be helpful. At this period the pages of the Proceedings were octavo, and the standard signature was therefore 16 pages. In several cases explored below the signature numbers that were apparent did not tally with what would be expected by dividing by 16; this anomaly has not been explored further. The signature numbers were originally</context>
<context citStr="Duncan (1937)" endWordPosition="1126" position="6546" startWordPosition="1125">ide to the page split between years as given by Duncan. The location is given of a volume with wrappers. In the early 1860s it was apparently the practice to print extra pages to complete a paper, probably inserting just a page or two, and to accept that these pages would be reprinted so that each issue began with a complete signature, but from 1865 to 1881 problems of this type did not occur, or at least did not occur at the break between the calendar years. From 1882 space was made available on wrappers to absorb text overflow and it was not necessary to use part of an extra signature. 1860 Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be between pages 336 and 337 and this is the first page of signature 438 (this volume begins with signature number 417). The wrapper for issues 1 and 2 lists the closing article as ‘On some hybrid ducks’ (p. 336). This article indeed began on that page, but it runs to p. 338. It would seem that pp. 337 and 338 were printed twice; in this instance the two states may only be distinguished in cases where the parts have been bound without excising the duplicate page. 1862 Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be between pages 208 and 209. The table </context>
<context citStr="Duncan (1937)" endWordPosition="1721" position="9942" startWordPosition="1720">d corrections. 3 lists the first article as beginning on page 210. Pages 208 and 209 contain a short article that should therefore have been in issue 2. Page 209 is the first page of signature 14 (from this volume, or perhaps from 1861, signature Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 1859–1900 429 numbers started each time from 1) and therefore this is the second state of this page; this text was not found on the wrapper and it is unclear how this page was provided in its first state; it seems that a short signature must have been used with all pages except for page 209 blank. 1863 Duncan (1937) suggested that the page break should be between pages 336 and page 337; this is the first page of signature 22. The article that fills page 336 continues through to the top of page 339. It is apparent that page 339, and very probably 337 and 338, were printed twice. The content of the final part will have begun part way through page 339. 1864 Duncan (1937) again suggested that the page break should be between pages 336 and page 337, and page 337 is the first page of signature 22, but the last article in the previous issue finishes at the foot of page 338. Pages 337 and 338 again appear to hav</context>
<context citStr="Duncan (1937)" endWordPosition="1970" position="11279" startWordPosition="1969">uld be between pages 590 and 591. It seems, oddly, that page 591 is the first page of signature 40; on it however one finds the description by Sharpe of a new flycatcher Muscicapa ussheri that was introduced on page 590. The wrappers show that the use of extra paper stock for reprinting the minimum amount of extra print on page 591 was avoided by the expedient of completing this text on the inside back of the wrapper itself, using 3/4 of the page. When printing the fourth issue page 591 thus contains 3/4 of a page of reprinted text and 1/4 of a page starts paper 12 from the June meeting. 1883 Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be between pages 460 and 461, which purports to be the first page of signature 31. The third issue of the year concludes with a long article on the birds of Yucatan and this will be seen to end on page 462. It seems clear that the content of the final issue began on page 463 (which is the Secretary’s Report on Additions to the Menagerie), as supported by the wrapper for the final part. Pages 461 and 462 will thus have been reprinted. 1887 Dickinson (2004) explained that pages 557 and 558 had been printed twice, the second of them being completed with the op</context>

Part III, however, ends with an article by Bates on the Coleoptera of Mount Kinabalu and this article only finishes on page 393. In this instance the small amount of extra text was first printed on the inside back of the wrapper for Part III and then reprinted on good paper when Part IV appeared. The description of the genus Eusynthela might, to one not seeing the wrapper, seem to have been half printed in 1889 and half in 1890. 1891 Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be between pages 464 and 465, but page 463 appears to be the first page of signature 32. The evidence in this case shows that page 463 and the first seven lines on page 464 were reprinted and issued with Part IV. 1893 Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be between pages 598 and 599, which appears to be the first page of signature 41 (although in its original state no number appears on that page). In fact the text of Part III ran on to page 599. The bound copy in the Mammal Department at The Natural History Museum, South Kensington has these tw</context>

It is apparent that pages 685 and 686 were reprinted and that page 686 must have existed in two states, being only two-thirds filled in its first state. A set at The Natural History Museum, Tring shows both states. The header in state one dates the page June 18, and in state two it is dated November 19. 1897 This is the third instance where Duncan reported the final Part beginning with an even page number (810). In this case all page 809, the first page of signature 54, was first printed inside the back cover of Part III. 1898 Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be between pages 584 and 585 (the first page of signature 40). The wrapper of Part III reveals that the top two-thirds of page 585 was first printed inside its back.

The importance of retaining wrappers and binding them in is demonstrated by what can be learned from them. INTRODUCTION Nomenclature is a cornerstone of communication in zoology. Today, the way in which names are used is governed by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN, 1999). In essence the Code governing binomial nomenclature requires that the names we attach to taxa must have four elements (a generic name, a name in the ‘species-group’, one or more authors – or describers – and the date of description). Special importance is attached to the date due to the Principle of Priority (Art. 23, ICZN, 1999). Only by using the Article applicable to dating (Art. 21, ICZN, 1999) do we determine between two names separately bestowed upon the same taxon.
