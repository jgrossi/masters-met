			<abstract>
				<p>Previous research found that a sun safety program for visitors at 1 zoo increased sun safety behaviors. This randomized study compared the effects of tailored dissemination materials plus 2 brief follow-up phone calls (tailored group) versus generic materials (basic group) on implementation by other zoos of the previously evaluated sun safety program. Education directors of 126 zoos completed surveys several months following initial dissemination and 1 year later. During Summer 1, 40% of tailored group zoos and 24% of basic group zoos offered visitors at least 1 sun safety activity (odds ratio ϭ 2.2, 95% confidence interval ϭ 1.0 – 4.8). During Summer 2, these rates were 34% and 44%, respectively (ns). The pattern of findings suggests that tailoring had no incremental long-term impact and that the generic materials produced a good level of dissemination.</p>

Results indicated that although only 5% of the zoos offered any sun safety-related advice or activities to visitors, the majority indicated they would be interested in providing sun safety activities in the future. The current study compared two strategies for disseminating sun safety activities to U.S. zoos. Much of the current thinking about dissemination began with the work of Everett Rogers and his colleagues; this framework provided general guidance for developing our dissemination strategies. According to Rogers (1983, 1995; Rogers &amp; Shoemaker, 1971), technological and behavioral innovations are often experimented with and adopted by certain individuals in a community who are seen by “late adopters” as trendsetters. The process of diffusion of innovations includes knowledge acquisition, persuasion, decision, and reinforcement (Rogers, 1983). Once success is achieved with a smaller group of early adopters, dissemination to other organizations, communities, and regions should prove much easier. The change agent should aim for a critical mass of individuals to adopt a single or limited number of changes in or</context>

The pattern of findings suggests that tailoring had no incremental long-term impact and that the generic materials produced a good level of dissemination. Keywords: skin cancer prevention, dissemination, tailoring, recreational settings, children Skin cancer rates are increasing throughout the United States. In 2003, more than 1 million people were diagnosed with nonmelanoma skin cancers and 54,000 with melanoma (American Cancer Society, 2003). Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure is a key skin cancer risk factor (Elwood, 1993; Friedman, Rigel, Berson, &amp; Rivers, 1991; Marks, 1995; Singletary &amp; Balch, 1991), and outdoor recreational settings such as zoological parks, where numerous visitors typically are exposed to long bouts of solar UVR, are high-risk environments. In the United States, zoos alone are visited by more than 100 million people annually (American Zoo and Aquarium Association, 2003). In 1998, we surveyed U.S. zoos accredited by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) to evaluate their current sun safety practices for visitors (Talosig et al., 2000).

The change agent should aim for a critical mass of individuals to adopt a single or limited number of changes in order to make a large-scale impact. Initially, diffusion theory emphasized how workers adopted innovations (Rogers, 1983). Subsequently, researchers acknowledged that individuals often adopt innovations as members of organizations and that such individuals seldom adopt an innovation until it is first accepted by the organization (Steckler, Goodman, &amp; Kegler, 2002). Diffusion within and dissemination between organizations is a complex process, requiring consideration of multiple factors, such as the organization’s goals, authority structure, decision-making mechanisms, rules, regulations, and informal norms. Diffusion may depend on involving multiple entities, such as an organization’s administrators, staff, and clientele (Parcel, Perry, &amp; Taylor, 1990). To date, only a few studies have been published describing controlled evaluations of dissemination strategies for health promotion programs (Oldenburg, Sallis, Ffrench, &amp; Owen, 1999).
