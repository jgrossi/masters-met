			<abstract>
				<p>Many organisms are able to regenerate lost or damaged body parts that are structural and functional replicates of the original. Eventually these become fully integrated into pre-existing tissues. However, with the exception of deer, mammals have lost this ability. Each spring deer shed antlers that were used for fighting and display during the previous mating season. Their loss is triggered by a fall in circulating testosterone levels, a hormonal change that is linked to an increase in day length. A complex 'blastema-like' structure or 'antler-bud' then forms; however, unlike the regenerative process in the newt, most evidence (albeit indirect) suggests that this does not involve reversal of the differentiated state but is stem cell based. The subsequent re-growth of antlers during the spring and summer months is spectacular and represents one of the fastest rates of organogenesis in the animal kingdom. Longitudinal growth involves endochondral ossification in the tip of each antler branch and bone growth around the antler shaft is by intramembranous ossification. As androgen concentrations rise in late summer, longitudinal growth stops, the skin (velvet) covering the antler is lost and antlers are 'polished' in preparation for the mating season. Although the timing of the antler growth cycle is clearly closely linked to circulating testosterone, oestro-gen may be a key cellular regulator, as it is in the skeleton of other male mammals. We still know very little about the molecular machinery required for antler regeneration, although there is evidence that developmental signalling pathways with pleiotropic functions are important and that novel 'antler-specific' molecules may not exist. Identifying these pathways and factors, deciphering their interactions and how they are regulated by environmental cues could have an important impact on human health if this knowledge is applied to the engineering of new human tissues and organs.</p>

The fourth and final stage is termed antler endochondral ossification. Here the antlerogenic cells maintain their chondrogenic differentiation pathway until the first antler has been fully formed (4 in Fig. 2C). The onset of antler formation is coincident with the appearance of ‘shiny’ velvet skin covering the distal end of the pedicle. These un-branched antlers (described as ‘spikers’ in the deer industry) then elongate as a result of an endochondral process in the distal tip (Fig. 2D; Chapman, 1975). Because the cellular anatomy of endochondral ossification is very similar in the primary and regenerating antlers it will be described in a later section. Growth of the first antler continues until the autumn rutting season approaches when there is another increase in circulating testosterone. This endocrine change is associated with a cessation in longitudinal growth, the antler bone becomes fully mineralized and the overlying velvet is shed exposing bare bone. This leaves the single un-branched antler attached to the pedicle until it is cast the following spring. This inhibition of longitu</context>

It is also possible to distinguish that there is a distal region of non-mineralized cartilage whereas more proximally deposition of mineral takes place (Price et al. 1996). The vascularization of antler cartilage is the most striking difference between its anatomy and that of other hyaline cartilages. This abundant blood supply is required to meet the high metabolic demands imposed by rapid tissue regeneration. That the antler provides a valuable model for the study of angiogenesis was proposed recently by Clark et al. (2004), who have identified VEGF and the VEGF receptor in regenerating antler tissues. Histologically, the boundary between mesenchyme and the zone of chondroprogenitors is not distinct in longitudinal sections, but is a region where cells start to become arranged into columns between which there are vascular spaces (Fig. 9F). Previously we have described this as a ‘zone of transition’ because cells at this site are at different stages of differentiation along the chondrocyte lineage (Price et al. 1996). Type IIA collagen mRNA identifies chondroprogenitors in the developing skeleton (Sandell et al. </context>

Compared with cells in more proximal regions of the antler, cells in this region express only low levels of alkaline phosphatase and this reflects their undifferentiated state (Price et al. 1994; Price, 2005). However, although these cells will differentiate into chondrocytes in more proximal regions, they do express markers of the early osteoblast lineage (our unpublished observations) and in the presence of dexamethasone alkaline phosphatase expression will increase (Faucheux et al. 2001). This indicates that these cells are at least bi-potential, although we have preliminary evidence that they can also differentiate into adipocyte-like cells under the appropriate culture conditions.

This demonstrates that the early antler bud is not a uniform structure and that, like PTHrP, RA may have multiple functions. Another question in antler biology pertains to the source of cells which give rise to the regenerating antler Wislocki and Goss were of the view that migrating cells from the dermis of the pedicle were the source (Wislocki, 1943; Goss, 1972, 1984, 1995). However, a number of workers in this field currently take the view that regenerating antlers are derived mainly from a population of progenitor cells in the periosteum of the pedicle (Kierdorf &amp; Kierdorf, 1992, 2000, 2001; Li et al. 2005). This tissue is derived from antlerogenic periosteum, which has convincingly been shown to be the origin of the pedicle and primary antlers (Hartwig, 1974; Goss &amp; Powel, 1985; Kierdorf &amp; Kierdorf, 2001). Li et al. (2005) concluded from their histological studies that antler regeneration is stem cell based with the periosteum being the source of these cells. However, before a cell can be defined as a true ‘stem’ cell it must be shown to have a capacity for self-renewal and to be capable of differentiation into specialized lineages.

However, the role of sex steroids is likely to be more complex and may also involve regulation of stem cell populations in the pedicle tissues (this will be discussed in more detail in a later section). Antler regeneration: formation of the antler bud The anatomy of the early stages of antler regeneration has been described in a number of recent publications is illustrated here in Fig. 7 (Kierdoff et al. 2003; Li et al. 2004, 2005; Price, 2005). Immediately after the old antlers have been cast a raised ‘swollen’ ring of skin surrounds the distal end of the pedicle (Fig. 7A). This has a ‘shiny’ surface, characteristic of antler velvet skin. Within hours, the epidermis, known as ‘wound epithelium’, starts to migrate across the exposed surface of the pedicle bone and covers a mass of cells within loosely packed extracellular matrix tissue (Fig. 8A). These cells have not been well characterized; for example, it is not known whether they express similar markers to cells in the newt blastema. Li et al. </context>

In some more phylogenetically evolved deer species the growth of castrated antlers is quite aberrant, e.g. fallow deer develop peculiar bony protuberances that Goss (1983) classified as ‘antleromas’ (Fig. 6C). Recently, Kierdorf et al. (2004) described in detail the structure of the antler of castrated fallow deer and presented evidence to suggest that these protuberances (Fig. 6C) are in fact benign tumour growths with comparable histological changes to osteomas. Roe deer also develop large benign tumours on castrated antlers in which intradermal bone has been observed. The link between regeneration and cancer was highlighted in a review by Brockes (1998), and led us to suggest previously (Price &amp; Allen, 2004) that castrated antlers develop tumour-like structures because a mechanism has evolved in deer whereby sex steroids (actin</context>

All of the molecules discussed above have been shown to regulate osteoblast function in other species (Grigoriadis et al. 1986; Choong et al. 1993; Oliva et al. 1993; Slootweg et al. 1996; Park et al. 1997; St-Jacques et al. 1999; Kobayashi et al. 2002). What is clear from the above is that the factors so far identified as being involved in antler regeneration have multiple functions. For example, both RA and PTHrP regulate chondrocyte, osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation. Our knowledge of the pathways involved remains in its infancy, but what is becoming apparent is that nature is conservative and that during antler regeneration a number of developmental pathways are recapitulated.

However, before a cell can be defined as a true ‘stem’ cell it must be shown to have a capacity for self-renewal and to be capable of differentiation into specialized lineages. To date there is no evidence that cells from the pedicle of an adult deer have the capacity for self-renewal or can differentiate into anything other than chondrocytes and osteoblasts (Li et al. 1995). A number of approaches could be taken to address this issue: (1) the identification of stem cell markers in tissues of the pedicle, (2) the demonstration that cells cultured from the periosteum of the pedicle of regenerating antlers are pluripotential in vitro and in animal models in vivo, and, (3) the demonstration that periosteum cells stably transfected with a genetic marker [e.g. green fluorescent protein (GFP)] differentiate into different antler cell types in regenerating antlers in vivo.

As the fawn approaches puberty (at approximately 5–7 months old in the red deer), a collection of determined periosteal cells located in the distal parts of the cristae externae of the frontal bones are activated by rising androgen levels in the blood. This specialized periosteum (Fig. 2B) was originally described as ‘antlerogenic periosteum’ (AP) by Richard Goss (Goss &amp; Powel, 1985). The AP contains specific binding sites for testosterone (Li &amp; Suttie, 1998) although testosterone does not appear to have direct effects on cultured AP cells whereas IGF-I stimulates their proliferation (Li et al. 1999; Sadighi et al. 2001). Trabecular bone is then formed beneath the periosteum and a pedicle develops (Sempere et al. 1983; Suttie et al. 1984, 1988, 1991). Normally the antlerogenic periosteum of female deer remains quiescent because the hormonal requirements necessary for pedicle formation are not present. However, female deer can be induced to form pedicles if injected with androgens (Kierdorf et al. 1995). Li &amp; Suttie (1994) have undertaken detailed histological analyses of pedicle formation and have identified four ossification stages. The first is the intramembranous ossification stage (1</context>

Studies using a cell lineage tracer described by Li and Suttie in their review of antlerogenic periosteum provide further evidence that pedicles and antlers are derived from this tissue (Li &amp; Suttie, 2001).

However, the role of sex steroids is likely to be more complex and may also involve regulation of stem cell populations in the pedicle tissues (this will be discussed in more detail in a later section). Antler regeneration: formation of the antler bud The anatomy of the early stages of antler regeneration has been described in a number of recent publications is illustrated here in Fig. 7 (Kierdoff et al. 2003; Li et al. 2004, 2005; Price, 2005). Immediately after the old antlers have been cast a raised ‘swollen’ ring of skin surrounds the distal end of the pedicle (Fig. 7A). This has a ‘shiny’ surface, characteristic of antler velvet skin. Within hours, the epidermis, known as ‘wound epithelium’, starts to migrate across the exposed surface of the pedicle bone and covers a mass of cells within loosely packed extracellular matrix tissue (Fig. 8A). These cells have not been well characterized; for example, it is not known whether they express similar markers to cells in the newt blastema. Li et al. (2004) describe </context>

Another question in antler biology pertains to the source of cells which give rise to the regenerating antler Wislocki and Goss were of the view that migrating cells from the dermis of the pedicle were the source (Wislocki, 1943; Goss, 1972, 1984, 1995). However, a number of workers in this field currently take the view that regenerating antlers are derived mainly from a population of progenitor cells in the periosteum of the pedicle (Kierdorf &amp; Kierdorf, 1992, 2000, 2001; Li et al. 2005). This tissue is derived from antlerogenic periosteum, which has convincingly been shown to be the origin of the pedicle and primary antlers (Hartwig, 1974; Goss &amp; Powel, 1985; Kierdorf &amp; Kierdorf, 2001).

PTHrP, acting through the PPR, is likely to play a role as both are present in osteoblasts at sites of endochondral and intramembranous bone formation. By contrast, we have only found IHH in osteoblasts in the midshaft of the antler, not at the periphery, which suggests a specific role in endochondral bone growth, consistent with the findings of knock-out studies in mice (St-Jacques et al. 1999). IHH mRNA has also been localized in antler cartilage and bone by in situ hybridization, following its identification in a cDNA library (Lord et al. 2004). TGFβ-1 is also present in antler osteoblasts (Price et al. 2004). Another molecule that is likely to regulate bone formation in antlers is RA given that it is found at relatively high levels in antler bone and RALDH2 is localized in osteoblast progenitors in antler cartilage as well as in more differentiated osteoblasts.

The hunt for novel ‘antler factors’ has been going on for a number of years; it started in the 1990s with the generation of a cDNA library by Mundy and colleagues (Mundy, 2001) who were trying to identify novel bone anabolic agents. More recently, Lord et al. (2004) generated a large database of genes present in regenerating antlers and the first proteomic analysis of red deer antler has been reported (Park et al. 2004). These studies provide an invaluable resource, inform us of ‘what is there’ and lead to hypothesis-driven research. However, it is very likely that novel molecular pathways may not be uncovered in antlers. In our view the challenge lies instead in understanding the way that different signalling pathways interact, both with each other and with their local and systemic environment, to regenerate a structure as large and complex as an antler</context>

This region of the antler has been variously described by different authors (our group is also guilty of this), and the descriptors include ‘reserve mesenchyme’, ‘hyperplastic perichondrium’, ‘cellular periosteum’ and ‘mesenchyme’. For consistency we now describe this as ‘mesenchyme’ or ‘mesenchymal growth zone’ because cells in this region, like cells in this region of the primary antler, are actively dividing (Matich et al. 2003; Faucheux et al. 2004). In culture these cells proliferate rapidly as monolayers and synthesize type I but not type II collagen (our unpublished observations), and this reflects their in vivo phenotype (Price et al. 1996). However, unlike mesenchymal cells from the developing limb, they cannot be cultured as micromasses; they spread out to form monolayers and chondrogenesis is not initiated. Compared with cells in more proximal regions of the antler, cells in this region express only low levels of alkaline phosphatase and this reflects their undifferentiated state (Price et al. 1994; Price, 2</context>

In recent years our group and others have made some progress in identifying the local factors that may play a role. Several years ago it was first shown that their proliferation in vitro is stimulated by IGF-I and IGF-II and IGF receptors are present in this region of the antler tip in vivo (Price et al. 1994; Sadighi et al. 1994). Furthermore, IGF-I and IGF-II were identified in a screen of antler extracts undertaken some years ago (Mundy et al. 2001). This is consistent with the hypothesis that IGF-I is likely to be the ‘antler growth stimulus’. We have found that FGF2 also stimulates proliferation of mesenchymal cells from regenerating antlers (Price, 2005), although we have not yet tried immunolocalizing it in regenerating antlers. Members of the FGF family and their receptors have also been identified in the primary antler.

All of the molecules discussed above have been shown to regulate osteoblast function in other species (Grigoriadis et al. 1986; Choong et al. 1993; Oliva et al. 1993; Slootweg et al. 1996; Park et al. 1997; St-Jacques et al. 1999; Kobayashi et al. 2002). What is clear from the above is that the factors so far identified as being involved in antler regeneration have multiple functions. For example, both RA and PTHrP regulate chondrocyte, osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation. Our knowledge of the pathways involved remains in its infancy, but what is becoming apparent is that nature is conservative and that during antler regeneration a number of developmental pathways are recapitulated. In fact, studies in a diverse range of models are beginning to show pleiotropic functions for known genetic</context>

Recently, Kierdorf et al. (2004) described in detail the structure of the antler of castrated fallow deer and presented evidence to suggest that these protuberances (Fig. 6C) are in fact benign tumour growths with comparable histological changes to osteomas. Roe deer also develop large benign tumours on castrated antlers in which intradermal bone has been observed. The link between regeneration and cancer was highlighted in a review by Brockes (1998), and led us to suggest previously (Price &amp; Allen, 2004) that castrated antlers develop tumour-like structures because a mechanism has evolved in deer whereby sex steroids (acting directly or indirectly) normally limit cell cycle progression in antler progenitor cells. It is the remarkable capacity for growth and self-renewal of antler progenitor cells that underpins the capacity of antlers to regenerate, but this has a potential downside: an increased risk of transformation. By contrast, lower organisms such as the newt have evolved a system whereby their cells can have an extended lifespan (and thus sustain regeneration) yet remain remarkably res</context>

There are several lines of evidence to suggest that retinoic acid (RA) is also likely to play a role during the early stages of regeneration: the RA-synthesizing enzyme RALDH2 is synthesized in the early antler and in situ hybridization studies have also shown that RARα, RABβ and RXRβ receptors are also expressed, although they are not each present in every cell type. For example, RARβ is specifically expressed in cells at sites of cartilage/bone formation in more proximal regions (Price &amp; Allen, 2004). This demonstrates that the early antler bud is not a uniform structure and that, like PTHrP, RA may have multiple functions. Another question in antler biology pertains to the source of cells which give rise to the regenerating antler Wislocki and Goss were of the view that migrating cells from the dermis of the pedicle were the source (Wislocki, 1943; Goss, 1972, 1984, 1995). However, a number of workers in this field currently take the view that regenerating antlers are derived mainly from a population of progenitor cells in the periosteum of the pedicle (Kierdorf &amp; Kierdorf, 1992, 2000, 2</context>

However, it is very likely that novel molecular pathways may not be uncovered in antlers. In our view the challenge lies instead in understanding the way that different signalling pathways interact, both with each other and with their local and systemic environment, to regenerate a structure as large and complex as an antler. Dissection of the function of these pathways requires the manipulation of gene expression in vivo and we have preliminary data to show that biolistic particle transfer can be used to transfect cells in the blastema (Price &amp; Allen, 2004). However, retroviral/adenoviral approaches may also prove to be useful tools for studying gene function. Conclusions Deer antlers are not only spectacular creations of the natural world but also provide us with a unique model for regeneration research (although the limitations of using a large semi-wild animal with a seasonal pattern of regeneration and limited potential for genetic manipulation should not be underestimated). Regeneration of antlers is regulated by environmental and systemic cues, rather than by injury or amputation, and recent evidence suggests that it probably involves stem</context>

Because antler regeneration takes place at a time when deer reproductive organs are inactive it was proposed many years ago that there must also be a non-gonadal factor involved and this was named ‘antler growth stimulus’ (AGS) (Wislocki, 1943). IGF-I synthesized in the liver is the most likely candidate as IGF-I concentrations are high during the period of rapid antler growth (Suttie et al. 1985), there are IGF receptors in the antler’s growing tip (Elliott et al. 1992, 1993) and IGFs promote proliferation of antler cells (Price et al. 1994; Sadighi et al. 1994). Changes in concentrations of other hormones are associated with the antler growth cycle, including 1,25(OH)2D3 (Van der Eems et al. 1988; Sempere et al. 1989), thyroid hormones (Shi &amp; Barrell, 1994), cortisol (Bubenik et al. 1975a; Suttie et al. 1995) and prolactin (Sempere et al. 1983; Suttie et al. 1984), although their function remains poorly understood. Antler growth places an enormous demand for mineral on the skeleton (sufficient mineral is needed to enable a 30-kg bone to grow in ∼3 months), and to meet this demand cyclical reversible osteoporosis occurs at other skeletal sites (Buben</context>

In recent years our group and others have made some progress in identifying the local factors that may play a role. Several years ago it was first shown that their proliferation in vitro is stimulated by IGF-I and IGF-II and IGF receptors are present in this region of the antler tip in vivo (Price et al. 1994; Sadighi et al. 1994). Furthermore, IGF-I and IGF-II were identified in a screen of antler extracts undertaken some years ago (Mundy et al. 2001). This is consistent with the hypothesis that IGF-I is likely to be the ‘antler growth stimulus’. We have found that FGF2 also stimulates proliferation of mesenchymal cells from regenerating antlers (Price, 2005), although we have not yet tried immunolocalizing it in regenerating antlers. Members of the FGF family and their receptors have also been identified in the primary antler. A proteome analysis of red deer antler has been recently undertaken but surprisingly neithe</context>

This specialized periosteum (Fig. 2B) was originally described as ‘antlerogenic periosteum’ (AP) by Richard Goss (Goss &amp; Powel, 1985). The AP contains specific binding sites for testosterone (Li &amp; Suttie, 1998) although testosterone does not appear to have direct effects on cultured AP cells whereas IGF-I stimulates their proliferation (Li et al. 1999; Sadighi et al. 2001). Trabecular bone is then formed beneath the periosteum and a pedicle develops (Sempere et al. 1983; Suttie et al. 1984, 1988, 1991). Normally the antlerogenic periosteum of female deer remains quiescent because the hormonal requirements necessary for pedicle formation are not present. However, female deer can be induced to form pedicles if injected with androgens (Kierdorf et al. 1995). Li &amp; Suttie (1994) have undertaken detailed histological analyses of pedicle formation and have identified four ossification stages.

Immediately after the old antlers have been cast a raised ‘swollen’ ring of skin surrounds the distal end of the pedicle (Fig. 7A). This has a ‘shiny’ surface, characteristic of antler velvet skin. Within hours, the epidermis, known as ‘wound epithelium’, starts to migrate across the exposed surface of the pedicle bone and covers a mass of cells within loosely packed extracellular matrix tissue (Fig. 8A). These cells have not been well characterized; for example, it is not known whether they express similar markers to cells in the newt blastema. Li et al. (2004) describe the tissue in the centre of the pedicle as granulation tissue. However, we have shown that as early as 4 days after casting a significant proportion of cells stain positive for PTHrP (Faucheux et al. 2004), which leads us to assume that these are of mesenchymal origin. By days 9–10, epithelialization is complete and a number of zones can be distinguished histologically at anterior and posterior sites on the pedicle that mark the position where future antler branches will develop (Figs 7E and 8).

This, together with evidence that antler regeneration may not involve reversal of the differentiated state, has recently led Li et al. (2004, 2005) to conclude that antler regeneration is not blastema-based. These authors define a blastema as being ‘formed from the de-differentiation of all cell lineages on the immediate amputation plane’ (Li et al. 2005). However, we would argue that the key issue is whether the undifferentiated cells in a blastema can regenerate a lost part, not whether they are formed by de-differentiation. For example, the regenerating tail of Xenopus involves formation of a structure that is generally described as a blastema, although there is no evidence that it forms by de-differentiation (Slack et al. 2004).

It is also possible to distinguish that there is a distal region of non-mineralized cartilage whereas more proximally deposition of mineral takes place (Price et al. 1996). The vascularization of antler cartilage is the most striking difference between its anatomy and that of other hyaline cartilages. This abundant blood supply is required to meet the high metabolic demands imposed by rapid tissue regeneration. That the antler provides a valuable model for the study of angiogenesis was proposed recently by Clark et al. (2004), who have identified VEGF and the VEGF receptor in regenerating antler tissues. Histologically, the boundary between mesenchyme and the zone of chondroprogenitors is not distinct in longitudinal sections, but is a region where cells start to become arranged into columns between which there are vascular spaces (Fig. 9F). Previously we have described this as a ‘zone of transition’ because cells at this site are at different stages of differentiation along the chondrocyte lineage (Price et al. 1996). Type IIA collagen mRNA identifies chondroprogenitors in the developing skeleton (Sandell et al. </context>

At the same time intramembranous ossification takes place around the antler shaft (Fig. 9J) and although we have not studied ALP expression at this site, osteocalcin can be immunolocalized in osteoblasts beneath the periosteum (Allen et al. 2002). To date, our knowledge of the factors that may specifically regulate osteogenesis in regenerating antlers is derived from descriptive studies, although culturing these cells from explants of antler bone is straightforward and so there is great potential for further work in this area. As discussed recently by Kierdorf &amp; Kierdorf (2004), the rapid rate of antler bone growth makes it an excellent model for investigating osteogenesis. PTHrP, acting through the PPR, is likely to play a role as both are present in osteoblasts at sites of endochondral and intramembranous bone formation. By contrast, we have only found IHH in osteoblasts in the midshaft of the antler, not at the periphery, which suggests a specific role in endochondral bone growth, consistent with the findings of knock-out studies in mice (St-Jacques et al. 1999).

In fact, studies in a diverse range of models are beginning to show pleiotropic functions for known genetic pathways in the context of regeneration (Sanchez Alvarado, 2004). The hunt for novel ‘antler factors’ has been going on for a number of years; it started in the 1990s with the generation of a cDNA library by Mundy and colleagues (Mundy, 2001) who were trying to identify novel bone anabolic agents. More recently, Lord et al. (2004) generated a large database of genes present in regenerating antlers and the first proteomic analysis of red deer antler has been reported (Park et al. 2004). These studies provide an invaluable resource, inform us of ‘what is there’ and lead to hypothesis-driven research.

Histologically, the boundary between mesenchyme and the zone of chondroprogenitors is not distinct in longitudinal sections, but is a region where cells start to become arranged into columns between which there are vascular spaces (Fig. 9F). Previously we have described this as a ‘zone of transition’ because cells at this site are at different stages of differentiation along the chondrocyte lineage (Price et al. 1996). Type IIA collagen mRNA identifies chondroprogenitors in the developing skeleton (Sandell et al. 1994) and this isoform is expressed in the distal antler cartilage whereas type IIB collagen mRNA and protein are expressed throughout the cartilage (Price et al. 1996). Type IIA collagen is not expressed in growth plate cartilage (Sandell et al. 1994), another reason why it is difficult to compare directly the process of endochondral ossification in a long bone with that in antlers. Neither is type I collagen found in the growth plate, whereas it is expressed by antler cells in the ‘transition zone’. Yet another difference between the matrix of antler and mammalian growth plate cartilage is the di</context>

As discussed recently by Kierdorf &amp; Kierdorf (2004), the rapid rate of antler bone growth makes it an excellent model for investigating osteogenesis. PTHrP, acting through the PPR, is likely to play a role as both are present in osteoblasts at sites of endochondral and intramembranous bone formation. By contrast, we have only found IHH in osteoblasts in the midshaft of the antler, not at the periphery, which suggests a specific role in endochondral bone growth, consistent with the findings of knock-out studies in mice (St-Jacques et al. 1999). IHH mRNA has also been localized in antler cartilage and bone by in situ hybridization, following its identification in a cDNA library (Lord et al. 2004). TGFβ-1 is also present in antler osteoblasts (Price et al. 2004). Another molecule that is likely to regulate bone formation in antlers is RA given that it is found at relatively high levels in antler bone and RALDH2 is localized in osteoblast progenitors in antler cartilage as well as in more differentiated osteoblasts. The effects of RA on osteoblast lineage cells may be mediated by the RARα receptor because it is expressed in perivascul</context>

Cartilage and bone resorption The growth of antlers, like that of other rapidly developing bones, requires extensive remodelling of cartilage and bone and thus is dependent on the local formation of osteoclasts from circulating mononuclear progenitors. In addition to columns of chondrocytes and vascular spaces, antler cartilage contains perivascular tissue (Fig. 9F,G) and this has been identified as a site where cells of the osteoclast lineage differentiate (Faucheux, 1999; Faucheux et al. 2002; Szuwart et al. 2002). When digests are obtained from antler cartilage for in vitro studies this includes a fraction of osteoclast progenitors because cells with the phenotypic characteristics of mammalian osteoclasts will differentiate in micromass cultures of chondrocytes under the appropriate conditions (Faucheux, 1999). This system is now used routinely in our laboratory to study the mechanisms that regulate antler osteoclast function. Factors that will induce antler osteoclastogenesis in vitro include PTHrP, RANKL, M-CSF and RA (Allen et al. 2000; Faucheux et al. 2002). Because sex steroids are important regu</context>

The rapid growth of antlers occurs during the early summer when there is a plentiful food supply and stags live sedentary lives while ‘testosterone depleted’ (Goss, 1983). Because antler regeneration takes place at a time when deer reproductive organs are inactive it was proposed many years ago that there must also be a non-gonadal factor involved and this was named ‘antler growth stimulus’ (AGS) (Wislocki, 1943). IGF-I synthesized in the liver is the most likely candidate as IGF-I concentrations are high during the period of rapid antler growth (Suttie et al. 1985), there are IGF receptors in the antler’s growing tip (Elliott et al. 1992, 1993) and IGFs promote proliferation of antler cells (Price et al. 1994; Sadighi et al. 1994). Changes in concentrations of other hormones are associated with the antler growth cycle, including 1,25(OH)2D3 (Van der Eems et al. 1988; Sempere et al. 1989), thyroid hormones (Shi &amp; Barrell, 1994), cortisol (Bubenik et al. 1975a; Suttie et al. 1995) and prolactin (Semper</context>

For example, RARβ is specifically expressed in cells at sites of cartilage/bone formation in more proximal regions (Price &amp; Allen, 2004). This demonstrates that the early antler bud is not a uniform structure and that, like PTHrP, RA may have multiple functions. Another question in antler biology pertains to the source of cells which give rise to the regenerating antler Wislocki and Goss were of the view that migrating cells from the dermis of the pedicle were the source (Wislocki, 1943; Goss, 1972, 1984, 1995). However, a number of workers in this field currently take the view that regenerating antlers are derived mainly from a population of progenitor cells in the periosteum of the pedicle (Kierdorf &amp; Kierdorf, 1992, 2000, 2001; Li et al. 2005). This tissue is derived from antlerogenic periosteum, which has convincingly been shown to be the origin of the pedicle and primary antlers (Hartwig, 1974; Goss &amp; Powel, 1985; Kierdorf &amp; Kierdorf, 2001). Li et al. (2005) concluded from their histological studies that antler regeneration is stem cell based with the periosteum being t</context>
