increasing throughout the United States. In 2003, more than 1 million people were
diagnosed with nonmelanoma skin cancers and 54,000 with melanoma (American Cancer
Society, 2003). Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure is a key skin cancer risk
factor (Elwood, 1993; Friedman, Rigel, Berson, &amp; Rivers, 1991; Marks, 1995;
Singletary &amp; Balch, 1991), and outdoor recreational settings such as zoological
parks, where numerous visitors typically are exposed to long bouts of solar UVR, are
high-risk environments. In the United States, zoos alone are visited by more than
100 million people annually (American Zoo and Aquarium Association, 2003). In 1998,
we surveyed U.S. zoos accredited by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA)
to evaluate their current sun safety practices for visitors (Talosig et<component

that although only 5% of the zoos offered any sun safety-related advice or
activities to visitors, the majority indicated they would be interested in providing
sun safety activities in the future. The current study compared two strategies for
disseminating sun safety activities to U.S. zoos. Much of the current thinking about
dissemination began with the work of Everett Rogers and his colleagues; this
framework provided general guidance for developing our dissemination strategies.
According to Rogers (1983, 1995; Rogers &amp; Shoemaker, 1971), technological and
behavioral innovations are often experimented with and adopted by certain
individuals in a community who are seen by "late adopters" as trendsetters. The
process of diffusion of innovations includes knowledge acquisition, persuasion,
decision, and reinforcement (Rogers, 1983). Once success is achieved with a smaller
group of early adopters, dissemination to other organizations, communities, and
regions should prove much easier. The change agent should aim for a critical mass of
individuals to adopt a single or limited number of changes in order to make a
large-scale impact. Initially, diffusion theory emphasized how workers adopted
innovations (Rogers, 1983). Subsequently, researchers acknowledged that individuals
often adopt innovations as members of organizations and that such individuals seldom
adopt an innovation until it is first accepted by the organization (Steckler,
Goodman, &amp; Kegler, 2002). Diffusion within and dissemination between
organizations is a complex process, requiring consideration of multiple factors,
such as the organization's goals, authority structure, decision-making mechanisms,
rules, regulations, and informal norms. Diffusion may depend on involving multiple
entities, such as an organization's administrators, staff, and clientele (Parcel,
Perry, &amp; Taylor, 1990). To date, only a few studies have been published
describing controlled evaluations of dissemination strategies for health promotion
programs (Oldenburg, Sallis, Ffrench, &amp; Owen, 1999). Brink et al. (1995) used a
quasi-experimental two-group design to evaluate the dissemination of a tobacco
prevention program to Texas school districts. The dissemination strategies were
based on Rogers's (1983) diffusion of innovation model and Bandura's (1986) social-
cognitive theory. Opinion leaders were asked to introduce the program to their
school district using videotapes and print materials. Intervention school districts
and control districts (which received no information on the tobacco prevention
program) did not differ on readiness to adopt a tobacco prevention program. Similar
to the present study, three other studies have compared less intensive with more
intensive dissemination strategies. Cooke, Mattick, and Campbell (1999) disseminated
a smoking cessation program to antenatal clinics. They compared a mailing only with
a mailing plus personal contact from a program representative. Although the sample
was too small for statistical analysis ( N( 23), clinics in the intensive
dissemination group had adopted or were planning to adopt more of the program
components than those in the simple dissemination group. Lock and Kaner (2000)
compared mailing, telemarketing, and personal marketing strategies to disseminate a
brief alcohol intervention to general practitioners ( N(614). Personal marketing
(in-person contacts) were the most effective, but telemarketing was the most cost
effective. Schofield, Edwards, and Pearce (1997) compared two strategies for
disseminating a sun-protection policy kit to primary and secondary schools ( N(781).
They compared a mailed kit alone and a mailed kit plus staff development module
strategy. Statistically significant between-groups differences were found among
primary schools: 44% of schools that received the intensive dissemination strategy
adopted the sun-protection policies as compared with 21% of schools in the
mailing-only group. In sum, although the number of studies is small, the available
evidence suggests that relatively more (vs. less) intensive dissemination strategies
are more likely to increase adoption of a health promotion program by the recipient
organization. In the current study, the more intensive strategy that was evaluated
was based on tailoring. Health promotion specialists increasingly have used
interventions tailored specifically for individuals using information provided by
the individual or from existing records. These tailored interventions typically
consist of brochures, newsletters, and/or telephone counseling sessions. In a review
of the literature regarding tailored interventions, C. S. Skinner, Campbell, Rimer,
Curry, and Prochaska (1999) concluded that tailored materials and interventions were
superior to nontailored materials and interventions in the majority of studies. The
tailored materials were both more salient (read, remembered, and viewed as credible)
and more effective in promoting behavior change. In recent years, tailored materials
have been used in studies focusing on a variety of behaviors, such as mammography
screening (Champion et al., 2002; Lipkus, Rimer, Halabi, &amp; Strigo, 2000),
physical activity (Bull, Kreuter, &amp; Scharff, 1999; Clark et al., 2002), and
smoking cessation (Lipkus, Lyna, &amp; Rimer, 1999). In all of these studies the
recipient was an individual person. The present study is novel with respect to
tailoring materials to address the unique characteristics of individual
organizations rather than individual persons. Our research group developed the
Sunwise Stampede project to reduce UVR exposure by zoo visitors and employees. In
Phase 1, we developed an intervention package geared toward children and their
parents that aimed to reduce zoo visitors' solar UVR risk during the zoo visit. We
also developed an intervention component for zoo employees (although it was not
systematically evaluated, owing to limited resources). In 1999 we evaluated the zoo
visitor intervention package at the World-Famous San Diego Zoo and the San Diego
Wild Animal Park in a winter study and then replicated it in the summer. The two
sites served as intervention and control sites, respectively. Intervention
components, which were based on operant learning principles (B. F. Skinner, 1953),
social- cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986), and an ecological framework (Sallis &amp;
Owen, 2002), included sun safety tip sheets for parents, children's activities, a
variety of prompts, and discounted hats and sunscreen in zoo gift shops. The
majority of the content used animal adaptations to illustrate desirable sun safety
behaviors, such as elephants dusting their skin with dirt to prevent sunburn.
Results, reported in an earlier article (Mayer et al., 2001), indicated that the
intervention site showed significantly larger increases in the sales of both hats
(summer study only) and sunscreen (both studies) relative to the control site, and
in the winter study, hat use by children (as they exited the zoo) was significantly
higher at the intervention site. This article describes Phase 2 of the project,
whose goal was to encourage other zoos throughout the United States to implement at
least one strategy from the Sunwise Stampede menu. We packaged the materials
evaluated in Phase 1 (Mayer et al., 2001) and compared two dissemination strategies:
basic versus tailored. Zoos in the basic group received a binder of generic
materials, and zoos in the tailored group received a tailored binder and brief
telephone calls from project staff. We hypothesized that zoos receiving the tailored
package would be more likely to adopt the Sunwise Stampede program than those that
received generic materials.<component x="315.68" y="79.02" width="240.1"

in the dissemination phase was to encourage zoos to adopt at least one sun safety
strategy for zoo visitors and at least one for zoo employees. Inclusion criteria for
this study were that a zoo (a) was accredited by the AZA and (b) had completed our
baseline survey in 1998. Because the AZA was collaborating with us in recruiting
zoos and disseminating our program and would have credibility with zoos, the first
criterion was viewed as important. The second criterion was used to ensure that we
would be able to obtain outcome data for the zoos; four zoos (3%) had not responded
in the 1998 baseline survey after repeated attempts. The 126 zoos meeting the
inclusion criteria were stratified on two factors and randomly assigned to one of
two dissemination groups: basic and tailored, with 63 zoos in each. The
stratification factors were the estimated number of visitors per year, dichotomized
(500,000 or less vs. over 500,000) and region of country (i.e., Northeast,
Southeast, Plains, Midwest, Central Pacific, Southwest, and Northwest).<component

the 126 zoos was mailed an introductory letter and a binder consisting of
project-related materials. The package typically was addressed to the zoo's
education director. The basic group materials (a) explained the Sunwise Stampede
goals and strategies, (b) described the features and benefits of participating, (c)
summarized data from San Diego Zoo's experience with the program, (d) provided
information about each element or strategy of the program, and (e) provided our
contact information (should the recipient have questions or comments). We also
provided samples and masters related to the intervention strategies, including, for
example, camera-ready copies of sunscreen application reminders for restrooms,
camera-ready point-of-purchase signs for gift shops, and a script for an employee
sun safety in-service presentation. Zoos in the tailored group received content
similar to that described above, with the following modifications: (a) UVR and skin
cancer data were provided for the state; (b) existing sun protective features of the
zoo were highlighted (e.g., shade trees or other shade structures); (c) descriptions
for each element of the program were tailored according to an individual zoo's
resources (e.g., animal adaptations for only the animals in that zoo were provided);
(d) irrelevant information was deleted (e.g., if a zoo did not have a gift shop, the
gift shop incentive element was not described); and (e) photographs of various
locations in the zoo were included to demonstrate implementation opportunities by
digitally superimposing an animal adaptation fact over one of the animal exhibits.
Prior to creating the materials, project staff had visited each of the zoos in the
tailored group to evaluate relevant aspects of their environments and obtain digital
photographs. The information obtained during the site visits enabled us to tailor
the materials appropriately. Additionally, the Sunwise Stampede representative who
had site visited a particular zoo phoned the education director twice- once
approximately 10 working days after the binder was mailed and again around the
middle of the first summer. Each call lasted 5 min or less. The objectives of the
calls were to inquire whether the education directors had reviewed the materials,
offer advice or recommendations (as needed) regarding which activities may be the
most feasible for their zoo, and praise any plans they had made to offer activities.
Zoos in both groups were informed via the binder and an e-mail message about two
Sunwise Stampede Web sites. The zoo staff site contained content similar to the
basic group's binder content and had downloadable materials
(http://www.foundation.sdsu.edu/sunwisestaff). The zoo visitor site targeted zoo
visitors irrespective of their geographic location and presented tips for a sunwise
visit and sunwise activities, animal facts, and a Web game
(http://www.foundation.sdsu.edu/sunwisestampede). Following the short-term survey,
which was conducted several months after the distribution of the initial materials
described above but prior to the long-term survey, additional materials were mailed.
New materials included additional children's activities, Spanish language
translations of previous visitor-oriented materials, and a hippopotamus-person sun
safety adaptation poster. These supplemental materials did not differ by group; no
special tailoring for individual zoos occurred.<component x="315.68" y="79.16"

differences between the two groups with respect to annual number of zoo visitors and

activities to visitors, the interaction effect reflects the differential pattern of
differences in percentages between tailored and basic groups seen short term versus
long term. This is evident in Table 2. It appears that the tailored group had an
initial higher percentage of zoos offering visitor activities, which stayed
relatively constant over time (with a slight, nonstatistically significant decay),
whereas the basic group had a near doubling of percentages over time. As can be seen

selling sunscreen and selling hats were not used as activities when computing our
outcome variables, because they could not be directly linked to our intervention.
Exposure to the materials. As noted, all 126 zoos initially were mailed binders with
descriptions of the program and activities, along with ready-to-use materials. The
proportions of respondents in the tailored and basic groups reporting they had read
at least some of the binder were approximately 93% and 90%, respectively. The
proportions in these groups reporting they had read more than half of the binder
were 59% and 42%, respectively. Of those who reported having read at least some of

impact of tailored materials plus follow-up calls on a zoo's likelihood of
implementing sun safety activities were mixed. Specifically, the more intensive
intervention appeared to increase the likelihood that a zoo would offer activities
for visitors the summer that immediately followed initial program dissemination, but
this increase was not found for the zoo employee activity. The next summer, zoos in
the basic group had levels of activities for both visitors and staff that were
comparable to the tailored group's levels. In general, between Summers 1 and 2 the
levels decreased slightly in the tailored group and increased in the basic group.
The intervention strategies that were used for each group differed only during the
period prior to the short-term survey; in Year 2 of the program, both groups
received the same (nontailored) materials, and neither group received phone calls.
Thus, given our design, it is not possible to determine whether (a) providing
tailored materials plus phone calls over a longer interval would have maintained
higher levels of zoo visitor activities (relative to providing generic materials);
(b) providing tailored materials plus calls simply may have prompted those zoos to
offer visitor activities earlier; or (c) the increase between the two summers in the
level of activities at basic group zoos was due to a delayed reaction to the initial
intervention or due to the receipt of additional materials and contacts during Year
2 of the intervention. Another key finding was that 31% (39/126) of participating
zoos had implemented at least one visitor activity by the first summer, and this
proportion was 33% (41/126) the following summer. Although our design did not
include a no-treatment control group, the activities that we assessed were specific
to the Sunwise Stampede program. Consequently, we believe it is unlikely that zoos
would have implemented these activities in the absence of our program. Additionally,
the base rates of any sun safety activities for zoo visitors had been negligible in
our earlier national survey (Talosig et al., 2000). The data from the current study
suggest that our menu of activities, which had been developed at one zoo, was
attractive to a respectable number of other zoos. The development of the initial
Sunwise Stampede activities tested in San Diego (Mayer et al., 2001), as well as the
dissemination strategies and materials, was informed by the results of extensive
formative evaluation with zoo and AZA personnel. Although no formal cost analyses
were performed, the site visits to the tailored group zoos required more resources
than typically would be available. To reduce costs, information about zoo
characteristics could be obtained via phone interviews of relevant zoo personnel,
and digital photographs (of key exhibits, etc.) could be provided by zoo staff or
volunteers. The majority of respondents in both groups reported having read at least
some of the binder and finding it useful. In contrast, very few accessed the zoo
staff Web site. However, this likely occurred because (a) many zoos did not have
computer resources at that time, and (b) the Web site content mirrored the content
of the binder, and the binder was introduced first. We also were encouraged by the
contacts we received about Sunwise Stampede from those who were not study
participants; most of these contacts were stimulated by people accessing the zoo
visitor Web site. The number of contacts we received likely underestimates the
degree of dissemination that occurred naturally. Methodological strengths include
(a) inclusion of nearly all AZA-accredited zoos in the sample, (b) high response
rates in both surveys, and (c) random assignment to groups using number of visitors
and geographical region as stratification factors. A key methodological weakness is
that all outcomes were based on verbal report. We did not attempt to validate the
data by directly observing whether the activities were being offered or by
interviewing multiple staff at each zoo. Thus, it is possible that because of social
demand or other biases, respondents overestimated the number of activities their zoo
adopted; this bias may have been stronger in the tailored group. Second, as noted
earlier, a study design in which the tailored group received tailoring in Year 2 of
the intervention (as well as in Year 1) would have allowed clearer interpretations
of the long-term group comparisons. Furthermore, the tailored group received two
phone calls, whereas the basic group received no calls. Thus, direct comparisons
cannot be made between tailored versus generic materials per se. Finally, we did not
measure the impact of the Sunwise Stampede activities (at zoos that implemented
them) on visitor and employee behaviors; this type of evaluation was beyond the
project's scope and budget. Our decision to compare two dissemination strategies of
different intensities rather than compare one strategy to no strategy (i.e., a true
control group) was influenced by our goal to expose as many AZA zoos as possible to
the Sunwise Stampede program. Only two conditions were compared because of our
sample size constraints. Our decision to evaluate the additive impact of tailoring
was based, in part, on (a) the diffusion criteria of "adoptability," presuming that
a tailored intervention would enhance adoptability by making it easier to both
"sell" and implement within the organization; (b) the success of interventions
tailored to individuals in improving health outcomes (C. S. Skinner et al., 1999);
and (c) the plethora of studies within the "two paths to persuasion" literature
(Chaiken, 1987; Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986a, 1986b) showing that increased personal
relevance of communication (via tailoring) heightens persuasion. We had reasoned
that tailored materials would be more persuasive, resulting in a higher likelihood
of a decision by key zoo personnel to adopt Sunwise Stampede activities. This was
confirmed by the Year 1 finding that zoos in the tailored condition were
significantly more likely to adopt the intervention. The finding that tailoring
encouraged greater rates of adoption, but not maintenance of the intervention in
Year 2, may mean that zoo program implementers did not realize significant
additional benefits from implementing the tailored intervention. Given the
importance of maintenance in the diffusion process, the numerous factors that could
account for this phenomenon should be explored in future process and impact
evaluation studies. Initially in brainstorming our interventions, we considered (a)
maximizing the cross-talk among zoos directly and via AZA communications and (b)
soliciting national, mass-media publicity about the program. These strategies likely
would have enhanced the adoption process in both groups through increasing shared
knowledge, mutual persuasion, or reinforcing adopters for already implementing part
or all of the intervention (Rogers, 1983, 1995). However, we ruled them out because
they may have caused contamination between the study groups. Thus, we potentially
weakened our intervention in an attempt to strengthen a study design typically used
in efficacy and effectiveness research. Ironically, the "contamination" and
"cross-talk" one seeks to reduce in controlled efficacy and effectiveness trials are
the very goals of the dissemination process. This catch-22 indicates that different
paradigms (as well as different criteria for funding and publication) will be needed
for dissemination intervention research if we wish to develop the most effective
strategies. In summary, the combination of tailoring printed dissemination materials
and providing two brief phone contacts had a marginally significant short-term
impact (relative to generic print materials) on a zoo's likelihood of offering a sun
safety activity to visitors; this effect was not found for the zoo employee
activity. However, during the subsequent summer, the proportion of basic group zoos
offering visitor activities had increased substantially, and there were no
between-group differences. By the second summer, one third of all participant zoos
were offering at least one Sunwise Stampede visitor activity. We conclude that the
mailed, print materials that targeted the "typical" zoo environment were sufficient
for a diffusion of this innovation to occur, namely, to encourage a moderately high
number of zoos to offer sun safety activities to their visitors. Additional research
is needed to address systematically whether a larger "dose" or longer duration of
tailoring would be more effective (and cost effective) for promoting long-term
implementation. Moreover, the impact on visitor and employee behavior due to
implementing Sunwise Stampede activities should be evaluated across multiple zoos to
replicate our initial effectiveness study (Mayer et al., 2001). The number of
activities that is sufficient to modify sun safety behavior, and which activities
are the most powerful, also should be addressed. Finally, as noted earlier, we warn
investigators to avoid the design-hygiene trap we succumbed to. Rather, we would
endorse innovative designs for evaluating dissemination strategies that build on the
cross-talk and diffusion that occur naturally within and across zoos.<component

that although only 5% of the zoos offered any sun safety-related advice or
activities to visitors, the majority indicated they would be interested in providing
sun safety activities in the future. The current study compared two strategies for
disseminating sun safety activities to U.S. zoos. Much of the current thinking about
dissemination began with the work of Everett Rogers and his colleagues; this
framework provided general guidance for developing our dissemination strategies.
According to Rogers (1983, 1995; Rogers &amp; Shoemaker, 1971), technological and
behavioral innovations are often experimented with and adopted by certain
individuals in a community who are seen by "late adopters" as trendsetters. The
process of diffusion of innovations includes knowledge acquisition, persuasion,
decision, and reinforcement (Rogers, 1983). Once success is achieved with a smaller
group of early adopters, dissemination to other organizations, communities, and
regions should prove much easier. The change agent should aim for a critical mass of
individuals to adopt a single or limited number of changes in order to make a
large-scale impact. Initially, diffusion theory emphasized how workers adopted
innovations (Rogers, 1983). Subsequently, researchers acknowledged that individuals
often adopt innovations as members of organizations and that such individuals seldom
adopt an innovation until it is first accepted by the organization (Steckler,
Goodman, &amp; Kegler, 2002). Diffusion within and dissemination between
organizations is a complex process, requiring consideration of multiple factors,
such as the organization's goals, authority structure, decision-making mechanisms,
rules, regulations, and informal norms. Diffusion may depend on involving multiple
entities, such as an organization's administrators, staff, and clientele (Parcel,
Perry, &amp; Taylor, 1990). To date, only a few studies have been published
describing controlled evaluations of dissemination strategies for health promotion
programs (Oldenburg, Sallis, Ffrench, &amp; Owen, 1999). Brink et al. (1995) used a
quasi-experimental two-group design to evaluate the dissemination of a tobacco
prevention program to Texas school districts. The dissemination strategies were
based on Rogers's (1983) diffusion of innovation model and Bandura's (1986) social-
cognitive theory. Opinion leaders were asked to introduce the program to their
school district using videotapes and print materials. Intervention school districts
and control districts (which received no information on the tobacco prevention
program) did not differ on readiness to adopt a tobacco prevention program. Similar
to the present study, three other studies have compared less intensive with more
intensive dissemination strategies. Cooke, Mattick, and Campbell (1999) disseminated
a smoking cessation program to antenatal clinics. They compared a mailing only with
a mailing plus personal contact from a program representative. Although the sample
was too small for statistical analysis ( N( 23), clinics in the intensive
dissemination group had adopted or were planning to adopt more of the program
components than those in the simple dissemination group. Lock and Kaner (2000)
compared mailing, telemarketing, and personal marketing strategies to disseminate a
brief alcohol intervention to general practitioners ( N(614). Personal marketing
(in-person contacts) were the most effective, but telemarketing was the most cost
effective. Schofield, Edwards, and Pearce (1997) compared two strategies for
disseminating a sun-protection policy kit to primary and secondary schools ( N(781).
They compared a mailed kit alone and a mailed kit plus staff development module
strategy. Statistically significant between-groups differences were found among
primary schools: 44% of schools that received the intensive dissemination strategy
adopted the sun-protection policies as compared with 21% of schools in the
mailing-only group. In sum, although the number of studies is small, the available
evidence suggests that relatively more (vs. less) intensive dissemination strategies
are more likely to increase adoption of a health promotion program by the recipient
organization. In the current study, the more intensive strategy that was evaluated
was based on tailoring. Health promotion specialists increasingly have used
interventions tailored specifically for individuals using information provided by
the individual or from existing records. These tailored interventions typically
consist of brochures, newsletters, and/or telephone counseling sessions. In a review
of the literature regarding tailored interventions, C. S. Skinner, Campbell, Rimer,
Curry, and Prochaska (1999) concluded that tailored materials and interventions were
superior to nontailored materials and interventions in the majority of studies. The
tailored materials were both more salient (read, remembered, and viewed as credible)
and more effective in promoting behavior change. In recent years, tailored materials
have been used in studies focusing on a variety of behaviors, such as mammography
screening (Champion et al., 2002; Lipkus, Rimer, Halabi, &amp; Strigo, 2000),
physical activity (Bull, Kreuter, &amp; Scharff, 1999; Clark et al., 2002), and
smoking cessation (Lipkus, Lyna, &amp; Rimer, 1999). In all of these studies the
recipient was an individual person. The present study is novel with respect to
tailoring materials to address the unique characteristics of individual
organizations rather than individual persons. Our research group developed the
Sunwise Stampede project to reduce UVR exposure by zoo visitors and employees. In
Phase 1, we developed an intervention package geared toward children and their
parents that aimed to reduce zoo visitors' solar UVR risk during the zoo visit. We
also developed an intervention component for zoo employees (although it was not
systematically evaluated, owing to limited resources). In 1999 we evaluated the zoo
visitor intervention package at the World-Famous San Diego Zoo and the San Diego
Wild Animal Park in a winter study and then replicated it in the summer. The two
sites served as intervention and control sites, respectively. Intervention
components, which were based on operant learning principles (B. F. Skinner, 1953),
social- cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986), and an ecological framework (Sallis &amp;
Owen, 2002), included sun safety tip sheets for parents, children's activities, a
variety of prompts, and discounted hats and sunscreen in zoo gift shops. The
majority of the content used animal adaptations to illustrate desirable sun safety
behaviors, such as elephants dusting their skin with dirt to prevent sunburn.
Results, reported in an earlier article (Mayer et al., 2001), indicated that the
intervention site showed significantly larger increases in the sales of both hats
(summer study only) and sunscreen (both studies) relative to the control site, and
in the winter study, hat use by children (as they exited the zoo) was significantly
higher at the intervention site. This article describes Phase 2 of the project,
whose goal was to encourage other zoos throughout the United States to implement at
least one strategy from the Sunwise Stampede menu. We packaged the materials
evaluated in Phase 1 (Mayer et al., 2001) and compared two dissemination strategies:
basic versus tailored. Zoos in the basic group received a binder of generic
materials, and zoos in the tailored group received a tailored binder and brief
telephone calls from project staff. We hypothesized that zoos receiving the tailored
package would be more likely to adopt the Sunwise Stampede program than those that
received generic materials.<component x="315.68" y="79.02" width="240.1"

in the dissemination phase was to encourage zoos to adopt at least one sun safety

this study were that a zoo (a) was accredited by the AZA and (b) had completed our
baseline survey in 1998. Because the AZA was collaborating with us in recruiting
zoos and disseminating our program and would have credibility with zoos, the first
criterion was viewed as important. The second criterion was used to ensure that we
would be able to obtain outcome data for the zoos; four zoos (3%) had not responded
in the 1998 baseline survey after repeated attempts. The 126 zoos meeting the
inclusion criteria were stratified on two factors and randomly assigned to one of
two dissemination groups: basic and tailored, with 63 zoos in each. The
stratification factors were the estimated number of visitors per year, dichotomized
(500,000 or less vs. over 500,000) and region of country (i.e., Northeast,

the 126 zoos was mailed an introductory letter and a binder consisting of
project-related materials. The package typically was addressed to the zoo's
education director. The basic group materials (a) explained the Sunwise Stampede
goals and strategies, (b) described the features and benefits of participating, (c)
summarized data from San Diego Zoo's experience with the program, (d) provided
information about each element or strategy of the program, and (e) provided our
contact information (should the recipient have questions or comments). We also
provided samples and masters related to the intervention strategies, including, for
example, camera-ready copies of sunscreen application reminders for restrooms,
camera-ready point-of-purchase signs for gift shops, and a script for an employee
sun safety in-service presentation. Zoos in the tailored group received content
similar to that described above, with the following modifications: (a) UVR and skin
cancer data were provided for the state; (b) existing sun protective features of the
zoo were highlighted (e.g., shade trees or other shade structures); (c) descriptions
for each element of the program were tailored according to an individual zoo's
resources (e.g., animal adaptations for only the animals in that zoo were provided);
(d) irrelevant information was deleted (e.g., if a zoo did not have a gift shop, the
gift shop incentive element was not described); and (e) photographs of various
locations in the zoo were included to demonstrate implementation opportunities by
digitally superimposing an animal adaptation fact over one of the animal exhibits.
Prior to creating the materials, project staff had visited each of the zoos in the
tailored group to evaluate relevant aspects of their environments and obtain digital
photographs. The information obtained during the site visits enabled us to tailor
the materials appropriately. Additionally, the Sunwise Stampede representative who
had site visited a particular zoo phoned the education director twice- once
approximately 10 working days after the binder was mailed and again around the
middle of the first summer. Each call lasted 5 min or less. The objectives of the
calls were to inquire whether the education directors had reviewed the materials,
offer advice or recommendations (as needed) regarding which activities may be the
most feasible for their zoo, and praise any plans they had made to offer activities.
Zoos in both groups were informed via the binder and an e-mail message about two
Sunwise Stampede Web sites. The zoo staff site contained content similar to the
basic group's binder content and had downloadable materials
(http://www.foundation.sdsu.edu/sunwisestaff). The zoo visitor site targeted zoo
visitors irrespective of their geographic location and presented tips for a sunwise
visit and sunwise activities, animal facts, and a Web game
(http://www.foundation.sdsu.edu/sunwisestampede). Following the short-term survey,
which was conducted several months after the distribution of the initial materials
described above but prior to the long-term survey, additional materials were mailed.
New materials included additional children's activities, Spanish language
translations of previous visitor-oriented materials, and a hippopotamus-person sun
safety adaptation poster. These supplemental materials did not differ by group; no
special tailoring for individual zoos occurred.<component x="315.68" y="79.16"

selling sunscreen and selling hats were not used as activities when computing our
outcome variables, because they could not be directly linked to our intervention.
Exposure to the materials. As noted, all 126 zoos initially were mailed binders with
descriptions of the program and activities, along with ready-to-use materials. The
proportions of respondents in the tailored and basic groups reporting they had read
at least some of the binder were approximately 93% and 90%, respectively. The
proportions in these groups reporting they had read more than half of the binder
were 59% and 42%, respectively. Of those who reported having read at least some of
the binder, the not distribution of usefulness ratings in the tailored group was
useful somewhat useful very useful 5%, 49%, and 45%. ( ( ( The distribution of
ratings for this variable for the basic group was 11%, 48%, and 41%, respectively.
Results of chi-square tests indicated that there were no statistically significant
associations between group assignment and (a) amount of binder read or (b)
perception of usefulness. The mailed version of the survey sent to tailored group

lateness="0.8571428571428571" reference_score="6.43">The results regarding the
impact of tailored materials plus follow-up calls on a zoo's likelihood of
implementing sun safety activities were mixed. Specifically, the more intensive
intervention appeared to increase the likelihood that a zoo would offer activities
for visitors the summer that immediately followed initial program dissemination, but
this increase was not found for the zoo employee activity. The next summer, zoos in
the basic group had levels of activities for both visitors and staff that were
comparable to the tailored group's levels. In general, between Summers 1 and 2 the
levels decreased slightly in the tailored group and increased in the basic group.
The intervention strategies that were used for each group differed only during the
period prior to the short-term survey; in Year 2 of the program, both groups
received the same (nontailored) materials, and neither group received phone calls.
Thus, given our design, it is not possible to determine whether (a) providing
tailored materials plus phone calls over a longer interval would have maintained
higher levels of zoo visitor activities (relative to providing generic materials);
(b) providing tailored materials plus calls simply may have prompted those zoos to
offer visitor activities earlier; or (c) the increase between the two summers in the
level of activities at basic group zoos was due to a delayed reaction to the initial
intervention or due to the receipt of additional materials and contacts during Year
2 of the intervention. Another key finding was that 31% (39/126) of participating
zoos had implemented at least one visitor activity by the first summer, and this
proportion was 33% (41/126) the following summer. Although our design did not
include a no-treatment control group, the activities that we assessed were specific
to the Sunwise Stampede program. Consequently, we believe it is unlikely that zoos
would have implemented these activities in the absence of our program. Additionally,
the base rates of any sun safety activities for zoo visitors had been negligible in
our earlier national survey (Talosig et al., 2000). The data from the current study
suggest that our menu of activities, which had been developed at one zoo, was
attractive to a respectable number of other zoos. The development of the initial
Sunwise Stampede activities tested in San Diego (Mayer et al., 2001), as well as the
dissemination strategies and materials, was informed by the results of extensive
formative evaluation with zoo and AZA personnel. Although no formal cost analyses
were performed, the site visits to the tailored group zoos required more resources
than typically would be available. To reduce costs, information about zoo
characteristics could be obtained via phone interviews of relevant zoo personnel,
and digital photographs (of key exhibits, etc.) could be provided by zoo staff or
volunteers. The majority of respondents in both groups reported having read at least
some of the binder and finding it useful. In contrast, very few accessed the zoo
staff Web site. However, this likely occurred because (a) many zoos did not have
computer resources at that time, and (b) the Web site content mirrored the content
of the binder, and the binder was introduced first. We also were encouraged by the
contacts we received about Sunwise Stampede from those who were not study
participants; most of these contacts were stimulated by people accessing the zoo
visitor Web site. The number of contacts we received likely underestimates the
degree of dissemination that occurred naturally. Methodological strengths include
(a) inclusion of nearly all AZA-accredited zoos in the sample, (b) high response
rates in both surveys, and (c) random assignment to groups using number of visitors
and geographical region as stratification factors. A key methodological weakness is
that all outcomes were based on verbal report. We did not attempt to validate the
data by directly observing whether the activities were being offered or by
interviewing multiple staff at each zoo. Thus, it is possible that because of social
demand or other biases, respondents overestimated the number of activities their zoo
adopted; this bias may have been stronger in the tailored group. Second, as noted
earlier, a study design in which the tailored group received tailoring in Year 2 of
the intervention (as well as in Year 1) would have allowed clearer interpretations
of the long-term group comparisons. Furthermore, the tailored group received two
phone calls, whereas the basic group received no calls. Thus, direct comparisons
cannot be made between tailored versus generic materials per se. Finally, we did not
measure the impact of the Sunwise Stampede activities (at zoos that implemented
them) on visitor and employee behaviors; this type of evaluation was beyond the
project's scope and budget. Our decision to compare two dissemination strategies of
different intensities rather than compare one strategy to no strategy (i.e., a true
control group) was influenced by our goal to expose as many AZA zoos as possible to
the Sunwise Stampede program. Only two conditions were compared because of our
sample size constraints. Our decision to evaluate the additive impact of tailoring
was based, in part, on (a) the diffusion criteria of "adoptability," presuming that
a tailored intervention would enhance adoptability by making it easier to both
"sell" and implement within the organization; (b) the success of interventions
tailored to individuals in improving health outcomes (C. S. Skinner et al., 1999);
and (c) the plethora of studies within the "two paths to persuasion" literature
(Chaiken, 1987; Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986a, 1986b) showing that increased personal
relevance of communication (via tailoring) heightens persuasion. We had reasoned
that tailored materials would be more persuasive, resulting in a higher likelihood
of a decision by key zoo personnel to adopt Sunwise Stampede activities. This was
confirmed by the Year 1 finding that zoos in the tailored condition were
significantly more likely to adopt the intervention. The finding that tailoring
encouraged greater rates of adoption, but not maintenance of the intervention in
Year 2, may mean that zoo program implementers did not realize significant
additional benefits from implementing the tailored intervention. Given the
importance of maintenance in the diffusion process, the numerous factors that could
account for this phenomenon should be explored in future process and impact
evaluation studies. Initially in brainstorming our interventions, we considered (a)
maximizing the cross-talk among zoos directly and via AZA communications and (b)
soliciting national, mass-media publicity about the program. These strategies likely
would have enhanced the adoption process in both groups through increasing shared
knowledge, mutual persuasion, or reinforcing adopters for already implementing part
or all of the intervention (Rogers, 1983, 1995). However, we ruled them out because
they may have caused contamination between the study groups. Thus, we potentially
weakened our intervention in an attempt to strengthen a study design typically used
in efficacy and effectiveness research. Ironically, the "contamination" and
"cross-talk" one seeks to reduce in controlled efficacy and effectiveness trials are
the very goals of the dissemination process. This catch-22 indicates that different
paradigms (as well as different criteria for funding and publication) will be needed
for dissemination intervention research if we wish to develop the most effective
strategies. In summary, the combination of tailoring printed dissemination materials
and providing two brief phone contacts had a marginally significant short-term
impact (relative to generic print materials) on a zoo's likelihood of offering a sun
safety activity to visitors; this effect was not found for the zoo employee
activity. However, during the subsequent summer, the proportion of basic group zoos
offering visitor activities had increased substantially, and there were no
between-group differences. By the second summer, one third of all participant zoos
were offering at least one Sunwise Stampede visitor activity. We conclude that the
mailed, print materials that targeted the "typical" zoo environment were sufficient
for a diffusion of this innovation to occur, namely, to encourage a moderately high
number of zoos to offer sun safety activities to their visitors. Additional research
is needed to address systematically whether a larger "dose" or longer duration of
tailoring would be more effective (and cost effective) for promoting long-term
implementation. Moreover, the impact on visitor and employee behavior due to
implementing Sunwise Stampede activities should be evaluated across multiple zoos to
replicate our initial effectiveness study (Mayer et al., 2001). The number of
activities that is sufficient to modify sun safety behavior, and which activities
are the most powerful, also should be addressed. Finally, as noted earlier, we warn
investigators to avoid the design-hygiene trap we succumbed to. Rather, we would
endorse innovative designs for evaluating dissemination strategies that build on the
cross-talk and diffusion that occur naturally within and across zoos.<component
