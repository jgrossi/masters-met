Perissodactyla; Family Tapiridae, is a shy, forest-dwelling herbivore from South East
Asia [e.g. Gemita et al., 2007], whose range has been extensively reduced in the
recent past [Khan, 1997]. Although generally thought of as a nocturnal solitary
species [Williams and Petrides, 1980], recent evidence suggests that the Malayan
tapir is more social than first thought [Diz, 2006]. Currently classified as
Endangered on the IUCN Red List (due to anthropogenic pressures and disturbance of
its natural habitat leading to fragmented populations), Malayan tapir is known to
exist in Malaysia, Sumatra (Indonesia), Thailand, and Burma [Lynam et al., 2008].
Malayan tapir is maintained in numerous animal collections around the world generally
being termed easy-to-keep [e.g. B arongi, 1999; Shoemaker et al., 2004]. As
intermediate feeders, Malayan tapirs select fruits, grasses, and browse trees
dependent upon season [Janssen, 2003], an important fact to consider when evaluating
captive diets. Previous work on t apir nutrition has noted animals being fed too many
domestic fruits and vegetables in place of good quality forage, such as lucerne
(alfalfa) hay [Clauss et al., 2008, 2009]. The focus of this research is to evaluate
various m anagement practices used for maintaining high standards of welfare in
captive Malayan tapir. Previous investigation by the authors has noted published

be lacking; a finding concurrent with other authors [Taylor, 2000; Zenzinger, 2003].
Specifically focusing on enrichment, research into Brazilian tapir ( Tapir
terrestris) enrichment protocols [e.g. Sharpe, 1997; Thompson and Rose, 2008;
Zenzinger, 2003] appear common, potentially due to the relative popularity of this
species in zoological collections when compared to its Asian relative. Limited
scientific assessment of Malayan tapir enrichment practice makes such an evaluative
undertaking both informative and useful. Rose et al. [2006] reviewed enrichment
practice at the East Midland Zoological Society, Twycross Zoo in an attempt to
qualify specific regimes that were of most benefit to improving welfare and promoting
natural behavior patterns. Behavioral observations on the same animal noted that
enrichment had a significant effect on foraging and locomotory behaviors in this
individual [Rose et al., 2008]. Work performed by Zenzinger [2003] has shown that
browse is the enrichment artifact most used by tapirs, and the one that alters
behavior patterns to the greatest extent; a fact that is to be expected as being
browsing ungulates, tapirs spend the greatest proportion of their time foraging [e.g.
Henry et al., 2000]. Wild Malayan tapirs 2 [Eisenberg, 1997] occupy large home
ranges, from 12 km 2 to over 25 km [Traeholt, 2004] and as such, captive enclosures
need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational stimulation for the
inhabitants. Indeed, Foerster and Vaughan's [2004] research highlights the seasonal
nature of tapir habitat use, indicating the complexity of wild tapir a ctivity
budgets. The research presented here is of prime importance as the current census
from the IUCN Red List 2011.1 shows that Malayan tapir numbers are decreasing in the
wild [ Lynam et al., 2008]. As such, the ex situ conservation of this species will
require support from specific management guidelines and accurate knowledge on the
species' individual captive requirements. The slow reproductive rate of M alayan
tapirs plus their low wild population density [Eisenberg, 1997] makes the
establishment and future continuation of a sustainable captive population an
essential conservation strategy.<component x="48.04" y="260.75" width="242.57"

sensory types is most often provided. It could be argued that group-housed animals
are e xperiencing social enrichment, and this will be discussed in due course. The

as a baseline, results highlight numerous areas of good practice in the keeping and
exhibition of Malayan tapirs in different zoos around the world. It appears that the
zoos surveyed meet Hall's [2007] guidelines for tapirs held s ocially whereby animals
need to be separated during calving and calf rearing, potentially due to the chance
of dangerous and unpredictable behavior being performed. Wild Malayan tapirs 2 occupy
large home ranges, from 12 km [Eisenberg, 1997] to 2 over 25 km [Traeholt, 2004] and
as such, captive enclosures need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational
stimulation for the inhabitants. The results show that collections provided some form
of enrichment for their tapirs to increase enclosure utilization and activity in
their animals. Current research states that tapirs are generally inactive, due to
inappropriate diets causing obesity and altered time budgets [Clauss et al., 2009];
similarly, Green et al. [2007] show that presentation of feed to captive tapirs can
affect total activity budgets and behavioral repertoire diversity. Wild tapirs expend
the majority of their energy consuming vegetation [Oliveiro-Santos et al., 2010], and
calculated times spent foraging range from 8.5 [Novarino, 2005] to 15 hr/ day [Holden
et al., 2003], depending on habitat type. Therefore, to promote "great welfare" [as
per Melfi, 2009], increased opportunities for foraging could be offered. Indeed,
Seitz [1998] and Barongi [2000] state that activity of captive tapirs is
predominantly influenced by dietary provision and the presence of conspecifics,
highlighting links between husbandry and social enrichment. Encouraging keepers to
use low-energy feed items would be highly beneficial as the positive relationship
between resting and limited forage opportunity would be reversed. Results suggest
that this approach is evident in the survey population and that keepers are
attempting to provide rations with some browse content. Collections are using native
browse to augment daily rations and at least one zoo stated that they specifically
collected types of browse akin to consumed plants in range states to "bulk out" daily
diets. Ragone and Cavaletto [2006] demonstrated that Artocarpus fruits from different
species of the genus contain variable amounts of energy, protein, and fiber, stating
that these trees make ideal candidates for sustainable food production. Field
observation suggests that Malayan tapirs are selective browsers and are very specific
in terms of ingested vegetation [Williams and Petrides, 1980]. It appears from this
research that there are differences between areas of the world in how diets are
formulated for this species (Fig. 2); those zoos in the Southern Hemisphere had a
greater reliance on forage, browse, and "natural" plant material compared with zoos
in the Northern Hemisphere that put a greater reliance on domestic produce and
pelleted feeds. Some colof the diet (e.g. lections feed locally available browse as a

Perissodactyla; Family Tapiridae, is a shy, forest-dwelling herbivore from South East
Asia [e.g. Gemita et al., 2007], whose range has been extensively reduced in the
recent past [Khan, 1997]. Although generally thought of as a nocturnal solitary
species [Williams and Petrides, 1980], recent evidence suggests that the Malayan
tapir is more social than first thought [Diz, 2006]. Currently classified as
Endangered on the IUCN Red List (due to anthropogenic pressures and disturbance of
its natural habitat leading to fragmented populations), Malayan tapir is known to
exist in Malaysia, Sumatra (Indonesia), Thailand, and Burma [Lynam et al., 2008].
Malayan tapir is maintained in numerous animal collections around the world generally
being termed easy-to-keep [e.g. B arongi, 1999; Shoemaker et al., 2004]. As
intermediate feeders, Malayan tapirs select fruits, grasses, and browse trees
dependent upon season [Janssen, 2003], an important fact to consider when evaluating
captive diets. Previous work on t apir nutrition has noted animals being fed too many
domestic fruits and vegetables in place of good quality forage, such as lucerne
(alfalfa) hay [Clauss et al., 2008, 2009]. The focus of this research is to evaluate
various m anagement practices used for maintaining high standards of welfare in
captive Malayan tapir. Previous investigation by the authors has noted published

be lacking; a finding concurrent with other authors [Taylor, 2000; Zenzinger, 2003].
Specifically focusing on enrichment, research into Brazilian tapir ( Tapir
terrestris) enrichment protocols [e.g. Sharpe, 1997; Thompson and Rose, 2008;
Zenzinger, 2003] appear common, potentially due to the relative popularity of this
species in zoological collections when compared to its Asian relative. Limited
scientific assessment of Malayan tapir enrichment practice makes such an evaluative
undertaking both informative and useful. Rose et al. [2006] reviewed enrichment
practice at the East Midland Zoological Society, Twycross Zoo in an attempt to
qualify specific regimes that were of most benefit to improving welfare and promoting
natural behavior patterns. Behavioral observations on the same animal noted that
enrichment had a significant effect on foraging and locomotory behaviors in this
individual [Rose et al., 2008]. Work performed by Zenzinger [2003] has shown that
browse is the enrichment artifact most used by tapirs, and the one that alters
behavior patterns to the greatest extent; a fact that is to be expected as being
browsing ungulates, tapirs spend the greatest proportion of their time foraging [e.g.
Henry et al., 2000]. Wild Malayan tapirs 2 [Eisenberg, 1997] occupy large home
ranges, from 12 km 2 to over 25 km [Traeholt, 2004] and as such, captive enclosures
need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational stimulation for the
inhabitants. Indeed, Foerster and Vaughan's [2004] research highlights the seasonal
nature of tapir habitat use, indicating the complexity of wild tapir a ctivity
budgets. The research presented here is of prime importance as the current census
from the IUCN Red List 2011.1 shows that Malayan tapir numbers are decreasing in the
wild [ Lynam et al., 2008]. As such, the ex situ conservation of this species will
require support from specific management guidelines and accurate knowledge on the
species' individual captive requirements. The slow reproductive rate of M alayan
tapirs plus their low wild population density [Eisenberg, 1997] makes the
establishment and future continuation of a sustainable captive population an
essential conservation strategy.<component x="48.04" y="260.75" width="242.57"

as a baseline, results highlight numerous areas of good practice in the keeping and
exhibition of Malayan tapirs in different zoos around the world. It appears that the
zoos surveyed meet Hall's [2007] guidelines for tapirs held s ocially whereby animals
need to be separated during calving and calf rearing, potentially due to the chance
of dangerous and unpredictable behavior being performed. Wild Malayan tapirs 2 occupy
large home ranges, from 12 km [Eisenberg, 1997] to 2 over 25 km [Traeholt, 2004] and
as such, captive enclosures need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational
stimulation for the inhabitants. The results show that collections provided some form
of enrichment for their tapirs to increase enclosure utilization and activity in
their animals. Current research states that tapirs are generally inactive, due to
inappropriate diets causing obesity and altered time budgets [Clauss et al., 2009];
similarly, Green et al. [2007] show that presentation of feed to captive tapirs can
affect total activity budgets and behavioral repertoire diversity. Wild tapirs expend
the majority of their energy consuming vegetation [Oliveiro-Santos et al., 2010], and
calculated times spent foraging range from 8.5 [Novarino, 2005] to 15 hr/ day [Holden
et al., 2003], depending on habitat type. Therefore, to promote "great welfare" [as
per Melfi, 2009], increased opportunities for foraging could be offered. Indeed,
Seitz [1998] and Barongi [2000] state that activity of captive tapirs is
predominantly influenced by dietary provision and the presence of conspecifics,
highlighting links between husbandry and social enrichment. Encouraging keepers to
use low-energy feed items would be highly beneficial as the positive relationship
between resting and limited forage opportunity would be reversed. Results suggest
that this approach is evident in the survey population and that keepers are
attempting to provide rations with some browse content. Collections are using native
browse to augment daily rations and at least one zoo stated that they specifically
collected types of browse akin to consumed plants in range states to "bulk out" daily
diets. Ragone and Cavaletto [2006] demonstrated that Artocarpus fruits from different
species of the genus contain variable amounts of energy, protein, and fiber, stating
that these trees make ideal candidates for sustainable food production. Field
observation suggests that Malayan tapirs are selective browsers and are very specific
in terms of ingested vegetation [Williams and Petrides, 1980]. It appears from this
research that there are differences between areas of the world in how diets are
formulated for this species (Fig. 2); those zoos in the Southern Hemisphere had a
greater reliance on forage, browse, and "natural" plant material compared with zoos
in the Northern Hemisphere that put a greater reliance on domestic produce and
pelleted feeds. Some colof the diet (e.g. lections feed locally available browse as a
