and infant fitness is affected by a range of ecological variables: predation,
availability and quality of food resources, social and environmental factors, and the
energetic cost of delivery [Bicca-Marques &amp; Gomes, 2005; De Lathouwers &amp; Van
Elsacker, 2005; Whittle et al., 2001]. Sensitivity to these factors has shaped
patterns of parturition in which birth is synchronized with periods of (1) high food
availability and (2) low conspecific and predator activity levels [Alford et al.,
1992; Bicca-Marques &amp; Gomes, 2005; Chism et al., 1978; McGrew &amp; McLuckie,
1984; Schino &amp; Troisi, 2005]. These shaping forces are substantially altered in
captivity: food resources are consistently available, predation threats are
eliminated, and other environmental factors are stabilized [De Lathouwers &amp; Van
Elsacker, 2005; Hosey, 2005]; however, some speciestypical patterns of birth timing
persist across captive context, including the tendency for diurnal and nocturnal
primates to give birth during the night and day, respectively [Bicca-Marques &amp;
Gomes, 2005]. In examining this consistency, investigators have questioned whether a
unique factor in captivity -presence of and interactions with humans-affects the
timing of the birthing process on a secondary, fine-grained level, beyond these
circadian-related rhythms [Cook et al., 2003; McGrew &amp; McLuckie, 1984]. In
support of this potential influence, human activity has been associated with a range
of behavioral and physiological effects on captive primates [Davis et al., 2005;
Hosey, 2000, 2005; Lambeth et al., 1997; Mitchell et al., 1992; Wells, 2005]. Many of
these reports link human presence to an increase in arousal, as indicated by
increased levels of activity [Chamove et al., 1988; Mitchell et al., 1992; Wells,
2005] and agonism, often with an accompanying decrease in conspecific affiliation
[Chamove et al., 1988; Wells, 2005] and an increase in cortisol levels [Davis et al.,
2005]. To assess whether these apparent effects extend to parturition, McGrew and
McLuckie [1984] and Alford et al. [1992] examined the distribution of captive primate
births over the course of the week, postulating that primates respond to
human-associated stimuli in captivity by suppressing components of the parturition
process to effectively delay birth. Consistent with this hypothesis, in two
laboratory populations of callitrichidae (common marmosets, and cotton top tamarins,
Callithrix j. jacchus ), McGrew and McLuckie found a Saguinus o. oedipus<component

of low human activity on the weekend (Friday-Sunday) compared with the working week
(Monday-Thursday). However, this ''weekend effect'' diminished among larger,
similarly managed populations of the same species, suggesting that the birth
distribution may have been skewed by the low number of births examined. Alford et al.
followed with an analysis of birth timing among a cross-institution population of
laboratory chimpanzees. In three of the five populations exposed to a large
differential in weekly staff activity, significantly more births occurred during the
low-activity weekend (Sunday-Monday) as compared with the week (Tuesday-Saturday).
The fewest births occurred in the late week, which the authors suggested is
associated with an accumulation of arousal over consecutive days of exposure to human
presence. Although Alford et al. interpreted these findings as indicative of a
captive-based, species-wide phenomenon, several management or site-related factors
may have exerted wide-ranging effects on the timing of birth events. For instance,
the reported separation of some of the pregnant subjects from the social group may
have changed ambient arousal levels and the nature of interaction with human staff
that in turn affected perinatal physiology. Alford et al. [1992] advocated a similar
analysis on birth patterns in the zoological environment, where visitor presence
provides the critical weekly variation in human exposure. This study addresses this
question by assessing the distribution of 20 years of recorded chimpanzee births
occurring in zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Contrary
to the weekly cycles of staff presence in the previous laboratory settings,
management activity in the zoological context remains relatively consistent
throughout the week, whereas visitor density demonstrates a predictable increase
during the weekend period. If chimpanzee parturition exhibited sensitivity to human
activity, then fewer births per day were expected during the weekend, as compared
with the weekday period; conversely, the null hypothesis predicted a random
distribution of births across days of the week. These findings have the potential to
further describe the effect of human visitors on captive primates, inform captive
management protocols, and hold implications for conservation breeding programs that
seek to optimize conditions under which successful births may occur. METHODS Subjects
Distribution of births was assessed among the 238 captive chimpanzees ( Pan
troglodytes) born in the 27 accredited American zoological institutions between 1985
and 2005 by using data from the 2006 North American Regional Studbook [Ross, 2006].
For each subject, studbook number and the date of discovery of birth (designated in
the studbook as date of birth) were recorded. Twin (five sets) and triplet (one set)
births were treated as single events, bringing the total number of births to 231.
Subjects were maintained in a variety of social and caretaking contexts, but all
institutions met the husbandry standards of the AZA as assessed in the accreditation
process. This standardized accreditation process permits the assumption of comparable
management settings and a consistent relationship between the day of birth and the
day of its discovery in each subject institution. Data Analysis Records were sorted
according to day of week within each of the 27 institutions of birth. To assess
day-related clustering in the distribution of births, the week was divided into
weekday and weekend periods. The weekend was defined as the period lasting from
Saturday to Sunday, in accordance with increases in visitor levels. Weekday and
weekend-day blocks were compared using the goodness-of-fit log likelihood test
statistic ( ). G RESULTS Each of the 27 focal institutions recorded between 1 and 47
birth events. To assess population-wide trends, records were combined across
institution regardless of differences in the size of each institutional sample. In
this pooled set, births in the population were recorded on every day of the week and
in every month of the year. Table I lists the number and frequency of births

lateness="0.75" reference_score="7.82">In the day-group comparison (weekend vs.
weekday), the number of births recorded as occurring during the weekend period was
not significantly different from that expected in a random distribution. To address
potential variation in patterns of visitor activity, birth numbers were also compared
within weekend/weekday-blocks and institution. Analyses again indicated a random
distribution of births across the week and between weekday and weekend blocks in the
11 zoos reporting seven or more births. DISCUSSION The random distribution of births
across days of the week indicates that the timing of chimpanzee parturition in
zoological parks seems not to be affected by changes in visitor activity levels. It
is possible that the contrast with the Alford et al. [1992] and McGrew and McLuckie
[1984] findings may result from a complex of institution- and species-typical
characteristics [Alford et al., 1992; Bicca-Marques &amp; Gomes, 2005; Hosey, 2005;
McGrew &amp; McLuckie, 1984]. In the zoological setting, the behavioral and
physiological effects of human exposure may be less pronounced than in a laboratory
setting as a result of the lower differential in presence (with weekend visitor
access) and the inclusion of secluded areas (with naturalistic elements and
enrichment structures) from which humans (and conspecifics) are visually occluded
[Hosey, 2000, 2005]. These factors may have also served to confound a clear
relationship in the current data set, given the large time range of birth events and
corresponding changes in zoological management [Davis et al., 2005; Hosey, 2005;
Wells, 2005]. The absence of significant differences in birth distributions within
institutions tempers this argument, but future analyses may include exhibit type
(naturalistic vs. laboratory) and days of public access as additional variables. In
concert with these habitat-based factors, a high species-typical ''nervousness''
[Alford et al., 1992; McGrew &amp; McLuckie, 1984] (i.e. disposition to arousal) may
enhance reactivity to visitor presence. Such species may exhibit the most robust
birthtiming sensitivities [Chamove et al., 1988; Hosey, 2000], a possibility
suggested by McGrew and McLuckie [1984] in describing observed interspecies
differences in birth distribution among the callitrichidae and a stump-tailed macaque
( Macaca arc) population and supported in the current toides chimpanzee results. In
this analysis, species-specific social and cognitive traits may differentiate
chimpanzees from callitrichidae in the nature of the reaction to human presence
[Wells, 2005] to suppress a significant response-perhaps involving parturition-in the
former species. An examination of birth cycles in other, zoologically housed species
is needed before the influence of setting and species traits in the two tamarin and
marmoset species and chimpanzee populations studied can be fully addressed. We also
considered that an interaction between human-associated arousal and parturition might
be expressed in terms of infant viability [Debyser, 1995; Newell-Morris et al.,
1989]. Using the same data set, which included recorded dates of death, we assessed
the association between length of infant survival and the day of week on which the
individual was born (weekday vs. weekend). Supporting the general analysis, there was
no relationship between the day of birth and survivability; in each survival category
examined (1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years)
infants that survived were no more likely to be born on a weekday (or weekend) than
those that did not survive to reach those specific benchmarks. In sum, the observed
random distribution of captive chimpanzee births, supported by the absence of a link
between day of birth and survival, is consistent with previous work demonstrating a
finegrained control of birth timing by intrinsic factors including circadian rhythms
[Cook et al., 2003; Reppert, 1988; Whittle et al., 2001], rather than by recurring
captive-based stimuli such as levels of human activity. The relationship between
human presence and parturition reported in other studies may be more likely to stem
from interactions of facility- and species-specific characteristics, as those authors
have suggested. However, though other dimensions of the reproductive process (e.g.
mating and development) may be affected by specific components of the external
environment, the current results suggest that the temporal patterns of chimpanzee
parturition events do not seem to be directly associated with a single factor unique
to the typical zoological environment, including one as salient as visitor
activity.<component x="50.8" y="576.61" width="233.15" height="129.72" page="3"

lateness="0.75" reference_score="7.82">In the day-group comparison (weekend vs.
weekday), the number of births recorded as occurring during the weekend period was
not significantly different from that expected in a random distribution. To address
potential variation in patterns of visitor activity, birth numbers were also compared
within weekend/weekday-blocks and institution. Analyses again indicated a random
distribution of births across the week and between weekday and weekend blocks in the
11 zoos reporting seven or more births. DISCUSSION The random distribution of births
across days of the week indicates that the timing of chimpanzee parturition in
zoological parks seems not to be affected by changes in visitor activity levels. It
is possible that the contrast with the Alford et al. [1992] and McGrew and McLuckie
[1984] findings may result from a complex of institution- and species-typical
characteristics [Alford et al., 1992; Bicca-Marques &amp; Gomes, 2005; Hosey, 2005;
McGrew &amp; McLuckie, 1984]. In the zoological setting, the behavioral and
physiological effects of human exposure may be less pronounced than in a laboratory
setting as a result of the lower differential in presence (with weekend visitor
access) and the inclusion of secluded areas (with naturalistic elements and
enrichment structures) from which humans (and conspecifics) are visually occluded
[Hosey, 2000, 2005]. These factors may have also served to confound a clear
relationship in the current data set, given the large time range of birth events and
corresponding changes in zoological management [Davis et al., 2005; Hosey, 2005;
Wells, 2005]. The absence of significant differences in birth distributions within
institutions tempers this argument, but future analyses may include exhibit type
(naturalistic vs. laboratory) and days of public access as additional variables. In
concert with these habitat-based factors, a high species-typical ''nervousness''
[Alford et al., 1992; McGrew &amp; McLuckie, 1984] (i.e. disposition to arousal) may
enhance reactivity to visitor presence. Such species may exhibit the most robust
birthtiming sensitivities [Chamove et al., 1988; Hosey, 2000], a possibility
suggested by McGrew and McLuckie [1984] in describing observed interspecies
differences in birth distribution among the callitrichidae and a stump-tailed macaque
( Macaca arc) population and supported in the current toides chimpanzee results. In
this analysis, species-specific social and cognitive traits may differentiate
chimpanzees from callitrichidae in the nature of the reaction to human presence
[Wells, 2005] to suppress a significant response-perhaps involving parturition-in the
former species. An examination of birth cycles in other, zoologically housed species
is needed before the influence of setting and species traits in the two tamarin and
marmoset species and chimpanzee populations studied can be fully addressed. We also
considered that an interaction between human-associated arousal and parturition might
be expressed in terms of infant viability [Debyser, 1995; Newell-Morris et al.,
1989]. Using the same data set, which included recorded dates of death, we assessed
the association between length of infant survival and the day of week on which the
individual was born (weekday vs. weekend). Supporting the general analysis, there was
no relationship between the day of birth and survivability; in each survival category
examined (1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years)
infants that survived were no more likely to be born on a weekday (or weekend) than
those that did not survive to reach those specific benchmarks. In sum, the observed
random distribution of captive chimpanzee births, supported by the absence of a link
between day of birth and survival, is consistent with previous work demonstrating a
finegrained control of birth timing by intrinsic factors including circadian rhythms
[Cook et al., 2003; Reppert, 1988; Whittle et al., 2001], rather than by recurring
captive-based stimuli such as levels of human activity. The relationship between
human presence and parturition reported in other studies may be more likely to stem
from interactions of facility- and species-specific characteristics, as those authors
have suggested. However, though other dimensions of the reproductive process (e.g.
mating and development) may be affected by specific components of the external
environment, the current results suggest that the temporal patterns of chimpanzee
parturition events do not seem to be directly associated with a single factor unique
to the typical zoological environment, including one as salient as visitor
activity.<component x="50.8" y="576.61" width="233.15" height="129.72" page="3"
