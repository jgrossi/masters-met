naturally regenerate any lost organ, let alone anything as large and complex as an
antler, e.g. the antlers of a 200-kg adult red deer may weigh as much 30 kg but take
only 3 months to grow. By contrast, animals that have retained the capacity to
regenerate are found in most other phyla and a variety of these are studied by
regeneration biologists. These include planaria, hydra, urodele amphibians, Xenopus
and zebrafish (Brockes, 1997; Fujisawa, 2003; Nye et al. 2003; Poss et al. 2003;
Sanchez Alvarado, 2003; Slack et al. 2004). In fact, it has been proposed that only
by studying a variety of examples of natural regeneration can we develop our
understanding of why some animals regenerate and others do not (Brockes, 2004).
However, despite their obvious convenience as experimental models, these are not
mammals and although some mouse strains have been shown to have an increased capacity
for repair (Heber-Katz et al. 2004), they are unable to regenerate whole organs. This
is why the mechanisms that underlie antler regeneration should continue to be
investigated, notwithstanding the limitations of deer as an animal model. This
argument made most persuasively by Richard Goss, the regeneration biologist who
pioneered antler research in the late twentieth century (Goss, 1995). Antler research
can help us understand why regenerative ability has been lost in mammals and take us
further towards a 'holy grail' of modern human medicine: the ability to regenerate
organs that have been removed through trauma or excision.<component x="305.36"

Cervidae family (order Artiodactyl) and are among the most graceful and attractive of
animals. This family consists of 17 genera and about 53 species. Deer are native to
all parts of the world except Antarctica, Australia, central and southern Africa,
Madagascar and New Zealand, and have adapted to virtually every land habitat, from
dry deserts to woodlands, prairies, marshes and Arctic regions. Deer are the only
animals that grow antlers, which are composed of skin, nerves, blood vessels, fibrous
tissue, cartilage and bone, and thus should not be confused with horns, which are a
keratinized tissue that grow from their base under the control of underlying
mesenchymal cells. Except for the reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), antlers develop only
in male deer and in most species this occurs in the spring of the animal's second
year of life. As with the developing limb, antlers have three axes: a proximal-distal
axis, an anterior-posterior axis and a dorsal-ventral axis (see Fig. 2A; Li &amp;
Suttie, 2001). Antlers come in all shapes and sizes from small unbranched antlers of
only a few centimetres in length, as seen on the pudu (Pudu puda), the smallest of
the deer species, to elaborately branched racks or palmate headpieces of impressive
proportions in species such as the moose and elk. The moose (Alces spp.) is the
largest deer (an adult stag's body weight can reach 800 kg) and these animals possess
the largest antlers. Elk (Cervus canadenesis) (Fig. 1A) also carry impressive sets of
antlers that can extend to 1.5 m in length. The antlers of more diminutive adult
fallow bucks (Dama dama)<component x="60.64" y="66.43" width="229.62" height="413.75"

protuberances on the frontal bone. As the fawn approaches puberty (at approximately
5-7 months old in the red deer), a collection of determined periosteal cells located
in the distal parts of the cristae externae of the frontal bones are activated by
rising androgen levels in the blood. This specialized periosteum (Fig. 2B) was
originally described as 'antlerogenic periosteum' (AP) by Richard Goss (Goss &amp;
Powel, 1985). The AP contains specific binding sites for testosterone (Li &amp;
Suttie, 1998) although testosterone does not appear to have direct effects on
cultured AP cells whereas IGF-I stimulates their proliferation (Li et al. 1999;
Sadighi et al. 2001). Trabecular bone is then formed beneath the periosteum and a
pedicle develops (Sempere et al. 1983; Suttie et al. 1984, 1988, 1991). Normally the
antlerogenic periosteum of female deer remains quiescent because the hormonal
requirements necessary for pedicle formation are not present. However, female deer
can be induced to form pedicles if injected with androgens (Kierdorf et al. 1995). Li
&amp; Suttie (1994) have undertaken detailed histological analyses of pedicle
formation and have identified four ossification stages. The first is the
intramembranous ossification stage (1 in Fig. 2C), and this is where the initial
antlerogenic cells start to proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts. These
osteoblasts form trabecular bone in cellular periosteum. The second stage is
transitional ossification, which takes place when the pedicle has reached 5-10 mm in
height (2 in Fig. 2C). Osseocartilaginous tissue is formed by antlerogenic
cells<component x="306.64" y="66.93" width="230.7" height="400.25" page="2"

they shed their velvet skin at the appropriate time of year (Hartwig &amp; Schrudde,
1974; Goss &amp; Powel, 1985). Structures resembling antlers, or pedicle-antlers,
have also been generated when AP was transplanted over the calvariae of nude mice (Li
et al. 2001). Studies using a cell lineage tracer described by Li and Suttie in their
review of antlerogenic periosteum provide further evidence that pedicles and antlers
are derived from this tissue (Li &amp; Suttie, 2001). Taken together, these studies
led Li &amp; Suttie (2001) to suggest that, like some embryonic tissues, AP has full
self-differentiating capacity. Interestingly, the cellular layer of AP is very rich
in glycogen (Li &amp; Suttie, 1998), a characteristic of fetal osteoblasts.
Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information on the local molecular mechanisms
involved in antler and pedicle development. In vitro studies have shown that
insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) may be an important systemic regulator of
pedicle formation as it stimulates proliferation of antlerogeneic cells from all four
ossification stages. Retinoic acid (RA) is also likely to play a role because
application of RA to the developing pedicle increased the growth rate of the first
antler and this was suggested to occur via an increase in the proliferation of
periosteal cells (Kierdorf &amp; Bartos, 1999). Recently, Barling and colleagues
(Barling et al. 2004a,b) have undertaken a series of studies aimed at identifying
growth factors and their receptors in the skin and underlying bone of primary
antlers. Growth factors identified include epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the EGF
receptor, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and the FGF receptors, FGFR1, FGFR2 and
FGFR3, bone morphogenetics proteins (BMPs) 2, 4 and 14 and the BMP receptors BMPR1B
and ACTRII. They hypothesize that these growth factors signal between the
osseocartilagenous and skin compartments of the primary antler (Barling et al.
2004b). The spatial and temporal differences in the localization of these growth
factors showed that their distribution in skin of the primary antler resembles that
described in adult skin of other species, whereas their distribution in bone and
cartilage resembles that in the fetal skeleton. Identifying the pathways that
regulate the prenatal development of antler primordiae should also be a priority for
future study. In the embryo, localized thickenings of the periosteum of the frontal
bone can be observed at sites of future pedicle/antler development (Fig. 2B; Lincoln,
1973; Li &amp; Suttie, 2001). These primordial pedicles enlarge between 55 and 150
days of gestation but regress at later stages. This tissue specification is likely to
involve interactions between mesenchyme and the overlying epithelial cell layer,
which Li &amp; Suttie (2001) described as resembling the apical ectodermal ridge in
the developing limb. It is noteworthy that development of the mammary gland, which,
like antlerogenic periosteum, is regulated by sex steroids, involves
epithelial-mesenchymal interactions (Foley et al. 2001). One of the molecules that
mediates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in the developing mammary gland is
parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). Although the role of PTHrP in the
development of antlerogenic periosteum has not been investigated, there is evidence
that it plays an important role in both the developing and the regenerating antler.
Barling et al. (2004a) have recently identified the PTHrP and the PTH/PTHrP receptor
in both velvet skin and underlying mesenchymal tissues of red deer primary antlers.
We have also found that PTHrP is widely expressed in tissues of regenerating red deer
antlers and that its synthesis is regulated by TGF- (Faucheux et al. 2004). Clearly a
major chal&#x3B2; lenge lies in characterizing the pathways and factors that: (i)
define where and how AP forms during fetal life, (ii) enable AP to 'survive' until
the systemic environment is appropriate for antler development and (iii ) activate
expansion of progenitor cells in the perisoteum. The potential role of periosteum in
regenerating antlers will be discussed in more detail in the next section.<component

to enable stags to protect and retain harems of females (does), their growth is
linked to the annual breeding cycle and its associated fluctuations in sex hormone
concentrations. In temperate species such as the red deer, it is a change in day
length that regulates reproductive activity, although there are endogenous rhythms of
antler growth (West &amp; Nordan, 1976). Studies in orchidectomized (castrated) stags
and in stags administered exogenous hormones have demonstrated that sex steroids are
most important at the start and at the end of the antler growth cycle. Incredibly,
Aristotle was the first scientist to describe the effects of castration on antler
growth! Antlers are normally cast in spring when testosterone levels are low.
Castration of stags in late winter/early spring will lead to premature casting of
antlers (Jaczewski et al. 1976), whereas administration of exogenous sex steroids at
this time will prevent casting and regeneration (Fletcher, 1978). The rapid growth of
antlers occurs during the early summer when there is a plentiful food supply and
stags live sedentary lives while 'testosterone depleted' (Goss, 1983). Because antler
regeneration takes place at a time when deer reproductive organs are inactive it was
proposed many years ago that there must also be a non-gonadal factor involved and
this was named 'antler growth stimulus' (AGS) (Wislocki, 1943). IGF-I synthesized in
the liver is the most likely candidate as IGF-I concentrations are high during the
period of rapid antler growth (Suttie et al. 1985), there are IGF receptors in the
antler's growing tip (Elliott et al. 1992, 1993) and IGFs promote proliferation of
antler cells (Price et al. 1994; Sadighi et al. 1994). Changes in concentrations of
other hormones are associated with the antler growth cycle, D (Van der Eems et al.
1988; including 1,25(OH) 2 3 Sempere et al. 1989), thyroid hormones (Shi &amp;
Barrell, 1994), cortisol (Bubenik et al. 1975a; Suttie et al. 1995) and prolactin
(Sempere et al. 1983; Suttie et al. 1984), although their function remains poorly
understood. Antler growth places an enormous demand for mineral on the skeleton
(sufficient mineral is needed to enable a 30-kg bone to grow in 3 months), and to
&#x223C; meet this demand cyclical reversible osteoporosis occurs at other skeletal
sites (Bubenik, 1983). This bone loss is greatest in non-weight-bearing bones such

bone cell activity in the circulation has shown how bone turnover increases
dramatically at the time of rapid antler growth. Figure 4 shows the results of a
study in which we measured changes in circulating levels of the carboxyterminal
pro-peptide of type I collagen, a marker of osteoblast activity (Eriksen et al.
1993), at different times of year. This showed that levels were ten times higher
during the period of antler regeneration. Baksi &amp; Newbury (1988) have also shown
changes in serum osteocalcin and hydroxyproline associated with antler growth.
Atlhough low levels of sex steroids are 'permissive' for regeneration, high levels
appear to act as a 'brake', as discussed previously in the context of the developing
antlers (Goss, 1968). Therefore, as the breeding season approaches and testosterone
levels increase, endochondral growth stops, the antlers become fully calcified, and
the velvet skin covering then thins, becomes 'dry' and is then shed (Fig. 5A) to
expose the antler as a solid bone that remains firmly attached to the pedicle. The
seasonal surge in testosterone also causes a behavioural change in the deer. Even
before shedding their velvet, bucks begin to establish positions in the social
hierarchy (Fig. 5B). Testosterone levels peak in late autumn when sexual activity is
intense (Lincoln, 1971) and then decline again as spring approaches.<component

and cancer was highlighted in a review by Brockes (1998), and led us to suggest
previously (Price &amp; Allen, 2004) that castrated antlers develop tumour-like
structures because a mechanism has evolved in deer whereby sex steroids (acting
directly or indirectly) normally limit cell cycle progression in antler progenitor
cells. It is the remarkable capacity for growth and self-renewal of antler progenitor
cells that underpins the capacity of antlers to regenerate, but this has a potential
downside: an increased risk of transformation. By contrast, Fig. 5 The consequences

our knowledge of the factors that may specifically regulate osteogenesis in
regenerating antlers is derived from descriptive studies, although culturing these
cells from explants of antler bone is straightforward and so there is great potential
for further work in this area. As discussed recently by Kierdorf &amp; Kierdorf
(2004), the rapid rate of antler bone growth makes it an excellent model for
investigating osteogenesis. PTHrP, acting through the PPR, is likely to play a role
as both are present in osteoblasts at sites of endochondral and intramembranous bone
formation. By contrast, we have only found IHH in osteoblasts in the midshaft of the
antler, not at the periphery, which suggests a specific role in endochondral bone
growth, consistent with the findings of knock-out studies in mice (St-Jacques et al.
1999). IHH mRNA has also been localized in antler cartilage and bone by in situ
hybridization, following its identification in a cDNA library (Lord et al. 2004). TGF
-1 is also present in antler osteoblasts (Price et al. &#x3B2; 2004). Another
molecule that is likely to regulate bone formation in antlers is RA given that it is
found at relatively high levels in antler bone and RALDH2 is localized in osteoblast
progenitors in antler cartilage as well as in more differentiated osteoblasts. The
effects of RA on osteoblast lineage cells may be mediated by the RAR receptor because

naturally regenerate any lost organ, let alone anything as large and complex as an
antler, e.g. the antlers of a 200-kg adult red deer may weigh as much 30 kg but take
only 3 months to grow. By contrast, animals that have retained the capacity to
regenerate are found in most other phyla and a variety of these are studied by
regeneration biologists. These include planaria, hydra, urodele amphibians, Xenopus
and zebrafish (Brockes, 1997; Fujisawa, 2003; Nye et al. 2003; Poss et al. 2003;
Sanchez Alvarado, 2003; Slack et al. 2004). In fact, it has been proposed that only
by studying a variety of examples of natural regeneration can we develop our
understanding of why some animals regenerate and others do not (Brockes, 2004).
However, despite their obvious convenience as experimental models, these are not
mammals and although some mouse strains have been shown to have an increased capacity
for repair (Heber-Katz et al. 2004), they are unable to regenerate whole organs. This
is why the mechanisms that underlie antler regeneration should continue to be
investigated, notwithstanding the limitations of deer as an animal model. This
argument made most persuasively by Richard Goss, the regeneration biologist who
pioneered antler research in the late twentieth century (Goss, 1995). Antler research
can help us understand why regenerative ability has been lost in mammals and take us
further towards a 'holy grail' of modern human medicine: the ability to regenerate
organs that have been removed through trauma or excision.<component x="305.36"

Cervidae family (order Artiodactyl) and are among the most graceful and attractive of
animals. This family consists of 17 genera and about 53 species. Deer are native to
all parts of the world except Antarctica, Australia, central and southern Africa,
Madagascar and New Zealand, and have adapted to virtually every land habitat, from
dry deserts to woodlands, prairies, marshes and Arctic regions. Deer are the only
animals that grow antlers, which are composed of skin, nerves, blood vessels, fibrous
tissue, cartilage and bone, and thus should not be confused with horns, which are a
keratinized tissue that grow from their base under the control of underlying
mesenchymal cells. Except for the reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), antlers develop only
in male deer and in most species this occurs in the spring of the animal's second
year of life. As with the developing limb, antlers have three axes: a proximal-distal
axis, an anterior-posterior axis and a dorsal-ventral axis (see Fig. 2A; Li &amp;
Suttie, 2001). Antlers come in all shapes and sizes from small unbranched antlers of
only a few centimetres in length, as seen on the pudu (Pudu puda), the smallest of
the deer species, to elaborately branched racks or palmate headpieces of impressive
proportions in species such as the moose and elk. The moose (Alces spp.) is the
largest deer (an adult stag's body weight can reach 800 kg) and these animals possess
the largest antlers. Elk (Cervus canadenesis) (Fig. 1A) also carry impressive sets of
antlers that can extend to 1.5 m in length. The antlers of more diminutive adult
fallow bucks (Dama dama)<component x="60.64" y="66.43" width="229.62" height="413.75"

protuberances on the frontal bone. As the fawn approaches puberty (at approximately
5-7 months old in the red deer), a collection of determined periosteal cells located
in the distal parts of the cristae externae of the frontal bones are activated by
rising androgen levels in the blood. This specialized periosteum (Fig. 2B) was
originally described as 'antlerogenic periosteum' (AP) by Richard Goss (Goss &amp;
Powel, 1985). The AP contains specific binding sites for testosterone (Li &amp;
Suttie, 1998) although testosterone does not appear to have direct effects on
cultured AP cells whereas IGF-I stimulates their proliferation (Li et al. 1999;
Sadighi et al. 2001). Trabecular bone is then formed beneath the periosteum and a
pedicle develops (Sempere et al. 1983; Suttie et al. 1984, 1988, 1991). Normally the
antlerogenic periosteum of female deer remains quiescent because the hormonal
requirements necessary for pedicle formation are not present. However, female deer
can be induced to form pedicles if injected with androgens (Kierdorf et al. 1995). Li
&amp; Suttie (1994) have undertaken detailed histological analyses of pedicle
formation and have identified four ossification stages. The first is the
intramembranous ossification stage (1 in Fig. 2C), and this is where the initial
antlerogenic cells start to proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts. These
osteoblasts form trabecular bone in cellular periosteum. The second stage is
transitional ossification, which takes place when the pedicle has reached 5-10 mm in
height (2 in Fig. 2C). Osseocartilaginous tissue is formed by antlerogenic
cells<component x="306.64" y="66.93" width="230.7" height="400.25" page="2"

they shed their velvet skin at the appropriate time of year (Hartwig &amp; Schrudde,
1974; Goss &amp; Powel, 1985). Structures resembling antlers, or pedicle-antlers,
have also been generated when AP was transplanted over the calvariae of nude mice (Li
et al. 2001). Studies using a cell lineage tracer described by Li and Suttie in their
review of antlerogenic periosteum provide further evidence that pedicles and antlers
are derived from this tissue (Li &amp; Suttie, 2001). Taken together, these studies
led Li &amp; Suttie (2001) to suggest that, like some embryonic tissues, AP has full
self-differentiating capacity. Interestingly, the cellular layer of AP is very rich
in glycogen (Li &amp; Suttie, 1998), a characteristic of fetal osteoblasts.
Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information on the local molecular mechanisms
involved in antler and pedicle development. In vitro studies have shown that
insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) may be an important systemic regulator of
pedicle formation as it stimulates proliferation of antlerogeneic cells from all four
ossification stages. Retinoic acid (RA) is also likely to play a role because
application of RA to the developing pedicle increased the growth rate of the first
antler and this was suggested to occur via an increase in the proliferation of
periosteal cells (Kierdorf &amp; Bartos, 1999). Recently, Barling and colleagues
(Barling et al. 2004a,b) have undertaken a series of studies aimed at identifying
growth factors and their receptors in the skin and underlying bone of primary
antlers. Growth factors identified include epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the EGF
receptor, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and the FGF receptors, FGFR1, FGFR2 and
FGFR3, bone morphogenetics proteins (BMPs) 2, 4 and 14 and the BMP receptors BMPR1B
and ACTRII. They hypothesize that these growth factors signal between the
osseocartilagenous and skin compartments of the primary antler (Barling et al.
2004b). The spatial and temporal differences in the localization of these growth
factors showed that their distribution in skin of the primary antler resembles that
described in adult skin of other species, whereas their distribution in bone and
cartilage resembles that in the fetal skeleton. Identifying the pathways that
regulate the prenatal development of antler primordiae should also be a priority for
future study. In the embryo, localized thickenings of the periosteum of the frontal
bone can be observed at sites of future pedicle/antler development (Fig. 2B; Lincoln,
1973; Li &amp; Suttie, 2001). These primordial pedicles enlarge between 55 and 150
days of gestation but regress at later stages. This tissue specification is likely to
involve interactions between mesenchyme and the overlying epithelial cell layer,
which Li &amp; Suttie (2001) described as resembling the apical ectodermal ridge in
the developing limb. It is noteworthy that development of the mammary gland, which,
like antlerogenic periosteum, is regulated by sex steroids, involves
epithelial-mesenchymal interactions (Foley et al. 2001). One of the molecules that
mediates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in the developing mammary gland is
parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). Although the role of PTHrP in the
development of antlerogenic periosteum has not been investigated, there is evidence
that it plays an important role in both the developing and the regenerating antler.
Barling et al. (2004a) have recently identified the PTHrP and the PTH/PTHrP receptor
in both velvet skin and underlying mesenchymal tissues of red deer primary antlers.
We have also found that PTHrP is widely expressed in tissues of regenerating red deer
antlers and that its synthesis is regulated by TGF- (Faucheux et al. 2004). Clearly a
major chal&#x3B2; lenge lies in characterizing the pathways and factors that: (i)
define where and how AP forms during fetal life, (ii) enable AP to 'survive' until
the systemic environment is appropriate for antler development and (iii ) activate
expansion of progenitor cells in the perisoteum. The potential role of periosteum in
regenerating antlers will be discussed in more detail in the next section.<component

to enable stags to protect and retain harems of females (does), their growth is
linked to the annual breeding cycle and its associated fluctuations in sex hormone
concentrations. In temperate species such as the red deer, it is a change in day
length that regulates reproductive activity, although there are endogenous rhythms of
antler growth (West &amp; Nordan, 1976). Studies in orchidectomized (castrated) stags
and in stags administered exogenous hormones have demonstrated that sex steroids are
most important at the start and at the end of the antler growth cycle. Incredibly,
Aristotle was the first scientist to describe the effects of castration on antler
growth! Antlers are normally cast in spring when testosterone levels are low.
Castration of stags in late winter/early spring will lead to premature casting of
antlers (Jaczewski et al. 1976), whereas administration of exogenous sex steroids at
this time will prevent casting and regeneration (Fletcher, 1978). The rapid growth of
antlers occurs during the early summer when there is a plentiful food supply and
stags live sedentary lives while 'testosterone depleted' (Goss, 1983). Because antler
regeneration takes place at a time when deer reproductive organs are inactive it was
proposed many years ago that there must also be a non-gonadal factor involved and
this was named 'antler growth stimulus' (AGS) (Wislocki, 1943). IGF-I synthesized in
the liver is the most likely candidate as IGF-I concentrations are high during the
period of rapid antler growth (Suttie et al. 1985), there are IGF receptors in the
antler's growing tip (Elliott et al. 1992, 1993) and IGFs promote proliferation of
antler cells (Price et al. 1994; Sadighi et al. 1994). Changes in concentrations of
other hormones are associated with the antler growth cycle, D (Van der Eems et al.
1988; including 1,25(OH) 2 3 Sempere et al. 1989), thyroid hormones (Shi &amp;
Barrell, 1994), cortisol (Bubenik et al. 1975a; Suttie et al. 1995) and prolactin
(Sempere et al. 1983; Suttie et al. 1984), although their function remains poorly
understood. Antler growth places an enormous demand for mineral on the skeleton
(sufficient mineral is needed to enable a 30-kg bone to grow in 3 months), and to
&#x223C; meet this demand cyclical reversible osteoporosis occurs at other skeletal
sites (Bubenik, 1983). This bone loss is greatest in non-weight-bearing bones such

bone cell activity in the circulation has shown how bone turnover increases
dramatically at the time of rapid antler growth. Figure 4 shows the results of a
study in which we measured changes in circulating levels of the carboxyterminal
pro-peptide of type I collagen, a marker of osteoblast activity (Eriksen et al.
1993), at different times of year. This showed that levels were ten times higher
during the period of antler regeneration. Baksi &amp; Newbury (1988) have also shown
changes in serum osteocalcin and hydroxyproline associated with antler growth.
Atlhough low levels of sex steroids are 'permissive' for regeneration, high levels
appear to act as a 'brake', as discussed previously in the context of the developing
antlers (Goss, 1968). Therefore, as the breeding season approaches and testosterone
levels increase, endochondral growth stops, the antlers become fully calcified, and
the velvet skin covering then thins, becomes 'dry' and is then shed (Fig. 5A) to
expose the antler as a solid bone that remains firmly attached to the pedicle. The
seasonal surge in testosterone also causes a behavioural change in the deer. Even
before shedding their velvet, bucks begin to establish positions in the social
hierarchy (Fig. 5B). Testosterone levels peak in late autumn when sexual activity is
intense (Lincoln, 1971) and then decline again as spring approaches.<component

and cancer was highlighted in a review by Brockes (1998), and led us to suggest
previously (Price &amp; Allen, 2004) that castrated antlers develop tumour-like
structures because a mechanism has evolved in deer whereby sex steroids (acting
directly or indirectly) normally limit cell cycle progression in antler progenitor
cells. It is the remarkable capacity for growth and self-renewal of antler progenitor

the antler that occurs in the distal end of each branch (shown schematically in Fig.

several lines of evidence to suggest that retinoic acid (RA) is also likely to play a

our knowledge of the factors that may specifically regulate osteogenesis in
regenerating antlers is derived from descriptive studies, although culturing these
cells from explants of antler bone is straightforward and so there is great potential
for further work in this area. As discussed recently by Kierdorf &amp; Kierdorf
(2004), the rapid rate of antler bone growth makes it an excellent model for
investigating osteogenesis. PTHrP, acting through the PPR, is likely to play a role
as both are present in osteoblasts at sites of endochondral and intramembranous bone
formation. By contrast, we have only found IHH in osteoblasts in the midshaft of the
antler, not at the periphery, which suggests a specific role in endochondral bone
growth, consistent with the findings of knock-out studies in mice (St-Jacques et al.
1999). IHH mRNA has also been localized in antler cartilage and bone by in situ
hybridization, following its identification in a cDNA library (Lord et al. 2004). TGF
-1 is also present in antler osteoblasts (Price et al. &#x3B2; 2004). Another
molecule that is likely to regulate bone formation in antlers is RA given that it is
found at relatively high levels in antler bone and RALDH2 is localized in osteoblast
progenitors in antler cartilage as well as in more differentiated osteoblasts. The
effects of RA on osteoblast lineage cells may be mediated by the RAR receptor because
