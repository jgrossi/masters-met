Africa (NZG) has been a declared National Research Facility of the National Research
Foundation (NRF) since 1 April 2004. As an independent government agency, the NRF
promotes and supports research in all knowledge fields. The National Research
Facilities, placed under the custodianship of the NRF, contribute to the provision of
a highquality research platform for the research community across the national
science system. The NZG as a National Research Facility is in a unique position to
generate new knowledge, core technologies and data pools/collections commensurate
with international standards. It provides a critical mass of equipment, skills and
users and the potential for networking and attracting collaboration. The facility
offers unique opportunities for the advancement of science and for an interface
between science and the public, and the additional provision of opportunities for
people development. The broad strategic contexts of the NZG are thematic drivers.
These drivers focus on the way the organization attracts, develops and retains
talent. The aim is to uphold excellence in all investments in knowledge, people and
infrastructure. Key-words: National System of Innovation; platform; research;

of South Africa (NZG) was founded in 1899 when the government of the time purchased
the farm Rus in Urbe from the celebrated South African author J. F. Cilliers to
establish a zoo. Today, it operates four sites in three provinces. Each site plays an
important role in adding value to the core functions of the organization. The main
site and headquarters are located in South Africa's capital city, Pretoria, in the
form of an 85 ha zoo. The 6000 ha Biodiversity Conservation Centre in Lichtenburg in
the North-West Province of the country has distinguished itself as a semi-in situ
site where White rhinoceros Ceratotherium simum have been bred successfully. The 1500
ha Biodiversity Conservation Centre in Mokopane in the Limpopo Province, located in
the north of South Africa, houses threatened species such as Roan antelope
Hippotragus equinus and Black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis, as well as other flagship
species that include Cape buffalo Syncerus caffer and Red-billed oxpeckers Buphagus
erythrorhynchus. In association with a commercial venture on the banks of the Vaal
River in Gauteng Province, the NZG also jointly manages a 14 ha zoo and an 89 ha
animal park. Collectively, these sites house one of the largest animal collections in
Africa, comprising 3117 specimens of 209 species of mammal, 1358 specimens of 202
species of bird, 3871 specimens of 190 species of fishes, 388 specimens of four
species of invertebrate, 309 specimens of 93 species of reptile and 44 specimens of
seven species of amphibian. A reptile park and the largest inland marine aquarium
further complement the collection. Acquired in 1916, the NZG is the only one of the
four governmental zoos in South Africa with national status. The only Komodo dragons
Varanus komodoensis and Koalas Phascolarctos cinereus on the African continent are
housed at the NZG. The 51 Bald ibises Geronticus eremita maintained by the NZG
constitute the largest breeding population of these birds in Africa and the NZG
observed the first ever zoo birth of a Southern white rhinoceros C. s. simum (Brand,
1980). The NZG is a member of the international zoo and aquarium community through
the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). The NZG has clearly aligned
itself strategically with the new roles and functions that zoos and aquariums are
required to play in the conservation of biodiversity, with conservation research,
education and science awareness being integral parts of the activities (WAZA, 2005;
Zimmermann et al., 2007; Dick &amp; Gusset, 2010). Through this global connectedness,
the NZG established linkages, partnerships, collaborations and sister relationships
with zoos from all corners of the world. Partnerships are also in place with research
and conservation organizations that undertake in situ conservation of threatened
species. In the African landscape, the NZG was the founder member of the regional
African Association of Zoos and Aquaria (PAAZAB). PAAZAB serves as a forum for shared
knowledge in ex situ conservation of wildlife biodiversity, skills development and
technical development in professional zoo practice, wildlife conservation education
and conservation research. The New Partnership for Africa's Development Science and
Technology Consolidated Plan of Action sees Africa's biodiversity as a major source
of economic and social transformation, although it is underutilized and being lost at
an alarming rate (Mugabe &amp; Ambali, 2006). The action plan argues for African
countries to establish regional networks of scientific centres of excellence to drive
conservation and sustainable use of the continent's biodiversity. As the only zoo in
the continent with a statutory mandate to undertake scientific research, the NZG is
appropriately positioned to lead and deliver on this continental
responsibility.<component x="47.45" y="70.71" width="179.37" height="113.89" page="1"

lateness="0.25" reference_score="6.94">On 1 April 2004, the NZG was declared a
National Research Facility and transferred to the management of the South African
National Research Foundation (NRF). South Africa's National Research Facilities are
high-end scientific and technical facilities with specialist equipment and skills
that are not duplicated anywhere else in the country. They serve as important
research platforms that are made accessible to the entire research community,
including universities and other components of the science system locally and
internationally. All National Research Facilities are managed by the NRF on behalf of
the nation and under the political direction of the National Department of Science
and Technology. The NRF is an autonomous government agency charged with supporting
research and human-resource development for science, engineering and technology in
South Africa. The fact that over 200 000 learners/scholars visit the facility
annually was a primary consideration in the declaration of the NZG as a National
Research Facility, in recognition of its potential to play a pivotal role in the
advancement of science in society. However, the NZG, which is a classical and old
(110 years old) zoo, had neither a distinguished history of research nor the primary
infrastructural platform to fulfil its new mandate at the time of its declaration as
a National Research Facility. National Research Facilities are expected to: (1)
provide a platform for high-quality research, accessible to the wider research
community both locally and internationally; (2) undertake high-quality research and
generate knowledge in areas of strategic national importance and competitive
advantage; (3) develop technology and pursue innovation in support of the national
effort for scientific, technological and social innovation; (4) grow human capital
through research and technology development in areas of strategic national importance
and for the development of a knowledge economy; (5) advance science in society

awareness and public engagement; supporting teaching and learning in science,
engineering and technology; communication of the relevance, importance, products and
benefits of science to/ for society. (WAZA, 2005), the second driver is 'to establish
the NZG as a world-class 21st century zoological garden'. The NZG is committed to
being a family attraction of first choice that inspires discovery, appreciation,
care, knowledge and respect for nature to fulfil the expectations of the 600 000 or
so visitors who pass through the gates every year. To this end, Agenda2015 commits
the NZG to become 'a top-class metropolitan ecotourism facility that places a premium
on environmental sustainability'. While advancing science in and for society, the NZG
also aims to be 'a place of learning and a source of inspiration to action for
science and biodiversity'. No organization can achieve any of its strategic
objectives without defining capabilities, people, culture and its values. Therefore,
the final strategic driver is 'the organization: transforming the NZG into an
organization that is capable, diverse, responsive, knowledge-led and embedded in core
values'. In giving the above exposition of the strategic framework of the NZG, the
description of its vision and mission was left until the end to tie together all the
strategic aspects into what the organization aspires to be. The vision of the NZG is
Nature and Humanity in Balance. NZG is committed to creating dynamic opportunities
for people and animals to connect and, thus, inculcate a healthy mutual respect and
acceptance of the other's place within nature's cycle. The mission statement
'inspired conservation of wildlife through knowledge, understanding and connection'
denotes the organization's commitment to the following. 1. Develop knowledge through
research that can underpin conservation practice and management of biodiversity.
Improve zoo operations and practice through continuous monitoring and review.
Evaluate and establish an evidence base for our actions and decisions through
knowledge generation. 2. Promote the understanding that humans are an integral part
of natural biodiversity and can act to protect the environment, nature, species and
their habitats. Promote the understanding that through action and changing our ways
of life we can protect the environment and save species and their habitats. Inculcate
understanding of the natural requirements of species and habitats that will enable
them to survive as a basis for protecting the earth for future generations to enjoy.
3. Illustrate the connection between wildlife, domestic animals, humans and
ecosystems as an integrated circle of life. Support education in schools using
conservation as a science and the school curriculum. Promote the animal collections
and (saving) species and their habitats in the wild and the science of conservation
and biodiversity management, on the one hand, and human-resource development on the
other. HATCHING THE WAY TO BEING A NATIONAL RESEARCH FACILITY Several research areas
have been established over the last 2-3 years and these are laying the foundation for
future research excellence. The NZG has a wildlife biomaterials bank (wBRC), which is
unique in that it encompasses components of multiple biobanks, such as microbial and
cell cultures, sperm bank, tissue bank, pathology bank and environmental tissue bank.
This represents an ideal platform for the development of a Knowledge Hub for both the
banking of biomaterials and reproductive physiology research. The wBRC forms an
integral part of an international partnership known as the South African
International Centre for Integrated Cryobiology, Research and Learning in partnership
with the University of KwaZuluNatal, the University of the Witwatersrand and
collaborators from the United Kingdom. Internationally, the wBRC is linked to and
participates in the International Society for Biological and Environmental
Depositories, Frozen Ark and the Barcode of Life initiatives, all being coalitions
aimed at deriving value from natural biodiversity residing in the form of
biomaterials in order to develop technologies and knowledge to benefit both nature
and humanity. In March 2009, the NZG launched its Centre for Conservation Science
(CfCS), a Knowledge and Training Hub that focuses on Conservation Biology and
Wildlife Biodiversity research. After wide local and global consultation, in
particular with the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany and
the Centre for Research and Conservation, Royal Society of Antwerp, Belgium, the
disciplines of wildlife epidemiology, behavioural ecology, molecular genetics,
wildlife nutrition and reproductive biology are targeted within the ex situ/in situ
interface. As the CfCS is well placed within the conservation community to develop
new and improved technologies through research, it also provides an opportunity to
offer research-orientated services and quality, efficient and professional expertise
to other zoological gardens, academic institutions, conservation agencies and
organizations. The CfCS has dedicated laboratories for wildlife pathology, veterinary
parasitology and molecular genetics with a sequencing laboratory and a veterinary
hospital. The staff, comprising a veterinary pathologist, a veterinary
parasitologist, a molecular geneticist, an ecologist, an animal nutritionist and
three clinical veterinarians, play a complementary role by contributing conservation
medicine input. Planning is under way to establish a Centre for Conservation Medicine
and Research, to expand the current Veterinary Hospital and establish it as a centre
of research excellence in this emerging science. Successful development of this area
will position the NZG as leader not only in the African continent but also globally
within an emerging knowledge field. Wildlife disease epidemiology focuses on targeted
research and diagnostics to investigate the causes, prevalence, distribution and
evolutionary consequences of wildlife diseases of captive and wild animals in Africa
(Espie et al., 2009; Junker et al., 2009; de Garine-Wichatitski et al., 2010). The
NZG has an extensive wildlife disease database and opportunistic, retrospective and
prospective research is carried out in order to understand the complex links between
animals, their environment and diseases. Current projects include the investigation
of the pathology of free-ranging and captive Cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus in southern
Africa. The first record of pathology of free-ranging Leopards Panthera pardus in the
Kruger National Park is an important project in collaboration with South African
National Parks (SANParks). Investigations into the pathology of free-ranging
Bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus and Humpback dolphins Sousa chinensis, in
collaboration with the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity, is the first
South African survey of marine mammals. Dolphins are important sentinels indicating
habitat degradation, and pathogen and/or chemical pollution. Avian influenza
surveillance of live, dead, captive and free-ranging birds is monitored in
collaboration with the University of Cape Town as part of an international programme
with global significance. An ex situ/ in situ emerging disease surveillance molecular
database for chytridimycosis in amphibians (the only one in Africa) is a first step
towards developing and applying key molecular diagnostic tests (Stuart et al., 2004;
Ro&#xA8;dder et al., 2009). Technological, competitive and innovative research is
undertaken to develop in situ hybridization techniques, molecular diagnostics for
parasite (blood, zoonotic) and disease detection, and investigate parasite pathogens,
diseases and vector control in wildlife. Roan antelope and Sable antelope Hippotragus
niger (on an individual and population scale) are the focus for an interdisciplinary
approach and multiplex detection of bacterial pathogens and molecular detection of
Cryptosporidium, toxoplasmosis and anaplasmosis. Cooperation with other research
groups is essential and includes the University of the Free State and University of
Venda in South Africa and, internationally, the National Research Centre for
Protozoan Diseases, Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Japan,
and the Oklahoma State University in the United States. Specific research projects
are an epidemiological and genetic diversity study of bovine anaplasmosis in South
Africa (Shkap et al., 2009); developing a dual priming oligonucleotide system for the
multiplex detection of bacterial pathogens in captive animals; characterization of
genes and proteins that can be used as vaccine candidates against parasitic
infections; genome sequencing of South African isolates of protozoan parasites and
the development of cell culture-derived vaccines for various animal diseases. The aim
is to improve understanding of zoonotic diseases and to optimize occupational health
of staff at the NZG through collaboration with the National Institute on Communicable
Diseases, Sandringham, South Africa. Together with regional veterinary and academic
institutions, capacity development in the Southern African Development Community
region is engaged in wildlife-disease diagnosis, particularly at the interface
between human, domestic animals and wildlife. The NZG is instrumental in the
development of a wildlife-diagnostic course with partners at the Veterinary Faculty,
University of Pretoria, SANParks and veterinarians representing different
organizations from Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The NZG has built up a unique resource to
conduct and promote molecular genetic research in Africa. As a result of habitat
fragmentation, a need to understand the relationships between the degree of genetic
diversity, phylogenetics and genetic factors that determine population viability is
essential. National genetic databases are being maintained and expanded for species
such as Blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus and Black wildebeest Connochaetes gnou
(Grobler et al., 2005), Black and White rhinoceros, Cheetahs, Southern ground
hornbills Bucorvus leadbeateri, oxpeckers, pangolins Manis sp, Sable antelope,
Tsessebe Damaliscus lunatus and African elephant Loxodonta africana. Research
projects range from the development and implementation of genetic techniques using
genetic markers to sequencing of genomes and DNA profiling as an aid for genetic
management of threatened populations and wildlife forensic-science investigations
(Kotze et al., 2008). A profitable and specialist unit has been established where
molecular genetic services are rendered on behalf of the African continent. Gender
determination in threatened birds, reptiles and mammals is part of a community
conservation project, whereby a free service is provided to all zoos in South Africa
(Dalton et al., 2010; Monadjem et al., 2010). A strong emphasis is on transfer of DNA
technology and here NZG collaborates nationally with several universities, national
and provincial conservation agencies and organizations. NZG has strong links with the
University of Vienna and the Research Institute for Wildlife and Ecology in Vienna,
Austria, on Cheetah molecular research, and with the Zoological Society of London,
UK, on chytrid detection using molecular techniques. The NZG is also working towards
the validation of cross-species and species-specific genetic markers in various
wildlife for forensic investigations. One of the flagship projects is the development
of single nucleotide polymorphisms as a tool for forensic investigations and genetic
characterization in White rhinoceros. Scientific information on the dietary and
nutritional requirements of every animal maintained by the NZG is an existing
challenge to the nutritional management of the animal collection. The specialization
of diets, energy budgets and feeding ecology is a focus while the building of
scientific capacity to become a leader in applied wildlife nutrition is still a
long-term aim. Links have been fostered with the University of Pretoria, the Tshwane
University of Technology in Pretoria and the University of KwaZulu Natal.
Nutrition-related projects include the detection of necrobacillosis in captive
Springbok Antidorcas marsupialis and a communitybased food-production initiative. The
focus of behavioural ecology is on finding ways to determine which elements in the
natural habitat of a particular animal species are most essential (essential habitat
features). Such elements would have to be present in the environment provided for
that species in captivity, as well as in areas identified for relocation or
reintroduction. Furthermore, attempts to identify indicators, both behavioural and
physiological, that signal the lack of one or more essential habitat features is an
aim and, to facilitate this, strong links have been developed with the Mammal
Research Institute of the University of Pretoria and the University of the
Witwatersrand (Fick et al., 2006; Kinahan et al., 2007; Meyer et al., 2008). Another
theme within this focus area is the management of fragmented populations in the urban
environment where a highly fragmented Giant bullfrog Pyxicephalus adspersus
population in Gauteng was investigated. The project is based on the prediction that
without management the population fragments will become extinct one-by-one as a
result of stochastic processes and genetic deterioration. Behaviour and movements of
individuals are monitored using radio frequency identification tags combined with
accelerometers. A public interface and engagement research focus area include four
components, namely conservation psychology, learning in an informal environment,
exhibit design and visitor studies. The nature and dynamics of the interface between
the NZG and the public, the impact of the science advancement activities of the NZG
and the extent to which the NZG meets the expectations and requirements of its
visitors and audiences are determined and examined. This programme is a collaborative
effort between the marketing, guest relation services, animal collection, research
and education functions of the NZG. Research projects currently under way include the
comparative evaluation of educational programmes at the NZG, Uganda Wildlife
Education Centre and Zoo Negara in Malaysia, two masters studies at the University of
Pretoria on experience management, and a survey of consumer perceptions and attitudes
in a South African organization. A further aim of the NZG is to create a critical
mass of African scientists, veterinarians and technicians with skills to engage in
wildlife conservation science. In this respect, the CfCS provides a platform for
scientists, veterinarians and students to conduct research, and access to facilities
and sharing of expertise on biodiversity conservation and animal health. With the
dedication of training undergraduate and postgraduate students, the CfCS adds value
to a growing and diverse body of conservationists, veterinary scientists, zoologists
and wildlife managers for Africa. CONCLUSION To achieve the aims described above, the
critical success factors will be a strong, sustained and diverse resource base, an
optimum number of quality, qualified, productive and passionate staff, and the
ability to establish, maintain and improve first-class facilities and equipment for
the animal collection, staff and visitors. It is clear that the NZG as a National
Research Facility can play a unique role fulfilling its mandate for conservation of
biodiversity. The only way of achieving success is to work in close collaboration
with other institutions in South Africa, Africa and internationally. It is these
institutions that need to recognize and acknowledge the new role of the NZG. In
return, the NZG will aim to assist these organizations to achieve their respective
mandates ultimately enhancing the collective efforts in southern Africa for the
conservation of regional biodiversity.<component x="57.43" y="541.94" width="169.38"

Africa (NZG) has been a declared National Research Facility of the National Research
Foundation (NRF) since 1 April 2004. As an independent government agency, the NRF
promotes and supports research in all knowledge fields. The National Research
Facilities, placed under the custodianship of the NRF, contribute to the provision of
a highquality research platform for the research community across the national
science system. The NZG as a National Research Facility is in a unique position to
generate new knowledge, core technologies and data pools/collections commensurate
with international standards. It provides a critical mass of equipment, skills and
users and the potential for networking and attracting collaboration. The facility
offers unique opportunities for the advancement of science and for an interface
between science and the public, and the additional provision of opportunities for
people development. The broad strategic contexts of the NZG are thematic drivers.
These drivers focus on the way the organization attracts, develops and retains
talent. The aim is to uphold excellence in all investments in knowledge, people and
infrastructure. Key-words: National System of Innovation; platform; research;
strategic drivers.<component x="47.45" y="234.8" width="179.42" height="204.54"

of South Africa (NZG) was founded in 1899 when the government of the time purchased
the farm Rus in Urbe from the celebrated South African author J. F. Cilliers to
establish a zoo. Today, it operates four sites in three provinces. Each site plays an
important role in adding value to the core functions of the organization. The main
site and headquarters are located in South Africa's capital city, Pretoria, in the
form of an 85 ha zoo. The 6000 ha Biodiversity Conservation Centre in Lichtenburg in
the North-West Province of the country has distinguished itself as a semi-in situ
site where White rhinoceros Ceratotherium simum have been bred successfully. The 1500
ha Biodiversity Conservation Centre in Mokopane in the Limpopo Province, located in
the north of South Africa, houses threatened species such as Roan antelope
Hippotragus equinus and Black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis, as well as other flagship
species that include Cape buffalo Syncerus caffer and Red-billed oxpeckers Buphagus
erythrorhynchus. In association with a commercial venture on the banks of the Vaal
River in Gauteng Province, the NZG also jointly manages a 14 ha zoo and an 89 ha
animal park. Collectively, these sites house one of the largest animal collections in
Africa, comprising 3117 specimens of 209 species of mammal, 1358 specimens of 202
species of bird, 3871 specimens of 190 species of fishes, 388 specimens of four
species of invertebrate, 309 specimens of 93 species of reptile and 44 specimens of
seven species of amphibian. A reptile park and the largest inland marine aquarium
further complement the collection. Acquired in 1916, the NZG is the only one of the
four governmental zoos in South Africa with national status. The only Komodo dragons
Varanus komodoensis and Koalas Phascolarctos cinereus on the African continent are
housed at the NZG. The 51 Bald ibises Geronticus eremita maintained by the NZG
constitute the largest breeding population of these birds in Africa and the NZG
observed the first ever zoo birth of a Southern white rhinoceros C. s. simum (Brand,
1980). The NZG is a member of the international zoo and aquarium community through
the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). The NZG has clearly aligned
itself strategically with the new roles and functions that zoos and aquariums are
required to play in the conservation of biodiversity, with conservation research,
education and science awareness being integral parts of the activities (WAZA, 2005;
Zimmermann et al., 2007; Dick &amp; Gusset, 2010). Through this global connectedness,
the NZG established linkages, partnerships, collaborations and sister relationships
with zoos from all corners of the world. Partnerships are also in place with research
and conservation organizations that undertake in situ conservation of threatened
species. In the African landscape, the NZG was the founder member of the regional
African Association of Zoos and Aquaria (PAAZAB). PAAZAB serves as a forum for shared
knowledge in ex situ conservation of wildlife biodiversity, skills development and
technical development in professional zoo practice, wildlife conservation education
and conservation research. The New Partnership for Africa's Development Science and
Technology Consolidated Plan of Action sees Africa's biodiversity as a major source
of economic and social transformation, although it is underutilized and being lost at
an alarming rate (Mugabe &amp; Ambali, 2006). The action plan argues for African
countries to establish regional networks of scientific centres of excellence to drive
conservation and sustainable use of the continent's biodiversity. As the only zoo in
the continent with a statutory mandate to undertake scientific research, the NZG is
appropriately positioned to lead and deliver on this continental
responsibility.<component x="47.45" y="70.71" width="179.37" height="113.89" page="1"

lateness="0.25" reference_score="6.94">On 1 April 2004, the NZG was declared a
National Research Facility and transferred to the management of the South African
National Research Foundation (NRF). South Africa's National Research Facilities are
high-end scientific and technical facilities with specialist equipment and skills
that are not duplicated anywhere else in the country. They serve as important
research platforms that are made accessible to the entire research community,
including universities and other components of the science system locally and
internationally. All National Research Facilities are managed by the NRF on behalf of
the nation and under the political direction of the National Department of Science
and Technology. The NRF is an autonomous government agency charged with supporting
research and human-resource development for science, engineering and technology in
South Africa. The fact that over 200 000 learners/scholars visit the facility
annually was a primary consideration in the declaration of the NZG as a National
Research Facility, in recognition of its potential to play a pivotal role in the
advancement of science in society. However, the NZG, which is a classical and old
(110 years old) zoo, had neither a distinguished history of research nor the primary
infrastructural platform to fulfil its new mandate at the time of its declaration as
a National Research Facility. National Research Facilities are expected to: (1)
provide a platform for high-quality research, accessible to the wider research
community both locally and internationally; (2) undertake high-quality research and
generate knowledge in areas of strategic national importance and competitive
advantage; (3) develop technology and pursue innovation in support of the national
effort for scientific, technological and social innovation; (4) grow human capital
through research and technology development in areas of strategic national importance
and for the development of a knowledge economy; (5) advance science in society

awareness and public engagement; supporting teaching and learning in science,
engineering and technology; communication of the relevance, importance, products and
benefits of science to/ for society. (WAZA, 2005), the second driver is 'to establish
the NZG as a world-class 21st century zoological garden'. The NZG is committed to
being a family attraction of first choice that inspires discovery, appreciation,
care, knowledge and respect for nature to fulfil the expectations of the 600 000 or
so visitors who pass through the gates every year. To this end, Agenda2015 commits
the NZG to become 'a top-class metropolitan ecotourism facility that places a premium
on environmental sustainability'. While advancing science in and for society, the NZG
also aims to be 'a place of learning and a source of inspiration to action for
science and biodiversity'. No organization can achieve any of its strategic
objectives without defining capabilities, people, culture and its values. Therefore,
the final strategic driver is 'the organization: transforming the NZG into an
organization that is capable, diverse, responsive, knowledge-led and embedded in core
values'. In giving the above exposition of the strategic framework of the NZG, the
description of its vision and mission was left until the end to tie together all the
strategic aspects into what the organization aspires to be. The vision of the NZG is
Nature and Humanity in Balance. NZG is committed to creating dynamic opportunities
for people and animals to connect and, thus, inculcate a healthy mutual respect and
acceptance of the other's place within nature's cycle. The mission statement
'inspired conservation of wildlife through knowledge, understanding and connection'
denotes the organization's commitment to the following. 1. Develop knowledge through
research that can underpin conservation practice and management of biodiversity.
Improve zoo operations and practice through continuous monitoring and review.
Evaluate and establish an evidence base for our actions and decisions through
knowledge generation. 2. Promote the understanding that humans are an integral part
of natural biodiversity and can act to protect the environment, nature, species and
their habitats. Promote the understanding that through action and changing our ways
of life we can protect the environment and save species and their habitats. Inculcate
understanding of the natural requirements of species and habitats that will enable
them to survive as a basis for protecting the earth for future generations to enjoy.
3. Illustrate the connection between wildlife, domestic animals, humans and
ecosystems as an integrated circle of life. Support education in schools using
conservation as a science and the school curriculum. Promote the animal collections
and (saving) species and their habitats in the wild and the science of conservation
and biodiversity management, on the one hand, and human-resource development on the
other. HATCHING THE WAY TO BEING A NATIONAL RESEARCH FACILITY Several research areas
have been established over the last 2-3 years and these are laying the foundation for
future research excellence. The NZG has a wildlife biomaterials bank (wBRC), which is
unique in that it encompasses components of multiple biobanks, such as microbial and
cell cultures, sperm bank, tissue bank, pathology bank and environmental tissue bank.
This represents an ideal platform for the development of a Knowledge Hub for both the
banking of biomaterials and reproductive physiology research. The wBRC forms an
integral part of an international partnership known as the South African
International Centre for Integrated Cryobiology, Research and Learning in partnership
with the University of KwaZuluNatal, the University of the Witwatersrand and
collaborators from the United Kingdom. Internationally, the wBRC is linked to and
participates in the International Society for Biological and Environmental
Depositories, Frozen Ark and the Barcode of Life initiatives, all being coalitions
aimed at deriving value from natural biodiversity residing in the form of
biomaterials in order to develop technologies and knowledge to benefit both nature
and humanity. In March 2009, the NZG launched its Centre for Conservation Science
(CfCS), a Knowledge and Training Hub that focuses on Conservation Biology and
Wildlife Biodiversity research. After wide local and global consultation, in
particular with the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany and
the Centre for Research and Conservation, Royal Society of Antwerp, Belgium, the
disciplines of wildlife epidemiology, behavioural ecology, molecular genetics,
wildlife nutrition and reproductive biology are targeted within the ex situ/in situ
interface. As the CfCS is well placed within the conservation community to develop
new and improved technologies through research, it also provides an opportunity to
offer research-orientated services and quality, efficient and professional expertise
to other zoological gardens, academic institutions, conservation agencies and
organizations. The CfCS has dedicated laboratories for wildlife pathology, veterinary
parasitology and molecular genetics with a sequencing laboratory and a veterinary
hospital. The staff, comprising a veterinary pathologist, a veterinary
parasitologist, a molecular geneticist, an ecologist, an animal nutritionist and
three clinical veterinarians, play a complementary role by contributing conservation
medicine input. Planning is under way to establish a Centre for Conservation Medicine
and Research, to expand the current Veterinary Hospital and establish it as a centre
of research excellence in this emerging science. Successful development of this area
will position the NZG as leader not only in the African continent but also globally
within an emerging knowledge field. Wildlife disease epidemiology focuses on targeted
research and diagnostics to investigate the causes, prevalence, distribution and
evolutionary consequences of wildlife diseases of captive and wild animals in Africa
(Espie et al., 2009; Junker et al., 2009; de Garine-Wichatitski et al., 2010). The
NZG has an extensive wildlife disease database and opportunistic, retrospective and
prospective research is carried out in order to understand the complex links between
animals, their environment and diseases. Current projects include the investigation
of the pathology of free-ranging and captive Cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus in southern
Africa. The first record of pathology of free-ranging Leopards Panthera pardus in the
Kruger National Park is an important project in collaboration with South African
National Parks (SANParks). Investigations into the pathology of free-ranging
Bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus and Humpback dolphins Sousa chinensis, in
collaboration with the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity, is the first
South African survey of marine mammals. Dolphins are important sentinels indicating
habitat degradation, and pathogen and/or chemical pollution. Avian influenza
surveillance of live, dead, captive and free-ranging birds is monitored in
collaboration with the University of Cape Town as part of an international programme
with global significance. An ex situ/ in situ emerging disease surveillance molecular
database for chytridimycosis in amphibians (the only one in Africa) is a first step
towards developing and applying key molecular diagnostic tests (Stuart et al., 2004;
Ro&#xA8;dder et al., 2009). Technological, competitive and innovative research is
undertaken to develop in situ hybridization techniques, molecular diagnostics for
parasite (blood, zoonotic) and disease detection, and investigate parasite pathogens,
diseases and vector control in wildlife. Roan antelope and Sable antelope Hippotragus
niger (on an individual and population scale) are the focus for an interdisciplinary
approach and multiplex detection of bacterial pathogens and molecular detection of
Cryptosporidium, toxoplasmosis and anaplasmosis. Cooperation with other research
groups is essential and includes the University of the Free State and University of
Venda in South Africa and, internationally, the National Research Centre for
Protozoan Diseases, Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Japan,
and the Oklahoma State University in the United States. Specific research projects
are an epidemiological and genetic diversity study of bovine anaplasmosis in South
Africa (Shkap et al., 2009); developing a dual priming oligonucleotide system for the
multiplex detection of bacterial pathogens in captive animals; characterization of
genes and proteins that can be used as vaccine candidates against parasitic
infections; genome sequencing of South African isolates of protozoan parasites and
the development of cell culture-derived vaccines for various animal diseases. The aim
is to improve understanding of zoonotic diseases and to optimize occupational health
of staff at the NZG through collaboration with the National Institute on Communicable
Diseases, Sandringham, South Africa. Together with regional veterinary and academic
institutions, capacity development in the Southern African Development Community
region is engaged in wildlife-disease diagnosis, particularly at the interface
between human, domestic animals and wildlife. The NZG is instrumental in the
development of a wildlife-diagnostic course with partners at the Veterinary Faculty,
University of Pretoria, SANParks and veterinarians representing different
organizations from Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The NZG has built up a unique resource to
conduct and promote molecular genetic research in Africa. As a result of habitat
fragmentation, a need to understand the relationships between the degree of genetic
diversity, phylogenetics and genetic factors that determine population viability is
essential. National genetic databases are being maintained and expanded for species
such as Blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus and Black wildebeest Connochaetes gnou
(Grobler et al., 2005), Black and White rhinoceros, Cheetahs, Southern ground
hornbills Bucorvus leadbeateri, oxpeckers, pangolins Manis sp, Sable antelope,
Tsessebe Damaliscus lunatus and African elephant Loxodonta africana. Research
projects range from the development and implementation of genetic techniques using
genetic markers to sequencing of genomes and DNA profiling as an aid for genetic
management of threatened populations and wildlife forensic-science investigations
(Kotze et al., 2008). A profitable and specialist unit has been established where
molecular genetic services are rendered on behalf of the African continent. Gender
determination in threatened birds, reptiles and mammals is part of a community
conservation project, whereby a free service is provided to all zoos in South Africa
(Dalton et al., 2010; Monadjem et al., 2010). A strong emphasis is on transfer of DNA
technology and here NZG collaborates nationally with several universities, national
and provincial conservation agencies and organizations. NZG has strong links with the
University of Vienna and the Research Institute for Wildlife and Ecology in Vienna,
Austria, on Cheetah molecular research, and with the Zoological Society of London,
UK, on chytrid detection using molecular techniques. The NZG is also working towards
the validation of cross-species and species-specific genetic markers in various
wildlife for forensic investigations. One of the flagship projects is the development
of single nucleotide polymorphisms as a tool for forensic investigations and genetic
characterization in White rhinoceros. Scientific information on the dietary and
nutritional requirements of every animal maintained by the NZG is an existing
challenge to the nutritional management of the animal collection. The specialization
of diets, energy budgets and feeding ecology is a focus while the building of
scientific capacity to become a leader in applied wildlife nutrition is still a
long-term aim. Links have been fostered with the University of Pretoria, the Tshwane
University of Technology in Pretoria and the University of KwaZulu Natal.
Nutrition-related projects include the detection of necrobacillosis in captive
Springbok Antidorcas marsupialis and a communitybased food-production initiative. The
focus of behavioural ecology is on finding ways to determine which elements in the
natural habitat of a particular animal species are most essential (essential habitat
features). Such elements would have to be present in the environment provided for
that species in captivity, as well as in areas identified for relocation or
reintroduction. Furthermore, attempts to identify indicators, both behavioural and
physiological, that signal the lack of one or more essential habitat features is an
aim and, to facilitate this, strong links have been developed with the Mammal
Research Institute of the University of Pretoria and the University of the
Witwatersrand (Fick et al., 2006; Kinahan et al., 2007; Meyer et al., 2008). Another
theme within this focus area is the management of fragmented populations in the urban
environment where a highly fragmented Giant bullfrog Pyxicephalus adspersus
population in Gauteng was investigated. The project is based on the prediction that
without management the population fragments will become extinct one-by-one as a
result of stochastic processes and genetic deterioration. Behaviour and movements of
individuals are monitored using radio frequency identification tags combined with
accelerometers. A public interface and engagement research focus area include four
components, namely conservation psychology, learning in an informal environment,
exhibit design and visitor studies. The nature and dynamics of the interface between
the NZG and the public, the impact of the science advancement activities of the NZG
and the extent to which the NZG meets the expectations and requirements of its
visitors and audiences are determined and examined. This programme is a collaborative
effort between the marketing, guest relation services, animal collection, research
and education functions of the NZG. Research projects currently under way include the
comparative evaluation of educational programmes at the NZG, Uganda Wildlife
Education Centre and Zoo Negara in Malaysia, two masters studies at the University of
Pretoria on experience management, and a survey of consumer perceptions and attitudes
in a South African organization. A further aim of the NZG is to create a critical
mass of African scientists, veterinarians and technicians with skills to engage in
wildlife conservation science. In this respect, the CfCS provides a platform for
scientists, veterinarians and students to conduct research, and access to facilities
and sharing of expertise on biodiversity conservation and animal health. With the
dedication of training undergraduate and postgraduate students, the CfCS adds value
to a growing and diverse body of conservationists, veterinary scientists, zoologists
and wildlife managers for Africa. CONCLUSION To achieve the aims described above, the
critical success factors will be a strong, sustained and diverse resource base, an
optimum number of quality, qualified, productive and passionate staff, and the
ability to establish, maintain and improve first-class facilities and equipment for
the animal collection, staff and visitors. It is clear that the NZG as a National
Research Facility can play a unique role fulfilling its mandate for conservation of
biodiversity. The only way of achieving success is to work in close collaboration
with other institutions in South Africa, Africa and internationally. It is these
institutions that need to recognize and acknowledge the new role of the NZG. In
return, the NZG will aim to assist these organizations to achieve their respective
mandates ultimately enhancing the collective efforts in southern Africa for the
conservation of regional biodiversity.<component x="57.43" y="541.94" width="169.38"
