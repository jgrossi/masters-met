Darwin's birth, and for the last 12 months zoologists have been reminded of the
enormous contribution that Darwin made to our understanding of the natural world. We
have celebrated his contribution in workshops and symposia, often in association with
other professional bodies like the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS),
but more importantly for this journal, we have celebrated Darwin's work through
publication of how his work has impacted upon present day science. Darwin would have
been delighted with the understanding that has arisen through our discoveries in
molecular biology. He would have been overjoyed with knowledge of the nature of DNA,
but I suspect he would have been surprised, perhaps even alarmed at the impact that
humans have had on the environment and the effect that this has had on the biosphere.
We are well aware that environments change, and the geological record is testament to
this, but it is the rapidity with which this change is occurring that is of concern.
We have lost many taxa already, and sadly we will lose many more - perhaps even
before they are described. The biological science community has taken this plight on
board, and our concerns have been recognized through the naming of 2010 as the
International Year of Biodiversity (the IUBS has gone a step further in naming the
period 2010-1012 as the Triennium for Biodiversity). How we communi cat e our
concerns, not j ust t o t he sci ent i fi c community, but beyond, will be a measure
of us as bioscientists - i.e. as guardians of the Earth's biosphere. Integrative
Zoology provides a vehicle for us to demonstrate o u r c o n c e r n s , f o r o n l
y t h r o u g h a d o p t i o n o f multidisciplinary approaches can we anticipate
mitigation of t he enormous damage we have caused i n t he environment. An
integrative approach is not just a desire, it is an imperative. We can be confident
that the journal Integrative Zoology will be an important vehicle for change, and we
are delighted to be able to report that it has been indexed in the ISI Web of Science
- recognition that we have reached a high level of credibility in science
communication. This issue of Integrative Zoology focuses upon the biological
consequences of climate change. We hope that readers will find papers that will
inspire, challenge and provide insight into how we may better manage our natural
world.<component x="62.34" y="161.78" width="230.19" height="313.36" page="1"
