in zoology. Today, the way in which names are used is governed by the International
Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN, 1999). In essence the Code governing binomial
nomenclature requires that the names we attach to taxa must have four elements (a
generic name, a name in the 'species-group', one or more authors - or describers -
and the date of description). Special importance is attached to the date due to the
Principle of Priority (Art. 23, ICZN, 1999). Only by using the Article applicable to
dating (Art. 21, ICZN, 1999) do we determine between two names separately bestowed
upon the same taxon. The Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London was, for
much of the 19th century, the English language journal of choice for the description
of new animals. Dating the name then given is not quite as simple as we might like it
to be. Researchers are well aware that the volume year of the Proceedings of the
Zoological Society of London should not be cited lightly as the date of publication.
For years it was routine practice for the papers read at meetings late one year to be
published next spring within the volume year based for the period when the paper was
read. There were also years when publication fell behind schedule. From the calendar
years 1831 to 1858 we do not know the dates of publication; the records show when the
printers delivered printed parts to the Society but not when these were published
(Duncan, 1937). From 1859 to 1900, and on through to 1926, the dates of publication
of the parts were brought together and explained by Duncan (1937) and his dates are
now<component x="50.95" y="65.65" width="239.11" height="353.19" page="1"

and 1860 suffer from dating to a period of several months, rather to a precise month.
Duncan also set out the page limits to the published parts, with some gaps for the
1872 and 1874 volumes, and these we also rely upon. Since then, Cowan (1973) was able
to provide some missing pagination data for the 1872 and 1874 volumes. The work
reported here shows that Duncan's information on the pagination of parts is extremely
accurate, but not faultless. Recently details were set out (Dickinson, 2004) that
confirmed from the 1887 volume that the Proceedings, at times at least, appeared in
two states. One as printed when concluding an issue, and the second as reprinted as
part of the complete signature with which a new issue was commenced. It has now been
possible to examine the volumes and wrappers for each year from 1859 to 1900 and
further information is here provided that should satisfy future needs for precision
in cases where two states of publication seemed likely to have occurred at the end of
the last issue within a calendar year and the beginning of the final issue in the
same volume. Happily such cases are rare. No attempt has been made to deal with the
monthcritical cases where it may be necessary to decide on a similar matter in the
context of prior issues in a volume as these are not date critical to the year.
However, the cases explained below, and the table naming a library where wrappers
will be found for that volume, will familiarize readers with what to look for if they
need to date monthcritical cases more definitely and thus have to examine earlier
numbers in the volumes. The reader may assume that a volume between 1859 and 1900
that is not discussed below has a clean and obvious break between the two issues that
concern us and that is wholly unambiguous and consistent with Duncan (1937). It will
be recalled that there were three issues a year from 1859 to 1873 and four issues a
year from 1874 to 1900.<component x="302.0" y="42.68" width="239.11" height="399.01"

flycatcher Muscicapa ussheri that was introduced on page 590. The wrappers show that
the use of extra paper stock for reprinting the minimum amount of extra print on page
591 was avoided by the expedient of completing this text on the inside back of the
wrapper itself, using 3/4 of the page. When printing the fourth issue page 591 thus
contains 3/4 of a page of reprinted text and 1/4 of a page starts paper 12 from the

printed on the inside back of the wrapper for Part III and then reprinted on good

not seeing the wrapper, seem to have been half printed in 1889 and half in

Hope Librarian in the Entomology Department of Oxford University but found wrappers
to be lacking in these two volumes as did Clair Castle at the Balfour and Newton

final and most elusive of the volumes to be traced was found at the Central Science

flycatcher Muscicapa ussheri that was introduced on page 590. The wrappers show that
the use of extra paper stock for reprinting the minimum amount of extra print on page
591 was avoided by the expedient of completing this text on the inside back of the
wrapper itself, using 3/4 of the page. When printing the fourth issue page 591 thus
contains 3/4 of a page of reprinted text and 1/4 of a page starts paper 12 from the

printed on the inside back of the wrapper for Part III and then reprinted on good

in providing access to the Mammal Department set which is particularly rich in

volume available for inspection. Several earlier attempts were made to locate this
and the last remaining volume and Linda Birch (Oxford) kindly made enquiries of the
Hope Librarian in the Entomology Department of Oxford University but found wrappers
to be lacking in these two volumes as did Clair Castle at the Balfour and Newton
Library (Cambridge), June Harvey in the Entomology Library at the NHM(South
Kensington), Ronald de Ruiter (Naturalis, Leiden) and Ante Strand (Stockholm). The
final and most elusive of the volumes to be traced was found at the Central Science
Library, Cambridge thanks to Kees Rookmaaker; the library staff kindly made this
available. Finally special thanks are owed to Nigel Roche at the Printing Library, St
Brides, London, for guidance regarding signatures, an understanding of which helped
