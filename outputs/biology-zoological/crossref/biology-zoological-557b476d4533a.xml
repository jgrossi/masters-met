comparative metric used in experimental and observational research into the causes of
aging (Comfort, 1979; Austad &amp; Fischer, 1991; Holmes &amp; Austad, 1995;
Wilkinson &amp; South, 2002; Hulbert et al., 2007), and it is often taken as the key
endpoint in comparisons among species, genotypes, or groups exposed to different
environmental manipulations. Comparative biogerontologists have long made use of MRLS
as a surrogate for species-specific aging rates, and much effort has gone into
compiling tables of MRLS values for this purpose (Finch, 1990; Carey &amp; Judge,
2000; de Magalhaes &amp; Costa, 2009). It is widely appreciated, however, that MRLS
is a problematic indicator for several reasons. First, MRLS is a downwardly biased
indicator of extreme lifespan. As sample sizes increase, expected MRLS values are
expected to increase as well. Second, the sample variance associated with estimates
of population MRLS may be high, especially with small sample sizes. These two issues
may present serious problems in comparative studies involving rare nonlaboratory
animals. Consequently, MRLS may differ across species owing to differences in the
number of species records used to determine longevity as well as to inherent
differences in the physiology and ecology of the species. Third, MRLS does not use
data effectively in situations where records are incomplete, which is often the case
in many observational studies where the terminal recorded event for an individual may
not be death (i.e., right censoring). Lastly, it reflects lifespan of a single
individual per species, grossly underestimating the characteristics of other members
of the species. Given the concern that some record-breaking lifespans may be
exaggerated (Steven Austad, personal communication), such extreme dependence on
single outliers is undesirable. Other metrics have been introduced in attempts to
improve upon MRLS by applying multivariate demographic models of aging, such as
Gompertz or Weibull functions, to survival data (Promislow, 1991; Wilson, 1994;
Ricklefs &amp; Scheuerlein, 2002). In some cases, these parameters have been assigned
controversial biological interpretations, as, for example, when the slope of a
Gompertz plot is interpreted as a measure of the rate at which aging occurs (Finch et
al., 1990; Pletcher et al., 2000; Bronikowski et al., 2011), and the intercept of a
Gompertz plot is interpreted as the inherent frailty of the members of the population
(Spencer &amp; Promislow, 2005; Maklakov et al., 2006; Flatt &amp; Kawecki, 2007). In
other cases, parameter estimates derived from these models are combined, for example,
by multiplication, to arrive at a univariate summary of aging rates (Ricklefs, 1998;
Ricklefs &amp; Scheuerlein, 2001). Nonparametric methods have also been proposed that
summarize the lifespan distribution of an elite subset of the population into
quantiles and or means (Wang et al., &#x2044; 2004; Gao et al., 2008). One
significant advantage of these alternative methods over MRLS is that their
application is not limited to the empirical distributions of complete lifespans; they
can benefit from the use of the Kaplan-Meier estimator, which allows the use of
censored data. Each of these estimators, and their combinations, has only an indirect
relationship to the underlying biological processes of aging, and it is unclear how
well these longevity metrics perform compared to MRLS as an index of differences of
the pace of age-related change among biologically interesting populations. Questions
about the evolution of different aging rates and the cellular and molecular processes
that can lead to striking differences in longevity among related species are the
central arena for comparative<component x="307.84" y="78.86" width="244.71"

mammals, MRLS values among species of rodents or primates can vary four- to
eightfold. Many evaluations of hypotheses about comparative aging among species have
depended on MRLS as the index of inter-species differences in aging rate, despite the
measure's well-known defects. Our goal in this project was to make use of population
data, obtained from zoo populations of nearly 200 bird and mammal species, to explore
the sampling properties of various univariate aging and longevity metrics. Some of
these metrics have been proposed by others, but some have not previously been applied
to questions in the comparative biology of aging. We wished to understand how well
each measure indicates extreme lifespan across a phylogenetically diverse range of
species that differ in life history and data quality. In addition, we wanted to
understand how robust each metric is to sampling effects, namely sampling variance
and bias arising from small population sizes. A major goal of this study was to
understand the limitations of MRLS as a comparative longevity metric and, if
possible, identify an alternative measure for MRLS that minimizes the sampling issues
and data-use restrictions associated with that measure. The datasets available to
test hypotheses in the comparative biology of aging differ in the proportion of
missing values and in the extent of erroneous data. The data often combine records
from wild and captive populations that differ in environmental factors (housing
conditions, food availability, reproductive histories, predation, infection levels,
etc.) that can have strong effects on mortality risks through both age-dependent and
age-independent pathways. Although tables of MRLS values across species contain a
good deal of information critical to testing ideas about the biology of aging, there
is a pressing need to develop improved demographic endpoints for
biogerontology.<component x="42.8" y="426.21" width="244.71" height="303.62" page="2"

the aging process begins at any defined life history transition (birth, puberty, age
at first reproduction), we assume here that deaths at the earliest ages, for example
perinatal deaths and deaths of juveniles, are unlikely to be informative about
inter-population variances in aging rates. We therefore used two methods to determine
the age before which mortality should be ignored, and we report the results derived
from both methods. We analyzed the subset of individuals from each species with
events (deaths or last observations) that met or exceeded one of two species-specific
truncation ages: (i) T , the age of 1 reproductive maturity for that species, or (ii)
T , the age at which the mor2 tality rate reaches a minimum (see Table S1 for
species, relevant life history information, and T estimates). Across the 163 species
that had at least 50 adults defined by both threshold definitions (T and T ), the
trun1 2 q cation ages correlated reasonably well ( = 0.53, P &lt; 0.0001, Spearman's
rank correlation; see Fig. 1). Nearly two-thirds of the species with both T and T
estimates had an age at minimal mortality that exceeded 1 2 the age at reproductive
onset (108 of 163 species). This pattern is consistent with Promislow's (1991)
earlier analysis of a much smaller set of species records in which he showed T &lt; T
in 75% (18 of 24) of cases 1 2 where age at maturity and age at minimal mortality
differed. More recent life history analyses also show that the onset of aging tends
to follow the timing of reproductive maturity (Jones et al., 2008; Peron et al.,
2010). The correlation between T and T estimates strengthened slightly when 1 2 the
collection of species was reduced to include only the 125 species with q 150 or more
adults ( = 0.58, P &lt; 0.0001). While the positive correlation was encouraging, it
seemed prudent to analyze the sampling properties of the various metrics using each
T-definition independently. As we show<component x="42.8" y="75.56" width="244.72"

population size affected the ranking of lifespan metrics across all study species.
Every population (for our purposes, a population was considered the worldwide
collection of animals of the same species, and we use species and population
interchangeably) was re-sampled n times with replacement, where n was each species'
sample i i size, and each species was ranked in order of each longevity value
(resulting in 16 metric-specific ranking vectors). For example, a MRLS vector may be
ordered species A &gt; species B &gt; species C &gt; species D and a W A vector may
rank species B &gt; D &gt; A &gt; C. This procedure was repeated, and each pair of
metric-specific ranking vectors was analyzed for stability. Rank persistence, as
inferred by a low Spearman's footrule distance D q and a high Spearman's ranked
correlation coefficient , quantified how robust each measure was to sampling
variation. We investigated four population size treatments. The n 50 treatment
included all species &#x2021; populations with at least 50 observed adult deaths (n =
175, T1,50 n = 165). We performed three other rank persistence analyses using T2,50

reasoned that the species rankings reflected both inherent differences in the biology
of species as well as variation in the size of the pooled zoo animal population

datasets available for testing hypotheses about species differences in aging and
longevity are also likely to contain a preponderance of small populations, similar in
this way to the datasets available through ISIS. We attempted to remove the latter
source of variation from our rank persistence analysis by randomizing sample size. As
before, a rank persistence analysis was performed using populations with adult
numbers of at least 50, 150, 500, and 1500 individuals. In this treatment, however,
the re-sampling procedure was changed. Instead of taking n samples from each species

mammal species have evolved that differ widely in life histories, including variation
in the rate at which aging leads to increased risks of mortality owing to disease and
infirmity. This rich set of related species could, in principle, be used to generate
and evaluate hypotheses about the cellular and physiological factors that time the
aging process, factors that make it very unlikely that a particular mouse will
survive 5 years, a dog survive 20 years, and a human survive 110 years. Lifespan is a
convenient, if flawed, surrogate for addressing hypotheses about the biological basis
for aging rates because many factors besides age change can lead to death, and
because aging leads to many consequences in addition to changes in mortality risk.
Ideally, hypotheses about the distribution of aging rates and age-dependent changes
across species could be tested by a database in which multiple age-sensitive traits
had been tested in hundreds of individuals across a wide range of diverse species. In
practice, however, physiological data of this kind are available only for a handful
of species, and for most species the only available data relevant to questions of
comparative aging rate are in the form of survival tables. The obvious problem is to
determine the best way to summarize these population-specific tables and provide a

relatively well, providing speA cies ranks that were roughly as persistent as the
quantile-based measures. The largest change in relative performance involved
nonparametric measures M16LS and M32LS; these were middling-to-good performers with
fixed populations sizes but very poor performers when sample sizes are randomized. It
appeared that for metrics MxLS, increasing x made for better metrics when samples
sizes were fixed but worse metrics when sample sizes varied. This makes sense when we
consider that, in terms of population lifespan quantiles, MxLS has different meanings
as population size changes. Using unrealistically low population sizes to illustrate
this point, MRLS is Q in a population of 20 but equal to Q 95 50 (the longevity
median) in a population of two. Results were largely unaffected by our choice of
T-definitions and perq sistence metric (D or ). In no case did altering these choices
change a topfive performing metric (in terms of rank persistence) into a bottom-five
q performer. Ranked correlations between D and values were very high in all
population size treatments and using both T-definitions, with ranked<component

preserves relevant biological information relating to lifespan while disregarding the
effects of extraneous or confounding factors, such as population size. Despite the
widespread appreciation of its statistical association with population size, the MRLS
is favored by comparative biologists because it is believed to measure an
individuals' intrinsic potential for long life. The degree to which the other metrics
measured this maximum, without regard for the biasing effects of small sample size,
is quantified by the partial correlations between candidate metrics and MRLS, holding
population size constant. Population size bias is addressed more directly by the
total correlation between sample size and metric value. Ideally, the best measures of
extreme lifespan are those with the greatest magnitude of partial correlations with
MRLS and the least magnitude of the total correlation between the measure and sample
size. By these criteria, the best are those that nonparametrically define some
well-defined elite fraction of the population: Q , Q , e , and e . Given that adult
lifespans are 90 95 90 95 typically right-skewed, we expected that measures of
central tendency should be affected least by sample size. Instead, we found negative
correlations between these measures and n that were slightly stronger than those
obtained from Q , Q , e , and e . Good evidence has been col90 95 90 95 lected to
suggest that animal size and lifespan are positively associated. If zoos favor larger
collections of smaller animals (a feasible expectation given resource limitations),
then these negative correlations between n and mean and median lifespans may reflect
true associations between intrinsic aging and population size and not simply bias.
Such associations would cause effects that act in opposition to the effects of sample
size bias on MRLS estimates. Put differently, maximum recorded lifespan would be more
sensitive to n than reflected by our correlation estimate. We note, however, that
regardless of whether we choose the ideal correlation to be zero or slightly
negative, Q , Q , e , and e still appear to 90 95 90 95 best satisfy these criteria
for best longevity metrics. Because MRLS observations depend upon the identification
of single individuals, it seemed reasonable to expect that estimates would suffer
from high sampling error. Indeed, our re-sampling analysis indicated that MRLS had a
larger sampling variance than the quantile-based measures at all sample sizes. The
difference intensified when species were disassociated from population sizes,
suggesting that small sample bias may contribute to the sampling error for MRLS. Most
parametric estimates suffered from high sample variance. The quantile-based measures
produced the most reliable estimates, especially when population sizes were allowed
to vary. Excluding those that describe the central tendency, we see that the least
extreme measures Q and e are the least variable. 90 90 The 90th quantile of adult
lifespan, Q , and the average of the top 90 10th percentile of adult lifespan, e ,
appear to be the best alternatives to 90 using MRLS as a comparative metric for
extreme lifespan. Both correlate well with MRLS when sample size is corrected for,
correlate weakly with population size, and demonstrate relatively little sampling
variance. Furthermore, both can accommodate right-censored data. Neither

over the other based upon the sampling characteristics analyzed here. However, one
may prefer Q over e if 90 90 extreme lifespan exaggeration was considered to be a
problem, because Q is expected to be more robust to this effect than e . We recommend
90 90 that future aging studies consider using the 90th quantile lifespan as a
comparative metric. The metrics that took the average of a set number of elite
individuals (MxLS) performed poorly as candidate metrics for extreme lifespan. Not
surprisingly, MxLS measures correlated extremely well with MRLS when population size
was held constant. However, the positive correlation between the measure and
population size increased for this family of measures. Our rank persistence analysis
illustrated problems inherent in the use of MxLS as a comparative metric. When
population sizes were not randomized, MRLS and the closely related M4LS performed
well, as indicated by high rank persistence to re-sampling. Similar methods that
correlate well to MRLS (M16LS and M32LS) also performed well under these conditions.
However, when population sizes were randomized to decouple the effects of biology and
animal collection size, these performed very poorly compared to other measures. The
reason for this is evident if we recognize that MxLS is the mean of the top 1 (n x) n
&#x2044; ) ) percentile of the population. Because the threshold for inclusion is
sensitive to population size, variation in population size varies the lifespans of
the individuals included in the measure. Judged as univariate descriptors of
longevity, measures based upon parameterized demographic models performed poorly as a
group, with the exception of the Weibull intercepts, W . Estimates of these metrics A
seemed to be more sensitive to our choice of method for delineating the aging and
nonaging segments of each species life history. These metrics correlated poorly with
MRLS, holding population size constant. With respect to the Weibull-based omega
values, our results (using T 1 as our definition of adulthood, the partial
correlation was 0.238 and ) the total correlation was 0.464) contrast sharply with a
full correlation ) between and MRLS of 0.83 across 150 captive vertebrate species )
recently reported by Ricklefs (2010b). At least two reasons may account for this
discrepancy. First, our analytical methods differ: Ricklefs uses least-squares
regression to fit a three-parameter Weibull model to death records at all ages (we
use maximum likelihood to fit a twoparameter model to adult events) and he does not
consider right-censored observations (we do). Second, the numbers of animal records
per species tend to be far greater in our study. If small sample sizes upwardly bias
estimates of omega (this is speculation on our part), then the variance in sample
size across species (such as both studies find) will generate excess negative
correlations between omega and MRLS. The results from the rank persistence analyses
suggested that the demographic parameters, especially those that describe the slopes
of mortality functions, are subject to high sampling variance. The Weibull intercept,
however, demonstrated high partial correlations with MRLS and low sampling variances.
Our only reason for not recommending this measure is that it correlated more strongly
with population size, which suggests that it is a more biased measure than some of
the nonparametric alternatives. While much attention in comparative biogerontology
focuses on measures of extreme lifespan, investigators might consider using measures
of central tendencies instead. There are at several reasons for doing so. First, as
we show here, mean adult lifespan exhibits the least amount of sampling variance. It
is the most repeatable measure that we investigated. Second, compared to MRLS, there
is far less association between population size and metric estimates. As we have
argued, there is reason to believe that mean lifespan should be the measure that is
least biased by small sample size. Third, mean lifespan is highly correlated with
MRLS (correcting for population size), with a partial correlation coefficient of
between 0.91 and 0.93. Other measures, such as Q , may perform better in this
respect, but 90 it appears that a great deal of the biological information that is
parameterized by maximum lifespan is also expressed by the mean lifespan of those
animals that live at least as long as the ages measured by T and T . Last, 1 2 the
most familiar definitions and predictions of the evolutionary change of phenotypes
from one generation to the next are expressed as changes in the means (Robertson,
1966; Price, 1970, 1972; Lande &amp; Arnold, 1983). In evolutionary biology, it is
changes in the means, and occasionally the variances, of phenotypes that are nearly
always the subject of study. We note, though, that the means and medians used for our
calculations are for samples that exclude perinatal and a high proportion of juvenile
mortality, and cannot be used to evaluate issues related to life expectancy at birth
or proportions of offspring surviving to reproductive age. Ultimately, the choice of
whether to compare means or extremes may depend upon the nature of the comparative
question that is under study. We recommend, however, that this decision is made
explicit and justified by each study. Comparative biogerontologists have prepared
extensive compilations of MRLS data, and for many meta-analyses MRLS may,
unfortunately, be the only available measure currently available. Compilation of
similar lists of Q values and mean lifespans of animals surviving 90 at least to T or
T would be a worthwhile project for field biologists and 1 2 zoo consortia to tackle
as a service to aging research, and we recommend that such statistics be routinely
included in reports about lifespan and aging in wild, captive, and experimental
populations. In this respect, our study makes an important contribution by providing
these estimates for nearly 200 bird and mammal species.<component x="306.42"

species of captive-born birds and mammals from the ISIS, an international nonprofit
membership organization of zoos and aquariums. ISIS maintains an extensive database
derived from over 800 zoological institutions in 77 countries, including life history
information on over 2.4 million individual animals, of which over 1.5 million have
exactly recorded birthdates. International Species Information System data have
contributed to previous studies of demographic parameters related to lifespan
evolution (Ricklefs, 2000, 2010a,b), in which the absence of predation in zoological
settings was believed to be an advantage in determining intrinsic mortality rates.
Because information in the ISIS database differs greatly among species in the number
of individuals, the degree of right censoring, the extent of missing data, and the
pooling of information from zoos of varying size and environmental characteristics,
these data provide an excellent opportunity to compare statistical estimates of
extreme longevity in a realistic context. Animal records included sex, birth dates,
and death dates (or last recorded observations). Animals with unknown or estimated
birth dates were removed from the analysis. We also removed all animals with
lifespans that exceeded 120% of the maximum recorded lifespan as reported by AnAge
(de Magalhaes &amp; Costa, 2009). We chose this value to allow for the possibility
that the ISIS records included valid ages of animals that exceeded the AnAge values
(many record-breaking individuals were identified), but we did not want to include
records of animals that were suspiciously old. We used two methods (explained below)
to determine the initial age of our analysis of aging (T) for each species. Most (181
species) had 50 or more individuals (n 50) with ages at death that &#x2021; exceeded

that occurred before the onset of aging (T). This age was determined in two different
ways: First, we ignored all deaths that occurred before the age of first reproduction
as determined by the literature (see Table S1). When sex-specific ages of first
reproduction were available and different, we took the greater of the two ages to be
the truncation age (T ) for both sexes. 1 The second method found the age at which
mortality was minimized (T ). For each reduced population, we used a simple iterative
routine to 2 find T : 2 We calculated L values using the 'Survival' package in R
2.11.0 1 X (R Development Core Team 2011; Therneau &amp; Lumley, 2011). Individuals
with known death dates (complete) and dates of last observation (rightcensored) were
used. We binned the population into groups of similar lifespans, defined by regular
age intervals. The bin number is defined by the 'Sturges' algorithm (Sturges, 1926),
where the number of classes is a function of sample size, N 1 log &#xBC; &#xFE;
&#xF0; &#xDE;n . This function is commonly used 2 to construct histograms. Cumulative
survival rates were converted to mortality rates. The age mid-point of the class with
the lowest mortality value was 2 the provisional T value. 2 A new population was
defined by individuals from this class and 3 those from either of the flanking
classes. We repeated steps 1-3 using the new population until age bins 4 appeared
with no deaths or until the Sturges function no longer returned more than two
classes. 2 The estimate of the mortality minimum was the last meaningful T 5 value

discriminating between populations represented by their longest-lived individuals.
One way to evaluate the merits of candidate metrics is to perform rank persistence
analyses of re-sampled species-specific populations. We began with a collection of P
species, each of size N . We re-sampled each species twice with replacement, taking N
p p draws from each population p. For each metric m, there was a ranking sequence
specific to each sample set. For example, the MRLS rankings for five sample species
(p = 1-5) may have been ; ; ; ; R1 m MRLS 1 2 3 4 5 &#xF0; &#xBC; &#xDE; &#xBC; f g ;
; ; ; : R2 m MRLS 1 3 4 2 5 &#xF0; &#xBC; &#xDE; &#xBC; f g In this case, species 1
always has the longest-lived individual and species 5 always has the lowest maximum
aged individual. Species 2, 3, and 4 exchange rank. Using the same re-sampled data, a
metric other than MRLS might return rankings that are more persistent: ; ; ; ; R1 m X
1 3 2 4 5 &#xF0; &#xBC; &#xDE; &#xBC; f g ; ; ; ; : R2 m X 1 2 3 4 5 &#xF0; &#xBC;
&#xBC; f&#xDE; g We can quantify rank persistence using two slightly different ( ( P
measures. The first measure is Spearman's footrule distance: ( ( n x D , where i and
j are R1 and R2, x is the rank, and &#xBC; (x ij ik jk k 1&#xBC; k is the population.
For the examples above, D &#xF0;MRLS 4 and &#xDE; &#xBC; R1R2 D (X) = 2. Persistence
increases with decreased D (low values are R1R2 superior to high values). The second
measure is r , the rank correlation ij across the samples, which increases with rank
persistence (high values are superior to low values). In our example, r 0 7 and:
&#xF0;MRLS &#xDE; &#xBC; &#xFE; R1R2 : r 0 9. Note that the measures are very
similar; the only fun&#xF0; &#xDE; &#xBC; &#xFE;X R1R2 damental difference between
the two measures is that r weights changes in rank by the square of the change and D
scales the changes linearly. By both measures, the rankings derived using metric X
would seem to more robust to changes in the populations resulting from resampling. In
terms of rank persistence alone, we would conclude that X is a superior longevity
metric to MRLS.<component x="42.57" y="356.13" width="244.94" height="356.92"

comparative metric used in experimental and observational research into the causes of
aging (Comfort, 1979; Austad &amp; Fischer, 1991; Holmes &amp; Austad, 1995;
Wilkinson &amp; South, 2002; Hulbert et al., 2007), and it is often taken as the key
endpoint in comparisons among species, genotypes, or groups exposed to different
environmental manipulations. Comparative biogerontologists have long made use of MRLS
as a surrogate for species-specific aging rates, and much effort has gone into
compiling tables of MRLS values for this purpose (Finch, 1990; Carey &amp; Judge,
2000; de Magalhaes &amp; Costa, 2009). It is widely appreciated, however, that MRLS
is a problematic indicator for several reasons. First, MRLS is a downwardly biased
indicator of extreme lifespan. As sample sizes increase, expected MRLS values are
expected to increase as well. Second, the sample variance associated with estimates
of population MRLS may be high, especially with small sample sizes. These two issues
may present serious problems in comparative studies involving rare nonlaboratory
animals. Consequently, MRLS may differ across species owing to differences in the
number of species records used to determine longevity as well as to inherent
differences in the physiology and ecology of the species. Third, MRLS does not use
data effectively in situations where records are incomplete, which is often the case
in many observational studies where the terminal recorded event for an individual may
not be death (i.e., right censoring). Lastly, it reflects lifespan of a single
individual per species, grossly underestimating the characteristics of other members
of the species. Given the concern that some record-breaking lifespans may be
exaggerated (Steven Austad, personal communication), such extreme dependence on
single outliers is undesirable. Other metrics have been introduced in attempts to
improve upon MRLS by applying multivariate demographic models of aging, such as
Gompertz or Weibull functions, to survival data (Promislow, 1991; Wilson, 1994;
Ricklefs &amp; Scheuerlein, 2002). In some cases, these parameters have been assigned
controversial biological interpretations, as, for example, when the slope of a
Gompertz plot is interpreted as a measure of the rate at which aging occurs (Finch et
al., 1990; Pletcher et al., 2000; Bronikowski et al., 2011), and the intercept of a
Gompertz plot is interpreted as the inherent frailty of the members of the population
(Spencer &amp; Promislow, 2005; Maklakov et al., 2006; Flatt &amp; Kawecki, 2007). In
other cases, parameter estimates derived from these models are combined, for example,
by multiplication, to arrive at a univariate summary of aging rates (Ricklefs, 1998;
Ricklefs &amp; Scheuerlein, 2001). Nonparametric methods have also been proposed that
summarize the lifespan distribution of an elite subset of the population into
quantiles and or means (Wang et al., &#x2044; 2004; Gao et al., 2008). One
significant advantage of these alternative methods over MRLS is that their
application is not limited to the empirical distributions of complete lifespans; they
can benefit from the use of the Kaplan-Meier estimator, which allows the use of
censored data. Each of these estimators, and their combinations, has only an indirect
relationship to the underlying biological processes of aging, and it is unclear how
well these longevity metrics perform compared to MRLS as an index of differences of
the pace of age-related change among biologically interesting populations. Questions
about the evolution of different aging rates and the cellular and molecular processes
that can lead to striking differences in longevity among related species are the
central arena for comparative<component x="307.84" y="78.86" width="244.71"

mammals, MRLS values among species of rodents or primates can vary four- to
eightfold. Many evaluations of hypotheses about comparative aging among species have
depended on MRLS as the index of inter-species differences in aging rate, despite the
measure's well-known defects. Our goal in this project was to make use of population
data, obtained from zoo populations of nearly 200 bird and mammal species, to explore
the sampling properties of various univariate aging and longevity metrics. Some of
these metrics have been proposed by others, but some have not previously been applied
to questions in the comparative biology of aging. We wished to understand how well
each measure indicates extreme lifespan across a phylogenetically diverse range of
species that differ in life history and data quality. In addition, we wanted to
understand how robust each metric is to sampling effects, namely sampling variance
and bias arising from small population sizes. A major goal of this study was to
understand the limitations of MRLS as a comparative longevity metric and, if
possible, identify an alternative measure for MRLS that minimizes the sampling issues
and data-use restrictions associated with that measure. The datasets available to
test hypotheses in the comparative biology of aging differ in the proportion of
missing values and in the extent of erroneous data. The data often combine records
from wild and captive populations that differ in environmental factors (housing
conditions, food availability, reproductive histories, predation, infection levels,
etc.) that can have strong effects on mortality risks through both age-dependent and
age-independent pathways. Although tables of MRLS values across species contain a
good deal of information critical to testing ideas about the biology of aging, there
is a pressing need to develop improved demographic endpoints for
biogerontology.<component x="42.8" y="426.21" width="244.71" height="303.62" page="2"

the aging process begins at any defined life history transition (birth, puberty, age
at first reproduction), we assume here that deaths at the earliest ages, for example
perinatal deaths and deaths of juveniles, are unlikely to be informative about
inter-population variances in aging rates. We therefore used two methods to determine
the age before which mortality should be ignored, and we report the results derived
from both methods. We analyzed the subset of individuals from each species with
events (deaths or last observations) that met or exceeded one of two species-specific
truncation ages: (i) T , the age of 1 reproductive maturity for that species, or (ii)
T , the age at which the mor2 tality rate reaches a minimum (see Table S1 for
species, relevant life history information, and T estimates). Across the 163 species
that had at least 50 adults defined by both threshold definitions (T and T ), the
trun1 2 q cation ages correlated reasonably well ( = 0.53, P &lt; 0.0001, Spearman's
rank correlation; see Fig. 1). Nearly two-thirds of the species with both T and T
estimates had an age at minimal mortality that exceeded 1 2 the age at reproductive
onset (108 of 163 species). This pattern is consistent with Promislow's (1991)
earlier analysis of a much smaller set of species records in which he showed T &lt; T
in 75% (18 of 24) of cases 1 2 where age at maturity and age at minimal mortality
differed. More recent life history analyses also show that the onset of aging tends
to follow the timing of reproductive maturity (Jones et al., 2008; Peron et al.,
2010). The correlation between T and T estimates strengthened slightly when 1 2 the
collection of species was reduced to include only the 125 species with q 150 or more

population size affected the ranking of lifespan metrics across all study species.
Every population (for our purposes, a population was considered the worldwide
collection of animals of the same species, and we use species and population
interchangeably) was re-sampled n times with replacement, where n was each species'
sample i i size, and each species was ranked in order of each longevity value
(resulting in 16 metric-specific ranking vectors). For example, a MRLS vector may be
ordered species A &gt; species B &gt; species C &gt; species D and a W A vector may
rank species B &gt; D &gt; A &gt; C. This procedure was repeated, and each pair of
metric-specific ranking vectors was analyzed for stability. Rank persistence, as
inferred by a low Spearman's footrule distance D q and a high Spearman's ranked

variation. We investigated four population size treatments. The n 50 treatment

reasoned that the species rankings reflected both inherent differences in the biology

longevity are also likely to contain a preponderance of small populations, similar in
this way to the datasets available through ISIS. We attempted to remove the latter

mammal species have evolved that differ widely in life histories, including variation
in the rate at which aging leads to increased risks of mortality owing to disease and
infirmity. This rich set of related species could, in principle, be used to generate
and evaluate hypotheses about the cellular and physiological factors that time the
aging process, factors that make it very unlikely that a particular mouse will
survive 5 years, a dog survive 20 years, and a human survive 110 years. Lifespan is a
convenient, if flawed, surrogate for addressing hypotheses about the biological basis
for aging rates because many factors besides age change can lead to death, and
because aging leads to many consequences in addition to changes in mortality risk.
Ideally, hypotheses about the distribution of aging rates and age-dependent changes
across species could be tested by a database in which multiple age-sensitive traits
had been tested in hundreds of individuals across a wide range of diverse species. In
practice, however, physiological data of this kind are available only for a handful
of species, and for most species the only available data relevant to questions of
comparative aging rate are in the form of survival tables. The obvious problem is to
determine the best way to summarize these population-specific tables and provide a
greater with randomized population sizes. This finding suggests that sam- lower,

longevity than on nonparametric measures. As before, W and the more intermediA ate

(excepting W ). At high sample sizes, howA ever, the Gompertz intercept G performed
relatively well, providing speA cies ranks that were roughly as persistent as the
quantile-based measures. The largest change in relative performance involved
nonparametric measures M16LS and M32LS; these were middling-to-good performers with
fixed populations sizes but very poor performers when sample sizes are randomized. It
appeared that for metrics MxLS, increasing x made for better metrics when samples
sizes were fixed but worse metrics when sample sizes varied. This makes sense when we
consider that, in terms of population lifespan quantiles, MxLS has different meanings
as population size changes. Using unrealistically low population sizes to illustrate
this point, MRLS is Q in a population of 20 but equal to Q 95 50 (the longevity
median) in a population of two. Results were largely unaffected by our choice of
T-definitions and perq sistence metric (D or ). In no case did altering these choices
change a topfive performing metric (in terms of rank persistence) into a bottom-five
q performer. Ranked correlations between D and values were very high in all

preserves relevant biological information relating to lifespan while disregarding the
effects of extraneous or confounding factors, such as population size. Despite the
widespread appreciation of its statistical association with population size, the MRLS
is favored by comparative biologists because it is believed to measure an
individuals' intrinsic potential for long life. The degree to which the other metrics
measured this maximum, without regard for the biasing effects of small sample size,
is quantified by the partial correlations between candidate metrics and MRLS, holding
population size constant. Population size bias is addressed more directly by the
total correlation between sample size and metric value. Ideally, the best measures of
extreme lifespan are those with the greatest magnitude of partial correlations with
MRLS and the least magnitude of the total correlation between the measure and sample
size. By these criteria, the best are those that nonparametrically define some
well-defined elite fraction of the population: Q , Q , e , and e . Given that adult
lifespans are 90 95 90 95 typically right-skewed, we expected that measures of
central tendency should be affected least by sample size. Instead, we found negative
correlations between these measures and n that were slightly stronger than those
obtained from Q , Q , e , and e . Good evidence has been col90 95 90 95 lected to
suggest that animal size and lifespan are positively associated. If zoos favor larger
collections of smaller animals (a feasible expectation given resource limitations),
then these negative correlations between n and mean and median lifespans may reflect
true associations between intrinsic aging and population size and not simply bias.
Such associations would cause effects that act in opposition to the effects of sample
size bias on MRLS estimates. Put differently, maximum recorded lifespan would be more
sensitive to n than reflected by our correlation estimate. We note, however, that
regardless of whether we choose the ideal correlation to be zero or slightly
negative, Q , Q , e , and e still appear to 90 95 90 95 best satisfy these criteria
for best longevity metrics. Because MRLS observations depend upon the identification
of single individuals, it seemed reasonable to expect that estimates would suffer
from high sampling error. Indeed, our re-sampling analysis indicated that MRLS had a
larger sampling variance than the quantile-based measures at all sample sizes. The
difference intensified when species were disassociated from population sizes,
suggesting that small sample bias may contribute to the sampling error for MRLS. Most
parametric estimates suffered from high sample variance. The quantile-based measures
produced the most reliable estimates, especially when population sizes were allowed
to vary. Excluding those that describe the central tendency, we see that the least
extreme measures Q and e are the least variable. 90 90 The 90th quantile of adult
lifespan, Q , and the average of the top 90 10th percentile of adult lifespan, e ,
appear to be the best alternatives to 90 using MRLS as a comparative metric for
extreme lifespan. Both correlate well with MRLS when sample size is corrected for,
correlate weakly with population size, and demonstrate relatively little sampling
variance. Furthermore, both can accommodate right-censored data. Neither

over the other based upon the sampling characteristics analyzed here. However, one
may prefer Q over e if 90 90 extreme lifespan exaggeration was considered to be a
problem, because Q is expected to be more robust to this effect than e . We recommend
90 90 that future aging studies consider using the 90th quantile lifespan as a
comparative metric. The metrics that took the average of a set number of elite
individuals (MxLS) performed poorly as candidate metrics for extreme lifespan. Not
surprisingly, MxLS measures correlated extremely well with MRLS when population size
was held constant. However, the positive correlation between the measure and
population size increased for this family of measures. Our rank persistence analysis
illustrated problems inherent in the use of MxLS as a comparative metric. When
population sizes were not randomized, MRLS and the closely related M4LS performed
well, as indicated by high rank persistence to re-sampling. Similar methods that
correlate well to MRLS (M16LS and M32LS) also performed well under these conditions.
However, when population sizes were randomized to decouple the effects of biology and
animal collection size, these performed very poorly compared to other measures. The
reason for this is evident if we recognize that MxLS is the mean of the top 1 (n x) n
&#x2044; ) ) percentile of the population. Because the threshold for inclusion is
sensitive to population size, variation in population size varies the lifespans of
the individuals included in the measure. Judged as univariate descriptors of
longevity, measures based upon parameterized demographic models performed poorly as a
group, with the exception of the Weibull intercepts, W . Estimates of these metrics A
seemed to be more sensitive to our choice of method for delineating the aging and
nonaging segments of each species life history. These metrics correlated poorly with
MRLS, holding population size constant. With respect to the Weibull-based omega
values, our results (using T 1 as our definition of adulthood, the partial
correlation was 0.238 and ) the total correlation was 0.464) contrast sharply with a
full correlation ) between and MRLS of 0.83 across 150 captive vertebrate species )
recently reported by Ricklefs (2010b). At least two reasons may account for this
discrepancy. First, our analytical methods differ: Ricklefs uses least-squares
regression to fit a three-parameter Weibull model to death records at all ages (we
use maximum likelihood to fit a twoparameter model to adult events) and he does not
consider right-censored observations (we do). Second, the numbers of animal records
per species tend to be far greater in our study. If small sample sizes upwardly bias
estimates of omega (this is speculation on our part), then the variance in sample
size across species (such as both studies find) will generate excess negative
correlations between omega and MRLS. The results from the rank persistence analyses
suggested that the demographic parameters, especially those that describe the slopes
of mortality functions, are subject to high sampling variance. The Weibull intercept,
however, demonstrated high partial correlations with MRLS and low sampling variances.
Our only reason for not recommending this measure is that it correlated more strongly
with population size, which suggests that it is a more biased measure than some of
the nonparametric alternatives. While much attention in comparative biogerontology
focuses on measures of extreme lifespan, investigators might consider using measures
of central tendencies instead. There are at several reasons for doing so. First, as
we show here, mean adult lifespan exhibits the least amount of sampling variance. It
is the most repeatable measure that we investigated. Second, compared to MRLS, there
is far less association between population size and metric estimates. As we have
argued, there is reason to believe that mean lifespan should be the measure that is
least biased by small sample size. Third, mean lifespan is highly correlated with
MRLS (correcting for population size), with a partial correlation coefficient of
between 0.91 and 0.93. Other measures, such as Q , may perform better in this
respect, but 90 it appears that a great deal of the biological information that is
parameterized by maximum lifespan is also expressed by the mean lifespan of those
animals that live at least as long as the ages measured by T and T . Last, 1 2 the
most familiar definitions and predictions of the evolutionary change of phenotypes
from one generation to the next are expressed as changes in the means (Robertson,
1966; Price, 1970, 1972; Lande &amp; Arnold, 1983). In evolutionary biology, it is
changes in the means, and occasionally the variances, of phenotypes that are nearly
always the subject of study. We note, though, that the means and medians used for our
calculations are for samples that exclude perinatal and a high proportion of juvenile
mortality, and cannot be used to evaluate issues related to life expectancy at birth
or proportions of offspring surviving to reproductive age. Ultimately, the choice of
whether to compare means or extremes may depend upon the nature of the comparative
question that is under study. We recommend, however, that this decision is made
explicit and justified by each study. Comparative biogerontologists have prepared
extensive compilations of MRLS data, and for many meta-analyses MRLS may,
unfortunately, be the only available measure currently available. Compilation of
similar lists of Q values and mean lifespans of animals surviving 90 at least to T or
T would be a worthwhile project for field biologists and 1 2 zoo consortia to tackle
as a service to aging research, and we recommend that such statistics be routinely
included in reports about lifespan and aging in wild, captive, and experimental
populations. In this respect, our study makes an important contribution by providing
these estimates for nearly 200 bird and mammal species.<component x="306.42"

species of captive-born birds and mammals from the ISIS, an international nonprofit
membership organization of zoos and aquariums. ISIS maintains an extensive database
derived from over 800 zoological institutions in 77 countries, including life history
information on over 2.4 million individual animals, of which over 1.5 million have
exactly recorded birthdates. International Species Information System data have
contributed to previous studies of demographic parameters related to lifespan
evolution (Ricklefs, 2000, 2010a,b), in which the absence of predation in zoological
settings was believed to be an advantage in determining intrinsic mortality rates.
Because information in the ISIS database differs greatly among species in the number
of individuals, the degree of right censoring, the extent of missing data, and the
pooling of information from zoos of varying size and environmental characteristics,
these data provide an excellent opportunity to compare statistical estimates of
extreme longevity in a realistic context. Animal records included sex, birth dates,
and death dates (or last recorded observations). Animals with unknown or estimated
birth dates were removed from the analysis. We also removed all animals with
lifespans that exceeded 120% of the maximum recorded lifespan as reported by AnAge
(de Magalhaes &amp; Costa, 2009). We chose this value to allow for the possibility
that the ISIS records included valid ages of animals that exceeded the AnAge values
(many record-breaking individuals were identified), but we did not want to include
records of animals that were suspiciously old. We used two methods (explained below)
to determine the initial age of our analysis of aging (T) for each species. Most (181
species) had 50 or more individuals (n 50) with ages at death that &#x2021; exceeded

that occurred before the onset of aging (T). This age was determined in two different
ways: First, we ignored all deaths that occurred before the age of first reproduction
as determined by the literature (see Table S1). When sex-specific ages of first
reproduction were available and different, we took the greater of the two ages to be
the truncation age (T ) for both sexes. 1 The second method found the age at which
mortality was minimized (T ). For each reduced population, we used a simple iterative
routine to 2 find T : 2 We calculated L values using the 'Survival' package in R
2.11.0 1 X (R Development Core Team 2011; Therneau &amp; Lumley, 2011). Individuals
with known death dates (complete) and dates of last observation (rightcensored) were
used. We binned the population into groups of similar lifespans, defined by regular
age intervals. The bin number is defined by the 'Sturges' algorithm (Sturges, 1926),
where the number of classes is a function of sample size, N 1 log &#xBC; &#xFE;
&#xF0; &#xDE;n . This function is commonly used 2 to construct histograms. Cumulative
survival rates were converted to mortality rates. The age mid-point of the class with
the lowest mortality value was 2 the provisional T value. 2 A new population was
defined by individuals from this class and 3 those from either of the flanking
classes. We repeated steps 1-3 using the new population until age bins 4 appeared
with no deaths or until the Sturges function no longer returned more than two
classes. 2 The estimate of the mortality minimum was the last meaningful T 5 value

discriminating between populations represented by their longest-lived individuals.
One way to evaluate the merits of candidate metrics is to perform rank persistence
analyses of re-sampled species-specific populations. We began with a collection of P
species, each of size N . We re-sampled each species twice with replacement, taking N
p p draws from each population p. For each metric m, there was a ranking sequence
specific to each sample set. For example, the MRLS rankings for five sample species
(p = 1-5) may have been ; ; ; ; R1 m MRLS 1 2 3 4 5 &#xF0; &#xBC; &#xDE; &#xBC; f g ;
; ; ; : R2 m MRLS 1 3 4 2 5 &#xF0; &#xBC; &#xDE; &#xBC; f g In this case, species 1
always has the longest-lived individual and species 5 always has the lowest maximum
aged individual. Species 2, 3, and 4 exchange rank. Using the same re-sampled data, a
metric other than MRLS might return rankings that are more persistent: ; ; ; ; R1 m X
1 3 2 4 5 &#xF0; &#xBC; &#xDE; &#xBC; f g ; ; ; ; : R2 m X 1 2 3 4 5 &#xF0; &#xBC;
&#xBC; f&#xDE; g We can quantify rank persistence using two slightly different ( ( P
measures. The first measure is Spearman's footrule distance: ( ( n x D , where i and
j are R1 and R2, x is the rank, and &#xBC; (x ij ik jk k 1&#xBC; k is the population.
For the examples above, D &#xF0;MRLS 4 and &#xDE; &#xBC; R1R2 D (X) = 2. Persistence
increases with decreased D (low values are R1R2 superior to high values). The second
measure is r , the rank correlation ij across the samples, which increases with rank
persistence (high values are superior to low values). In our example, r 0 7 and:
&#xF0;MRLS &#xDE; &#xBC; &#xFE; R1R2 : r 0 9. Note that the measures are very
similar; the only fun&#xF0; &#xDE; &#xBC; &#xFE;X R1R2 damental difference between
the two measures is that r weights changes in rank by the square of the change and D
scales the changes linearly. By both measures, the rankings derived using metric X
would seem to more robust to changes in the populations resulting from resampling. In
terms of rank persistence alone, we would conclude that X is a superior longevity
metric to MRLS.<component x="42.57" y="356.13" width="244.94" height="356.92"
