Many organisms are able to regenerate lost or damaged body parts that are structural and functional replicates
of the original. Eventually these become fully integrated into pre-existing tissues. However, with the exception of
deer, mammals have lost this ability. Each spring deer shed antlers that were used for fighting and display during
the previous mating season. Their loss is triggered by a fall in circulating testosterone levels, a hormonal change
that is linked to an increase in day length. A complex ‘blastema-like’ structure or ‘antler-bud’ then forms; however,
unlike the regenerative process in the newt, most evidence (albeit indirect) suggests that this does not involve
reversal of the differentiated state but is stem cell based. The subsequent re-growth of antlers during the spring
and summer months is spectacular and represents one of the fastest rates of organogenesis in the animal kingdom.
Longitudinal growth involves endochondral ossification in the tip of each antler branch and bone growth around
the antler shaft is by intramembranous ossification. As androgen concentrations rise in late summer, longitudinal
growth stops, the skin (velvet) covering the antler is lost and antlers are ‘polished’ in preparation for the mating
season. Although the timing of the antler growth cycle is clearly closely linked to circulating testosterone, oestrogen may be a key cellular regulator, as it is in the skeleton of other male mammals. We still know very little about
the molecular machinery required for antler regeneration, although there is evidence that developmental signalling pathways with pleiotropic functions are important and that novel ‘antler-specific’ molecules may not exist.
Identifying these pathways and factors, deciphering their interactions and how they are regulated by environmental cues could have an important impact on human health if this knowledge is applied to the engineering of new
human tissues and organs.

Introduction
Deer antlers are one of the animal kingdom’s most dramatic examples of male prowess and thus since ancient
times have been held in great regard by humans.
However, antlers also provide a model for studying
two unique processes: the development of a complete
appendage that is delayed until puberty and mammalian

organ regeneration. No other mammal can naturally
regenerate any lost organ, let alone anything as large
and complex as an antler, e.g. the antlers of a 200-kg
adult red deer may weigh as much 30 kg but take
only 3 months to grow. By contrast, animals that have
retained the capacity to regenerate are found in most
other phyla and a variety of these are studied by regeneration biologists. These include planaria, hydra,
urodele amphibians, Xenopus and zebrafish (Brockes,
1997; Fujisawa, 2003; Nye et al. 2003; Poss et al.
2003; Sanchez Alvarado, 2003; Slack et al. 2004). In
fact, it has been proposed that only by studying a
variety of examples of natural regeneration can we
develop our understanding of why some animals
regenerate and others do not (Brockes, 2004). However,
despite their obvious convenience as experimental

models, these are not mammals and although some
mouse strains have been shown to have an increased
capacity for repair (Heber-Katz et al. 2004), they are
unable to regenerate whole organs. This is why the
mechanisms that underlie antler regeneration should
continue to be investigated, notwithstanding the
limitations of deer as an animal model. This argument
made most persuasively by Richard Goss, the regeneration biologist who pioneered antler research in the late
twentieth century (Goss, 1995). Antler research can help
us understand why regenerative ability has been lost
in mammals and take us further towards a ‘holy grail’
of modern human medicine: the ability to regenerate
organs that have been removed through trauma or
excision.

are also very spectacular (Fig. 1B) curving majestically
outward and upward. The species studied by us is the
red deer (Cervus elapus), the antlers of which have a
more ‘classic’ shape, depicted in artworks throughout
history (Fig. 1C).
The diverse anatomy of antlers
Deer are hoofed, ruminant mammals in the Cervidae
family (order Artiodactyl) and are among the most
graceful and attractive of animals. This family consists
of 17 genera and about 53 species. Deer are native to
all parts of the world except Antarctica, Australia, central
and southern Africa, Madagascar and New Zealand,
and have adapted to virtually every land habitat, from
dry deserts to woodlands, prairies, marshes and Arctic
regions. Deer are the only animals that grow antlers,
which are composed of skin, nerves, blood vessels,
fibrous tissue, cartilage and bone, and thus should not
be confused with horns, which are a keratinized tissue
that grow from their base under the control of underlying mesenchymal cells.
Except for the reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), antlers
develop only in male deer and in most species this
occurs in the spring of the animal’s second year of life.
As with the developing limb, antlers have three axes:
a proximal–distal axis, an anterior–posterior axis and
a dorsal–ventral axis (see Fig. 2A; Li &amp; Suttie, 2001).
Antlers come in all shapes and sizes from small unbranched antlers of only a few centimetres in length, as
seen on the pudu (Pudu puda), the smallest of the deer
species, to elaborately branched racks or palmate
headpieces of impressive proportions in species such as
the moose and elk. The moose (Alces spp.) is the largest
deer (an adult stag’s body weight can reach 800 kg)
and these animals possess the largest antlers. Elk
(Cervus canadenesis) (Fig. 1A) also carry impressive sets
of antlers that can extend to 1.5 m in length. The antlers

Development of primary antlers
Antlers develop from pedicles, permanent bony protuberances on the frontal bone. As the fawn approaches
puberty (at approximately 5–7 months old in the red
deer), a collection of determined periosteal cells located
in the distal parts of the cristae externae of the frontal
bones are activated by rising androgen levels in the
blood. This specialized periosteum (Fig. 2B) was originally described as ‘antlerogenic periosteum’ (AP) by
Richard Goss (Goss &amp; Powel, 1985). The AP contains
specific binding sites for testosterone (Li &amp; Suttie, 1998)
although testosterone does not appear to have direct
effects on cultured AP cells whereas IGF-I stimulates their
proliferation (Li et al. 1999; Sadighi et al. 2001). Trabecular
bone is then formed beneath the periosteum and a
pedicle develops (Sempere et al. 1983; Suttie et al. 1984,
1988, 1991). Normally the antlerogenic periosteum of
female deer remains quiescent because the hormonal
requirements necessary for pedicle formation are not
present. However, female deer can be induced to form
pedicles if injected with androgens (Kierdorf et al. 1995).
Li &amp; Suttie (1994) have undertaken detailed histological analyses of pedicle formation and have identified
four ossification stages. The first is the intramembranous ossification stage (1 in Fig. 2C), and this is where
the initial antlerogenic cells start to proliferate and
differentiate into osteoblasts. These osteoblasts form
trabecular bone in cellular periosteum. The second stage
is transitional ossification, which takes place when the
pedicle has reached 5–10 mm in height (2 in Fig. 2C).

at the apical surface, which have undergone a change
in differentiation pathway to form chondrocytes. Pedicle endochondral ossification is the third stage, when
chondrogenesis takes place in the pedicle alone (3 in
Fig. 2C). The fourth and final stage is termed antler
endochondral ossification. Here the antlerogenic cells
maintain their chondrogenic differentiation pathway
until the first antler has been fully formed (4 in Fig. 2C).
The onset of antler formation is coincident with the
appearance of ‘shiny’ velvet skin covering the distal end
of the pedicle. These un-branched antlers (described as
‘spikers’ in the deer industry) then elongate as a
result of an endochondral process in the distal tip
(Fig. 2D; Chapman, 1975). Because the cellular anatomy
of endochondral ossification is very similar in the primary and regenerating antlers it will be described in a
later section.
Growth of the first antler continues until the autumn
rutting season approaches when there is another
increase in circulating testosterone. This endocrine change
is associated with a cessation in longitudinal growth,
the antler bone becomes fully mineralized and the
overlying velvet is shed exposing bare bone. This leaves
the single un-branched antler attached to the pedicle
until it is cast the following spring. This inhibition of
longitudinal bone growth in response to an increase in
sex steroids is similar to that which occurs at puberty in
humans (Riggs et al. 2002). In fact it is now known that
in the male skeleton many of the effects of testosterone
are indirect, following its conversion to oestrogen
by the enzyme aromatase (Riggs et al. 2002). That oestrogen may be an important regulator of antler growth
was first demonstrated by Goss (1968), who found that
injection of oestrogen inhibited growth of regenerating antlers and promoted premature ossification and
shedding of the velvet skin. Bubenik et al. (1975b) subsequently showed that administration of an oestrogen
antagonist had an inhibitory effect on antler bone formation. More recently, Bubenick et al. (2005) have provided evidence that oestrogen is actually synthesized
by antler tissues in deer stags. It has also been demonstrated that the seasonal antler cycle in female reindeer
is regulated by oestradiol, in this case synthesized by
the ovary (Lincoln &amp; Tyler, 1999).
Transplantation experiments demonstrated that the
tissue from which the first antler develops is antlerogenic periosteum (Fig. 2B). Hartwig (1967) showed that
moving this tissue to another region of the frontal
bone resulted in an antler forming at the new location
but not at the original site. It was subsequently shown
that growth of antler structures can be induced by
transplantation of this periosteum to a heterotopic
location (Fig. 3) overlying the metacarpal bone. Furthermore, these ‘mini-antlers’ are influenced by the same

the EGF receptor, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2)
and the FGF receptors, FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3, bone
morphogenetics proteins (BMPs) 2, 4 and 14 and the
BMP receptors BMPR1B and ACTRII. They hypothesize
that these growth factors signal between the osseocartilagenous and skin compartments of the primary
antler (Barling et al. 2004b). The spatial and temporal
differences in the localization of these growth factors
showed that their distribution in skin of the primary

hormonal cues as antlers on the skull, e.g. they shed
their velvet skin at the appropriate time of year
(Hartwig &amp; Schrudde, 1974; Goss &amp; Powel, 1985). Structures resembling antlers, or pedicle-antlers, have also
been generated when AP was transplanted over the
calvariae of nude mice (Li et al. 2001). Studies using a
cell lineage tracer described by Li and Suttie in their
review of antlerogenic periosteum provide further evidence that pedicles and antlers are derived from this
tissue (Li &amp; Suttie, 2001). Taken together, these studies
led Li &amp; Suttie (2001) to suggest that, like some embryonic tissues, AP has full self-differentiating capacity.
Interestingly, the cellular layer of AP is very rich in
glycogen (Li &amp; Suttie, 1998), a characteristic of fetal
osteoblasts.
Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information on
the local molecular mechanisms involved in antler and
pedicle development. In vitro studies have shown that
insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) may be an important
systemic regulator of pedicle formation as it stimulates
proliferation of antlerogeneic cells from all four ossification stages. Retinoic acid (RA) is also likely to play a
role because application of RA to the developing pedicle
increased the growth rate of the first antler and this
was suggested to occur via an increase in the proliferation of periosteal cells (Kierdorf &amp; Bartos, 1999).
Recently, Barling and colleagues (Barling et al. 2004a,b)
have undertaken a series of studies aimed at identifying growth factors and their receptors in the skin and
underlying bone of primary antlers. Growth factors
identified include epidermal growth factor (EGF) and
antler resembles that described in adult skin of other
species, whereas their distribution in bone and cartilage
resembles that in the fetal skeleton.
Identifying the pathways that regulate the prenatal
development of antler primordiae should also be a priority for future study. In the embryo, localized thickenings of the periosteum of the frontal bone can be
observed at sites of future pedicle/antler development
(Fig. 2B; Lincoln, 1973; Li &amp; Suttie, 2001). These primordial pedicles enlarge between 55 and 150 days of
gestation but regress at later stages. This tissue specification is likely to involve interactions between mesenchyme and the overlying epithelial cell layer, which Li
&amp; Suttie (2001) described as resembling the apical ectodermal ridge in the developing limb. It is noteworthy
that development of the mammary gland, which, like
antlerogenic periosteum, is regulated by sex steroids,
involves epithelial–mesenchymal interactions (Foley
et al. 2001). One of the molecules that mediates
epithelial–mesenchymal interactions in the developing
mammary gland is parathyroid hormone-related
peptide (PTHrP). Although the role of PTHrP in the
development of antlerogenic periosteum has not
been investigated, there is evidence that it plays an
important role in both the developing and the regenerating antler. Barling et al. (2004a) have recently
identified the PTHrP and the PTH / PTHrP receptor in
both velvet skin and underlying mesenchymal tissues
of red deer primary antlers. We have also found that
PTHrP is widely expressed in tissues of regenerating
red deer antlers and that its synthesis is regulated
by TGF-β (Faucheux et al. 2004). Clearly a major challenge lies in characterizing the pathways and factors
that: (i) define where and how AP forms during
fetal life, (ii) enable AP to ‘survive’ until the systemic
environment is appropriate for antler development
and (iii ) activate expansion of progenitor cells in the
perisoteum. The potential role of periosteum in regenerating antlers will be discussed in more detail in the
next section.

Deer antler regeneration, J. S. Price et al. 607
Systemic regulation of the repeated cycles of
antler regeneration
Because the primary function of antlers is to enable
stags to protect and retain harems of females (does),
their growth is linked to the annual breeding cycle and
its associated fluctuations in sex hormone concentrations. In temperate species such as the red deer, it is a
change in day length that regulates reproductive
activity, although there are endogenous rhythms of
antler growth (West &amp; Nordan, 1976). Studies in orchidectomized (castrated) stags and in stags administered
exogenous hormones have demonstrated that sex
steroids are most important at the start and at the end
of the antler growth cycle. Incredibly, Aristotle was
the first scientist to describe the effects of castration
on antler growth!
Antlers are normally cast in spring when testosterone
levels are low. Castration of stags in late winter/early
spring will lead to premature casting of antlers (Jaczewski et al. 1976), whereas administration of exogenous
sex steroids at this time will prevent casting and regeneration (Fletcher, 1978). The rapid growth of antlers
occurs during the early summer when there is a plentiful food supply and stags live sedentary lives while
‘testosterone depleted’ (Goss, 1983). Because antler
regeneration takes place at a time when deer reproductive organs are inactive it was proposed many years
ago that there must also be a non-gonadal factor
involved and this was named ‘antler growth stimulus’
(AGS) (Wislocki, 1943). IGF-I synthesized in the liver is
the most likely candidate as IGF-I concentrations are
high during the period of rapid antler growth (Suttie
et al. 1985), there are IGF receptors in the antler’s
growing tip (Elliott et al. 1992, 1993) and IGFs promote
proliferation of antler cells (Price et al. 1994; Sadighi
et al. 1994). Changes in concentrations of other hormones are associated with the antler growth cycle,
including 1,25(OH) 2D 3 (Van der Eems et al. 1988;
Sempere et al. 1989), thyroid hormones (Shi &amp; Barrell,
1994), cortisol (Bubenik et al. 1975a; Suttie et al. 1995)
and prolactin (Sempere et al. 1983; Suttie et al. 1984),
although their function remains poorly understood.
Antler growth places an enormous demand for
mineral on the skeleton (sufficient mineral is needed
to enable a 30-kg bone to grow in ∼3 months), and to
meet this demand cyclical reversible osteoporosis
occurs at other skeletal sites (Bubenik, 1983). This bone
loss is greatest in non-weight-bearing bones such as
Fig. 4 Changes in circulating concentrations of testosterone
and the carboxy-terminal pro-peptide of type I collagen (PICP)
during the antler growth cycle in red deer stags. Serum
samples were collected at post-mortem from deer stags killed
for venison at different times of year. PICP was measured by
radioimmunoassay (Orion, Diagnostica, Finland) and the
values shown are the mean ± SEM. This illustrates that antler
regeneration is associated with significant changes in bone
turnover. The testosterone graph is adapted from Muir et al.
(1988).
the rib. Measuring biochemical markers of bone cell
activity in the circulation has shown how bone turnover increases dramatically at the time of rapid antler
growth. Figure 4 shows the results of a study in which
we measured changes in circulating levels of the carboxyterminal pro-peptide of type I collagen, a marker
of osteoblast activity (Eriksen et al. 1993), at different
times of year. This showed that levels were ten times
higher during the period of antler regeneration. Baksi
&amp; Newbury (1988) have also shown changes in serum
osteocalcin and hydroxyproline associated with antler
growth.
Atlhough low levels of sex steroids are ‘permissive’
for regeneration, high levels appear to act as a ‘brake’,
as discussed previously in the context of the developing
antlers (Goss, 1968). Therefore, as the breeding season
approaches and testosterone levels increase, endochondral growth stops, the antlers become fully calcified, and the velvet skin covering then thins, becomes
‘dry’ and is then shed (Fig. 5A) to expose the antler
as a solid bone that remains firmly attached to the
pedicle. The seasonal surge in testosterone also causes
a behavioural change in the deer. Even before shedding
their velvet, bucks begin to establish positions in the
social hierarchy (Fig. 5B). Testosterone levels peak in
late autumn when sexual activity is intense (Lincoln,
1971) and then decline again as spring approaches.

circulating testosterone in late summer. (A) Shedding of velvet

Reediehill Deer Farm, Auchtermuchty, Fife, UK).
In red deer, castration during the period of antler
growth will delay velvet shedding and the antlers do
not fully mineralize (Fig. 6B). In some more phylogenetically evolved deer species the growth of castrated
antlers is quite aberrant, e.g. fallow deer develop peculiar bony protuberances that Goss (1983) classified as
‘antleromas’ (Fig. 6C). Recently, Kierdorf et al. (2004)
described in detail the structure of the antler of castrated fallow deer and presented evidence to suggest
that these protuberances (Fig. 6C) are in fact benign
tumour growths with comparable histological changes
to osteomas. Roe deer also develop large benign tumours
on castrated antlers in which intradermal bone has
been observed. The link between regeneration and
cancer was highlighted in a review by Brockes (1998),
and led us to suggest previously (Price &amp; Allen, 2004)
that castrated antlers develop tumour-like structures
because a mechanism has evolved in deer whereby sex
steroids (acting directly or indirectly) normally limit cell
cycle progression in antler progenitor cells. It is the
remarkable capacity for growth and self-renewal of
antler progenitor cells that underpins the capacity of
antlers to regenerate, but this has a potential downside: an increased risk of transformation. By contrast,
lower organisms such as the newt have evolved a system whereby their cells can have an extended lifespan
(and thus sustain regeneration) yet remain remarkably
resistant to cancer (Tsonis, 1983). Humans and other
mammals may have lost the ability to regenerate
because the evolutionary benefit is outweighed by the
increased risk of developing cancer.
Antler regeneration: casting of the old set
of antlers
Casting of the stag’s primary antlers marks the onset
of an annual regenerative cycle that will continue
throughout its life. In a 2-year-old animal the regenerated antlers are relatively unimpressive, but as the stag
ages his antlers also become larger. Before the antlers
are cast the skin covering the distal pedicle assumes
the shiny appearance of antler velvet and the region

becomes slightly ‘swollen’ (Fig. 7A). Antlers are then
normally cast within a day or so of each other and this
event is effected by osteoclasts resorbing bone in the
distal pedicle (Goss et al. 1992). This resorption appears
to be very tightly regulated because, unlike teeth, antlers do not start to ‘wobble’ in the days/ hours before
they are shed. Casting then leaves an exposed concave
pedicle surface that rapidly fills with blood, although
within hours a large scab forms to cover it (Fig. 7A).
Kierdorf et al. (1993) have described the histological
changes in this region and found that after casting
osteoclasts continue to resorb bone in the distal pedicle,
which creates a smooth surface. This is followed by
a phase of bone formation that restores the portion of
the pedicle that was lost with the cast antler.
In most species of deer loss of the antler coincides
with regeneration of its replacement. However, in reindeer and moose, antlers are cast in late autumn and yet
the wound does not heal over the pedicle stump and
re-growth does not take place until environmental
conditions are appropriate several months later (this
delay may have evolved to reduce the energy demands
on the animal as a consequence of carrying heavy
antlers during harsh winters). Goss also demonstrated
experimentally that if the distal end of the pedicle is
amputated in winter (a ‘non-permissive’ time of year)
wound healing and regeneration was delayed until
spring (Goss, 1972). These observations imply that
antler regeneration is not triggered by the tissue repair
mechanisms induced by casting, whereas components
of the injury response pathway are known to be critical
for inducing regeneration in the newt (Brockes et al.
2001). The phenomenon of double-headed antlers also
demonstrates that injury is not an absolute requirement
for antler regeneration. In this situation, new antlers
develop from the base of the previous antlers that are
retained on the pedicle (Kierdorf et al. 1994). That is not
to say that there is a relationship between antler regeneration and wound repair; by definition the process
of epimorphic regeneration requires wound healing
to take place (Goss, 1972). For example, Goss (1972)
showed that when skin was sutured over the stump following antler removal regeneration could not take place.
The cue for the initiation of deer antler regeneration
is therefore most likely to be a systemic factor(s) whose
synthesis is regulated by changes in the hypothalamic–

pituitary axis. Regeneration could be initiated either
when concentrations of a ‘permissive’ factor reach a
threshold or when concentrations of a ‘repressor’ fall
below a certain threshold. Testosterone is a strong candidate for being the ‘repressor’ as casting of antlers is
known to be associated with a decrease in circulating
concentrations (Suttie et al. 1995; Bubenik et al. 1997).
One of the consequences of a decline in sex steroid
concentrations (and or the number of receptors) could
be induction of bone resorption at the antler–pedicle
bone interface since sex steroids are known to inhibit
osteoclast function in other species (Shevde et al. 2000).
However, the role of sex steroids is likely to be more
complex and may also involve regulation of stem cell
populations in the pedicle tissues (this will be discussed
in more detail in a later section).
Antler regeneration: formation of the
antler bud
The anatomy of the early stages of antler regeneration
has been described in a number of recent publications
is illustrated here in Fig. 7 (Kierdoff et al. 2003; Li et al.
2004, 2005; Price, 2005). Immediately after the old
antlers have been cast a raised ‘swollen’ ring of skin
surrounds the distal end of the pedicle (Fig. 7A). This
has a ‘shiny’ surface, characteristic of antler velvet skin.
Within hours, the epidermis, known as ‘wound epithelium’, starts to migrate across the exposed surface of
the pedicle bone and covers a mass of cells within loosely
packed extracellular matrix tissue (Fig. 8A). These cells
have not been well characterized; for example, it is not
known whether they express similar markers to cells in
the newt blastema. Li et al. (2004) describe the tissue in
the centre of the pedicle as granulation tissue. However,
we have shown that as early as 4 days after casting a
significant proportion of cells stain positive for PTHrP
(Faucheux et al. 2004), which leads us to assume that
these are of mesenchymal origin.
By days 9–10, epithelialization is complete and a
number of zones can be distinguished histologically at
anterior and posterior sites on the pedicle that mark
the position where future antler branches will develop
(Figs 7E and 8). Below the wound epithelium and
perichondrium is a zone of proliferating mesenchymal
cells, and more proximally chondrogenesis and bone
formation takes place (Fig. 8C,D).
The structure which forms on the pedicle after
antler casting has traditionally been called a ‘blastema’
(Fig. 7B) because blastema formation is a fundamental
step in the process of epimorphic regeneration. Epimorphic regeneration is defined as ‘de novo development of appendages distal to the level of amputation’
(Goss, 1980), and is distinct from the processes of cellular regeneration turnover or tissue repair. However,
the antler ‘blastema’ (Fig. 7B,E) is not a morphologically uniform structure like the blastema that forms following amputation of appendages in newts and other

Deer antler regeneration, J. S. Price et al. 611
lower vertebrates (Brockes, 1997). This, together with
evidence that antler regeneration may not involve
reversal of the differentiated state, has recently led Li
et al. (2004, 2005) to conclude that antler regeneration
is not blastema-based. These authors define a blastema
as being ‘formed from the de-differentiation of all cell
lineages on the immediate amputation plane’ (Li et al.
2005). However, we would argue that the key issue is
whether the undifferentiated cells in a blastema can
regenerate a lost part, not whether they are formed by
de-differentiation. For example, the regenerating tail of
Xenopus involves formation of a structure that is generally
described as a blastema, although there is no evidence
that it forms by de-differentiation (Slack et al. 2004).
Within a few days after casting, distinct ‘growth
zones’ can be identified in the early antler at sites
where branches will eventually develop (Fig. 7E) (Price
et al. 1994). These can be identified by the presence of
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells
(Price, 2005) that also synthesize PTHrP, which we have
previously proposed is a marker of antler progenitor
cells (Faucheux et al. 2004). We suggest that although
the whole structure that forms on the pedicle should
not be called a blastema, the individual growth zones
do have some of the features that define a blastema,
i.e. they consist of ‘a mass of undifferentiated cells that
will develop into an organ or tissue that is present at
a site of regeneration’. Therefore, until cells in the
different regions of the early regenerating antler
‘blastema’ have been better characterized, we suggest
that it is somewhat premature to conclude that antler
regeneration is not blastema-based.
Because the early stages of antler regeneration have
not been studied in any detail at a cellular level, we
know little about the signalling pathways that are
involved. As discussed above, PTHrP is localized in
mesenchymal cells but it is also present in regenerating
wound epithelium, suggesting that it may have multiple roles (Faucheux et al. 2004). In the same study we
also identified TGF-β in the early antler and found that
it up-regulates PTHrP synthesis by cultured blastema
cells. There are several lines of evidence to suggest that
retinoic acid (RA) is also likely to play a role during
the early stages of regeneration: the RA-synthesizing
enzyme RALDH2 is synthesized in the early antler and
in situ hybridization studies have also shown that
RARα, RABβ and RXRβ receptors are also expressed,
although they are not each present in every cell type.
For example, RARβ is specifically expressed in cells at
sites of cartilage/bone formation in more proximal
regions (Price &amp; Allen, 2004). This demonstrates that
the early antler bud is not a uniform structure and that,
like PTHrP, RA may have multiple functions.
Another question in antler biology pertains to the
source of cells which give rise to the regenerating antler Wislocki and Goss were of the view that migrating
cells from the dermis of the pedicle were the source
(Wislocki, 1943; Goss, 1972, 1984, 1995). However, a
number of workers in this field currently take the view
that regenerating antlers are derived mainly from a
population of progenitor cells in the periosteum of the
pedicle (Kierdorf &amp; Kierdorf, 1992, 2000, 2001; Li et al.
2005). This tissue is derived from antlerogenic periosteum, which has convincingly been shown to be the
origin of the pedicle and primary antlers (Hartwig, 1974;
Goss &amp; Powel, 1985; Kierdorf &amp; Kierdorf, 2001). Li et al.
(2005) concluded from their histological studies that
antler regeneration is stem cell based with the periosteum being the source of these cells. However, before
a cell can be defined as a true ‘stem’ cell it must be
shown to have a capacity for self-renewal and to be
capable of differentiation into specialized lineages. To
date there is no evidence that cells from the pedicle of
an adult deer have the capacity for self-renewal or can
differentiate into anything other than chondrocytes
and osteoblasts (Li et al. 1995). A number of approaches
could be taken to address this issue: (1) the identification of stem cell markers in tissues of the pedicle,
(2) the demonstration that cells cultured from the
periosteum of the pedicle of regenerating antlers
are pluripotential in vitro and in animal models in vivo,
and, (3) the demonstration that periosteum cells stably
transfected with a genetic marker [e.g. green fluorescent protein (GFP)] differentiate into different antler
cell types in regenerating antlers in vivo.
Antler regeneration: cartilage and bone growth
In the first month after casting, antlers grow relatively
slowly; however, during the next 2 months longitudinal growth is very rapid and this rate of bone formation represents the fastest described in the mammalian
kingdom (Goss, 1983). The longitudinal growth of the
antler that occurs in the distal end of each branch
(shown schematically in Fig. 7F and histologically in
Fig. 9) was originally described as a process of modified
endochondral ossification by Banks &amp; Newbry (1983).
These authors classified the antler tip as consisting of

four zones, namely the zones of proliferation, maturation, hypertrophy and calcification, representing the
spectrum of bone development.
The mesencymal growth zone
Below the dermis of the velvet skin (Fig. 9B) is the perichondrium (Fig. 9C), which is continuous proximally
with the periosteum that surrounds the shaft of the
antler and is the site of intramembranous bone formation. There is an outer fibrous perichondrium where
type I collagen mRNA and protein are highly expressed
(Price &amp; Faucheux, 2001) and an inner, more cellular
zone (Fig. 9D). This region of the antler has been variously described by different authors (our group is also
guilty of this), and the descriptors include ‘reserve
mesenchyme’, ‘hyperplastic perichondrium’, ‘cellular
periosteum’ and ‘mesenchyme’. For consistency we now
describe this as ‘mesenchyme’ or ‘mesenchymal growth
zone’ because cells in this region, like cells in this region
of the primary antler, are actively dividing (Matich
et al. 2003; Faucheux et al. 2004). In culture these cells
proliferate rapidly as monolayers and synthesize type I
but not type II collagen (our unpublished observations), and this reflects their in vivo phenotype (Price
et al. 1996). However, unlike mesenchymal cells from
the developing limb, they cannot be cultured as micromasses; they spread out to form monolayers and
chondrogenesis is not initiated. Compared with cells in
more proximal regions of the antler, cells in this region
express only low levels of alkaline phosphatase and this
reflects their undifferentiated state (Price et al. 1994;
Price, 2005). However, although these cells will differentiate into chondrocytes in more proximal regions,
they do express markers of the early osteoblast lineage
(our unpublished observations) and in the presence of
dexamethasone alkaline phosphatase expression will
increase (Faucheux et al. 2001). This indicates that
these cells are at least bi-potential, although we have
preliminary evidence that they can also differentiate
into adipocyte-like cells under the appropriate culture
conditions.
In the mesenchymal growth zone there will be a
tightly co-ordinated balance between cell growth, cell

survival and differentiation into chondroprogenitors,
with some signalling pathways inducing proliferation
and others inducing differentiation. In recent years our
group and others have made some progress in identifying the local factors that may play a role. Several
years ago it was first shown that their proliferation in
vitro is stimulated by IGF-I and IGF-II and IGF receptors
are present in this region of the antler tip in vivo (Price
et al. 1994; Sadighi et al. 1994). Furthermore, IGF-I and
IGF-II were identified in a screen of antler extracts
undertaken some years ago (Mundy et al. 2001). This is
consistent with the hypothesis that IGF-I is likely to be
the ‘antler growth stimulus’. We have found that FGF2 also stimulates proliferation of mesenchymal cells
from regenerating antlers (Price, 2005), although we
have not yet tried immunolocalizing it in regenerating
antlers. Members of the FGF family and their receptors
have also been identified in the primary antler. A
proteome analysis of red deer antler has been recently
undertaken but surprisingly neither FGFs, IGFs, IGF
binding proteins nor IGF receptors were identified
(Park et al. 2004).
The BMP and TGF-β signalling pathways appear to
induce a more differentiated state in mesenchymal
cells, as our preliminary studies have shown that BMP2 and TGFβ-1 inhibit the proliferation of mesenchymal
cells whereas they induce ALP activity (Price, 2005).
BMP-2 and BMP-4 have both been cloned from antlers
(Feng et al. 1995, 1997) and Barling and collagues have
identified BMP-2, BMP-4 and BMP-14 and their receptors
in the primary antler (Barling, 2004b). We have recently
immunolocalized TGF-β in regenerating antlers and
it appears to act upstream of PTHrP, which, together
with the PTH/PTHrP receptor, are synthesized by the
majority of mesenchymal cells (Faucheux et al. 2004).
Interestingly, we have found that PTHrP has no effect
on the proliferation of mesenchymal cells (Faucheux &amp;
Price, 1999) and may maintain the undifferentiated
state, although the functional significance of its abundance in this region requires further study. We have
previously presented several lines of evidence that RA
also plays a role in controlling mesenchymal cell growth
and differentiation: first, the RA-synthesising enzyme
RALDH2 can be immunolocalized in mesenchymal cells,
and second, retinol, all-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA were
identified in mesenchyme by HLPC and in vitro alltrans-RA dose dependently increased ALP activity in
cultures of mesenchymal cells (Allen et al. 2002). However, the effects of RA in this region are likely to be very
complex, as reflected in the distinct patterns of expression of the RA receptors RARα, RXRβ, RXRβ and RXRγ.
Antler cartilage
With the naked eye it is possible to identify where
chondrogenesis starts in a longitudinal antler section; it
is where the tissue becomes slightly darker in colour
because of an increase in size of the vascular channels
(Fig. 9A). It is also possible to distinguish that there is a
distal region of non-mineralized cartilage whereas more
proximally deposition of mineral takes place (Price et al.
1996). The vascularization of antler cartilage is the
most striking difference between its anatomy and that
of other hyaline cartilages. This abundant blood supply
is required to meet the high metabolic demands
imposed by rapid tissue regeneration. That the antler
provides a valuable model for the study of angiogenesis was proposed recently by Clark et al. (2004),
who have identified VEGF and the VEGF receptor in
regenerating antler tissues.
Histologically, the boundary between mesenchyme
and the zone of chondroprogenitors is not distinct in
longitudinal sections, but is a region where cells start to
become arranged into columns between which there
are vascular spaces (Fig. 9F). Previously we have described
this as a ‘zone of transition’ because cells at this site
are at different stages of differentiation along the
chondrocyte lineage (Price et al. 1996). Type IIA collagen mRNA identifies chondroprogenitors in the developing skeleton (Sandell et al. 1994) and this isoform is
expressed in the distal antler cartilage whereas type IIB
collagen mRNA and protein are expressed throughout
the cartilage (Price et al. 1996). Type IIA collagen is
not expressed in growth plate cartilage (Sandell et al.
1994), another reason why it is difficult to compare
directly the process of endochondral ossification in a
long bone with that in antlers. Neither is type I collagen
found in the growth plate, whereas it is expressed by
antler cells in the ‘transition zone’. Yet another difference between the matrix of antler and mammalian
growth plate cartilage is the distribution of type X collagen; in the growth plate it is expressed only in proximal hypertrophic chondrocytes (Sandell et al. 1994)
whereas in the antler type X collagen can be localized
in the majority of chondrocytes.
Non-mineralized cartilage (Fig. 9F) provides us with
an abundant source of cells for in vitro studies, and
culturing them as a micromass helps to maintain the

chondrocyte phenotype (Allen et al. 2002; Price, 2005).
This provides a useful model for in vitro studies of
chondrogenesis; however, as will be described below,
we also use the model to study antler osteoclasts. To
date we have focused on molecules that we have identified in antler cartilage in vivo. PTHrP can be immunolocalized in chondroprogenitors but not in fully
differentiated chondrocytes (Faucheux et al. 2004),
and in micromass cultures it inhibits differentiation,
consistent with its role during limb development
(Faucheux, 1999). Indian hedgehog (IHH) and TGFβ-1
are also expressed in antler chondroprogenitors, indicating that these molecules may act with PTHrP in a
feedback loop to control differentiation. RA also controls chondrogenesis; both all-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA
are present in antler cartilage, and in vitro RA inhibits
proteoglycan synthesis by chondrocytes, an effect that
requires RAR signalling (Faucheux, 1999; Allen et al.
2002). However, RXRβ may mediate the effects of RA
in vivo because it is expressed throughout cartilage
trabeculae.
Cartilage and bone resorption
The growth of antlers, like that of other rapidly developing bones, requires extensive remodelling of cartilage and bone and thus is dependent on the local
formation of osteoclasts from circulating mononuclear
progenitors. In addition to columns of chondrocytes
and vascular spaces, antler cartilage contains perivascular tissue (Fig. 9F,G) and this has been identified as a
site where cells of the osteoclast lineage differentiate
(Faucheux, 1999; Faucheux et al. 2002; Szuwart et al.
2002). When digests are obtained from antler cartilage
for in vitro studies this includes a fraction of osteoclast
progenitors because cells with the phenotypic characteristics of mammalian osteoclasts will differentiate in
micromass cultures of chondrocytes under the appropriate conditions (Faucheux, 1999). This system is now
used routinely in our laboratory to study the mechanisms that regulate antler osteoclast function. Factors
that will induce antler osteoclastogenesis in vitro
include PTHrP, RANKL, M-CSF and RA (Allen et al. 2000;
Faucheux et al. 2002). Because sex steroids are important regulators of bone resorption in other species
(Riggs et al. 2002), we are currently exploring whether
the cessation of antler bone growth induced by high
concentrations of testosterone involves direct effects
of sex steroids on osteoclast activity.
Antler bone formation
Although osteoclasts start to differentiate in the nonmineralized cartilage, the largest TRAP-positive cells
are localized in the mineralized cartilage lower down
the antler tip where extensive matrix resorption
takes place. This results in the formation of a number
of irregular trabeculae that are eventually replaced by
woven bone and cancellous lamellar bone in the primary spongiosa (Fig. 9H) at the centre of the antler
shaft (Banks &amp; Newbry, 1983). Osteoblasts appear to
differentiate from a population of osteoblast progenitors in perivascular tissue in cartilage; these cells synthesize type I collagen mRNA (Price et al. 1996), alkaline
phosphatase (Price et al. 1994) and, as they mature,
osteocalcin, a marker of the fully differentiated osteoblast phenotype (Allen et al. 2002). At the same time
intramembranous ossification takes place around the
antler shaft (Fig. 9J) and although we have not studied
ALP expression at this site, osteocalcin can be immunolocalized in osteoblasts beneath the periosteum
(Allen et al. 2002).
To date, our knowledge of the factors that may specifically regulate osteogenesis in regenerating antlers
is derived from descriptive studies, although culturing
these cells from explants of antler bone is straightforward and so there is great potential for further work in
this area. As discussed recently by Kierdorf &amp; Kierdorf
(2004), the rapid rate of antler bone growth makes it
an excellent model for investigating osteogenesis.
PTHrP, acting through the PPR, is likely to play a role as
both are present in osteoblasts at sites of endochondral
and intramembranous bone formation. By contrast, we
have only found IHH in osteoblasts in the midshaft of
the antler, not at the periphery, which suggests a specific role in endochondral bone growth, consistent with
the findings of knock-out studies in mice (St-Jacques
et al. 1999). IHH mRNA has also been localized in antler
cartilage and bone by in situ hybridization, following
its identification in a cDNA library (Lord et al. 2004).
TGFβ-1 is also present in antler osteoblasts (Price et al.
2004). Another molecule that is likely to regulate bone
formation in antlers is RA given that it is found at relatively high levels in antler bone and RALDH2 is localized in osteoblast progenitors in antler cartilage as well
as in more differentiated osteoblasts. The effects of RA
on osteoblast lineage cells may be mediated by the
RARα receptor because it is expressed in perivascular
tissues where type I collagen mRNA-expressing cells are

Deer antler regeneration, J. S. Price et al. 615
also located (Allen et al. 2002). All of the molecules discussed above have been shown to regulate osteoblast
function in other species (Grigoriadis et al. 1986; Choong
et al. 1993; Oliva et al. 1993; Slootweg et al. 1996; Park
et al. 1997; St-Jacques et al. 1999; Kobayashi et al. 2002).
What is clear from the above is that the factors so far
identified as being involved in antler regeneration
have multiple functions. For example, both RA and
PTHrP regulate chondrocyte, osteoclast and osteoblast
differentiation. Our knowledge of the pathways involved
remains in its infancy, but what is becoming apparent
is that nature is conservative and that during antler
regeneration a number of developmental pathways
are recapitulated. In fact, studies in a diverse range of
models are beginning to show pleiotropic functions for
known genetic pathways in the context of regeneration
(Sanchez Alvarado, 2004). The hunt for novel ‘antler
factors’ has been going on for a number of years; it
started in the 1990s with the generation of a cDNA
library by Mundy and colleagues (Mundy, 2001) who
were trying to identify novel bone anabolic agents.
More recently, Lord et al. (2004) generated a large
database of genes present in regenerating antlers and
the first proteomic analysis of red deer antler has been
reported (Park et al. 2004). These studies provide an
invaluable resource, inform us of ‘what is there’ and
lead to hypothesis-driven research. However, it is very
likely that novel molecular pathways may not be
uncovered in antlers. In our view the challenge lies
instead in understanding the way that different signalling pathways interact, both with each other and with
their local and systemic environment, to regenerate a
structure as large and complex as an antler. Dissection
of the function of these pathways requires the manipulation of gene expression in vivo and we have preliminary data to show that biolistic particle transfer can
be used to transfect cells in the blastema (Price &amp; Allen,
2004). However, retroviral/adenoviral approaches may
also prove to be useful tools for studying gene function.
Conclusions
Deer antlers are not only spectacular creations of the
natural world but also provide us with a unique model
for regeneration research (although the limitations of
using a large semi-wild animal with a seasonal pattern
of regeneration and limited potential for genetic
manipulation should not be underestimated). Regeneration of antlers is regulated by environmental and
systemic cues, rather than by injury or amputation, and
recent evidence suggests that it probably involves stem
cells, not de-differentiation of mature cells. Therefore,
antler regeneration does not utilize all of the same
strategies as regeneration in the urodele amphibian.
However, this makes the antler more, not less, relevant
as a model for human regeneration because if we can
understand how deer have adapted the normal
mechanisms of development, cell renewal and repair to
regenerate a complete appendage it may be possible
to achieve the same outcome in diseased or damaged
human tissues.
