The National Zoological Gardens of South Africa (NZG)
has been a declared National Research Facility of the
National Research Foundation (NRF) since 1 April 2004.
As an independent government agency, the NRF promotes and supports research in all knowledge ﬁelds. The
National Research Facilities, placed under the custodianship of the NRF, contribute to the provision of a highquality research platform for the research community
across the national science system. The NZG as a
National Research Facility is in a unique position to
generate new knowledge, core technologies and data
pools/collections commensurate with international standards. It provides a critical mass of equipment, skills and
users and the potential for networking and attracting
collaboration. The facility offers unique opportunities
for the advancement of science and for an interface
between science and the public, and the additional
provision of opportunities for people development. The
broad strategic contexts of the NZG are thematic drivers.
These drivers focus on the way the organization attracts,
develops and retains talent. The aim is to uphold excellence in all investments in knowledge, people and
infrastructure.
Key-words: National System of Innovation; platform;
research; strategic drivers.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.929180564102564">
The National Zoological Gardens of South
Africa (NZG) was founded in 1899 when the
government of the time purchased the farm
Rus in Urbe from the celebrated South African author J. F. Cilliers to establish a zoo.
Today, it operates four sites in three provinces. Each site plays an important role in
adding value to the core functions of the
organization. The main site and headquarters
are located in South Africa’s capital city,
Pretoria, in the form of an 85 ha zoo. The
6000 ha Biodiversity Conservation Centre in
Lichtenburg in the North-West Province of
the country has distinguished itself as a
semi-in situ site where White rhinoceros
Ceratotherium simum have been bred successfully. The 1500 ha Biodiversity Conservation Centre in Mokopane in the Limpopo
Province, located in the north of South Africa, houses threatened species such as Roan
antelope Hippotragus equinus and Black
rhinoceros Diceros bicornis, as well as other
ﬂagship species that include Cape buffalo
Syncerus caffer and Red-billed oxpeckers
Buphagus erythrorhynchus. In association
with a commercial venture on the banks of
the Vaal River in Gauteng Province, the NZG
also jointly manages a 14 ha zoo and an 89 ha
animal park.
Collectively, these sites house one of the
largest animal collections in Africa, comprising 3117 specimens of 209 species of mammal, 1358 specimens of 202 species of bird,
3871 specimens of 190 species of ﬁshes, 388
specimens of four species of invertebrate, 309
specimens of 93 species of reptile and 44
specimens of seven species of amphibian.
A reptile park and the largest inland marine
aquarium further complement the collection.
Acquired in 1916, the NZG is the only one
of the four governmental zoos in South
Africa with national status. The only

Koalas Phascolarctos cinereus on the African
continent are housed at the NZG. The 51
Bald ibises Geronticus eremita maintained
by the NZG constitute the largest breeding
population of these birds in Africa and
the NZG observed the ﬁrst ever zoo birth of
a Southern white rhinoceros C. s. simum
(Brand, 1980).
The NZG is a member of the international
zoo and aquarium community through the
World Association of Zoos and Aquariums
(WAZA). The NZG has clearly aligned itself
strategically with the new roles and functions
that zoos and aquariums are required to play
in the conservation of biodiversity, with conservation research, education and science
awareness being integral parts of the activities (WAZA, 2005; Zimmermann et al.,
2007; Dick &amp; Gusset, 2010). Through this
global connectedness, the NZG established
linkages, partnerships, collaborations and sister relationships with zoos from all corners of
the world. Partnerships are also in place with
research and conservation organizations that
undertake in situ conservation of threatened
species.
In the African landscape, the NZG was the
founder member of the regional African
Association of Zoos and Aquaria (PAAZAB).
PAAZAB serves as a forum for shared
knowledge in ex situ conservation of wildlife
biodiversity, skills development and technical
development in professional zoo practice,
wildlife conservation education and conservation research. The New Partnership for
Africa’s Development Science and Technology Consolidated Plan of Action sees Africa’s biodiversity as a major source of
economic and social transformation, although
it is underutilized and being lost at an alarming rate (Mugabe &amp; Ambali, 2006). The
action plan argues for African countries to
establish regional networks of scientiﬁc centres of excellence to drive conservation
and sustainable use of the continent’s biodiversity. As the only zoo in the continent
with a statutory mandate to undertake scientiﬁc research, the NZG is appropriately positioned to lead and deliver on this continental
responsibility.

THE NEW MANDATE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9604031875">
On 1 April 2004, the NZG was declared a
National Research Facility and transferred
to the management of the South African
National Research Foundation (NRF). South
Africa’s National Research Facilities are
high-end scientiﬁc and technical facilities
with specialist equipment and skills that are
not duplicated anywhere else in the country.
They serve as important research platforms
that are made accessible to the entire research
community, including universities and other
components of the science system locally
and internationally. All National Research
Facilities are managed by the NRF on behalf
of the nation and under the political direction
of the National Department of Science and
Technology. The NRF is an autonomous
government agency charged with supporting
research and human-resource development
for science, engineering and technology in
South Africa.
The fact that over 200 000 learners/scholars visit the facility annually was a primary
consideration in the declaration of the NZG
as a National Research Facility, in recognition of its potential to play a pivotal role in the
advancement of science in society. However,
the NZG, which is a classical and old
(110 years old) zoo, had neither a distinguished history of research nor the primary
infrastructural platform to fulﬁl its new mandate at the time of its declaration as a National
Research Facility.
National Research Facilities are expected
to: (1) provide a platform for high-quality
research, accessible to the wider research

(2) undertake high-quality research and generate knowledge in areas of strategic national importance and competitive advantage;
(3) develop technology and pursue innovation in support of the national effort for
scientiﬁc, technological and social innovation; (4) grow human capital through research
and technology development in areas of strategic national importance and for the development of a knowledge economy; (5)
advance science in society through:

 provision of platforms for enhancing
science awareness and public engagement;

This meant that the organization had to
undergo fundamental transformation to position itself to fulﬁl the new mandate and the
expectations that came with it.

ORGANIZATIONAL
TRANSFORMATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997345905660378">
A comprehensive strategic planning process
to review the activities of the NZG critically
and to position it within South Africa’s National System of Innovation commenced in
2005. This process culminated in the development and the adoption of a new NZG
Strategic Plan in 2006 (NZG, 2006), which
focused largely on the transformation of the
NZG into a National Research Facility.
During this time, however, strategic shifts
within the NRF occurred and were subsequently embodied in a new strategy document NRF Vision 2015 (NRF, 2008). As a
result, the NZG revised its newly adopted
Stategic Plan in order to align with the
corporate NRF strategy. The result was
Agenda2015, a plan aimed at appropriate
positioning of the facility within its new
context focusing on delivery of the revised
mandate.
Key aspects of the NZG’s new strategic
framework
Agenda2015 highlights ﬁve strategic drivers,
the ﬁrst of which, by virtue of its declaration
as a National Research Facility, is ‘to grow
the NZG as a centre of excellence for conservation and biodiversity research on the
one hand, and conservation medicine on the
other, working at the in situ/ex situ interface’.
In delivering on the expectations of being a
modern zoo as envisioned in the World
Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy
(WAZA, 2005), the second driver is ‘to establish the NZG as a world-class 21st century
zoological garden’. The NZG is committed to
being a family attraction of ﬁrst choice that
inspires discovery, appreciation, care, knowledge and respect for nature to fulﬁl the
expectations of the 600 000 or so visitors
who pass through the gates every year. To this
end, Agenda2015 commits the NZG to become ‘a top-class metropolitan ecotourism
facility that places a premium on environmental sustainability’. While advancing science in
and for society, the NZG also aims to be ‘a
place of learning and a source of inspiration
to action for science and biodiversity’. No
organization can achieve any of its strategic
objectives without deﬁning capabilities, people, culture and its values. Therefore, the ﬁnal
strategic driver is ‘the organization: transforming the NZG into an organization that is
capable, diverse, responsive, knowledge-led
and embedded in core values’.
In giving the above exposition of the
strategic framework of the NZG, the description of its vision and mission was left until the
end to tie together all the strategic aspects into
what the organization aspires to be. The
vision of the NZG is Nature and Humanity
in Balance. NZG is committed to creating
dynamic opportunities for people and animals
to connect and, thus, inculcate a healthy
mutual respect and acceptance of the other’s
place within nature’s cycle. The mission
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.906386857142857">
statement ‘inspired conservation of wildlife
through knowledge, understanding and connection’ denotes the organization’s commitment to the following.
1. Develop knowledge through research that
can underpin conservation practice and management of biodiversity. Improve zoo operations and practice through continuous
monitoring and review. Evaluate and establish an evidence base for our actions and
decisions through knowledge generation.
2. Promote the understanding that humans
are an integral part of natural biodiversity and
can act to protect the environment, nature,
species and their habitats. Promote the understanding that through action and changing our
ways of life we can protect the environment

and save species and their habitats. Inculcate
understanding of the natural requirements of
species and habitats that will enable them to
survive as a basis for protecting the earth for
future generations to enjoy.
3. Illustrate the connection between wildlife,
domestic animals, humans and ecosystems as
an integrated circle of life. Support education
in schools using conservation as a science and
the school curriculum. Promote the animal
collections and (saving) species and their
habitats in the wild and the science of conservation and biodiversity management, on
the one hand, and human-resource development on the other.

HATCHING THE WAY TO BEING A
NATIONAL RESEARCH FACILITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963749869565217">
Several research areas have been established
over the last 2–3 years and these are laying
the foundation for future research excellence.
The NZG has a wildlife biomaterials bank
(wBRC), which is unique in that it encompasses components of multiple biobanks,
such as microbial and cell cultures, sperm
bank, tissue bank, pathology bank and environmental tissue bank. This represents an ideal
platform for the development of a Knowledge
Hub for both the banking of biomaterials and
reproductive physiology research. The
wBRC forms an integral part of an international partnership known as the South African International Centre for Integrated
Cryobiology, Research and Learning in partnership with the University of KwaZuluNatal, the University of the Witwatersrand
and collaborators from the United Kingdom.
Internationally, the wBRC is linked to and
participates in the International Society for
Biological and Environmental Depositories,
Frozen Ark and the Barcode of Life initiatives, all being coalitions aimed at deriving
value from natural biodiversity residing in the
form of biomaterials in order to develop
technologies and knowledge to beneﬁt both
nature and humanity.
In March 2009, the NZG launched its
Centre for Conservation Science (CfCS), a
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997292">
33
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.976920333333333">
Knowledge and Training Hub that focuses on
Conservation Biology and Wildlife Biodiversity research. After wide local and global
consultation, in particular with the Leibniz
Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in
Germany and the Centre for Research and
Conservation, Royal Society of Antwerp,
Belgium, the disciplines of wildlife epidemiology, behavioural ecology, molecular genetics, wildlife nutrition and reproductive
biology are targeted within the ex situ/in situ
interface. As the CfCS is well placed within
the conservation community to develop new
and improved technologies through research,
it also provides an opportunity to offer research-orientated services and quality, efﬁcient and professional expertise to other
zoological gardens, academic institutions,
conservation agencies and organizations.
The CfCS has dedicated laboratories for
wildlife pathology, veterinary parasitology
and molecular genetics with a sequencing
laboratory and a veterinary hospital. The
staff, comprising a veterinary pathologist, a
veterinary parasitologist, a molecular geneticist, an ecologist, an animal nutritionist and
three clinical veterinarians, play a complementary role by contributing conservation
medicine input.
Planning is under way to establish a Centre
for Conservation Medicine and Research, to
expand the current Veterinary Hospital and
establish it as a centre of research excellence
in this emerging science. Successful development of this area will position the NZG as
leader not only in the African continent but
also globally within an emerging knowledge
ﬁeld.
Wildlife disease epidemiology focuses on
targeted research and diagnostics to investigate the causes, prevalence, distribution and
evolutionary consequences of wildlife diseases of captive and wild animals in Africa
(Espie et al., 2009; Junker et al., 2009; de
Garine-Wichatitski et al., 2010). The NZG
has an extensive wildlife disease database and

include the investigation of the pathology of
free-ranging and captive Cheetahs Acinonyx
jubatus in southern Africa. The ﬁrst record of
pathology of free-ranging Leopards Panthera
pardus in the Kruger National Park is an
important project in collaboration with South
African National Parks (SANParks). Investigations into the pathology of free-ranging
Bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus and
Humpback dolphins Sousa chinensis, in collaboration with the South African Institute for
Aquatic Biodiversity, is the ﬁrst South African survey of marine mammals. Dolphins are
important sentinels indicating habitat degradation, and pathogen and/or chemical pollution. Avian inﬂuenza surveillance of live,
dead, captive and free-ranging birds is monitored in collaboration with the University of
Cape Town as part of an international programme with global signiﬁcance. An ex situ/
in situ emerging disease surveillance molecular database for chytridimycosis in amphibians (the only one in Africa) is a ﬁrst step
towards developing and applying key molecular diagnostic tests (Stuart et al., 2004;
Ro¨dder et al., 2009).
Technological, competitive and innovative
research is undertaken to develop in situ
hybridization techniques, molecular diagnostics for parasite (blood, zoonotic) and disease
detection, and investigate parasite pathogens,
diseases and vector control in wildlife. Roan
antelope and Sable antelope Hippotragus
niger (on an individual and population scale)
are the focus for an interdisciplinary approach
and multiplex detection of bacterial pathogens and molecular detection of Cryptosporidium, toxoplasmosis and anaplasmosis.
Cooperation with other research groups is
essential and includes the University of the
Free State and University of Venda in South
Africa and, internationally, the National Research Centre for Protozoan Diseases, Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary
Medicine, Japan, and the Oklahoma State
University in the United States. Speciﬁc
research projects are an epidemiological and
genetic diversity study of bovine anaplasmosis in South Africa (Shkap et al., 2009);
developing a dual priming oligonucleotide
system for the multiplex detection of bacterial
pathogens in captive animals; characterization of genes and proteins that can be used as
vaccine candidates against parasitic infections; genome sequencing of South African
isolates of protozoan parasites and the development of cell culture-derived vaccines for
various animal diseases.
The aim is to improve understanding of
zoonotic diseases and to optimize occupational health of staff at the NZG through
collaboration with the National Institute
on Communicable Diseases, Sandringham,
South Africa. Together with regional veterinary and academic institutions, capacity
development in the Southern African Development Community region is engaged in
wildlife-disease diagnosis, particularly at the
interface between human, domestic animals
and wildlife. The NZG is instrumental in the
development of a wildlife-diagnostic course
with partners at the Veterinary Faculty, University of Pretoria, SANParks and veterinarians representing different organizations from
Mozambique and Zimbabwe.
The NZG has built up a unique resource
to conduct and promote molecular genetic
research in Africa. As a result of habitat
fragmentation, a need to understand the relationships between the degree of genetic diversity, phylogenetics and genetic factors that
determine population viability is essential.
National genetic databases are being maintained and expanded for species such as Blue
wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus and Black
wildebeest Connochaetes gnou (Grobler
et al., 2005), Black and White rhinoceros,
Cheetahs, Southern ground hornbills Bucorvus leadbeateri, oxpeckers, pangolins Manis
sp, Sable antelope, Tsessebe Damaliscus lunatus and African elephant Loxodonta africana. Research projects range from the
development and implementation of genetic
techniques using genetic markers to sequencing of genomes and DNA proﬁling as an aid
for genetic management of threatened populations and wildlife forensic-science investigations (Kotze et al., 2008). A proﬁtable and

behalf of the African continent. Gender determination in threatened birds, reptiles and
mammals is part of a community conservation project, whereby a free service is provided to all zoos in South Africa (Dalton
et al., 2010; Monadjem et al., 2010). A strong
emphasis is on transfer of DNA technology
and here NZG collaborates nationally with
several universities, national and provincial
conservation agencies and organizations.
NZG has strong links with the University of
Vienna and the Research Institute for Wildlife
and Ecology in Vienna, Austria, on Cheetah
molecular research, and with the Zoological
Society of London, UK, on chytrid detection
using molecular techniques. The NZG is also
working towards the validation of cross-species and species-speciﬁc genetic markers in
various wildlife for forensic investigations.
One of the ﬂagship projects is the development of single nucleotide polymorphisms as a
tool for forensic investigations and genetic
characterization in White rhinoceros.
Scientiﬁc information on the dietary and
nutritional requirements of every animal
maintained by the NZG is an existing challenge to the nutritional management of the
animal collection. The specialization of diets,
energy budgets and feeding ecology is a
focus while the building of scientiﬁc capacity
to become a leader in applied wildlife nutrition is still a long-term aim. Links have been
fostered with the University of Pretoria, the
Tshwane University of Technology in Pretoria and the University of KwaZulu Natal.
Nutrition-related projects include the detection of necrobacillosis in captive Springbok
Antidorcas marsupialis and a communitybased food-production initiative.
The focus of behavioural ecology is on
ﬁnding ways to determine which elements in
the natural habitat of a particular animal
species are most essential (essential habitat
features). Such elements would have to be
present in the environment provided for that
species in captivity, as well as in areas
identiﬁed for relocation or reintroduction.
Furthermore, attempts to identify indicators,
both behavioural and physiological, that signal the lack of one or more essential habitat

<bodyText confidence="0.998137736842105">
features is an aim and, to facilitate this, strong
links have been developed with the Mammal
Research Institute of the University of Pretoria and the University of the Witwatersrand
(Fick et al., 2006; Kinahan et al., 2007;
Meyer et al., 2008). Another theme within
this focus area is the management of fragmented populations in the urban environment
where a highly fragmented Giant bullfrog
Pyxicephalus adspersus population in Gauteng was investigated. The project is based on
the prediction that without management the
population fragments will become extinct
one-by-one as a result of stochastic processes
and genetic deterioration. Behaviour and
movements of individuals are monitored
using radio frequency identiﬁcation tags
combined with accelerometers.
A public interface and engagement research focus area include four components,
namely conservation psychology, learning in
an informal environment, exhibit design and
visitor studies. The nature and dynamics of
the interface between the NZG and the public, the impact of the science advancement
activities of the NZG and the extent to which
the NZG meets the expectations and requirements of its visitors and audiences are determined and examined. This programme is a
collaborative effort between the marketing,
guest relation services, animal collection,
research and education functions of the
NZG. Research projects currently under way
include the comparative evaluation of educational programmes at the NZG, Uganda
Wildlife Education Centre and Zoo Negara
in Malaysia, two masters studies at the University of Pretoria on experience management, and a survey of consumer perceptions
and attitudes in a South African organization.
A further aim of the NZG is to create a
critical mass of African scientists, veterinarians and technicians with skills to engage in
wildlife conservation science. In this respect,
the CfCS provides a platform for scientists,
veterinarians and students to conduct research, and access to facilities and sharing of
expertise on biodiversity conservation and
animal health. With the dedication of training
undergraduate and postgraduate students, the

To achieve the aims described above, the
critical success factors will be a strong,
sustained and diverse resource base, an optimum number of quality, qualiﬁed, productive
and passionate staff, and the ability to establish, maintain and improve ﬁrst-class facilities and equipment for the animal collection,
staff and visitors. It is clear that the NZG as a
National Research Facility can play a unique
role fulﬁlling its mandate for conservation of
biodiversity. The only way of achieving success is to work in close collaboration with
other institutions in South Africa, Africa and
internationally. It is these institutions that
need to recognize and acknowledge the new
role of the NZG. In return, the NZG will aim
to assist these organizations to achieve their
respective mandates ultimately enhancing the
collective efforts in southern Africa for the
conservation of regional biodiversity.
