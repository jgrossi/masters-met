Integrative Zoology is proud to honor Darwin’s legacy by
supporting the study of biological and zoological sciences
The year 2009 marked the bicentenary of Charles
Darwin’s birth, and for the last 12 months zoologists have
been reminded of the enormous contribution that Darwin
made to our understanding of the natural world. We have
celebrated his contribution in workshops and symposia,
often in association with other professional bodies like
the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS), but
more importantly for this journal, we have celebrated
Darwin’s work through publication of how his work has
impacted upon present day science. Darwin would have
been delighted with the understanding that has arisen
through our discoveries in molecular biology. He would
have been overjoyed with knowledge of the nature of DNA,
but I suspect he would have been surprised, perhaps even
alarmed at the impact that humans have had on the environment and the effect that this has had on the biosphere.
We are well aware that environments change, and the geological record is testament to this, but it is the rapidity
with which this change is occurring that is of concern. We
have lost many taxa already, and sadly we will lose many
more – perhaps even before they are described.
The biological science community has taken this plight
on board, and our concerns have been recognized through
the naming of 2010 as the International Year of Biodiversity
(the IUBS has gone a step further in naming the period
2010-1012 as the Triennium for Biodiversity). How we com-

municate our concerns, not just to the scientific
community, but beyond, will be a measure of us as bioscientists – i.e. as guardians of the Earth’s biosphere. Integrative Zoology provides a vehicle for us to demonstrate
our concerns, for only through adoption of
multidisciplinary approaches can we anticipate mitigation
of the enormous damage we have caused in the
environment. An integrative approach is not just a desire,
it is an imperative. We can be confident that the journal
Integrative Zoology will be an important vehicle for
change, and we are delighted to be able to report that it
has been indexed in the ISI Web of Science – recognition
that we have reached a high level of credibility in science
communication. This issue of Integrative Zoology focuses
upon the biological consequences of climate change. We
hope that readers will find papers that will inspire, challenge and provide insight into how we may better manage
our natural world.
