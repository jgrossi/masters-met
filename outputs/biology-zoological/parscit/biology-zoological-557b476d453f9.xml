The Malayan, or Asian, tapir (Tapirus indicus) has a diminishing wild population and is becoming more common in
captivity as zoos attempt to manage sustainable ex situ populations. Tapirs can be relatively easy to maintain and breed,
but captive animals appear to suffer from reduced activity budgets, obesity, and poor public image. A questionnairebased survey was designed and sent specifically to 10 collections around the world that exhibit Malayan tapirs, with
the aim of assessing husbandry regimes to determine prevalence of standardized practices as well as highlighting any
key differences, and to showcase good practice, thus providing information beneficial to those maintaining this species
in their zoo. Twenty-five animals were included in the survey from collections across four continents. The research’s
major conclusions show differing dietary make-up, with a lack of forage provision, contrasting with a diverse array
of enrichment protocols used. Significant differences were noted between zoos for total amount of food offered (P =
0.000) as well as ratios of forage to concentrate pellet offered (P = 0.004). Comparing food offered to male and female
tapirs with published requirements for an “average” of either gender shows not all zoos providing the amount suggested in husbandry guidelines. Intelligently designed and original enrichment was provided to all animals but differences between zoos were noted in the application and “usefulness” of enrichment for individual tapir. Overall, animals
are benefiting from enrichment but welfare could be further improved via consistent feeding of ad libitum forage and
regular use of browse as a constituent part of daily rations. Zoo Biol. 32:347–356, 2013.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.925595848484849">
The Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus), Order Perissodactyla; Family Tapiridae, is a shy, forest-dwelling herbivore
from South East Asia [e.g. Gemita et al., 2007], whose range
has been extensively reduced in the recent past [Khan, 1997].
Although generally thought of as a nocturnal solitary species
[Williams and Petrides, 1980], recent evidence suggests that
the Malayan tapir is more social than first thought [Diz,
2006]. Currently classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red
List (due to anthropogenic pressures and disturbance of its
natural habitat leading to fragmented populations), Malayan
tapir is known to exist in Malaysia, Sumatra (Indonesia),
Thailand, and Burma [Lynam et al., 2008]. Malayan tapir is
maintained in numerous animal collections around the world
generally being termed easy-to-keep [e.g. Barongi, 1999;
Shoemaker et al., 2004]. As intermediate feeders, Malayan
tapirs select fruits, grasses, and browse trees dependent upon
season [Janssen, 2003], an important fact to consider when
evaluating captive diets. Previous work on tapir nutrition
© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
has noted animals being fed too many domestic fruits and
vegetables in place of good quality forage, such as lucerne
(alfalfa) hay [Clauss et al., 2008, 2009].
The focus of this research is to evaluate various
management practices used for maintaining high standards
of welfare in captive Malayan tapir. Previous investigation
by the authors has noted published research into captive

husbandry of this particular tapir species to be lacking; a
finding concurrent with other authors [Taylor, 2000; Zenzinger, 2003]. Specifically focusing on enrichment, research
into Brazilian tapir (Tapir terrestris) enrichment protocols
[e.g. Sharpe, 1997; Thompson and Rose, 2008; Zenzinger,
2003] appear common, potentially due to the relative popularity of this species in zoological collections when compared to its Asian relative. Limited scientific assessment of
Malayan tapir enrichment practice makes such an evaluative
undertaking both informative and useful. Rose et al. [2006]
reviewed enrichment practice at the East Midland Zoological Society, Twycross Zoo in an attempt to qualify specific
regimes that were of most benefit to improving welfare and
promoting natural behavior patterns. Behavioral observations on the same animal noted that enrichment had a significant effect on foraging and locomotory behaviors in this
individual [Rose et al., 2008]. Work performed by Zenzinger
[2003] has shown that browse is the enrichment artifact most
used by tapirs, and the one that alters behavior patterns to the
greatest extent; a fact that is to be expected as being browsing ungulates, tapirs spend the greatest proportion of their
time foraging [e.g. Henry et al., 2000]. Wild Malayan tapirs
occupy large home ranges, from 12 km2 [Eisenberg, 1997]
to over 25 km2 [Traeholt, 2004] and as such, captive enclosures need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational stimulation for the inhabitants. Indeed, Foerster and
Vaughan’s [2004] research highlights the seasonal nature
of tapir habitat use, indicating the complexity of wild tapir
activity budgets.
The research presented here is of prime importance as
the current census from the IUCN Red List 2011.1 shows
that Malayan tapir numbers are decreasing in the wild
[Lynam et al., 2008]. As such, the ex situ conservation of
this species will require support from specific management guidelines and accurate knowledge on the species’
individual captive requirements. The slow reproductive
rate of Malayan tapirs plus their low wild population density [Eisenberg, 1997] makes the establishment and future
continuation of a sustainable captive population an essential
conservation strategy.

Questionnaire Design
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.867794666666667">
The questionnaire consisted of four sections, (1) demographics of the population housed, enclosure design,
and any mixed species arrangements; (2) types of enrichment used (on an individual as well as group basis);
(3) daily diet for all animals housed; and (4) if any behavioral
observations had occurred on the animals in the collection,
specifically concerning noted performance of abnormal/
unwanted behavior patterns. Sections contained a mixture
of open (please describe any stereotypic behavior observed
in your animals) and closed (do you provide any form of
enrichment; yes or no) style questions. The authors obtained British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums
(BIAZA) Research Group support for the survey, which was
posted out to a named individual (curator or similar) at those
zoos housing this species. Questions were posed in English,
as were responses. Questionnaires were generally filled-in
thoroughly with all questions being answered fully. Several
zoos provided photocopies of diet sheets, enrichment programs, and other such “in-house” information. Several of the
returned surveys included contact information for a named
individual should any extra information be required; such
detail was used by the authors to clarify specific points during analyses.

Data collection was part of a student research
project and, after contacts were made at the 2006 International Congress on Zookeeping, questionnaires were
posted at the start of 2007 to 10 collections that hold
Malayan tapir inside and outside of the European Endangered Species Program (EEP) that expressed an interest
in being surveyed and involved in the study. Participating
zoos were asked to detail the number of animals held, and
to provide details on their housing, feeding practice, and
enrichment. Zoos were also asked to provide any information on the behavior patterns of their animals, with a
specific emphasis on the performance of abnormal (stereotypic) behavior patterns.

One-sample t-tests were used to determine any significant
deviation away from the recommended amount of feed provided per animal per day. One-factor chi-squared tests were
used to compare differences between fiber values from each
collection’s diet (after Zootrition analysis). A one proportion

Enclosure type
Table 2 shows that all but one collection keeping
more than one tapir regularly house their animals socially, and that the majority of collections provided detail on
separation of individuals during breeding. Only one collection (zoo 9) keeps their tapirs in a mixed-species enclosure (hereafter termed “MSE”); animals being housed with

ferruginea). The limited number of MSEs could possibly be explained by the potential temperamental nature
of Malayan tapirs and the injury that could be caused to
cage-mates.
Nutrition
Each collection provided details of the feeding regime
in place for all tapirs housed. Table 3 details trends in (1)
concentrate type used, (2) preferred forage, and (3) how often tapirs are fed. It appears that a “meal-based” approach to
feeding is apparent in some situations.
Inferential analysis shows a significant difference
between the amount of food offered daily to each animal
between all collections (χ2; df = 8; P = 0.000). Consequently, there does not appear to be a standard feeding
regime in place that these collections are adhering to. It
was not possible to analyze the diet from collection 6
as no specific details on quantities, brands, or types of
feed were provided. A one-sample t-test was used to compare current recommended total daily food provision (as

Shoemaker et al. (2004) and estimating a male tapir to
weigh on average 340 kg and a female to weigh on average 386 kg, it can be suggested that a male tapir’s daily
intake should be 15.3 kg/food and for a female 17.4 kg/
food. If each collection housed one male and one female
animal, and provided the current total daily amount of
food to each, then a significant difference away from recommended guidelines can be seen (t = –2.76; P = 0.025
for an average male tapir and t = –4.88; P = 0.001 for an
average female tapir); see Figure 1.
Numerous health problems can be associated with
poor intake of structural carbohydrate; inferential analysis
of each collection’s dietary fiber component (Table 5) shows
a significant difference between values (for crude fiber (CF),
χ2; df = 8, P = 0.001; acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral
detergent fiber (NDF), χ2 = 8, P = 0.000).
Assuming that zoological collections holding Malayan tapir are following the current and readily accessible
husbandry guidelines by Shoemaker et al. [2004], it can be
assumed that diets in captivity should be formulated of 33%
forage, 33% concentrate pellets, and 33% other (produce,
browse, or similar). Comparison of diets (Fig. 2) from this
research shows that there is significant deviation away from
recommended, published, guidelines (one proportion sign
test, P = 0.004) with regard to standardized forage/pellet
provision. Indeed, weights of feed given and ratios stated do
not appear to match (Tables 3 and 4), suggesting that mea-
sured amounts are not always provided by keepers. Taking
a more radical view and assuming that 70% forage to 30%
pellet standard should be followed [as per Lintzenich and
Ward, 1997], all diets in this study would fail to provide adequate structural carbohydrate (see ratios for concentrate to
pellet per diet, Table 6). However, splitting zoos into “European” and “non-European” shows that zoos in the Southern
Hemisphere have a higher forage components to their diets
(as fed).
Questionnaire data provided detail on a range of
grass and legume forages provided to Malayan tapir in different collections. A range of forage types were detailed
as being fed to captive tapirs, specifically: barley straw,
wheat straw, oat hay, lucerne (alfalfa) hay, timothy hay,
and lucerne-based chaff. There was no standard forage
type that appeared favored among collections. Drawing
on recommended guidelines for browsers, forage with a
medium to high protein and NDF content is preferable;
however, several collections noted tapirs consumed straw
bedding and therefore this has been included as a forage

Enrichment
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.942770235294118">
The majority of collections provide enrichment for
their tapirs and details regarding the key forms presented
can be seen in Tables 7 and 8. Of the five recognized forms
of enrichment (physical, occupational, nutritional, sensory, and social; for more information on categories see
Shepherdson, 1998), the results show that enrichment categorized as nutritional, occupational, and sensory types is
most often provided. It could be argued that group-housed
animals are experiencing social enrichment, and this will be
discussed in due course.
The most common browse species reported include
willow (Salix sp.), ash (Fraxinus sp.), sycamore (Acer pseudoplantanus), Bambuseae (various species), oak (Quercus
sp.), lime (Tilia sp.), Moraceae (mulberry, fig species), hazel (Corylus avellana), sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa),
poplar (Populus sp.), field maple (Acer campestre), and
beech (Fagus sp.). Results appear to suggest that browse
is considered more for the purposes of enrichment in European collections, compared to attitudes in non-European
zoos.

DISCUSSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991230820512821">
Using Shoemaker et al.’s [2004] husbandry guide as a
baseline, results highlight numerous areas of good practice
in the keeping and exhibition of Malayan tapirs in different
zoos around the world. It appears that the zoos surveyed
meet Hall’s [2007] guidelines for tapirs held socially whereby animals need to be separated during calving and calf
rearing, potentially due to the chance of dangerous and unpredictable behavior being performed. Wild Malayan tapirs
occupy large home ranges, from 12 km2 [Eisenberg, 1997] to
over 25 km2 [Traeholt, 2004] and as such, captive enclosures
need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational
stimulation for the inhabitants. The results show that collections provided some form of enrichment for their tapirs to
increase enclosure utilization and activity in their animals.
Current research states that tapirs are generally inactive,
due to inappropriate diets causing obesity and altered time
budgets [Clauss et al., 2009]; similarly, Green et al. [2007]
show that presentation of feed to captive tapirs can affect total activity budgets and behavioral repertoire diversity. Wild
tapirs expend the majority of their energy consuming vegetation [Oliveiro-Santos et al., 2010], and calculated times
spent foraging range from 8.5 [Novarino, 2005] to 15 hr/
day [Holden et al., 2003], depending on habitat type. Therefore, to promote “great welfare” [as per Melfi, 2009], increased opportunities for foraging could be offered. Indeed,
Seitz [1998] and Barongi [2000] state that activity of captive tapirs is predominantly influenced by dietary provision
and the presence of conspecifics, highlighting links between
husbandry and social enrichment.
Encouraging keepers to use low-energy feed items
would be highly beneficial as the positive relationship
between resting and limited forage opportunity would be
reversed. Results suggest that this approach is evident in the
survey population and that keepers are attempting to provide rations with some browse content. Collections are using native browse to augment daily rations and at least one
zoo stated that they specifically collected types of browse
akin to consumed plants in range states to “bulk out” daily diets. Ragone and Cavaletto [2006] demonstrated that
fruits from different species of the genus Artocarpus contain variable amounts of energy, protein, and fiber, stating
that these trees make ideal candidates for sustainable food
production.
Field observation suggests that Malayan tapirs are selective browsers and are very specific in terms of ingested
vegetation [Williams and Petrides, 1980]. It appears from
this research that there are differences between areas of the
world in how diets are formulated for this species (Fig. 2);
those zoos in the Southern Hemisphere had a greater reliance
on forage, browse, and “natural” plant material compared
with zoos in the Northern Hemisphere that put a greater reliance on domestic produce and pelleted feeds. Some collections feed locally available browse as a main component
of the diet (e.g. Artocarpus indicus fruits and leaves fed to

Tapir Husbandry Survey 353
animals at the South East Asian zoo). Consequently, work
on the components of those plants that occur in the same
regions as the wild population of Malayan tapirs could yield
interesting results that would be applicable to the formation
of a more species-appropriate captive diet.
An explanation centering on the logistics of collecting, growing, and harvesting “native-type” plants/plant material in Northern Hemisphere zoos could account for such
discrepancies. Research published by Wilson and Wilson
[1973] shows that, historically, fruit and vegetables were
a large component of captive tapir diets; the research presented here shows this to be unchanged in some collections.
Kawata [2008] refers to the “dire need” for more knowledge
on wild diets of even the most commonly housed zoo species. While only an approximation, Figure 1 visibly shows
discrepancy between suggested daily amount of food for
male and female tapirs, and that actually offered; this deviation being especially pronounced for male animals. Clearly,
animals may not consume all that is offered but collections
offering up to 3 or 4 kg more than guidelines suggest could
think about reducing volume of some dietary items and thus
cutting expenditure.
Personal observation, supported by the findings of this
study and published work [e.g. Clauss and Dierenfeld, 2008;
Hall et al., 2003], identifies the discrepancies between grazer and browser intake. Many zoos provide forage for their tapirs but limited acceptance, high wastage, and an associated
reluctance to continue to offer forage seem to be the norm.
Veterinary problems associated with other specialized herbivores are linked to poor forage acceptance [e.g. Clauss et
al., 2002; Hatt et al., 2005], identifying the importance of a
knowledge of evolutionary ecology applied to captive feeding practice. The more specialized the species, the less general the captive management should be. Indeed, comparison
between Malayan tapir and black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) intake highlights, yet again, the issues associated with
finding an optimal forage ration for browsing Perissodactyla [e.g. Clauss et al., 2006]. Improvements to the welfare
of captive individuals, which have been demonstrated via
increases in activity and change to fecal consistency, occur
with minor alterations to captive diet [Clauss et al., 2008].
Dietary change not only would benefit welfare but
also the public’s image of the tapir in the zoo. Seitz [2002]
states that the zoo-going public do not find tapirs particularly
interesting animals to observe. Similarly, anecdotal evidence
collected by the authors of this paper show that the public
are generally not very interested in ungulates as a group and
find tapirs “boring” due to their inactivity. An objective of an
earlier study [Rose et al., 2006] involving Malayan tapir at
Twycross Zoo was designed to “make” tapirs more interesting to the public by encouraging the animal to be more active via the use of enrichment. Steiz [1998] supports the idea
that tapir can be “made” more interesting to zoo visitors via
alterations to exhibit layout and planned use of enrichment,
thus directly impacting the conservation/education value of
the exhibit.
Only one zoo surveyed attempted an MSE and while
the authors know of several collections that mix Brazilian
tapir with other species, research suggests that MSE with
Malayan tapir to be limited. The large size, shy character,
and potential for aggressive behavior in this species may
cause zoos to be reluctant to attempt MSE. However, as zoo
exhibit design becomes more adventurous and sophisticated, the potential for MSE with difficult species is increased.
Added interest in the enclosure, with species from a similar
geographic area to the Malayan tapir or inclusion of active or
visually attractive animals (as per those included in zoo 9),
helps draw in the public and tell a specific conservation and/
or educational message [e.g. Hosey et al., 2009]. Interspecific interaction can be used to diversify the behaviors of Malayan tapir in captivity (see zoo 1 in Table 8) and provides
another form of enrichment to stimulate and interest captive
individuals. It may be that such an exhibit is not feasible in
many current collections, due to space and budget demands,
and also the potentially volatile nature of the species [e.g.
see Janssen, 2003] causing zoo personnel to be wary of multispecies incorporation. What is encouraging is that many
of the tapirs in this sample population are housed in enclosures that allow access to a conspecific but that segregation
of individuals can be allowed for specific management-related purposes (breeding, parturition, veterinary treatment).
Hosey et al. [2009] and Hickey and Rose [2010] detail that
interaction with conspecifics can be an important enriching aspect of the captive environment; to be fully enriching
for the individual, the animal then must be given the opportunity to remove itself from one situation and enter into
another.
Williams and Petrides [1980] state that Malayan tapirs have been observed to congregate in pairs or trios; thus,
stating that this species is more social than originally assumed. While tapirs are traditionally considered solitary,
if more is known about wild aggregations, this could be
factored into captive enclosure design to allow mixing of
individuals at particular times or for possible enrichment.
The authors know of a case where two Malayan tapirs were
maintained in the same enclosure but both had access to individual dens, hence giving the choice of companionship or
not. This setup appeared to work well to provide stimulation
and chances for social interaction that allow for development of a “full” behavioral repertoire. White et al. [2003]
analyzed the effect of rotational exhibition of a range of species, including Malayan tapirs; results showed an increase
in important natural behaviors in the tapir, with the conclusion that without the presence of variation in the exhibit,
there may not be the chance for some important behaviors
to be performed.
Tapirs have been the subject of enrichment studies
[e.g. Rose et al., 2006; Sharpe, 1997; Taylor, 2000; Zenziger,
2003] but there is still a relative dearth of available information concerning enrichment methods used for ungulates
(when compared to primates or carnivores for example);
hence, research into tapir-specific management helps to fill

a gap in knowledge. Indeed, Swaisgood and Shepherdson’s
[2005] paper on the future “journey” of enrichment studies
highlights only one article available on tapir enrichment for
the purposes of their research. As a group, ungulates can
seem difficult to enrich, but there are guidelines available to
act as a starting point [e.g. Burgess/AZA, n.d.; Roddis and
Wakefield, 1998; Shepherdson, 1998], and systematic planning for ungulate enrichment can yield interesting results for
both animals and keepers alike [Rose et al., 2008; Rose and
Roffe, 2008].
It is heartening to note the diverse array of enrichment provided for tapirs at the collections surveyed (Tables
7 and 8) and collections provided some interesting anecdotes
alongside of this information. One collection reported poor
acceptance of feed balls and specifically that the use of a
feed ball depended on the “personality” of the individual tapir, whereas in another collection that employed this form
of enrichment, all tapirs used feed balls readily. Contradiction arose between collections as to species of vegetation
deemed acceptable to be used for tapir browse; zoos in Europe were particularly divided over the use of white willow
(Salix alba). Some responses specifically stated that willow
was not fed to tapirs as it “is hard to digest,” whereas other
collections reported willow as being the favorite browse
choice of their tapirs with no reported ill-effects. Acceptance
of browse can be high, so continued and methodical analysis of browse provision to tapirs is desirable. Melfi [2009]
describes a situation where recommended practice for housing and husbandry used for a species is based on empirical
evidence of the animal’s needs. As befitting this research,
more data on wild tapir ecology (specifically concerning diet
selection and analysis of wild food choice) fed into captive
husbandry practice will further move this species in the direction of excellent welfare overall.
Welfare experienced by tapirs included in this survey
appears positive. Stereotypic behaviors were only noticed at
two collections and these manifested as locomotory actions
normally associated with the presence of a keeper, or the
animal anticipating the arrival of an excitatory stimulus (e.g.
the arrival of food). All zoos were asked whether or not they
conduct nighttime behavioral observations on their tapirs to
check “normality” of activity budgets during a period when
tapirs are naturally most active. Only two zoos stated that
they had ever done this with any form of regularity.
Research by Rose et al. [2008] showed that a singularly housed Malayan tapir portioned different parts of her
activity budget to both day and nighttime behaviors, and
that increased frequency of activity was observed with the
regular provision of a range of enrichment. Interestingly,
the effect of enrichment on behavior was more pronounced
for daytime activity than during nocturnal observation.
The same enrichment provided during the night had no
significant impact on behavioral diversity and expected
increases in investigative and foraging behavior did not
occur. Barongi [2000] states that wild Malayan tapir is
more active during daylight than assumed; consequently,
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.656806">

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919814814815">
it would suggest that more research into the holistic effects
of nutritional and sensory enrichment at different times of
the day are needed to ensure their relevance to this species overall. Rose et al. [2006] note a similar activity budget in a lone female Malayan tapir when provided with a
range of enrichments across different periods of the day.
When comparing the findings of Rose et al. with Mahler’s
[1984] research into captive Brazilian tapir time budgets,
similarities do appear; thus, suggesting that well thoughtout, evidence-based enrichment [e.g. Rose and Roffe,
2008, 2010] is the optimum way of providing beneficial
enrichment to captive ungulates, including tapirs. Kinahan [2001] states that the overall fundamental difference
between captive and wild tapir activity budgets concerns
time spent actively moving around, or investigating or
being able to forage in, the animal’s immediate environment. It would appear that certain facets of tapir management impair the species’ ability to perform a “wild-type”
time budget. It is important to remember that the zoo environment, when compared to a natural habitat, is often
controlled and predictable [Kinahan, 2001; Shepherdson,
1998], and not all wild behaviors can be performed exactly
for evolutionary purpose. There are key appetitive behavior patterns that fundamentally link to good welfare [e.g.
Swaisgood, 2007]; infringement on these behaviors will
deprive individuals of the opportunity to best cope with
their situation and can lead to stress. The effects of stress
on captive tapirs, due to inappropriate housing, husbandry
and management are well documented [Janssen, 2003] and
hence, stressors should be minimized or removed where
possible. The tapir is evidently a difficult animal to exhibit
with regard to nutritional requirements and “likeability”
with the zoo-going public. Further implementation of species-appropriate husbandry that rectifies or alters provision of care to create positive welfare [as per Yeates and
Main, 2008] can benefit behavioral repertoires, activity
patterns, and hence public perception.

1. A summary of the main results show that 70% of the collections surveyed provide some form of enrichment to
their tapirs every day and that 70% of collections provide
enrichment in the morning and the evening.
2. A total of 90% of collections surveyed provided browse to
their animals but only 2 of the 10 collections gave access
to ad libitum forage.
3. All Malayan tapirs in these surveyed zoos are managed in
enclosures that conform to guidelines based on promoting
good welfare in this species.

Although generally thought of as a nocturnal solitary species [Williams and Petrides, 1980], recent evidence suggests that the Malayan tapir is more social than first thought [Diz, 2006]. Currently classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (due to anthropogenic pressures and disturbance of its natural habitat leading to fragmented populations), Malayan tapir is known to exist in Malaysia, Sumatra (Indonesia), Thailand, and Burma [Lynam et al., 2008]. Malayan tapir is maintained in numerous animal collections around the world generally being termed easy-to-keep [e.g. Barongi, 1999; Shoemaker et al., 2004]. As intermediate feeders, Malayan tapirs select fruits, grasses, and browse trees dependent upon season [Janssen, 2003], an important fact to consider when evaluating captive diets. Previous work on tapir nutrition © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. has noted animals being fed too many domestic fruits and vegetables in place of good quality forage, such as lucerne (alfalfa) hay [Clauss et al., 2008, 2009]. The focus of this research is to evaluate various management practices used for maintaining high standards of welfare in captive Malayan tapir. Previous investigation b</context>

Malayan tapir is maintained in numerous animal collections around the world generally being termed easy-to-keep [e.g. Barongi, 1999; Shoemaker et al., 2004]. As intermediate feeders, Malayan tapirs select fruits, grasses, and browse trees dependent upon season [Janssen, 2003], an important fact to consider when evaluating captive diets. Previous work on tapir nutrition © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. has noted animals being fed too many domestic fruits and vegetables in place of good quality forage, such as lucerne (alfalfa) hay [Clauss et al., 2008, 2009]. The focus of this research is to evaluate various management practices used for maintaining high standards of welfare in captive Malayan tapir. Previous investigation by the authors has noted published research into captive This article was published online on 18 May 2012.

Wild Malayan tapirs occupy large home ranges, from 12 km2 [Eisenberg, 1997] to over 25 km2 [Traeholt, 2004] and as such, captive enclosures need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational stimulation for the inhabitants. The results show that collections provided some form of enrichment for their tapirs to increase enclosure utilization and activity in their animals. Current research states that tapirs are generally inactive, due to inappropriate diets causing obesity and altered time budgets [Clauss et al., 2009]; similarly, Green et al. [2007] show that presentation of feed to captive tapirs can affect total activity budgets and behavioral repertoire diversity. Wild tapirs expend the majority of their energy consuming vegetation [Oliveiro-Santos et al., 2010], and calculated times spent foraging range from 8.5 [Novarino, 2005] to 15 hr/ day [Holden et al., 2003], depending on habitat type.

Behavioral observations on the same animal noted that enrichment had a significant effect on foraging and locomotory behaviors in this individual [Rose et al., 2008]. Work performed by Zenzinger [2003] has shown that browse is the enrichment artifact most used by tapirs, and the one that alters behavior patterns to the greatest extent; a fact that is to be expected as being browsing ungulates, tapirs spend the greatest proportion of their time foraging [e.g. Henry et al., 2000].

Indeed, Foerster and Vaughan’s [2004] research highlights the seasonal nature of tapir habitat use, indicating the complexity of wild tapir activity budgets.

The large size, shy character, and potential for aggressive behavior in this species may cause zoos to be reluctant to attempt MSE. However, as zoo exhibit design becomes more adventurous and sophisticated, the potential for MSE with difficult species is increased. Added interest in the enclosure, with species from a similar geographic area to the Malayan tapir or inclusion of active or visually attractive animals (as per those included in zoo 9), helps draw in the public and tell a specific conservation and/ or educational message [e.g. Hosey et al., 2009]. Interspecific interaction can be used to diversify the behaviors of Malayan tapir in captivity (see zoo 1 in Table 8) and provides another form of enrichment to stimulate and interest captive individuals. It may be that such an exhibit is not feasible in many current collections, due to space and budget demands, and also the potentially volatile nature of the species [e.g. see Janssen, 2003] causing zoo personnel to be wary of multispecies incorporation. What is encouraging is that many of the tapirs in this sample population are housed in enclosures that allow access to a conspecific but t</context>

Although generally thought of as a nocturnal solitary species [Williams and Petrides, 1980], recent evidence suggests that the Malayan tapir is more social than first thought [Diz, 2006]. Currently classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (due to anthropogenic pressures and disturbance of its natural habitat leading to fragmented populations), Malayan tapir is known to exist in Malaysia, Sumatra (Indonesia), Thailand, and Burma [Lynam et al., 2008]. Malayan tapir is maintained in numerous animal collections around the world generally being termed easy-to-keep [e.g. Barongi, 1999; Shoemaker et al., 2004]. As intermediate feeders, Malayan tapirs select fruits, grasses, and browse trees dependent upon season [Janssen, 2003], an important fact to consider when evaluating captive diets. Previous work on tapir nutrition © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. has noted animals being fed too many domestic fruits and vegetables in place of good quality forage, such as lucerne (alfalfa) hay [Clauss et al., 2008, 2009]. The focus of this research is to e</context>

Wild Malayan tapirs occupy large home ranges, from 12 km2 [Eisenberg, 1997] to over 25 km2 [Traeholt, 2004] and as such, captive enclosures need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational stimulation for the inhabitants. Indeed, Foerster and Vaughan’s [2004] research highlights the seasonal nature of tapir habitat use, indicating the complexity of wild tapir activity budgets. The research presented here is of prime importance as the current census from the IUCN Red List 2011.1 shows that Malayan tapir numbers are decreasing in the wild [Lynam et al., 2008]. As such, the ex situ conservation of this species will require support from specific management guidelines and accurate knowledge on the species’ individual captive requirements. The slow reproductive rate of Malayan tapirs plus their low wild population density [Eisenberg, 1997] makes the establishment and future continuation of a sustainable captive population an essential conservation strategy. Questionnaire Design The questionnaire consisted of four sections, (1) demographics of the population housed, enclosure design, and any mixed species arrangements; (2) types of enrichment used (on</context>

Current research states that tapirs are generally inactive, due to inappropriate diets causing obesity and altered time budgets [Clauss et al., 2009]; similarly, Green et al. [2007] show that presentation of feed to captive tapirs can affect total activity budgets and behavioral repertoire diversity. Wild tapirs expend the majority of their energy consuming vegetation [Oliveiro-Santos et al., 2010], and calculated times spent foraging range from 8.5 [Novarino, 2005] to 15 hr/ day [Holden et al., 2003], depending on habitat type. Therefore, to promote “great welfare” [as per Melfi, 2009], increased opportunities for foraging could be offered. Indeed, Seitz [1998] and Barongi [2000] state that activity of captive tapirs is predominantly influenced by dietary provision and the presence of conspecifics, highlighting links between husbandry and social enrichment. Encouraging keepers to use low-energy feed items would be highly beneficial as the positive relationship between resting and limited forage opportunity would be reversed.

Rose et al. [2006] note a similar activity budget in a lone female Malayan tapir when provided with a range of enrichments across different periods of the day. When comparing the findings of Rose et al. with Mahler’s [1984] research into captive Brazilian tapir time budgets, similarities do appear; thus, suggesting that well thoughtout, evidence-based enrichment [e.g. Rose and Roffe, 2008, 2010] is the optimum way of providing beneficial enrichment to captive ungulates, including tapirs. Kinahan [2001] states that the overall fundamental difference between captive and wild tapir activity budgets concerns time spent actively moving around, or investigating or being able to forage in, the animal’s immediate environment. It would appear that certain facets of tapir management impair the species’ ability to perform a “wild-type” time budget. It is important to remember that the zoo environment, when compared to a natural habitat, is often controlled and predictable [Kinahan, 2001;</context>

Dietary change not only would benefit welfare but also the public’s image of the tapir in the zoo. Seitz [2002] states that the zoo-going public do not find tapirs particularly interesting animals to observe. Similarly, anecdotal evidence collected by the authors of this paper show that the public are generally not very interested in ungulates as a group and find tapirs “boring” due to their inactivity. An objective of an earlier study [Rose et al., 2006] involving Malayan tapir at Twycross Zoo was designed to “make” tapirs more interesting to the public by encouraging the animal to be more active via the use of enrichment. Steiz [1998] supports the idea that tapir can be “made” more interesting to zoo visitors via alterations to exhibit layout and planned use of enrichment, thus directly impacting the conservation/education value of the exhibit. Only one zoo surveyed attempted an MSE and while the authors know of several collections that mix Brazilian tapir with other species, research suggests that MSE with Malayan tapir to be limited.

There are key appetitive behavior patterns that fundamentally link to good welfare [e.g. Swaisgood, 2007]; infringement on these behaviors will deprive individuals of the opportunity to best cope with their situation and can lead to stress. The effects of stress on captive tapirs, due to inappropriate housing, husbandry and management are well documented [Janssen, 2003] and hence, stressors should be minimized or removed where possible. The tapir is evidently a difficult animal to exhibit with regard to nutritiona</context>

Specifically focusing on enrichment, research into Brazilian tapir (Tapir terrestris) enrichment protocols [e.g. Sharpe, 1997; Thompson and Rose, 2008; Zenzinger, 2003] appear common, potentially due to the relative popularity of this species in zoological collections when compared to its Asian relative. Limited scientific assessment of Malayan tapir enrichment practice makes such an evaluative undertaking both informative and useful. Rose et al. [2006] reviewed enrichment practice at the East Midland Zoological Society, Twycross Zoo in an attempt to qualify specific regime</context>

This setup appeared to work well to provide stimulation and chances for social interaction that allow for development of a “full” behavioral repertoire. White et al. [2003] analyzed the effect of rotational exhibition of a range of species, including Malayan tapirs; results showed an increase in important natural behaviors in the tapir, with the conclusion that without the presence of variation in the exhibit, there may not be the chance for some important behaviors to be performed. Tapirs have been the subject of enrichment studies [e.g. Rose et al., 2006; Sharpe, 1997; Taylor, 2000; Zenziger, 2003] but there is still a relative dearth of available information concerning enrichment methods used for ungulates (when compared to primates or carnivores for example); hence, research into tapir-specific management helps to fill Zoo Biology 354 Rose and Roffe a gap in knowledge. Indeed, Swaisgood and Shepherdson’s [2005] paper on the future “journey” of enrichment studies highlights only one article available on tapir enrichment for the purposes of their research. As a group, ungulates can seem difficult to enrich, but there are guidelines available to act as a starting point [</context>

Behavioral observations on the same animal noted that enrichment had a significant effect on foraging and locomotory behaviors in this individual [Rose et al., 2008]. Work performed by Zenzinger [2003] has shown that browse is the enrichment artifact most used by tapirs, and the one that alters behavior patterns to the greatest extent; a fact that is to be expected as being browsing ungulates, tapirs spend the greatest proportion of their time foraging [e.g. Henry et al., 2000]. Wild Malayan tapirs occupy large home ranges, from 12 km2 [Eisenberg, 1997] to over 25 km2 [Traeholt, 2004] and as such, captive enclosures need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational stimulation for the inhabitants. Indeed, Foerster and Vaughan’s [2004] research highlights the seasonal nature of tapir habitat use, indicating the complexity of wild tapir activity budgets. The research presented here is of prime importance as the current census from the IUCN Red List 2011.1 shows that Malayan tapir numbers are decreasing in the wild [Lynam et al., 2008]. As such, the ex situ conservation of this species will require support from specific management guidelines and accurate knowledge on</context>

It appears that the zoos surveyed meet Hall’s [2007] guidelines for tapirs held socially whereby animals need to be separated during calving and calf rearing, potentially due to the chance of dangerous and unpredictable behavior being performed. Wild Malayan tapirs occupy large home ranges, from 12 km2 [Eisenberg, 1997] to over 25 km2 [Traeholt, 2004] and as such, captive enclosures need to be diverse in furnishing and provide occupational stimulation for the inhabitants. The results show that collections provided some form of enrichment for their tapirs to increase enclosure utilization and activity in their animals. Current research states that tapirs are generally inactive, due to inappropriate diets causing obesity and altered time budgets [Clauss et al., 2009]; similarly, Green et al. [2007] show that presentation of feed to captive tapirs can affect total activity budgets and behavioral repertoire diversity. Wild tapirs expend the m</context>
