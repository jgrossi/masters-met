<bodyText confidence="0.999057625">
Duncan (1937) provided detailed information that has been widely used to date names of new taxa described in
early volumes of the Proceedings. The examinations reported here suggest that at least at the point where the year
of publication is important Duncan was usually correct, and although exceptions are reported they are not of great
consequence (although 14 of 42 volumes are anomalous). These exceptions relate to cases where the published
pages differed from a multiple of the signature size by a couple of pages or so. Over the 41 volumes examined,
two or more techniques were used to provide, economically, text needed to complete an article that would have
over-run the number of signatures planned for the issue. The importance of retaining wrappers and binding them
in is demonstrated by what can be learned from them.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998885661538461">
Nomenclature is a cornerstone of communication in
zoology. Today, the way in which names are used
is governed by the International Code of Zoological
Nomenclature (ICZN, 1999). In essence the Code
governing binomial nomenclature requires that the names
we attach to taxa must have four elements (a generic name,
a name in the ‘species-group’, one or more authors –
or describers – and the date of description). Special
importance is attached to the date due to the Principle
of Priority (Art. 23, ICZN, 1999). Only by using the
Article applicable to dating (Art. 21, ICZN, 1999) do we
determine between two names separately bestowed upon
the same taxon.
The Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London
was, for much of the 19th century, the English language
journal of choice for the description of new animals.
Dating the name then given is not quite as simple as
we might like it to be. Researchers are well aware that
the volume year of the Proceedings of the Zoological
Society of London should not be cited lightly as the date
of publication. For years it was routine practice for the
papers read at meetings late one year to be published
next spring within the volume year based for the period
when the paper was read. There were also years when
publication fell behind schedule. From the calendar years
1831 to 1858 we do not know the dates of publication; the
records show when the printers delivered printed parts to
the Society but not when these were published (Duncan,
1937). From 1859 to 1900, and on through to 1926, the
dates of publication of the parts were brought together
and explained by Duncan (1937) and his dates are now
E-mail: asiaorn@tiscali.co.uk
generally relied upon. Only the parts for 1859 and 1860
suffer from dating to a period of several months, rather to
a precise month. Duncan also set out the page limits to
the published parts, with some gaps for the 1872 and 1874
volumes, and these we also rely upon. Since then, Cowan
(1973) was able to provide some missing pagination data
for the 1872 and 1874 volumes. The work reported here
shows that Duncan’s information on the pagination of parts
is extremely accurate, but not faultless.
Recently details were set out (Dickinson, 2004) that
confirmed from the 1887 volume that the Proceedings,
at times at least, appeared in two states. One as printed
when concluding an issue, and the second as reprinted as
part of the complete signature with which a new issue was
commenced.
It has now been possible to examine the volumes and
wrappers for each year from 1859 to 1900 and further
information is here provided that should satisfy future
needs for precision in cases where two states of publication
seemed likely to have occurred at the end of the last issue
within a calendar year and the beginning of the final issue
in the same volume. Happily such cases are rare.
No attempt has been made to deal with the monthcritical cases where it may be necessary to decide on a
similar matter in the context of prior issues in a volume as
these are not date critical to the year. However, the cases
explained below, and the table naming a library where
wrappers will be found for that volume, will familiarize
readers with what to look for if they need to date monthcritical cases more definitely and thus have to examine
earlier numbers in the volumes.
The reader may assume that a volume between 1859 and
1900 that is not discussed below has a clean and obvious
break between the two issues that concern us and that is
wholly unambiguous and consistent with Duncan (1937).

SIGNATURE NUMBERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999552">
It was suggested that in the course of this work that understanding the signature numbering system might be helpful.
At this period the pages of the Proceedings were octavo,
and the standard signature was therefore 16 pages. In several cases explored below the signature numbers that were
apparent did not tally with what would be expected by dividing by 16; this anomaly has not been explored further.
The signature numbers were originally in Roman
numerals, but were changed to Arabic numerals following
a period when they appeared in both Roman and Arabic
numerals; here, to simplify, only Arabic numerals are
mentioned.
The Proceedings is one of several journals of the period
in which one finds a repetition of the signature number two
pages later with an asterisk added; this is due to printers
wishing to be sure that the correct eight pages have been
printed on the reverse side of the sheet.

FINDINGS

<bodyText confidence="0.982560421052631">
In Table 1 the years examined are listed with a simple
two-column guide to the page split between years as
given by Duncan. The location is given of a volume with
wrappers.
In the early 1860s it was apparently the practice to
print extra pages to complete a paper, probably inserting
just a page or two, and to accept that these pages would
be reprinted so that each issue began with a complete
signature, but from 1865 to 1881 problems of this type did
not occur, or at least did not occur at the break between the
calendar years. From 1882 space was made available on
wrappers to absorb text overflow and it was not necessary
to use part of an extra signature.
Table 1. Breaks between years in Proceedings of the Zoological
Society volumes, details mainly according to Duncan (1937). For
years before 1859, Duncan gave information based on the supply
of printed pages from the printer to the PZS; dates are ‘not before
dates’; exactly how and when these pages were issued to members
is not clear. SK, Natural History Museum, South Kensington; ZS,

Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be
between pages 336 and 337 and this is the first page of
signature 438 (this volume begins with signature number
417). The wrapper for issues 1 and 2 lists the closing article
as ‘On some hybrid ducks’ (p. 336). This article indeed
began on that page, but it runs to p. 338. It would seem
that pp. 337 and 338 were printed twice; in this instance
the two states may only be distinguished in cases where
the parts have been bound without excising the duplicate
page.

Duncan erred in citing a left-hand page as beginning the part; see
text for detailed corrections.
3 lists the first article as beginning on page 210. Pages 208
and 209 contain a short article that should therefore have
been in issue 2. Page 209 is the first page of signature
14 (from this volume, or perhaps from 1861, signature

the second state of this page; this text was not found on
the wrapper and it is unclear how this page was provided

Duncan (1937) suggested that the page break should be

through to the top of page 339. It is apparent that page 339,

Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be

is the first page of signature 40; on it however one finds
the description by Sharpe of a new flycatcher Muscicapa
ussheri that was introduced on page 590. The wrappers
show that the use of extra paper stock for reprinting the
minimum amount of extra print on page 591 was avoided
by the expedient of completing this text on the inside back
of the wrapper itself, using 3/4 of the page. When printing
the fourth issue page 591 thus contains 3/4 of a page of
reprinted text and 1/4 of a page starts paper 12 from the
June meeting.

Dickinson (2004) explained that pages 557 and 558 had

Bates on the Coleoptera of Mount Kinabalu and this
article only finishes on page 393. In this instance the small
amount of extra text was first printed on the inside back
of the wrapper for Part III and then reprinted on good
paper when Part IV appeared. The description of the genus

Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be

page of signature 31. The third issue of the year concludes
with a long article on the birds of Yucatan and this will be
seen to end on page 462. It seems clear that the content of
the final issue began on page 463 (which is the Secretary’s
Report on Additions to the Menagerie), as supported by
the wrapper for the final part. Pages 461 and 462 will thus
have been reprinted.
This is the first of three cases where Duncan suggested
that a new part began with an even numbered page (594).
Inside the back of the wrapper for Part III the bulk (7/8ths)
of page 593 is printed with the last eighth of the page
blank. In its final state, at the start of the fourth issue,
page 593 appears as the first page of signature 40, and a
short horizontal line splits, or ‘uses’, the last eighth of the

providing access to the Mammal Department set which
is particularly rich in bound-in wrappers. Gina Douglas
at the Linnean Society of London kindly made the 1881
volume available for inspection. Several earlier attempts
were made to locate this and the last remaining volume
and Linda Birch (Oxford) kindly made enquiries of the
Hope Librarian in the Entomology Department of Oxford
University but found wrappers to be lacking in these two
volumes as did Clair Castle at the Balfour and Newton
Library (Cambridge), June Harvey in the Entomology
Library at the NHM (South Kensington), Ronald de Ruiter
(Naturalis, Leiden) and Ante Strand (Stockholm). The
final and most elusive of the volumes to be traced was
found at the Central Science Library, Cambridge thanks
to Kees Rookmaaker; the library staff kindly made this
available. Finally special thanks are owed to Nigel Roche
at the Printing Library, St Brides, London, for guidance
regarding signatures, an understanding of which helped in
making sense of the evidence.

It has now been possible to examine the volumes and wrappers for each year from 1859 to 1900 and further information is here provided that should satisfy future needs for precision in cases where two states of publication seemed likely to have occurred at the end of the last issue within a calendar year and the beginning of the final issue in the same vol</context>

It seems, oddly, that page 591 is the first page of signature 40; on it however one finds the description by Sharpe of a new flycatcher Muscicapa ussheri that was introduced on page 590. The wrappers show that the use of extra paper stock for reprinting the minimum amount of extra print on page 591 was avoided by the expedient of completing this text on the inside back of the wrapper itself, using 3/4 of the page. When printing the fourth issue page 591 thus contains 3/4 of a page of reprinted text and 1/4 of a page starts paper 12 from the June meeting. 429 1887 Dickinson (2004) explained that pages 557 and 558 had been printed twice, the second of them being completed with the opening text of the final issue. Furthermore, the problem was compounded because the article with the description of the broadbill Calyptomena whiteheadi appeared not just on the wrapper for Part III as stated, but also on the wrapper for Part IV. 1889 Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be between pages 392 and 393; this is the first page of signature 27. Part III, however, ends with an article by Bates on the Coleoptera of Mount Kinabalu and this article only finishes on page 3</context>

Researchers are well aware that the volume year of the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London should not be cited lightly as the date of publication. For years it was routine practice for the papers read at meetings late one year to be published next spring within the volume year based for the period when the paper was read. There were also years when publication fell behind schedule. From the calendar years 1831 to 1858 we do not know the dates of publication; the records show when the printers delivered printed parts to the Society but not when these were published (Duncan, 1937). From 1859 to 1900, and on through to 1926, the dates of publication of the parts were brought together and explained by Duncan (1937) and his dates are now E-mail: asiaorn@tiscali.co.uk generally relied upon. Only the parts for 1859 and 1860 suffer from dating to a period of several months, rather to a precise month. Duncan also set out the page limits to the published parts, with some gaps for the 1872 and 1874 volumes, and these we also rely upon. Since then, Cowan (1973) was able to provide some missing pagination data for the 1872 and 1874 volumes. The work reported here shows that Dunca</context>

However, the cases explained below, and the table naming a library where wrappers will be found for that volume, will familiarize readers with what to look for if they need to date monthcritical cases more definitely and thus have to examine earlier numbers in the volumes. The reader may assume that a volume between 1859 and 1900 that is not discussed below has a clean and obvious break between the two issues that concern us and that is wholly unambiguous and consistent with Duncan (1937). 428 EDWARD C. DICKINSON It will be recalled that there were three issues a year from 1859 to 1873 and four issues a year from 1874 to 1900. SIGNATURE NUMBERS It was suggested that in the course of this work that understanding the signature numbering system might be helpful. At this period the pages of the Proceedings were octavo, and the standard signature was therefore 16 pages. In several cases explored below the signature numbers that were apparent did not tally with what would be expected by dividing by 16; this anomaly has not been explored further. The signature numbers were originally</context>

In the early 1860s it was apparently the practice to print extra pages to complete a paper, probably inserting just a page or two, and to accept that these pages would be reprinted so that each issue began with a complete signature, but from 1865 to 1881 problems of this type did not occur, or at least did not occur at the break between the calendar years. From 1882 space was made available on wrappers to absorb text overflow and it was not necessary to use part of an extra signature. Table 1. Breaks between years in Proceedings of the Zoological Society volumes, details mainly according to Duncan (1937). For years before 1859, Duncan gave information based on the supply of printed pages from the printer to the PZS; dates are ‘not before dates’; exactly how and when these pages were issued to members is not clear.

Pages 208 and 209 contain a short article that should therefore have been in issue 2. Page 209 is the first page of signature 14 (from this volume, or perhaps from 1861, signature Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 1859–1900 numbers started each time from 1) and therefore this is the second state of this page; this text was not found on the wrapper and it is unclear how this page was provided in its first state; it seems that a short signature must have been used with all pages except for page 209 blank. 1863 Duncan (1937) suggested that the page break should be between pages 336 and page 337; this is the first page of signature 22. The article that fills page 336 continues through to the top of page 339. It is apparent that page 339, and very probably 337 and 338, were printed twice. The content of the final part will have begun part way through page 339. 1864 Duncan (1937) again suggested that the page break should be between pages 336 and page 337, and page 337 is the first page of signature 22, but the last article in the previous issue finishes at the foot of page 338. Pages 337 and 338 again appear to hav</context>

Furthermore, the problem was compounded because the article with the description of the broadbill Calyptomena whiteheadi appeared not just on the wrapper for Part III as stated, but also on the wrapper for Part IV. 1889 Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be between pages 392 and 393; this is the first page of signature 27. Part III, however, ends with an article by Bates on the Coleoptera of Mount Kinabalu and this article only finishes on page 393. In this instance the small amount of extra text was first printed on the inside back of the wrapper for Part III and then reprinted on good paper when Part IV appeared. The description of the genus Eusynthela might, to one not seeing the wrapper, seem to have been half printed in 1889 and half in 1890. 1891 Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be be</context>
<context position="12915" citStr="Duncan (1937)" startWordPosition="2264" endWordPosition="2265">e the first page of signature 32. The evidence in this case shows that page 463 and the first seven lines on page 464 were reprinted and issued with Part IV. 1893 Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be between pages 598 and 599, which appears to be the first page of signature 41 (although in its original state no number appears on that page). In fact the text of Part III ran on to page 599. The bound copy in the Mammal Department at The Natural History Museum, South Kensington has these two parts bound in, as does one of two copies at The Natural History Museum, Tring. 1883 1894 Duncan (1937) reported that the page break should be between pages 460 and 461, which purports to be the first page of signature 31. The third issue of the year concludes with a long article on the birds of Yucatan and this will be seen to end on page 462. It seems clear that the content of the final issue began on page 463 (which is the Secretary’s Report on Additions to the Menagerie), as supported by the wrapper for the final part. Pages 461 and 462 will thus have been reprinted. This is the first of three cases where Duncan suggested that a new part began with an even numbered page (594). Inside the ba</context>

Over the 41 volumes examined, two or more techniques were used to provide, economically, text needed to complete an article that would have over-run the number of signatures planned for the issue. The importance of retaining wrappers and binding them in is demonstrated by what can be learned from them. INTRODUCTION Nomenclature is a cornerstone of communication in zoology. Today, the way in which names are used is governed by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN, 1999). In essence the Code governing binomial nomenclature requires that the names we attach to taxa must have four elements (a generic name, a name in the ‘species-group’, one or more authors – or describers – and the date of description). Special importance is attached to the date due to the Principle of Priority (Art. 23, ICZN, 1999). Only by using the Article applicable to dating (Art. 21, ICZN, 1999) do we determine between two names separately bestowed upon the same taxon.
