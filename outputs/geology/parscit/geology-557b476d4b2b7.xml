Abstract: The supracrustals that constitute the Goa Group of Gokul et al. (1985) can be divided into two lithostratigraphic
sequences namely the Barcem Group and the Ponda Group. The former comprises predominantly greenstones (metabasalts)
and rests on a basement of the 3300-3400 Ma Anmode Ghat trodhjemite gneiss with a crudely developed quartz-pebble
conglomerate at the base, and shows lithological similarities with the lower part of the Bababudan Group. The younger
sequence is dominated by clastics, and is assigned to a new stratigraphic group formally termed the Ponda Group which
is equivalent to the Chitradurga Group of the Dharwar Supergroup. This group rests on a basement of the 2700-2900 Ma
Chandranath granite gneiss with a distinct unconformity marked by a polymict, granite-clast metaconglomerate. The
conglomerate displays many similarities with the Talya conglomerate that occurs at the base of the Chitradurga Group.
It is overlain by a psamolitic sequence which is followed in ascending order by the chemogenic sediments that host the
BIF and by the deep water turbidite sequence (argillite-graywacke association) with intercalations of mafic volcanics.
The supracrustal sequence is intruded by the Bondla layered mafic-ultramafic complex along a major shear zone
(NW-SE) that largely controls the course of the northwesterly flowing tributary of River Mandovi. The late intrusive,
Canacona potassic granite marks the culmination of the sedimentation in the Shimoga-Goa basin.

INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.9612843125">
The southern portion of the Indian shield particularly
the granite-greenstone terrain of the Dharwar craton is a
complex amalgamation of the Western and the Eastern
Dharwar cratons (WDC, EDC) respectively. The intricate
relationship between the gneisses and supracrustals from
parts of the Dharwar craton continues to be debated (e.g.
Swami Nath and Ramakrishnan, 1981; Naqvi and Rogers,
1987; Ramakrishnan, 1994; Radhakrishna and Vaidyanadhan,
1997; Ramakrishnan and Vaidyanadhan, 2008). The same
is true for the gneissic rocks that belong to various episodes
that have been broadly included under the Peninsular
Gneissic Complex. A systematic study of the gneissic
complex and its relationship with the greenstones from
critical areas can yield significant information on the
Precambrian crustal evolution and the palaeo-tectonics of
this region.
Goa is situated in the northwestern part of the WDC
where the Shimoga-Goa supracrustal belt extends
contiguously until it is concealed beneath the Arabian Sea
and the Deccan Traps in the north. The belt possibly
continues beneath the Traps up to the Narmada, where the
Narmada-Son lineament terminates this supracrustal belt.
The Shimoga-Goa belt extends NNW-SSE over a length
of approximately 250 km and has a maximum width of about
120 km at Dharwar. The western margin of the belt is marked
by large domal masses of gneissose rocks such as the
Chandranath granite gneiss and the Canacona granite. The
eastern margin is faulted, whereas the southern section
appears to have been deposited in shallow waters. The latter
is associated with subaerial mafic volcanic rocks at
Kumbharwada, and north of Karwar and Ankola. The
thickest accumulation of mafic volcanics of this schist belt
is, however, centred at Bababudan and Kudremukh which
forms the southern extensions of this belt (Harinadha Babu
et al. 1981a). A thick sequence of greywackes occupy the
northern section of the basin. The southern section in general,
is characterized by orthoquartzite/basic lava association that
denotes subaerial environments and intermittent volcanic
activity in a coastal sand environment under stable
conditions. The limestone-iron-manganese ore sequence of
Goa and north Kanara (Castlerock band) in the northern
part (Maclaran, 1904) of the Shimoga belt is in physical
continuity with that in the southern part and serves as the
marker horizon to show the continuity of the rocks over the
entire length of the belt.
The granitic-gneisses from Goa were assigned either a
syntectonic or post-tectonic status (Harinadha Babu et al.

1981a; Gokul et al. 1985) in relation to the deformational
episodes exhibited by the supracrustals. However, there is
a considerable lack of clarity as regards the interrelationship
among the granitic gneisses on the one hand and between
the gneisses and the supracrustal greenstones on the other.
The supracrustal sequences in particular, consist of
metavolcanics and clastics each with peculiarities of its
own, yet both have been included under one stratigraphic
group namely the Goa Group (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985).

The lithounits from Goa were geologically examined by
Fermor (1909) and later by Dunn (1942). A formal
stratigraphic classification was, however, provided by Oertal
(1958) who divided the rocks into two groups: (i) the lower
infraconglomerate group and (ii) the upper metalliferous
group. The granitic rocks occurring at Quepem, Canacona
and Dudhsagar were considered by him to be intrusive into
the schistose rocks. The Goa region in general, is largely
occupied by schistose rocks (Pascoe, 1950; Dhepe, 1954)
but for the northeastern corner of the State where Deccan
Traps (late Cretaceous to Eocene) overlie the Dharwar
metasediments.
Recent geological mapping (GSI, 1996) has shown that
the basal sequences are made of metavolcanics with
intercalations of metasediments overlain by a larger
proportion of clastics, dominated by greywackes. In these
respects, they are similar to the Dharwar-type greenstones
of Radhakrishna and Vaidyanadhan (1997). Gokul et al.
(1985) proposed a modern scheme of stratigraphic
classification and grouped the lithounits of Goa into four
formations. The stratigraphic succession proposed by Gokul
et al. (1985) is presented in Table 1 along with the proposed
revision. In their scheme of classification all the granitic
gneisses and the granites from Goa were considered coeval
and intrusive into the metasediments (e.g. Harinadha Babu
et al. 1981b; Gokul et al. 1985). The basement for the
supracrustal sequence was not clearly identified. The Goa
Group typically has a greenstone dominated sequence at
the base which is overlain by a metaconglomerate over which
rests a dominantly clastic sequence. The metaconglomerate
(tilloid) was assigned the status of a para-conglomerate. The
granitic gneisses in Goa are exposed at four different
localities and are referred to as (i) Chandranath granite
gneiss, (ii) Tamdi felspathic gneiss, (iii) Dudhsagar granite,
and (iv) Canacona granite. They are all considered as
intrusives into the supracrustals (greenstones) by Gokul et
al. (1985). The Chandranath granite gneiss was considered
to be syntectonic with the first phase of folding, the Tamdi
felspathic gneiss and the Dudhsagar granite were considered
to be synkinematic with the second phase, whereas the
Canacona granite was considered to be post-tectonic (Gokul
et al. 1985). In the light of the recent work (Dhoundial et al.
1987; Devaraju et al. 2007, 2010; Dessai et al. 2009)
especially on the granitic gneisses, greenstones and the
intrusive granites from representative sections, it is proposed
to revisit the classification of the greenstones from this area.
The Goa Group of Gokul et al. (1985) needs to be integrated
(see also Devaraju et al. 2010) with the contiguous Dharwar
Supergroup of WDC, as otherwise it would give an erroneous
impression of forming a separate stratigraphic entity within
the Dharwar craton. The Goa Group (e.g Gokul et al. 1985)
denotes a local classification confined to Goa and is here
devided into two groups namely the Barcem Group and the
Ponda Group which correspond respectively to the
Bababudan and Chitradurga Groups of the Dharwar
Supergroup in the unified regional classification. The
proposed stratigraphic scheme is listed in Table 1.

Anmode Ghat Trondhjemite Gneiss: The gneiss is
exposed at Anmode (Tamdi felspathic gneiss of Gokul et al.
1985) along the Panaji-Belgaum National Highway (NH
4A) and is amongst the oldest gneisses from India that has
yielded an Rb/Sr whole-rock age of 3400±140 Ma
(Dhoundial et al. 1987). Recent Sm-Nd and U-Pb work has
provided ages of about 3300 Ma (Devaraju et al. 2007).
Temporally the gneiss is nearly equivalent to the Gorur
Gneiss from Hassan district of Karnataka [34 point Rb/Sr
isochron age of 3315±54 Ma (Beckinsale et al. 1980); with
very low 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.7006] that has yielded an equally
older age. These grey gneisses, that are older than 3,000
Ma, are included along with the younger ones (~ 2600 Ma)
under the Peninsular Gneissic Complex. It consists of a
complex assemblage of migmatites, gneisses and granitoids
and forms a back-drop for the schist belts scattered within
the gneisses. Most workers agree to its polyphase and
polymigmatitic nature, which has been supported in recent
years by isotope studies and radiometric dating. The Anmode
Ghat gneiss is fine grained, granulated and has a
metamorphic fabric. The foliation trends N-S and dips
60-70o west. Petrographically it varies in composition from
trondhjemite, tonalite to granodiorite (TTG). It is essentially
an orthogneiss as shown by low initial strontium ratios
(87Sr/86Sr) of 0.7016±0.0005, low potassium (K2O: &amp;lt;1 wt%;
Na2O/K2O: 2.63) content, negative εNd : -7 (Devaraju et al.

lineation within the plane of foliation. Two generation of
felspars are seen. Quartzofelspathic augens are seen along
the planes of foliation, some of which show replacement by
the late K-feldspar (microcline) which is indicative of the
activity of metasomatic fluids from the intrusive granites.
The gneiss is compositionally similar to the Anmode gneiss
and in particular also contains low abundance of K2O [(&amp;lt;12 wt%), author’s unpublished data] like the latter, however,
its correlation with the Anmode gneiss could be confirmed
from isotope systematics. The TTG suite is flanked by
greenstones of the Barcem Formation both to the north and
south. The gneisses are intruded by late granites (Canacona
Granite) described later. The pods and lenses of hornblende
are replaced by biotite indicating retrogression. The gneisses
display a foliation that trends WNW-ESE and dips by 70o
NNE.
A crudely developed quartz-pebble conglomerate
horizon is exposed at Nagargali in Karnataka. It rests on the
trondhjemite gneisses and is overlain by metavolcanics and
metasediments of the Barcem Formation of Gokul et al.
(1985). At places the gneiss occurs as metre long inliers
within the supracrustal assemblage and forms the basement
for the latter. The conglomerate is possibly the equivalent
of the Walkunje and the Kalaspura conglomerates at the base
of the Bababudan Group in the Dharwar craton. Dhoundial
et al. (1987) described it as a meta-arkosic conglomerate.
Chandranath Granite Gneiss: It is exposed at Paroda,
Quepem (Gokul and Srinivasan, 1976) and extends in
general E-W from Sanguem in the east to Colva-Banaulim
in the west over a length of more than 22 km and is over 11
km wide. It is well foliated, the foliation trends NE-SW and
dips by 50o east. Gokul et al. (1985) and Dhoundial et al.
(1987) considered it to be intrusive, synkinematically with
the first phase of folding of the metasediments. However,
distinct intrusive relationship between the gneiss and the
metasediments is no where available for observation (also
Ramakrishnan, per.comm.).
It is a grey granitic gneiss that varies in composition
from granodiorite to quartz-diorite. The Rb/Sr age obtained
for it is 2650±100 Ma (Dhoundial et al. 1987). Recent SmNd isotope studies provide model ages of about 2900 Ma
(Devaraju et al. 2007) indicating that the protoliths are either
younger than the trondhjemites or are less enriched in light
rare earth elements. A similar gneiss exposed along the
eastern border of the State and referred to as the Londa
migmatitic gneiss is considered to be contemporaneous
with the Chandranath granite gneiss. The recent age data
(e.g. Devaraju et al. 2010) suggest that these gneisses are
distinctly younger that the basement trondhjemite gneisses
from the Dharwar craton. They form the basement for the
Sanvordem Formation of the Ponda Group. The relationship
between the gneiss and the supracrustal assemblage is best
exposed to the east of Sanvordem railway station where the
metaconglomerate with granite-clast unconformably rests
on the gneiss and contains stretched pebbles of granitic
gneiss along with those of vein-quartz in a chlorite-rich
matrix. Devaraju et al. (2007) also describe the conglomerate
as resting on the basement of Chandranath granite gneiss.
Layered Intrusion: The emplacement of the Chandranath
granite gneiss was followed by the intrusion of gabbroic
rocks (e.g. Jena, 1980, 1985) which were later identified to
form a layered peridotites-gabbro complex (e.g.
Balakrishnan et al. 1992; Dessai et al. 2009). Dessai and
Peshwa (1982) have shown that the complex is intruded
along a major shear zone that runs NW-SE. It consists of a
series of at least four plutons that provide evidence for the
north-south continuity of the complex. The outcrops occur
at Pernem, Valpoy, Bondla, and Canacona. The well exposed
ones are those at Bondla and Canacona, both of which show
ultramafic rocks at the base followed by mafic gabbros,
leucogabbros and rarely by granophyric rocks at the top.
The ultramafic zone consists of cumulates of chromitite
layers alternating with those of olivine (Dessai et al. 1995).
The mafic zone shows uniform layering (Dessai et al. 2009).
These layered intrusives were placed stratigraphically higher
than the ‘intrusive’ Chandranath granitic gneisses (Gokul et
al. 1985). However, according to Devaraju et al. (2010) the
complex is enclosed within the supracrustal rocks and as
such was emplaced during the early stages of the basin
formation and prior to the deposition of the supracrustals.
Canacona Granite: It is exposed at Char Rasta-Chauri,
Palolem and Agonda, in Canacona taluka (Srinivasan and
Gopalakrishnan, 1985). Harinadha Babu et al. (1981b) and
Gokul et al. (1985) have included this granite as equivalent
to the Chandranath granite gneiss. As per the latest geological
and mineral map of Goa (GSI, 1996), the granite is depicted
as intrusive into the TTG gneisses. It has been dated at
2395±390 Ma (e.g. Dhoundial et al. 1987), however, due to
the large error factor, the age data are rather suspect. The
granite is distinctly late, unfoliated, and exhibits a discordant
relationship with the WNW-ESE foliation of the older TTG
gneiss/migmatite (Fig. 1). It is potassic in comparison with
the host gneiss/migmatite which is strongly foliated, and
relatively sodic. Exposures at Palolem and Agonda occur
as bosses and plutons. The contacts are sheared, patches
and shreds of older gneiss can be traced on either sides of
the younger intrusive phase. The granite is coarse to very

coarse grained compared to the gneiss, grey to pinkish grey
in colour and contains relict phases from the host TTG
gneiss. The gneiss in the vicinity of the granite, contains
K-felspar megacrysts that have grown along and across the
foliation. The megacrysts are bent and fractured providing
evidence of plastic and brittle deformation. The granite can
be traced up to Palolem sea shore in the west and continues
north up to Agonda. In the south it occurs discontinuously
up to Polem and even beyond to Sadashivgarh and Karwar
in Karnataka. Enclaves and rafts of metasediments are
invariably intruded by aplite-pegmatite veins.
The rock is often porphyritic with megacrysts and
phenocrysts of microcline, perthitic feldspar and plagioclase
in a groundmass dominated by quartz, biotite and
hornblende. Felspar megacrysts surround and include
plagioclase and biotite of older generation. New K-felspar
(microcline) has grown and it is interconnected with similar
phases probably indicating melt injection. The rock is high
in K (2.91-3.7 wt% K2O; Na2O/K2O: 0.57), Rb (103-162
ppm) and moderate Sr (118-250 ppm) (author’s unpublished
data). According to Gokul et al. (1985) it is synkinematic
with the second phase of folding. Dhoundial et al. (1987)
have dated this granite at 2395±390 Ma, but the dates cannot
be considered definitive. However, considering its late
intrusive nature and distinct compositional identity, it is
suggested that it may be a late phase of the Closepet granite
(~2500 Ma).

are exposed around Dudhsagar railway station. The rock
consists of quartz, plagioclase, K-felspar and hornblende.
It is a high-K rock that varies in composition from adamellite,
granodiorite to quartz-monzonite (Devaraju et al. 2007). The
contact zone of the granite with the quartz-chlorite-schists
is migmatised. It is considered to be synkinematically
intrusive (Gokul et al. 1985) into the metavolcanics and
metasediments. However, Dhoundial et al. (1987) consider
it to be a late to post-tectonic intrusion. The granitic rocks
are intruded by quartzofelspathic pegmatites and by quartz
veins that in general trend NW-SE and WNW-ENE. In the
light of Sm-Nd isotope systematics, Devaraju et al. (2007)
suggest that the granite is as old as the Chandranath granitic
gneiss.
The LIL-enriched character coupled with field relations
and textural characteristics suggest an anatectic origin for
the granite; the melt having derived either at the expense of
the host gneiss itself or from a mixture of greywacke-argillite
(e.g. Dhoundial et al. 1987). Devaraju et al. (2007), however,
consider it to be a part of the basement. The WNW-ESE
gneiss-granite belt is flanked by the greenstones of the
Barcem Formation which rests on a basement of the
trondhjemitic gneiss (Dhoundial et al. 1987). A poorly
developed (patchy) conglomerate is seen exposed at the base
of the metavolcanics. Intrusive relationship of the gneiss
with the metavolcanics of the Barcem Formation is
conspicuously absent.

PROPOSED REVISION OF THE GOA GROUP
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993897">
In the light of the aforesaid, a revision of the classification
of the Goa Group (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985) is warranted. The
lithological characteristics of the supracrustal rocks permit
the subdivision of the Goa Group (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985)
into two sequences of greenstones (Fig.2). The lower
sequence that rests on the TTG gneisses with a quartz-pebble
conglomerate is largely dominated by mafic volcanics with
intercalated clastics. It was designated as the Barcem
Formation of the Goa Group by Gokul et al. (1985). This
sequence is elevated to the status of a ‘Group’ which is
formally named as the Barcem Group. The ‘Group’ as per
the provisions of international stratigraphic guide (Hedberg,
1976, p.34) should consist of more than one Formation.
However, considering the lithological and the facies
variation within the Barcem Formation, it is felt that detailed
mapping may eventually lead to its division into more than
one Formation. It bears many similarities with the lower
part of the Kalaspura Formation of the Bababudan Group.

Saleri-Vagon road in Canacona taluka. At places phyllitic
intercalations are noticed. These probably represent the
metamorphosed tuffs. Well preserved pillow lavas are
described from Gokuldem-Maina section (Gokul et al.
1985). The basalts at the base of the Mormugao headland
are schistose and at places vesicular. Those from Bogmalo
are vesicular, amygdaloidal and are dominated by pyroxene
and at places contain olivine (Devaraju et al. 2010). The
basalts in general, consist of saussuritised plagioclase and
uralitised pyroxene forming actinolite, chlorite, epidote,
clinozoisite along with opaques.
Metavolcanics that could be silicic lavas or pyroclasts
are exposed at Barcem. They are represented by quartzsericite-schists and quartz porphyry. At places they are
crushed and contain porphyroclasts of quartz in a pulvurised
quartz-sericite matrix.

Ponda Group
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992467545454545">
The Ponda Group is best developed around Ponda town
where most of the lithologies are well exposed. It comprises
three formations which in ascending order are the Sanvordem
Formation, Bicholim Formation and the Vagheri Formation,
all of which are dominated by clastics with very subordinate
mafics only in the Vagheri Formation. Around Ponda, the
total thickness of this group is about 8.8 km (Ram Das and
Ramprasad Rao, 2001).
Sanvordem Formation: The Sanvordem Formation rests
on the Chandranath granite gneiss with a polymict
metaconglomerate at the base and comprises
metagreywacke, and argillites. The conglomerate consists
of stretched and elongated pebbles of quartzite and gneiss
in a schistose chlorite matrix. The proportion of lithologies
varies considerably from place to place, so much so that
one single lithology may be present to the complete exclusion
of the other members. The best section of this formation is
exposed along the railway tract between Sanvordem railway
station and Periudoc. In this section it has a thickness of
over 1.2 km. To the east of Kalay railway station the lithounit
is a metagreywacke which containds intercalations of

metaconglomerate. It is also well exposed between Bati and
Keri south of river Tiracol. Exposures occur at Ribandar in
the vicinity of Panaji where it consists of metagreywacke
with subordinate metaconglomerate. The exposures across
River Mandovi between Aguada and Baga are dominated
by thinly bedded (laminated) argillites. The metaconglomerate consists of stretched lenticular pebbles and
boulders of quartzite and granite gneiss (particularly at
Sanvordem) that vary in size from 10 x15 x 25 cm along the
longer dimension and are enclosed in a schistose matrix
dominated by chlorite.
The metagreywackes are faintly schistose and show
graded bedding. The rock consists of sub-angular quartz,
plagioclase and lithic fragments in a matrix of sericite,
chlorite and quartz. The argillites are light to deep grey and
consist of quartz in a sericite-chlorite matrix with opaques.
Rarely biotite has formed at the expense of chlorite. A
detailed account of the petrography of the conglomerates is
available in Devaraju et al. (2010).
Bicholim Formation: This Formation can be traced over
the entire length of Goa (~ 185 km) in a NW-SE direction
from Naibag in the northwest to Salgini in the southeast.
The average true thickness of the Formation is about 1.4
km (Gokul et al. 1985). It consists of amphibole schists,
ferruginous and manganiferous phyllites, limestones and
banded ferruginous quartzites (BHQ) that occur as
intercalations within the phyllites. The BHQs serve as the
protores for the iron ore deposits that are extensively
developed in this formation. The BHQs are thinly laminated
and consist of alternate laminae of hematite/magnetite and
chert. Magnetite is invariably martitised. The banded iron
formation (BIF) consists of two subfacies- the haematite
sub-facies and the magnetite sub-facies, both of which show
interdigitated relationship. The hematite sub-facies
predominates in the northwestern and central part (from
Advalpal to Dharbadora) of the State whereas the magnetite
sub-facies is largely confined to the central and the
southeastern part (Costi to Barazana-Villiena). Calcareous
(carbonate facies of BIF) and carbonaceous (sulphide
facies) intercalations are common. Manganese being an
inseparable associate of iron in almost all BIF the world
over, both these exhibit a zonal distribution pattern. Broadly
the iron-rich protores are confined to the northern part of
the formation, northwest of Sanguem, whereas the
manganese-rich protores are confined to the southern part
of the State, largely to the south of Sanguem between Rivona
and Salgini.
The dominant lithology is represented by quartz-chloritetremolite schists followed by ferruginous phyllites which is

a ubiquitous lithology of this formation. The rock consists
of tremolite and chlorite with quartz and opaques as
accessories.
Limestone exposures are rare and occur to the northeast
of Goa. Calcareous intercalations also occur in association
with the phyllites and are encountered in bore holes below
the manganiferous phyllites. They are also intercalated by
cherts. The rock consists of calcite and dolomite with some
tremolite.
Vagheri Formation: The topmost formation of this
Group is represented by Vagheri Formation which
conformably overlies the Bicholim Formation. It is best
exposed to the northeast of Valpoy. It comprises
metagreywacke-argillite with intercalated metabasalts. The
metagreywackes are grey to greyish green, compact and
exhibit poorly developed schistosity. The rock consists of
angular to sub-angular crystic- and lithic-fragments in a fine
grained mesostasis made up of quartz, feldspar and chlorite.
The rocks are immature with poorly sorted angular and subangular clasts of andesitic tuffs (Devaraju et al. 2010).
The metabasalts occur as narrow, lenticular intercalations
within the metagreywacke and exhibit a poorly developed
foliation at places. The rock is grey to greenish grey, hard,
compact and has faint schistosity. It consists of chlorite,
tremolite/actinolite, plagioclase, epidote, zoisite, opaques
and quartz which may be secondary. The revised
classification is presented in Table 1 and the justification is
outlined in the following section.

<bodyText confidence="0.997582152542373">
Rationale for the Identification of the Barcem Group
Although the Goa Group of Gokul et al. (1985) is
considered younger, similar to the Chitradurga Group (e.g.
Gokul et al. 1985), it lacks the polymictic granite-clast
conglomerate at the base, as seen for example in the
Chitradurga and Shimoga schist belts, where the Talya and
Kaldurga conglomerates respectively, mark the base of the
depositional sequence. A conglomerate, similar to the Talya
conglomerate does occur within the Goa Group, however,
it is not basal for the latter Group, but occurs above the
Barcem Group, and at the base of the overlying Sanvordem
Formation.
Recent work has shown, that the basal part of the
greenstones (e.g. Gokul et al., 1985), namely the newly
established Barcem Group is characterized by a quartzpebble conglomerate overlain by mafic rocks (with clastic
intercalations), some of which show pillow structures
whereas others are vesicular (also see Devaraju et al. 2010).
The presence of a quartz-pebble conglomerate and
greenstones dominated by mafics, show their similarity to
the basal lithologies of the Bababudan Group. The Group
also rests on a basement of trondhjemite gneiss. The newly
identified Group, however, differs from the Bababudan in
not having a well developed BIF horizon above the mafic
rocks, that in fact is a hallmark of the Bababudan sequence
in the type area. As these two groups are not exactly identical,
the Barcem Group could be viewed as a ‘truncated’ sequence
of the Bababudan-type sedimentation.
The overlying three Formations of the newly formed
Ponda Group are, however, lithologically similar to those
of the Chitradurga Group. The existence of a gneissic
basement for the sedimentary sequence, larger proportion
of clastic sediments than the volcanics and the presence of
a limestone-iron-manganese marker horizon show their
likeness to the Chitradurga Group sediments with which they
are correlated (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985).
The clastics of the Sanvordem Formation rest on the
granite-clast conglomerate which consists of pebbles of
quartzite and gneiss (some of the pebbles may have been
derived from aplites and pegmatites) in a schistose chloriterich matrix. This unit could be treated to be equivalent to
the Talya and Kaldurga conglomerates from the Chitradurga
and Shimoga schist belts. The overlying Bicholim Formation
is dominated by chemogenic sediments that contain the
BIF and is equivalent to the Vanivilas Sub-group of the
Chitradurga Group. The Vagheri Formation overlies the
Bicholim and consists of argillites and metagreywacke
with volcanic intercalations. This formation broadly
corresponds to the Ranibennur Sub-group of the Chitradurga
Group.
Thus the mafic volcanism in the case of Chitradurga
Group and the Ponda Group occurred towards the terminal
phase of sedimentation whereas in the case of the Bababudan
and also the Barcem Group the dominant volcanism
preceded the deposition of the clastics and chemogenic
sediments (e.g. Swami Nath and Ramakrishnan, 1981; Naqvi
and Rogers, 1987; Ramakrishnan, 1994; Radhakrishna and
Vaidyanadhan, 1997; Ramakrishnan and Vaidyanadhan,
2008). Thus the correlation of the newly identified Barcem
Group with the Bababudan and that of the Ponda Group
with the Chitradurga Group is justified.

Palaeoenvironmental Considerations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994564514285714">
The mafic volcanics at the base of the Barcem Goup
indicate volcanic activity both under subaerial and
subaqueous conditions in a nascent basin. Possibly
recognizing this fact, Oertal (1958) included the lower
sequence of mafic rocks under the ‘lower infraconglomerate
JOUR.GEOL.SOC.INDIA, VOL.78, SEPT. 2011
THE GEOLOGY OF GOA GROUP: REVISITED
group’. The basinal conditions at the time of deposition of
the Ponda Group were different than these. The
metaconglomerate indicates shallow water deposition,
proximal to the basinal uplift whereas the volcaniclastics
represent distal deposits. The BIF of the Bicholim Formation
is suggestive of chemogenic precipitation under quieter
conditions in relatively deeper parts in closed environments.
Lateral variations with the haematite sub-facies in the north
progressively grading into the magnetite sub-facies in the
central and south Goa represents platformal-type of
deposition. Minor limestones and silica suggest presence
of algal activity. A change from shelf facies to deeper water
facies is indicated by the presence of the manganesecarbonate marker horizon and by the greywacke-argillite
association (with intercalated volcanics) of the Vagheri
Formation. This unit was deposited under turbidite
conditions as evident from abundant turbitite structures seen
at Aguada.
The supracrustal assemblage was intruded by the layered
mafic-ultramafic complex. The intrusion of the Canacona
granite possibly marked the close of sedimentation of this
group. Thus, although the Goa rocks in general show
characteristics typical of the ‘Dharwar-type’ sedimentation,
strictly the Goa Group of Gokul et al. (1985) conforms
neither to the Bababudan nor to the Chitradurga Groups but
share peculiarities of both. Hence the division of the
supracrustal rocks into two stratigraphic groups, that are
distinctly unconformable on their respective basements, is
justified.

CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999698038461538">
The greenstones of the Goa Goup of Gokul et al. (1985)
are divisible into two stratigraphic groups. The older group
formally named the Barcem Group, has a poorly developed
quartz-pebble conglomerate at the base. The Group consists
of metavolcanics with intercalations of metasediments and
rests on a basement of 3300-3400 Ma Anmode Ghat
trondhjemite gneiss. This group is unconformably overlain
by the Ponda Group which is a clastics-dominated sequence
lithologically similar to the Chitradurga Group and rests on
a basement of 2700-2900 Ma Chandranath granite gneiss
with a distinct polymict, granite-clast conglomerate at the
base. It consists of three formations namely the Sanvordem,
Bicholim and the Vagheri (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985) in
ascending order. The supracrustal sequence is intruded by
the Bondla layered mafic-ultramafic complex which is
strongly controlled by a major NW-SE trending shear zone.
The post-tectonic Canacona granite distinctly intrudes the
trondhjemite-tonalite gneisses and marks the close of
sedimentation in the Goa basin. It is an anatectic, potassic
granite which is temporally equivalent to the late phases of
the Closepet granite activity.

The thickest accumulation of mafic volcanics of this schist belt is, however, centred at Bababudan and Kudremukh which forms the southern extensions of this belt (Harinadha Babu et al. 1981a). A thick sequence of greywackes occupy the northern section of the basin. The southern section in general, is characterized by orthoquartzite/basic lava association that denotes subaerial environments and intermittent volcanic activity in a coastal sand environment under stable conditions. The limestone-iron-manganese ore sequence of Goa and north Kanara (Castlerock band) in the northern part (Maclaran, 1904) of the Shimoga belt is in physical continuity with that in the southern part and serves as the marker horizon to show the continuity of the rocks over the entire length of the belt. The granitic-gneisses from Goa were assigned either a syntectonic or post-tectonic status (Harinadha Babu et al. 0016-7622/2011-78-3-233/$ 1.00 © GEOL. SOC. INDIA 234 A. G.

The well exposed ones are those at Bondla and Canacona, both of which show ultramafic rocks at the base followed by mafic gabbros, leucogabbros and rarely by granophyric rocks at the top. The ultramafic zone consists of cumulates of chromitite layers alternating with those of olivine (Dessai et al. 1995). The mafic zone shows uniform layering (Dessai et al. 2009). These layered intrusives were placed stratigraphically higher than the ‘intrusive’ Chandranath granitic gneisses (Gokul et al. 1985). However, according to Devaraju et al. (2010) the complex is enclosed within the supracrustal rocks and as such was emplaced during the early stages of the basin formation and prior to the deposition of the supracrustals. Canacona Granite: It is exposed at Char Rasta-Chauri, Palolem and Agonda, in Canacona taluka (Srinivasan and Gopalakrishnan, 1985). Harinadha Babu et al. (1981b) and Gokul et al. (1985) have included this granite as equivalent to the Chandranath granite gneiss. As per the latest geological and mineral map of Goa (GSI, 1996), the granite is depicted as intrusive into the TTG gneisses. It has been dated at 2395±390 Ma (e.</context>

The metagreywackes are faintly schistose and show graded bedding. The rock consists of sub-angular quartz, plagioclase and lithic fragments in a matrix of sericite, chlorite and quartz. The argillites are light to deep grey and consist of quartz in a sericite-chlorite matrix with opaques. Rarely biotite has formed at the expense of chlorite. A detailed account of the petrography of the conglomerates is available in Devaraju et al. (2010). Bicholim Formation: This Formation can be traced over the entire length of Goa (~ 185 km) in a NW-SE direction from Naibag in the northwest to Salgini in the southeast. The average true thickness of the Formation is about 1.4 km (Gokul et al. 1985). It consists of amphibole schists, ferruginous and manganiferous phyllites, limestones and banded ferruginous quartzites (BHQ) that occur as intercalations within the phyllites. The BHQs serve as the protores for the iron ore deposits that are extensively developed in this formation. The BHQs are thinly laminated and consist of alternate laminae o</context>
