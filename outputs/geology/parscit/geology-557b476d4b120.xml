A highlight of environmental and engineering
geology in Fargo, North Dakota, USA
Abstract Several unfavorable environmental and engineering geologic
conditions exist in Fargo, North
Dakota. Dominantly, the behavior
of smectitic clays within the proglacial Lake Agassiz sediments of the
Sherack and Brenna Formations
creates subsoil instability beneath
engineered structures in the Fargo
area and slope instability within
cutbank meanders of the Red River
of the North. Unfavorable engineering geologic conditions encountered include: the elastic
deformation of clayey glaciolacustrine soils, shrink-swell properties,
inadequate bearing capacities, and
mass movements. These conditions
are responsible for structural failures
including the Fargo Grain Elevator
Introduction
The application of geology to the supporting factors of
engineered works is the sub-discipline of geology known
as engineering geology. Engineering geologists in some
form or fashion have most likely been around since
ancient times. Many of the engineered and constructed
works of the ancient world are located on generally good
natural sites and appear to take local geological conditions into consideration.
Some of the earliest types of works likely to have been
studied by engineering geologists include the construction of tunnels for water transport and the construction
of the Roman highway (Kiersch 1991). Today, most
engineering geologists are well versed in soil and rock
mechanics, issues relating to slope stability, aggregate
resource exploration and characterization, and ground-
in 1955 and the Northern Paciﬁc
railroad grade. Bank failures along
the Red River are common due to
the inherent instability of Brenna
Formation smectitic clays which are
subject to plastic deformation in the
subsurface, with resultant block
failure of overlying Sherack Formation. Recent alluvial sediments due
to typical ﬂuvial action and the
continued seasonal saturation of
cutbank meanders within the ﬂoodplain also add to soil instability.

recent, in Fargo, North Dakota must be dealt with and a
brief discussion follows (Fig. 1).
Environmental geological overview of the Fargo Area
The City of Fargo is within the Red River Valley adjacent to the Red River of the North which drains the
majority of northeastern and eastern North Dakota. Its
sister city, Moorhead, Minnesota, continues the urban
footprint to the east and comprises the largest metropolitan region in the state (Fig. 2).
The surﬁcial geology (deﬁned here as the near surface
sediments most encountered during the construction of
engineered works) in the Fargo area is characterized by

Fig. 3 Generalized lithostratigraphic geologic map of the Fargo
area depicting the distribution of surﬁcial sediments in the
southern Red River Valley. Unit Qaa consists of overbank
sediments associated with ancient river systems draining the Lake
Agassiz ﬂoodplain. Unit Qlo consists of oﬀshore glaciolacustrine
silts and clays of the Sherack and Brenna Formations (Harris et al.
1974). Unit Ha consists of Holocene age alluvium and channel
sediments deposited within the Red River ﬂoodplain and along
tributary drainages. Ice drag marks (linear black lines) and
compaction ridges (linear blue-gray lines) are also shown. Modiﬁed
from Harris et al. (2005)
a relatively uniform blanket of glacial lake sediments
deposited during the onset of Glacial Lake Agassiz
around 11,000 years before present (bp) (Fig. 3) and
alluvial sediments that mantle the lake silts and clays
throughout the southern Red River Valley.
The sediments that underlie the Fargo area consist
dominantly of glacial lake silts, sands, and clays (and
gradational combinations of each) that reach depths of
up to 46 m below the land surface (bls). The Red River
of the North incises this relatively featureless plain and
periodically delivers a healthy amount of overbank ﬁnes
to the area during seasonal ﬂooding events (Fig. 4a, b).
Sediments underlying the Fargo area that are arguably
of greatest concern consist of glaciolacustrine silts, clays,
and silty clays of the Sherack and Brenna Formations
(Harris et al. 1974). In the Fargo area these sediments
are generally found to depths slightly greater than 31 m.
The generalized stratigraphy of these units (Fig. 5) is
somewhat regular with 6 m of yellow-brown laminated
silty clays of the Sherack Formation (Fig. 6) underlain
by approximately 24 m of gray, fat clays of the Brenna
Formation (Fig. 7) (Schwert 2003). Sandwiched between
these units are the West Fargo and Harwood Members
of the Poplar River Formation (Harris and others 1974;
Arndt 1977). Due to the fact that these glaciolacustrine
sediments contain high amounts of smectitic or ‘‘swelling’’ clays in their overall mineralogy these sediments
present many diﬃculties when structural loads are applied due to their inherent ability to take up water within
their mineralogical framework with a resultant loss of
strength.
Examples of engineering geologic issues in the Fargo
area
For the most part, the engineering geologic problems
that exist in the Fargo area are the result of the interaction between constructed engineered works and the
underlying ‘‘load -bearing’’ sediments. The presence or
absence of water within these sediments serves to create
two major engineering geologic challenges within the
valley: soil stablility issues related to the construction of
surface engineered works and slope stability issues re-

Previous workers (Moran 1972; Arndt 1974; Schwert
1997, 2003) have documented several signiﬁcant engineering geologic conditions throughout the Red River
Valley. Some examples are the elastic deformation of
clayey glaciolacustrine soils, shrink-swell properties,
inadequate bearing capacity, and mass movements.
Elastic deformation of clay-rich soils has been documented throughout the Red River Valley. Under certain
cases of loading and unloading, such as in the con-
struction, use, and subsequent failure of the Fargo grain
elevator in 1955 (Fig. 8), soils beneath the structure
deform in response to the increased load upon them,
resulting in an adverse structural eﬀect. Upon removal
of the load, these materials restore to their previous
condition.
Volumetric expansion of clayey rich soils under differing moisture conditions has also been documented.
During signiﬁcantly wet periods, subsurface soils increase in their capacity to accept water into their mineralogical framework, with a resultant loss of bearing
capacity. Conversely, during periods of drought the

developments in north Fargo. Note the subvertical orientation of trees and presence of developing scarps in the foreground
opposite occurs, resulting in overall volumetric reduction of material. Taken in concert, these changes in soil
volume over time have the cumulative eﬀect of
destroying the underlying foundation stability.
Many structural failures have occurred due to the
inherent weakness of clay-rich soils in the Red River
Valley and their inability to accept uniform or nonuniform loads. Three signiﬁcant failures noted include
the Transcona Elevator in Winnipeg, Manitoba (Peck
and Bryant 1953), the Fargo Grain Elevator in 1955
(Nordlund and Deere 1970), and the failure of the
Northern Paciﬁc railroad grade, best chronicled by
Schwert (1997).
These types of failures have occurred simply by the
overloading of unstable foundation soils in the subsurface, which deformed through an increase in load with a
resultant decrease in eﬀective stress and increase in pore
water pressure with further expansion of materials
around the structures (much like placing a brick in a box
of mud). The solution has been to drive supporting
structures through the glacial lake sediments into the
more stable underlying subglacial sediments.
Mass movements of unstable soils within the Fargo
area have also been extensively documented by Harris
(2003) and Schwert (2003).
Failures of materials within cutbank meanders along
the banks of the Red River are persistent and common
and are related to the inherent instability of underlying
Brenna Formation sediments which undergo plastic
deformation in the subsurface with the resultant block
failure of overlying Sherack and recent alluvial sediments and repeated seasonal ﬂooding (Figs. 9, 10).
If surrounding geology is ignored in the construction
of engineered works, then that geology will most certainly assert its inﬂuence on any engineered structures.
Current investigations
The common factors in the majority of the engineering
geologic problems that are encountered in the Fargo
area are the result of the inherent physical properties of
the Glacial Lake Agassiz oﬀshore sediments and the
underlying stratigraphic relationships of these materials.
Problem areas must be identiﬁed prior to site utilization
and other areas with more favorable geologic conditions
considered. However, when the geologic condition is
pervasive and is common across a large pre-existing
urbanized area (Arndt and Moran 1974) it may be
possible to engineer around the problem, or more

Currently, environmental and engineering geologists
from the North Dakota Geological Survey and North
Dakota State University, in addition to many others,
are engaged in detailed geologic mapping studies and
public education eﬀorts to enhance and develop the
public’s understanding of the existing geological conditions in the Fargo area. Many of the products created from these investigations, such as detailed
geologic and derivative maps, will serve as the primary
database for environmental and engineering geological
investigations conducted within the Fargo area in the
future.
The engineering geology of the glaciolacustrine
deposits of the Sherack and Brenna Formations in the
vicinity of the Fargo area and their physical and engineering properties, stratigraphic relationships and environmental geological characteristics are understood.
How these materials vary spatially, both in two and
three dimensions, is not yet fully documented. This work
will continue.
