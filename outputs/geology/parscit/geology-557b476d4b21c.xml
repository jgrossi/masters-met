Abstract Through the analysis of the surrounding rock, coal seam burial depth, coal
quality and hydrologic geological condition, the methane-bearing property characteristics
of the coal reservoir in the Gemudi syncline were elucidated. Most of the wall rock of the
coal reservoir is mudstone and silt, which is a favourable enclosing terrane. Burial depth of
the main excavating coal seam is moderate. The groundwater activity is thin, and there
are absolute groundwater systems between each coal seam, which make poor interconnections to accelerate CBM enrichment. In our research, the area coal reservoir metamorphosis is high, CBM content is high, hole-cranny system development degree is high,
and permeability of the great mass of the main coal seam exceeds 0.1×10-3 μm2. The result demonstrates that the southeast of the Gemudi syncline has the best conditions for
prospecting and exploiting CBM.

The Gemudi syncline lies to the north of the Pan
county basin. It belongs to the Upper Yangtze area,
bounded to the north by the Waterside town (Ya) Ziyun fault, and to the south by the Mount Cock anticline. It runs from northwest to north-northwest, exhibiting a ribbon-like shape. The traps were formed
by the coal measures of the upper permian, above
which are the late and middle Triassic coasts. The
cores of the syncline in the east and west were
formed by the upper Triassic series and Jurassic. The
northern alar was incised by northwestern and northeastern faults. The basin of Gemudi has an area of
523 km2 of coal; the coal formation is 35 201 m thick,
413 m on average. Commercial beds are buried less
than 2 000 m deep, generally less than 1 500 m. The
main commercial beds are the Longtan formation and
Changxing formation (Fig.1). A lagoon, peat marsh,
distributary channel, tide flat, tidal channel, delta
front, sand bank and marsh make up the transition
environment. They are in an unconformable contact
with the underlying upper permian basalts and in
conformable contact with the overlying lower Triassic Feixianguan formation.

2.2 Country rock conditions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999033625">
Coalbed methane reservoirs need appropriate
conditions for generating, storing and capping. A gasbearing formation is good at generating and storing
coalbed methane. Cap rock, specifically country rock
condition, has a direct influence on the coalbed methane reserve, and the properties of the country rock are
decided by lithological characteristics and ventilative
power of the bed roof and floor.
The Gemudi syncline coal-bearing formation (including Longtan and Changxing formations) is located
in the paralic district, to the east of which is a shallow
marine district, while to the west is a continental deposit area (Ao, 2006). Mudstone and siltite make up
the primary part of lithology, occupying 41%~62% of
the coal-bearing formation. The lesser in this district is
made of limestone, pack sand, and sandstone inserted
conglomerate. Mudstone, yakatagite and argillaceous
sandstone make up the main part of the lithology of
the bed roof and floor. A single layer of mudstone,
argillaceous flour sand in this district is 4 to 12 m in
thickness. It is a better cap rock in the gas-bearing reservoir group that can transform the reserve layer into a
good enclosure. The lower Triassic series Feixianguan
formation or Yelang formation, belongs to the shallow
bank marine deposit, having purple mudstone, argillaceous flour sand rock inserted pack rock widespread;
the thickness is constant, reaches 43 580 m thick, and
is a good regional cap rock. Because of the very low
carrying of permeability at the Gemudi baseplate and
good traps that can prevent the longitudinal dissipation

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995496">
2.3 Buried condition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991796">
Generally speaking, it is more difficult for coalbed methane to escape outward with the increase of
stratum pressure influenced by the depth of the coalbearing formation. Most coalbed methane exists in
sorption state and it is not easy for deep formations to
form crannies, making the coalbed methane well
stored.
According to wildcat materials outside the area,
the content of coalbed methane in the Gemudi syncline increases with increase of depth. It is greater than
15 m3/t of the content of the main working seam
which is buried less than 500 m deep. The contents of
formations buried 800~1 000 m deep is constant, and
for formations that are about 200~1 500 m deep, the
coal seam area can reach 403 km2, coalbed methane
resource is about 2 063×108 m3, and resource abundance degree is 5.20×108 m3/km2. All these help store
coalbed methane in the aspects that the stratum coal
seam is continuous and coal seam seldom appears.

2.4 Geohydrologic conditions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967305">
The siltstone and pack stone of the Longtan formations in the Gemudi synclinal keep the pressurebearing crevice water, limestone stores the karst crevice water; limestone has stronger permeability than
sandstone. Watery sandstone and limestone present
intermediate layers lying in mudstone, sandy mudstone and coal bearing formations, which are as thick
as 45~65 m in total. Therefore, the Longtan coal bearing formation shows weak watery characteristics. The
Changxing coal bearing formation where erosion
crannies exist develops into a medium-sized rich watery layer. A weak watery layer, and also the regional
water barrier present are Emeishan basalts at the bottom of the Longtan formations.
The amount and velocity of groundwater have a
certain influence on the storage, exploitation and
utilization of coalbed methane. In the area where
groundwater flows fast, coalbed methane relatively
reduces. The upside of the Feixianguan formation,
which deposits on the Changxing formation, also
shows weak watery characteristics, so the whole area
is very suitable for cap rock superposition, forming
multi-layer traps longitudinally. There are close negative structural traps and possible sealing faults in the
lateral direction. Water power of the basin has a system of its own, enabling coalbed methane storage in
coal bearing formations.

Content of coalbed methane
New Star of the Chinese Petroleum Company has
implemented a shallow natural gas (including coalbed
methane) evaluation and investigation project in the
western region of Guizhou Province, constructing 5
test pits, and has tried to drain water and product gas.
After conducting sand fracturing in 5 strata in Qianhong No.1 and No.2 well and Guimei No.1 well, the
company started to drain water and product gas for 7
months starting March 2000. The daily gas production
of a single well was dozens of cubic meters (Jiang,
2008). The gas production rate of Qianhong No.1well
was 29 to 38 m3/d, the cumulative gas production was

Equivalence line chart of the content of synclinal
coalbed methane of Gemudi Basin
Characteristic of coal property
The rank of coal metamorphism’s impact on the
content of coalbed methane are mainly shown in two
aspects: First, with the increasing of the degree of
coalification, the amount of coalbed methane increases
gradually, reaching a maximum by anthracite stage.
Studies have suggested that the total production of
coalbed methane can reach 4 000 m3/t as the coal turns
into anthracite. Second, the absorbing amount of
coalbed methane of the coal seam increases constantly
as the degree of coalification rises by anthracite stage.
Inside the coal seam, it produces a large number of
pores, joints and microcracks, which lead to the adsorbtion surface area reaching the maximum. The gas
content of the coal seam can reach 40 m3/t. Therefore,
the high degree of coal metamorphism created conditions for the formation and accumulation of coalbed
methane. The higher the rank of coal metamorphism is,
the bigger the gas content of the coal seam is.
The coal lithotype of Longtan group in the Gemudi coal Basin includes half clarain, bright coal
mixed with semidull coal; the group of Changxing
consists of semidull-half bright coal. Coal luster
strengthens from east to west in the Gemudi Basin
Shuicheng area, half clarain and clarain increase; the
coal lithotype of Liuzhi Basin is mainly half clarain.
Coal macerals are mainly vitrinite (38.4%~98.6%); the
content of vitrinite is greater than 50%, except for
parts of the Gemudi Basin and Liuzhi Basin. The intertinite takes up 1.4% to 59.3%, except for some parts
of the Gemudi Basin and Liuzhi Basin which are
greater than 45%, the others are smaller than 10%. The
content of exinite and inertinite in the Qianxi coal Basin is very high, the content of inertinite is 21.0% to
44.8%, among which fusinite and half fusinite have
comparative advantage, the content of exinite is 6.0%
to 8.5%. The ash content of the coal rock is 14.63% to
38.21%, belonging to ash coal and is partly bone coal.
The northeast is slightly low, while the southwest is
relatively high, general ash content is 20% to 30%.

The microstructure determination of the Gemudi
coal sample by mercury intrusion porosimetry indicated that there is a spike of mercury intrusion when
the pressure is under 0.1 MPa, another peak appeared
when the pressure transited to 10 MPa. This proves
that the coal rock has a double pore structural characteristic. We determined 16 samples, with 6 samples
having macropore as the core; the others are with fine
pore and micropore. Coal rock cryogenic nitrogen adsorption and desorption test proved that it contains
storage pore and open space in the coal; the open

space is favorable to interconnection and flow of gas
in the coal rock pore. The cryogenic nitrogen adsorption determined pore volume and average pore diameter and proved that the pore volume and average pore
diameter distribution rewidespread, and have a strong
randomness. The specific surface area of the coal
sample is determined to be 0.1 m2/g.
The northwest area of the Gemudi Basin is like a
long band, and the development of cleat is quite different as the direction and intensity of stress in every
part is different. According to the macroscopic and
microscopic statistical analysis of the coal seam (Table
1), the direction of the main cleat and outstanding tectonic direction are roughly the same, though with a
slight offset; the direction of cleat development still
varies with structural trend. The direction of secondary
cleats is basically identical with secondary structure
line. Thus, the porosity in this area is comparatively
good, and is favorable to adsorption and deposition of
coalbed methane.

The key parameter that influences air output during the development of coalbed methane is the permeability of the coal beam. In the area where the
structure stress is close, it is relatively low, while in
the area where the structure stress is lax the permeability is high.
The coefficient of permeability of coal seam in
Shuicheng, Gemudi is 0.17 m2/(MPa2•d). The coal
seam permeability in this district is relatively low,
generally smaller than 0.1×10 3 μm and not exceeding 0.61×10 3 μm. As the coefficient of permeability
of the coal seam is 0.69×10 3 μm2 in the neighboring

deposit condition is similar and the coefficient of
permeability of coal seam is 0.81×10 3 μm2 on the 9th
coal seam, with developing cracks and high porosity
in this district, we can conclude that the coefficient of
permeability of coal seam in Gemudi is relatively
high too.

the Gemudi syncline is good. The adjacent rock is
mainly mudstone and siltstone in the study area with a
good capped ability. It will be difficult for the coalbed
methane in the coal reservoir to escape; the buried
depth of minable seam and main minable seam is generally smaller than 1 000 m, the depth is moderate.
The activity of ground water is weak, and every coal
seam has independent ground water regime and the
connectivity is not very good, which promotes coalbed
methane accumulation.
(2) The physical property of the coal reservoir of
the Gemudi syncline is good. The gas content of the
coal reservoir in the study area is high, the maximum
is 37.66 cm3/g, the average is 12.84 cm3/g. The coal is
mainly meager coal and lean coal, the rank of coal
metamorphism is relatively high; pore sand crack
abundance is relatively high, the permeability of most
main mineral seam exceeds 0.1×10 3 μm2.
(3) In sum, the coal reservoir in the Gemudi syncline in the west of Guizhou Province has good coalbed methane hosting feature and physical property.
The most suitable place for coalbed methane exploration and exploitation lies in the southeast of the study
area.
