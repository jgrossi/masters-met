Many readers probably attended the 32nd
International Geological Congress (IGC) held
20–28 August 2004 in Florence, Italy. The scientific
program of the IGC was classified into three symposium categories: 14 Special, 38 Topical, and 24
General Symposia including a “Mathematical
Geology” symposium. Each Topical and General
symposium consisted of several sessions: six sessions
were organized for “Mathematical Geology.” This issue of Natural Resources Research is composed of papers from one such session; “G-13.06 Mathematical
Geology for Resource Exploration,” held the afternoon of 22 August. The session was supported jointly
by the International Association for Mathematical
Geology (IAMG) and the International Symposium
on Mineral Exploration (ISME). Pengda Zhao
(China University of Geosciences) and I served
as convenors to select abstracts and to create the
program.
ISME is an international organization of the Division of Exploration Technology (DETEC) in the
Mining and Materials Processing Institute of Japan
(MMIJ). Since 1990, symposia sponsored or supported by ISME have been held every 2 years; in
Japan, Canada, China, Australia, Brazil, and USA,
in conjunction with the annual conferences of IAMG
and the IGC. As Singer and Kouda (1993) correctly
noted, the purpose of ISME symposia is “to bring
together scientists actively working on some diverse
fields in order to foster the exchanges of ideas related to the methods of resource exploration.” ISME
originally focused on mineral resources, but has since
developed to also focus on solving other natural resources problems involving such areas as coal, natural gas, petroleum, methane hydrate, geothermal,
groundwater, and aggregates. Its activities at the last
seventh symposium can be seen in the special issues
on the application of neural networks to earth sciences in Natural Resources Research, v. 12, no. 3 and
part of no. 4.
This session presented the eighth ISME symposium, which was intended to cover all aspects
of mathematical geology for resource exploration.
Initially, the main topics were proposed as; advanced
data-analysis methods for exploring and assessing
renewable and nonrenewable resources, advanced
geostatistics for characterizing petroleum and
geothermal reservoirs, remote sensing for detecting
mineral manifestations, highly precise methods for
modeling geologic structures and, new paradigms for
resource assessment.
There were eight oral (two cancelled out of
an original 10) and 15 poster presentations. The
oral papers could be classified into three topics:

<listItem confidence="0.3613922">
(1) geoinformatics and mathematics for mineralresource explorations, (2) GIS and probabilistic
applications, and (3) remote sensing for mineral potential and geologic hazard assessment. Topic (1)
presented new paradigms of mathematical geology
for mineral-resource exploration by sensitivity analysis of geologic spatial estimation by Koike and
Matsuda; quantifying mineral information by Zhao,
Chen, and Zhang; and valuing information acquisition by Dimitrakopoulos and Scott. GIS technologies in topic (2) were applied to coastal exploration by Kouda, Kishimoto, and Kusunose; mineralresource exploration in southwest China by Chen,
Wang, and Hou; and a Jurassic petroleum system

by Sinding-Larsen and Xu. Satellite remote-sensing
technologies in topic (3) were applied effectively to
mapping of mineral compositions in porphyry copper belts by Sanga and co-authors; and to detection
of highly susceptible landslide areas by Ueki and
co-authors.
The posters had wider topics areas than the
oral presentations. Main topics were informatic and
probabilistic appraisals of natural resources, geostatistical modeling of ore deposits, numerical simulation for basin modeling, integration of diverse geologic information, and statistical characterization of
rock fractures and mineral textures. I hope that the
participants were able to follow the advances and
new trends in mathematical geology for natural resource exploration through both the oral and poster
presentations.
As a result of a request made to all session
speakers after the 32nd IGC, the papers in this
special issue were submitted for peer review. I
sincerely thank the authors submitting to this issue
for their effort and diligence, and the following
reviewers for their valuable comments that contributed greatly to edit this special issue: Tetsuya

Sincere thanks are extended to Ryoichi Kouda (Geological Survey of Japan) and Toshiaki Ueki (Ocean
High Technology Institute Inc.) for their efforts in
making the session a success. Papers late for this
issue will appear in a subsequent issue of the journal.
The next ISME symposium (ISME-IX) will be
held 19–20 September 2006 at the Institute of Technology Bandung (ITB), Indonesia, with the title “Toward New Frontiers for Resource Exploration &amp;
Sustainable Development.” For sustainable development, new technologies of resources exploration
are becoming of the utmost importance. The symposium will cover all aspects that contribute to innovative technologies in resource exploration. I encourage readers to take part in the ISME-IX and to exchange ideas on the exploration, development, and
the use of natural resources.
