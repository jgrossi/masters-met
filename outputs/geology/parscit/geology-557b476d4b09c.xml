New age metals: the geology and genesis of ores required
for a changing economy and a carbon-constrained
world—preface to a thematic issue on critical commodities

Over the last decade or so, the development of technologies associated with consumer electronics, renewable
energy, and specialty steel have sparked demand for a
range of “specialty” mineral commodities. These commodities are quite diverse and include, among others,
rare earth elements, (REEs: lanthanides, Y, and Sc), Ga,
In, W, platinum group elements (PGEs: Ru, Rh, Pd, Os,
Ir, Pt), Co, Nb, Mg, Mo, Sb, Li, V, Ni, Ta, Te, Cr, Mn,
Se, Ti, Sr, graphite, Sn, Ge, Be, Zr, Bi, F, and Cd. Most
of these commodities have small, restricted markets,
and, in some cases, supply is restricted—concentrated
in either a small group of countries or producing companies. Some elements, such as In, Ga, Cd, Se, and Te,
are produced as by-products of the extraction of base
metals.
Although the amount of these commodities produced can
be quite small (annual global production of Re, for example,
was ~50 t in 2012: www.comtrade.un.org/db), they can be
highly critical for some manufacturing industries.
Consequently, a number of countries, including USA
(United States Department of Energy 2010), UK (British
Geological Survey 2012), Japan (JOGMEC 2010), Korea
(Bae 2010), the European Union (European Commission
2010), and Australia (Skirrow et al. 2013), have
commissioned reports on critical commodities. Most of these
reports concentrated on economic aspects, with few
discussing the geological occurrence of critical commodities.
Although the details differed, most of these reports identified

REEs (particularly heavy REEs), Ga, In, W, PGEs, Co, Nb,
Mg, Mo, Sb, Li, V, Ni, Ta, Te, Cr, and Mn as being highly
critical (see Skirrow et al. 2013 for summary). Interestingly,
some of these reports identified more traditional commodities,
such as Zn, as critical.
This Thematic Issue is the result of a symposium at
the 34th International Geological Congress in Brisbane,
Australia in August 2012 entitled “New age metals: the
geology and genesis of ores required for a changing
economy and a carbon constrained world”. The purpose
of this symposium was to discuss the geology and, to a
lesser extent, the economics of critical commodities.
This thematic issue presents some of the results of this
symposium and related research.
The first paper in this issue (Simandl 2014) presents
an overview of the geology and market dependency of
REE resources. This analysis indicates that in recent
years, changes in Chinese government policy have had
a major impact on the supply and price of REEs, and
that the production of these elements is highly dependent upon metallurgical characteristics and the ratio of
heavy to light REEs in the ores. At present, most REEs
are produced from carbonatite and related alkaline
rocks. Recycling of these elements is in its infancy.
Geological and geochemical descriptions of the
Cummins Range deposit in Australia and of Bastnästype deposits in the Bergslagen district in Sweden are
presented by Downes et al. (2014) and Holtstam et al.
(2014), respectively. Important results from the
Cummins Range deposit include recognition of shear
zone-hosted, REE-rich apatite-monazite-(Ce) rocks
formed by the hydrothermal remobilization of REEs
from carbonatites within the complex, and that the
carbonatitic melts were derived from a subduction-

modified mantle source (Downes et al. 2014). Holtstam
et al. (2014) found that Bastnäs-type deposits formed
when high temperature (&amp;gt;400 °C) magmatic fluids of
Svecofennian age (ca. 1,900 Ma) interacted with dolomitic rocks in supracrustal assemblages. These fluids
carried Fe, REEs, Cu, Mo, Bi, and Au as ore metals,
along with Si, F, Cl, S, and CO2.
Höhn et al. (2014) describe the geology and geochemistry
of clay deposits in the Czech Republic and in Austria. In
particular, they assess whether REEs could be recovered as
by-products of kaolinite production. Although REE-bearing
minerals are enriched in the by-products of kaolinite extraction, the quantities produced are insufficient to justify
extraction.
Migdisov and Williams-Jones (2014) consider the hydrothermal geochemistry of REE transport and demonstrate that,
under many geological conditions, chloride complexes, rather
than fluoride complexes, were the most likely transporting
agents for REEs. This has significant implications when considering the mechanisms and environments of REE
deposition.
Simandl et al. (2014) document the application and
reliability of hand-held X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis to exploration for REE deposits. They determined
analytical uncertainties and detection limits for a range
of REEs and related elements, demonstrating that this
technique can be used effectively for REE, particularly
light REE, exploration. Horiuchi et al. (2014) also discuss the utility of hand-held XRF spectrometry for REE
exploration, in this case for the Blockspruit deposit in
South Africa. They show that handheld XRF analysis of
termite mounds in the field can effectively map the
distribution of both light and heavy REE mineralization
where exposure of outcropping rocks is poor.
Finally, Mackay and Simandl (2014) explore the history and uses of Ta and Nb, including the growing
demand for “conflict” columbite-tantalite concentrates
from Africa. These elements are extracted from a range
of geological sources, including pegmatites and related
alluvials for Ta, and weathered carbonatites and
peralkaline complexes for Nb. An important conclusion
of this study is that in the long-term, the supplies of Ta
and Nb should be assured.
In addition to this thematic issue, Mineralium
Deposita has recently published a number of other articles covering critical commodities. Sanematsu et al.
(2013) studied a weathering profile with ion-adsorption
type REE mineralization over granite in Phuket,
Thailand. Luque et al. (2014) described the geology
and geological controls on vein graphite, a commodity
Miner Deposita (2014) 49:885–887
that has received much interest due to its use in
graphene and other high tech applications. Yang et al.
(2014) described the geology, geochemistry, and mineralogy of the Baerzhe deposit in China, one of the
largest Zr-REE-Nb deposits in Asia. Frenzel et al.
(2014) discussed potential geological sources of Ge
and the technologies required to extract this critical
commodity. Boudreau et al. (2014) discussed alteration
in the offset zone of the Lac des Iles Pd deposit in
Ontario, and a new model for the formation of the
PGE-, Cr-, and V-rich layers of the Bushveld Complex
was presented by Maier et al. (2013).
This thematic issue and recent papers in Mineralium
Deposita have highlighted that many commodities that
are considered “critical” by industrialized countries differ not only in economics, but also in their geology,
with respect to more broadly traded commodities such
as iron ore, Cu, Zn, Pb, Au, Ag, and Ni. Many critical
commodities are associated with rocks, such as
carbonatites and peralkaline magmatic rocks that have
been the topics of highly specialized studies. Perhaps,
the current emphasis on critical commodities may spur a
better understanding of the metallogeny of these unusual, but important, rocks.
