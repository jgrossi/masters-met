				<p>Through the analysis of the surrounding rock, coal seam burial depth, coal quality and hydrologic geological condition, the methane-bearing property characteristics of the coal reservoir in the Gemudi syncline were elucidated. Most of the wall rock of the coal reservoir is mudstone and silt, which is a favourable enclosing terrane. Burial depth of the main excavating coal seam is moderate. The groundwater activity is thin, and there are absolute groundwater systems between each coal seam, which make poor intercon-nections to accelerate CBM enrichment. In our research, the area coal reservoir metamorphosis is high, CBM content is high, hole-cranny system development degree is high, and permeability of the great mass of the main coal seam exceeds 0.1×10-3 μm 2. The result demonstrates that the southeast of the Gemudi syncline has the best conditions for prospecting and exploiting CBM.</p>

The Gemudi syncline coal-bearing formation (including Longtan and Changxing formations) is located in the paralic district, to the east of which is a shallow marine district, while to the west is a continental deposit area (Ao, 2006).

A single layer of mudstone, argillaceous flour sand in this district is 4 to 12 m in thickness.

After conducting sand fracturing in 5 strata in Qianhong No.1 and No.2 well and Guimei No.1 well, the company started to drain water and product gas for 7 months starting March 2000. The daily gas production of a single well was dozens of cubic meters (Jiang, 2008). The gas production rate of Qianhong No.1well was 29 to 38 m3/d, the cumulative gas production was 7 258.5 m3. Meanwhile, the fluid production rate was 0 to 30.40 m3/d and the cumulative fluid production was 294.48 m3.
