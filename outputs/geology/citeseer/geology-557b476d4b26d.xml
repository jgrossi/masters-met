			<abstract>
				<p>Pingxiang Mining Area in Jiangxi Province is one of the major coal-producing areas and is prone to serious coal and gas outburst, therefore, it is of significance to research on gas geological features and its controlling factors. Based on the analysis of gas data collected from geological exploration and coal mining, the research reveals that the features of gas geology vary significantly between west part and east part of Pingxiang Mining Area, and it is characterized by high gas mines with serious coal and gas outburst in the west part and low gas mines with no coal and gas outburst in the east part. The main controlling factors to gas geology are discussed, and the great difference of gas geology between west part and east part is the result of comprehensive effect by geological factors. Concerning the gas generation, the coal rank in the west part is higher than that in the east part, which is favorable to generate more gas in the west part than in the east part. Concerning the gas preservation, the structures are characterized by gliding nappe in the west part and by tectonic window in the east part, the surrounding rocks are characterized by poor permeability in the west part and comparatively good permeability in the east part, and the characteristics of coal rank and coal body structure are favorable to gas preservation in the west part and favorable to gas emission in the east part.</p>

About Baiyuan Coal Mine, the coal-bearing strata of Triassic are directly contacted with the Cretaceous red layer, and the entire Jurassic strata are missed, which shows that a large amount of gas is released for a long weathering and erosion period before the sediment of Cretaceous red layer. 3.2.3 Factor of coal quality The metamorphic degree of coal has considerable influence on coal’s gas adsorption capacity. The coal’s gas adsorption capacity increases from medium-rank bituminous to anthracite (Zhang, 2009). The statistics based on the data from more than 160 mining area in China (Qin et al., 1999) reveal the enveloping line relationship between the coal rank and gas content in coal reservoir, that is, with the increase coal rank from brown coal to the early stage of anthracite, the maximum gas content of coal seam increases, and the area with high gas content corresponds to the area with high rank coal. However, with the increase coal rank from middle stage to later stage of anthracite, the methane adsorption capacity of coal seam decreases, and correspondingly, the maximum gas content of coal seam sharply decreases.

Meanwhile, in the east part, the structures are comparatively simple, and the synclines are wide and gentle, which is favorable to gas migration and emission. Fig.3 Correlation section between Anyuan gliding block and Gaokeng gliding block (according to Liu et al., 2003) Fig.4 Section of gliding nappe structure at Juyuan Coal Mine 3.2.2 Factor of surrounding rock of coal seam Some researches are reported concerning the sedimentary features in Pingxiang Mining Area (Yan and Wu, 1995; Yan et al., 1995; Xie et al., 2001; Chen and Peng, 2005). For Qingshan Coal Mine, the coal seams of Zijiachong Stage have good conditions to prevent gas migration. The ratio of sandstone to mudstone within 50 m of roof and floor is lower, and the carbonaceous mudstone and mudstone in roof and floor are thick and tight, so the permeability of the roof and floor is low, which provides the favorable conditions for gas storage. Also, for Juyuan Coal Mine, the roof rock of the main coal-bearing section is 350 m mud-cement siltstone, and the floor rock is 60 m tight mudstone, which is favorable to gas preservation.</context>

The east-towest length is about 25 km, while the north-to-south width is about 10 km, and the coal-bearing area is about 250 km2 (Fig.1). Pingxiang Mining Area is one of the major coal-producing areas in Jiangxi Province (Tan et al., 2009). From west to east, there are five major coal mines in Pingxiang Mining Area named Juyuan Coal Mine, Qingshan Coal Mine, Baiyuan Coal Mine, Anyuan Coal Mine, and Gaokeng Coal Mine. Pingxiang Mining Area is very serious in coal and gas outburst (Xie et al., 2001; Chen and Wang, 2009; Zhang et al., 2010). Therefore, it is of significance to research on gas geological features and its controlling factors. The coal seams in Anyuan Formation are the mining Fig.1 Distribution of five major coal mines in Pingxiang Mining Area objects in Pingxiang Mining Area. Anyuan Formation is unconformable above Maokou Formation, Longtan Formation of the Permian, or Daye Formation of the Triassic. From bottom to top, Anyuan Formation (T3a) is subdivided into Zijiachong Stage (T3a1), Sanjiachong Stage (T3a2), and Sanqiutian Stage (T3a3). Within the Anyuan Formation, Zijiachong Stage is well developed and include</context>

But in the east part, the coal ranks are comparatively low, and most of them are medium-rank bituminous, coking coal for Baiyuan Coal Mine and Wupi Coal Mine, 1/3 coking coal for Wangkeng Coal Mine, Hongqi Coal Mine, and Panjiachong Coal Mine, fat coal or 1/3 coking coal for Anyuan Coal Mine and Gaokeng Coal Mine, and fat coal for Yuejin Coal Mine. The metamorphism degree of coal and gas storage is closely related. The higher the metamorphism degree of coal is, the more the coal’s gas productivity is (Zhang, 2009). Therefore, from the angle of gas generation, the higher metamorphism degree of coal in the west part than that in the east part means more gas produced for coal in the west part than that in the east part. 3.2 About the gas preservation 3.2.1 Factor of structure During Middle Proterozoic to Early Paleozoic, Jiangxi Province is separated by Yangtze Plate and South China Plate. Between these two plates, there is a combination belt, named Pingxiang-Leping Depression. Yangtze Plate, Pingxiang-Leping Depression, and South China Plate are three first-level tectonic units in the northern, middle, a</context>

About Baiyuan Coal Mine, the coal-bearing strata of Triassic are directly contacted with the Cretaceous red layer, and the entire Jurassic strata are missed, which shows that a large amount of gas is released for a long weathering and erosion period before the sediment of Cretaceous red layer. 3.2.3 Factor of coal quality The metamorphic degree of coal has considerable influence on coal’s gas adsorption capacity. The coal’s gas adsorption capacity increases from medium-rank bituminous to anthracite (Zhang, 2009). The statistics based on the data from more than 160 mining area in China (Qin et al., 1999) reveal the enveloping line relationship between the coal rank and gas content in coal reservoir, that is, with the increase coal rank from brown coal to the early stage of anthracite, the maximum gas content of coal seam increases, and the area with high gas content corresponds to the area with high rank coal. However, with the increase coal rank from middle stage to later stage of anthracite, the methane adsorption capacity of coal seam decreases, and correspondingly, the maximum gas content of coal </context>
