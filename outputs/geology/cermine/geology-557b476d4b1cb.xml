          <institution>Five stages can be distinguished in the developmen- tal history of engineering geology at Moscow Univer- sity. The first stage is the origin of engineering geology at Moscow University, which lasted from the end of the 19th century until 1938. It was closely associated with the name of Academician A.P. Pavlov and his studies in the field of applied geology; with the studies of the famous geologist Professor E.V. Milanovskii concern- ing the design of a number of the largest hydraulic engi- neering constructions on the Volga</institution>

It was he who established the first specialization in the field of engineering geol- ogy-Road Soil Science-at Moscow University. This was opened in 1930 at the Chair of soil science of the soil geographical division at the physico-mathematical department, and soon (in 1934) it was reorganized into the wider specialty of Soil Science</institution>

        <p>In 1938, Professor M.M. Filatov organized the Chair of soil science as the first independent structural unit that joined lecturers and researchers in the field of engineering geology at MSU. From 1938 to 1942, he was in charge of this Chair; then the first associate professor and later professor S.S. Morozov replaced him at this position (from 1942 to 1954). In 1954, after 16 years of independent development, the Chair of soil science was transformed into the Chair of soil science and engineering geology by amalgamating a group of engineering geologists who worked at the Chair of hydrogeology. In August 1986, the former was reorganized into the Chair of engineering geology and geological environment protection. From 1954 to 1988, Professor, Academician of the AN USSR E.M. Sergeev headed the Chair, and in 1989 Professor, Academician of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (RANS) and the International Academy of Sciences of Higher Schools (IAS HS) V.T. Trofimov took charge of it. In 1998, the Chair was reorganized into the Chair of engineering and ecological geology, headed by V.T. Trofimov.</p>

      <p>The second stage (1938–1954) was the formation
stage of the engineering geologist school at MSU. On
one hand, this was marked by the opening of the Chair
of soil science at the geological and soil department of
MSU on February 1, 1938; and on the other hand, by
the development of other studies in engineering
geology carried out by related Chairs (of dynamic geology
and hydrogeology) of this department. This resulted in
a paradoxical situation where specialties providing
geological support of construction turned out to be
given by different chairs. Geological processes and
engineering geological methods of investigation were
taught without engineering geological study of soils
and rocks (soil science), and specialists graduating
from the soil science Chair did not have the necessary
courses on engineering geodynamics. Also, scientific
research study suffered from this situation because it
could not be integrated. This was changed in 1954,
when, according to the decision of the scientific council
of the geological faculty, the USSR Ministry of Higher
Education transformed the soil science Chair into the
Chair of soil science and engineering geology, and the
Chair of hydrogeology and engineering geology into
the Chair of hydrogeology.</p>
      <p>The third stage (1954–1986) was the stage of the
final establishment of the engineering geologist school
at MSU. It was performed under the guidance of
E.M. Sergeev, Professor, Corresponding member
(1966), and later Academician (1979) of the AN USSR.
This stage was characterized by the final formation of
all scientific aspects of engineering geology, soil
science, engineering geodynamics, and regional
engineering geology in research areas. This was reflected in the
next structural reorganization of the Chair at the
beginning of the 70s. Three educational scientific
laboratories were formed instead of the three structural units
present at that time. These were: the Laboratory of soil
science and technical melioration of soils (the
previously organized laboratory of soil mechanics and the
newly formed laboratory of hard rocks entered into this
laboratory); the Laboratory of engineering
geodynamics (which included the process-modeling laboratory
and the problem laboratory of slope processes); and the
Laboratory of regional engineering geology.</p>
      <p>The Chair staff, both in quantitative and qualitative
terms, was changing remarkably during that stage. At
the beginning of the stage, it amounted to 35
employees, whereas the number of state budget employees
reached 60 and 54 permanent workers in expeditionary
divisions at the end.</p>
      <p>The fourth development stage (1986–1996) of
engineering geology was characterized by further evolution
of scientific research studies in all aspects of
engineering geology directed at estimating and predicting
changes in engineering geological conditions under
technological impact. In 1986, the Chair was renamed
into the Chair of engineering geology and geological
environment protection. Consequently, the research has
gone in new directions concerning engineering
geological substantiation of protection and the rational use of
geological environments along with estimating the
resistance of such environments to technological
impacts.</p>
      <p>The change in the Chair name also caused changes
in the names of laboratories. Thus, the Laboratory of
engineering geodynamics was renamed the Laboratory
of engineering geodynamics and geological
environment protection and the Laboratory of regional
engineering geology was renamed the Laboratory of
regional engineering geology and rational use of the
geological environment. A portion of all the scientific
problems under study in all laboratories became
associated with the protection and rational use of the
geological environment. In 1986, the first Chair graduates
received a degree in the specialization of Geological
environment protection.</p>
      <p>By the end of the fourth stage, the number of staff
members was 66, among whom there were 10 doctors
and 22 candidates of sciences. The total number of
Chair members was reduced by the end of the fourth
stage. This was caused by a reduction in the number of
expeditionary workers, first due to the curtailment and
then the almost complete termination of economic
contract studies [Trofimov, 1998].</p>
      <p>The fifth stage (from 1996) in the Chair
development was characterized by carrying out investigations,
not only in the field of engineering geology, but also in
a new aspect of geological sciences: ecological
geology. Therefore the Chair structure and its name
changed. By order of the MSU rector on May 26, 1996,
a new laboratory was organized under the name of
Ecological geology, and the Laboratory of engineering
geodynamics and geological environment protection was
renamed the Laboratory of engineering geodynamics
and substantiation of engineering protection of
territories. Since March 26, 1998, the Chair has been called
the Chair of engineering and ecological geology.</p>
      <p>Geological engineering issues still prevailed in the
scientific plan of the Chair (see below). But also
principally new issues appeared: ecological geology and
engineering geology, i.e., theoretical methodological
foundations and relations, development of the
theoretical fundamentals of the doctrine on the ecological
functions of the lithosphere, etc.</p>
      <p>During these stages, the Moscow university school
of engineering geologists, i.e., a school at the
international level, formed at MSU and continues its
successful study at the present time. Its formation is associated
with the names of M.M. Filatov, who organized the
Chair of soil science in 1938; I.V. Popov, S.S. Morozov,
E.M. Sergeev, and G.S. Zolotarev. This school
produced the doctors of sciences V.M. Bezruk, Yu.K.
Vasil’chuk, A.N. Vakhtangov, E.A. Voznesenskii, S.D.
Voronkevich, G.A. Golodkovskaya, B.M. Gumenskii,
I.P. Zelinskii, R.S. Ziangirov, E.V. Kalinin, K.A.
Kozhobaev, E.N. Kolomenskii, I.G. Korobanova, V.A.
Korolev, V.S. Krupoderov, V.M. Kutepov, N.A.
Maksimovich, V.A. Mymrin, Nguen Than (Vietnam), V.I.
Osipov, Yu.B. Osipov, V.N. Sokolov, V.E. Sokolovich,
B.I. Sergeev, V.T. Trofimov, Sh.E. Usupaev, V.S.
Fedorenko, L.V. Shaumyan, N.L. Sheshenya, more than
254 candidates of sciences, and also more than
1300 Specialists and 51 Masters of geology.</p>
      <p>The results of the 60-year study experience of
engineering geologists of Moscow University are
concentrated in publications of different years [Gerasimova,
2001; Filatov, 1940]. The principal achievements can
be formulated as follows:</p>
      <p>(1) the Chair as one of the leading scientific
methodological centers, the first in the USSR and then Russia,
played an important role in the development of higher
engineering geological education in this country; its
professors have contributed much to the elaboration of
standard curricula, which underlie the specialty
preparation program for students pursuing a degree in
hydrogeology and engineering geology. Textbooks and
teaching materials developed by lecturers of the Chair
were applied at geological institutes of higher
education both in our country and abroad for many years;
(2) a great contribution was made to the formation
of engineering geology as a science of the geological
cycle and to development of its theoretical
fundamentals. The main direction of the Chair’s scientific study
consisted of a systematic development of all the
scientific aspects of engineering geology (soil science,
engineering geodynamics, and regional engineering
geology), and also of a number of applied aspects of
engineering geology (engineering geology of cities and city
agglomerations, engineering geology of hydraulic
power plants, engineering geology of mineral deposits,
etc.), and of the methodology for engineering
geological exploration;</p>
      <p>(3) the engineering geologists of MSU played an
important role in the organization and operation of the
USSR AN Research Council on engineering geology
and soil science (from 1966 to 1980) and the USSR AN
Research Council on engineering geology and
hydrogeology, and in the activities of the national group of
engineering geologists of the USSR and Russian
National Committee of Geologists; they provided close
interaction between Russian engineering geologists
and the International Association of Engineering
Geologists (IAEG);</p>
      <p>(4) Chair members played a leading role in the
initiation of the AN USSR Journal Engineering Geology,
whose first issue was published in 1979; this journal
was later renamed and reoriented by its Editor-in-Chief
Academician V.I. Osipov, the Chair graduate, as the
Geoecology Journal;</p>
      <p>(5) the Chair organized many scientific conferences,
including forums, in cooperation with the IAEG and
the International Geological Congress.</p>
      <p>The scientific and educational activity of the Chair
members in the field of engineering geology was highly
appreciated in our country and abroad. The
eight-volume monograph Engineering geology of the USSR
received the Lenin Award in 1982. E.M. Sergeev and
I.V. Popov (posthumously) were among the laureates of
this award. Previously in 1952, I.V. Popov and
G.S. Zolotarev received the Stalin Award as the
coauthors of the two-volume monograph Manual on
Engineering Geological Exploration for Hydraulic
Construction.</p>
      <p>A cycle of monographic studies and original maps
on engineering geology providing effective national
economical development of Western Siberia was
awarded with a USSR State Award in 1977. Among its
laureates were four members of the Chair: E.M.
Sergeev, A.S. Gerasimova, S.B. Ershova, and V.T.
Trofimov. In 1988, a similar award was given to the textbook
Soil science (5th edition, 1983). As well, Sergeev,
G.A. Golodkovskaya, Ziangirov, Osipov, and Trofimov
were its laureates. The participation of Trofimov in the
creation of the five-volume monograph Geocryology of
the USSR was appreciated by giving him the rank of a
laureate of the Russian Federation State Award in 1993
[Gerasimova, 2001; XX vek—lichnosti…, 2004].</p>
      <p>The results of long-term studies of the Chair staff for
engineering the geological mapping of Western Siberia
were distinguished by the Lomonosov Award of MSU
(1st rank) in 1975, and three major participants:
Sergeev, Gerasimova, and Trofimov, were honored with the
rank of laureates of this award. In 1998, E.A.
Voznesenskii became the laureate of the Shuvalov Award of
MSU (2nd rank), which is given to young scientists, for
his monograph Soil Behavior under Dynamic Impact
(published in 1997).</p>
      <p>The scientific activity of the school was highly
appreciated by the geological community, when
Sergeev was elected Academician of the AN USSR,
Osipov, an Academician of the RAS, V.T. Trofimov, an
academician of the RANS and IAS HS, Yu.K. Vasil’chuk
an academician of the RANS, and Voznesenskii,
Voronkevich, and Korolev, as corresponding members
of the RANS.</p>
      <p>The scientific activities of professor S.D. Voronkevich
and assistant professor E.A. Voznesenskii received
international acknowledgment: they were elected as
members of the New York Academy of Sciences in
1996. Sergeev was an honorary doctor of the Bratislava
(1972) and Warsaw (1974) Universities, and was
awarded Hans Cloos Medal (IAEG).</p>
      <p>The scientific and teaching activity of the Chair’s
professors was widely recognized. S.S. Morozov
(1967), Popov (1969), Zolotarev, Golodkovskaya
(1992), and Trofimov (1998) were each conferred the
rank of “Honored Scientific Worker of the Russian
Federation.” In 1997, the Scientific Council of Moscow
University awarded the rank of “Honored Professor of
MSU” to Golodkovskaya, and the year before that, to
Zolotarev. In 1998, this rank was conferred on
Trofimov, and in 2002, he won the Lomonosov Prize of
MSU for his teaching activities.</p>
      <p>The developmental history of ecological geology at
the Moscow University covers a very short period.
Only after 1990 the Chair members started to study in
this principally new aspect of geological science, which
investigates the ecological functions of the lithosphere,
patterns in their formation and spaciotemporal changes
under the effects of natural and technogenic conditions
due to the activities of the biota, and first of all, of
humans. Within three years, the first series of fundamental
studies was published, and in 1997, the monograph
“Theory and Methodology of Ecological Geology.”</p>
      <p>The results of the study of the Chair members in the
field of ecological geology can by briefly described as
follows:</p>
      <p>(1) the theoretical and methodological principles of
ecological geology as a new aspect of modern geology
were elaborated;</p>
      <p>(2) a curriculum of the new specialty “Ecological
geology” was elaborated, and a number of classical
Universities in Russia follow it in their training of
Bachelors, Specialists, and Masters; the geological
faculty of MSU first accepted students pursuing this
specialty in 1994; in 2000, the RF Ministry of Education
approved the State Educational Standard (SES) of
specialty 013300, Ecological geology;</p>
      <p>(3) in 1996, the first special structure in the world
was organized that is professionally engaged in a new
aspect of geology; this was the Laboratory of
Ecological Geology, and in 1998 its Chair was organized, in
whose name the words ecological geology were
present;</p>
      <p>(4) the syllabi of subjects concerning ecological
geology provided by the State Educational Standard
(SES) for the specialty “Ecological geology” were
prepared and teaching manuals on many of them were
published, including the first textbook on Ecological
Geology” (2002, authors Trofimov and D.G. Ziling) in the
world;</p>
      <p>(5) the Chair organized and actively participated in
three international scientific conferences Ecological
geology and the Rational Use of Subsoil (1997, 2000,
and 2003), and also the first (2000) through eighth
(2007) Interuniversity conferences of young scientists
The School of Ecological Geology and Rational Use of
Subsoil.</p>
      <p>The scientific and educational activity of the staff in
the field of ecological geology has already received
wide acknowledgment, both in our country and abroad.
V.T. Trofimov, D.G. Ziling, and M.B. Kurinov were
awarded the 1st rank prize of the Moscow Society of
Nature Explorers for their monograph Theory and
Methodology of Ecological Geology (1997). This was
also expressed in that the development of SES standard
curricula and syllabi was performed within the
framework of the educational methodic council headed by
professors of the geology faculty of MSU.</p>

      <title>OF THE CHAIR OF ENGINEERING</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="3">
      <title>AND ECOLOGICAL GEOLOGY</title>
      <p>The present Chair structure was developed in 1996.
It consists of teaching and support staff and four
scientific laboratories: (1) soil science and technical
melioration of soils; (2) engineering geodynamics and
substantiation of engineering protection of territories;
(3) regional engineering geology and rational use of the
geological environment; and (4) ecological geology.
This structure has remained unchanged for the last ten
years. In contrast, the Chair staff has considerably
changed. During this period, associate professor
B.A. Snezhkin, part-time professor Ziangirov (2006),
and researchers A.V. Anikeev (2001), D.A. Spiridonov
(2001), and I.K. Fomenko (2004) left the Chair; since
the beginning of the 2000–2001 academic year, Osipov
no longer works as a professor. Leading research
workers Gerasimova, Ziling, Kolomenskii, Z.A.
Krivosheeva, and associate professor E.N. Ogorodnikova retired.
The oldest professor of the Chair, G.S. Zolotarev,
passed away in June 2006 (1914–2006). E.N.
Voznesenskii was elected a professor of the Chair (2000),
T.I. Averkina, M.B. Kurinov, S.K. Nikolaeva, V.N.
Shirokov, E.N. Samarin, and I.Yu. Grigor’eva were elected
associate professors, and A.V. Bershov, an assistant.
The scientific and engineering staff of the Chair has
been largely renewed recently, because former
postgraduates came to study here.</p>
      <p>The teaching staff included 14 lecturers, 11 support
workers, and 33 researchers by 2008. At that time the
deputy heads of the Chair were: general deputy
Professor Voznesenskii (from 2002), scientific study deputy
senior researcher V.G. Shlykov (to the middle of 1999),
associate professor I.Yu. Grigor’eva (from 1999), and
senior researcher T.V. Andreeva (2006–2007) during
her business trip abroad; Voznesenskii (till May 2002)
and S.K. Nikolaeva (from 2002) were scientific
secretaries of the Chair.</p>
      <p>The teaching staff includes 5 professors (Trofimov,
Voznesenskii, G.A. Golodkovskaya, E.V. Kalinin, and
V.A. Korolev), 6 associate professors (Averkina,
I.Yu. Grigor’eva, Kurinov, Nikolaeva, Samarin, and
Shirokov), and an assistant (Bershov). Moreover, in
2007 senior research workers T.V. Andreeva and
Yu.V. Frolova occupied the posts of associate
professors. The teaching support staff of the Chair that
organized and helped in the teaching process consisted of
11 workers: leading engineer M.V. Flamina, 1st
category engineers N.P. Bol’shakova, O.I. Golubtsova,
T.Yu. Merkulova, V.V. Vshivtseva, and I.Yu. Silina,
2nd category engineers M.V. Kopteva–Dvornikova,
1st category technical workers L.P. Tereshkova and
E.A. Makarova, 2nd category technical worker
M.M. Vorob’eva, and technical worker A.A. Zhuravleva.</p>
      <p>During the last decade, considerable changes also
took place in the scientific staff of the Chair.
V.N. Sokolov became the Head of the Laboratory of
soil science and technical melioration, Ziling was the
alternate Head of the Laboratory of ecological geology
(until 2004), and Yu.K. Vasil’chuk became the Head of
the Laboratory of regional engineering geology. During
this period, T.V. Andreeva, S.D. Balykova, T.A.
Baraboshkina, A.V. Ershova, N.A. Larionova, L.L. Panas’yan,
Yu.V. Frolova, M.A. Khar’kina, D.I. Yurkovets,
V.V. Funikova et al. were elected senior researchers of
the Chair. Also the staff of engineers and technical
workers changed.</p>
      <p>The body of the laboratory of soil science and
technical melioration of soils consists currently of
16 employees: Trofimov, scientific supervisor; Sokolov,
Head of the Laboratory; senior researchers V.M.
Ladygin, N.A. Larionova, L.L. Panas’yan, V.V. Funikova,
D.I. Yurkovets1, and V.V. Krupskaya1; research worker

special devices G.M. Churakov, E.N. Dobrolyubov1, and
K.V. Bernard1.</p>
      <p>Professor E.V. Kalinin is the scientific supervisor
and the alternate head of the Laboratory of engineering
geodynamics. This Laboratory consists of senior
researcher O.S. Barykina, research worker N.B.
Artamonova, leading engineer I.P. Gvozdeva, 1st category
engineers N.V. Yurkovets (Kuznetsova) and E.S.
Kushnareva1.</p>
      <p>The laboratory of regional engineering geology has
7 employees: Yu.K. Vasil’chuk, Head of the Laboratory,
senior researchers N.S. Krasilova, S.D. Balykova,
A.V. Ershova, research worker N.A. Budantseva, 1st
category engineer E.O. Golovina1, and 2nd category
engineer G.I. Maslova. Professor Trofimov is the
scientific supervisor of the Laboratory.</p>
      <p>The laboratory of ecological geology consists of
5 employees: senior researchers M.A. Khar’kina and
T.A. Baraboshkina1, leading researcher A.D. Zhigalin1,
research worker L.A. Tsukanova, and leading engineer
N.D. Khachinskaya. Professor V.T. Trofimov is the
scientific supervisor of the Laboratory.</p>
      <p>The Chair staff closely collaborates with the faculty
scientific research laboratory investigating the
influence of geological factors on the physicochemical
solidification of soils. The largest part of this laboratory
consists of graduates or former employees of the Chair.
This laboratory has been headed by professor
Voznesenskii since 2006, who was appointed deputy dean of
the Geological Faculty in 2007. At present, the staff of
this laboratory consists of 10 members. It includes
senior researchers S.D. Voronkevich1, L.V.
Goncharova, T.T. Abramova, T.G. Makeeva, V.I. Baranova,
and V.I. Divisilova, leading engineers V.M. Fedorov,
K.E. Valieva, and E.A. Fedyaeva, and engineer
P.A. Yavlyaev.</p>
      <p>All in all, during this period the Chair staff ranged
between 66 and 58 specialists, among them 7 doctors
and 25 candidates of sciences, 6 laureates of the USSR
State Prize (Gerasimova, Golodkovskaya, Ziangirov,
Zolotarev, Osipov, and Trofimov), a laureate of the
State Prize of Russia (Trofimov), and 2 laureates of the
1st rank Lomonosov Prize (Gerasimova and Trofimov).</p>

      <p>The main objective of the Chair was and still is the
preparation of high-skilled specialists in the framework
of two specialties: Hydrogeology and Engineering
Geology and Ecological Geology, and also candidates
of sciences through post-graduate study and from
young employees. The joint annual loading of the Chair
lecturers increased and changed within a range from
11300 to 11700 h. The total number of lecture courses
delivered by the Chair staff reached 53, 5 of which are
accompanied by extensive laboratory courses. The
Chair lecturers not only teach students pursuing the
above specialties, but also deliver lectures on subjects
of Engineering geology, Ecological geology, and
Geoecology to the students of other specialties of the
geological faculty, and the Soil science course to students
of the Chair of cryolithology and glaciology and the Chair
of physical geography of the Geographical faculty.</p>
      <p>During the decade in question, the Chair
participated in the multilevel preparation of students in the
specialization “Geology,” a new specialization in the
natural science block in the list of higher education
specializations given by classical universities of Russia. In
accordance with this approach, the first four years of
education within the framework of each professional
orientation (corresponding to common specialties) are
absolutely similar in their content and volume.
Students, having completed the four-year syllabus, receive
a Bachelor’s degree in geology and may continue their
education to get a Master’s degree (admission is
competitive, 5–6th year of education) or a Specialist (5th year).
Altogether in the years from 1998 to 2007, the Chair
prepared 178 people in higher education: 119
Specialists, 51 Masters (3 of these were from China), and</p>
      <sec id="7-1">
        <title>8 Bachelors (6 from China).</title>
        <p>The preparation of students in the context of the
specialty Hydrogeology and engineering geology was
realized through the specialties Engineering geology, Soil
science and artificial lithogenesis, and Protection of the
geological environment. The first of these was
successfully acquired by 69 people; the second, by 2, and the
third, by 25 persons; these each received a Specialist’s
degree. The program Engineering geology was finished
by 25 Masters, and 8 people got a Master’s degree in
Soil science and artificial lithogenesis.</p>
        <p>Note that since the 2000–2001 academic year,
education is occurring according to a new curriculum in
compliance with the State Educational Standard for
specialty 011400: Hydrogeology and engineering
geology. This caused the need to develop a series of new
courses and revise previous ones. The curricula of all
specialties were renovated with regard to the
requirements of the SES in force. All these methodical
considerations were included in collected volumes regularly
published by the geological faculty of MSU. In 2000
the Curricula and Syllabi and Educational and
Practical Training were published, and in 2002 Graduate
Studies and State Examination. In 2004, a revised and
corrected edition of Curricula and Syllabi and
Specializations and Master’s Programs were published, which
included curricula and programs of the courses of “the
right side” along with abstracts of subjects of
specializations and Master’s programs on engineering geology
delivered by the Chair.</p>
        <p>The preparation of students in the Bachelor’s
program in the Ecological geology specialty was started by
the geological faculty in 1994 and in the Master’s
program, in 1998. However, specialty 013300, Ecological
geology, as an experimental specialty was organized at
MSU by the order of the RF Ministry of Education only
in October 1999. In 2000, the State Educational
Standard of specialty Ecological geology 013300 was
approved for the first time. It was elaborated mainly by
members of the Geological Faculty and adjusted with
standards of other geological specialties in
humanitarian and natural science disciplines, differing in a larger
number of hours for biological and chemical courses.
In respect to common professional subjects, the SES of
the specialty Ecological geology comprised 17 courses
compulsory for all geological specialties (including
Ecological geology) and 13 new courses absent in the
curricula of other specialties. Among them are:
“Fundamentals of geoecology,” “Landscape science,” “Soil
science,” “Meteorology and hydrology,” “Ecological
geodynamics,” “Ecological hydrogeology and
hydrochemistry,” “Ecological geochemistry,” “Ecological
expertise,” “Industrial Ecology,” “Human ecology
(medical aspects),” “Legal foundations of the use of
subsoil and protection of subsurface resources,”
“Economics of nature management,” and “Principles of
ecological geological exploration.”</p>
        <p>A set of syllabus projects for the specialty (differing
from the syllabi in Bachelors’ preparation of the
specialization Geology) was presented to the Ministry of
Education and approved in 2000. The syllabi of special
disciplines were revised based on the teaching
experience at MSU and SPbSU (St. Petersb. State Univ.) and
reapproved by the Ministry of Education in 2002.
Among the authors of syllabi and curricula are many
lecturers of the Chair of engineering and ecological
geology. These methodical elaborations were published
in the form of an abstract in the mentioned SES and
collected issues of the geological faculty of MSU.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, 23 people with a Specialist’s
degree in ecogeology graduated from the Chair. Fifteen
students successfully received a Master’s degree.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the Chair staff elaborated a syllabus of
a refresher course Engineering and ecological geology
of oil and gas basins, and also the syllabus and
curriculum of the innovative Master’s project Ecological
geology of territories disturbed techogenically (TDT)
in the context of the program Formation of the system
of innovative education at Lomonosov MSU. In the
framework of this project, the Chair staff has developed
syllabi for new disciplines: Ecological geology of TDT,
Patterns in the formation of ecological functions of the
lithosphere, Estimation of changes in the ecological
geological conditions under technogenic impact,
Riskanalysis of technocratically developed territories,
Ecological geological mapping of TDT, Ecological
geodynamics of TDT, Problems in predicting changes in the
geological environment in the TDT limits, Geological
factors of ecological risk, Ecological geological
conditions of Russia, Physicochemical methods of
investigating the components of ecological geological systems
and ecological interpretation of results, Geochemical
factors of ecological risk and microelements, and
Contamination of TDT soils and their purification.</p>
        <p>During the period from 1996 to 2006, 40 persons
entered the post-graduate degree course of the Chair. It
was completed by 15 people, and 13 of them
successfully defended candidate dissertations. Moreover,
candidate dissertations were defended by 2 members of the
Chair and one attached to the post-graduate degree
course.</p>
        <p>During this period, a number of textbooks and
teaching manuals were published: textbooks by
Trofimov and Ziling Ecological geology (2002), Kalinin
Engineering geological calculations and simulation
(2006), Soil science (6th edition, Trofimov, Korolev,
Voznesenskii, Golodkovskaya, Vasil’chuk, Ziangirov,

        <p>RESULTS OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES IN 1998–2007</p>
        <p>From 1998 to 2000, the scientific research study of
the Chair was carried out in two aspects, the Theory of
formation of engineering geological conditions of the
Earth and their evolution in the epoch of technogenesis
and Development of theoretical principles of the
doctrine on ecological functions of the lithosphere. In the
context of the first aspect, 12 themes were developed,
and 2 themes of the second were developed as well
[Trofimov, 1998]. Eight themes were reported; there
were publications, including monographic ones.</p>
        <p>The study on classifying the Earth’s engineering
geological structural features resulted in the publishing
of the monograph Engineering Geological Structures
of the Earth (authors Trofimov, Averkina, Spiridonov,
2001). The monograph Engineering Geology and
Ecological Geology—Theoretical Methodological
Principles and Interrelation (1999) finished the development
of the eponymous theme by Trofimov and Ziling. The
books “Genesis of Loess Soil Subsidence” (Trofimov,
1999) and “Loess Cover on the Earth and Its
Properties” (2001) are the results of the development made by
Trofimov, Andreeva, Balykova, and Ershova of the
theme Loess Cover on the Earth and Its Engineering
Geological Peculiarities. The monograph “Ecological
functions of the lithosphere” (Trofimov, Ziling,
Baraboshkina, Bogoslovskii, Zhigalin, Khar’kina, et al.,
2000) was written in the course of elaborating the
theme Developing the Theoretical Foundations of the
Doctrine of Ecological Functions of the Lithosphere.
The generalization of the theme Artificial soils as a
techogenic product permitted the teaching manual
Technogenic Soils (Ogorodnikova and Nikolaeva,
2004) to be written and later published.</p>
        <p>On other themes, articles were written and reports
made at conferences of different levels. Among them
are: Theoretical and Methodical Principles of
Modeling and Predicting the Properties of Binder Soils Based
on Their Mineral Structural and Thermodynamic
Indices. Development of Fundamental Principles of
Modeling and Predicting Behavior of Clay Soils in the
Technogenic Zone for Optimization of Exploration and
Solution of Ecological Problems (Korolev, Sokolov,
Shlykov, et al.); Patterns in the Formation of
Engineering Geological Properties of Volcanic Rocks in
Different Tectonic Structures of the Earth (Golodkovskaya,
Ladygin, Frolova, et al.); Investigation of Time Effects
of Deformation and Destruction of Soils under Variable
Loads, finished by publishing a monograph Dynamic
Instability of Soils (Voznesenskii, 1999); Development
of Methods for Probability Simulation of Engineering
Geological Processes Based on Cell Automates
(Kolomenskii, Kharitonov, et al.); Patterns and the
Mechanism of Slope and Accompanying Processes.
Development of Standard Engineering Geological Models and
Geomechanical Schemes as a Basis for Predicting and
Substantiating Engineering Protection (Zolotarev,
Kalinin, Anikeev, et al.); Role of the Deformation Mode
(DM) of Rocks in the Formation of Geological
Processes. Exploration of DM of Rock Masses by
Mathematical and Experimental Methods (Kalinin,
Panas’yan, and Shirokov); Development History of
Engineering Geology (Zolotarev and Gerasimova);
Theoretical issues in the Evolution Problem of
Engineering Geological Conditions of the Earth during the
Technogenic Epoch (Trofimov, Kurinov, Spiridonov,
et al.); Study of Historical Geological Patterns in
Formation of Engineering Geological Peculiarities of Rock
Masses with Thick Ice Wedges (Yu.K. Vasil’chuk).</p>
        <p>During this period, the researchers and lecturers of
the Chair actively carried out, along with state budget
themes, scientific studies and projects supported by
grants received on a competitive basis from various
foundations (RFBR, FSP “Integration,” RF Ministry of
Science and Education, program “Universities of
Russia,” INTAS, Institute for Sustainable Communities,
etc.). Thus, RFBR grants supported the following
themes: “Time effects of deformation and destruction
of soils” (supervisor Voznesenskii), “Classification of
engineering geological structures of the Earth and their
characteristic” (Trofimov), “Logical and actual
diversity of engineering geological structures of the Earth”
(Trofimov), “Fundamentals of modeling the properties
of argillaceous rocks of subaqueous origin” (Sokolov),
“Investigation of the mineral composition effect on the
formation of corrosion properties of argillaceous
rocks” (L.A. Tsukanova), “Study of formation
mechanism of syngenetic subsidence of eolian loess rocks”
(Andreeva).</p>
        <p>The themes of the performed studies supported by
the program “Fundamental Studies of Higher Schools.
Universities of Russia” grants were also very diverse.
They were as follows: “Composition, structure,
properties, and patterns of clay mineral transformation under
different conditions of dia- and epigenesis”
(Voznesenskii); “Ecological functions of the lithosphere”
(Trofimov); “Functional analysis of ecological geological
systems: methodology, methods, exploration
experience” (Golodkovskaya); “Development of
unconventional principles and methods of prevention and
elimination of technogenic impact (damage, destruction, and
pollution) on mountain range rocks” (Voronkevich);
“Ecological geological maps: their content, themes,
and assignment” (Ziling); “Simulation of dynamics and
evolution of engineering geological conditions during
the technogenic epoch” (Spiridonov). E.A.
Voznesenskii performed the studies “Extended energy approach
in the dynamics of soils” supported by the INTAS grant
and “Low-cost reduction of the environment pollution
at exploiting oil and gas fields” supported by the
Institute for Sustainable Communities grant.</p>
        <p>Contract studies were developing as well. From
1996 to 1998, they were carried out along with the
Ministry of Natural Resources of Russia on the theme
“Theoretical fundamentals of ecological geology” and on
the theme “Content and methods for next generation
ecological geological mapping,” in 1999. In 1998, the
studies on the theme “Estimation of landslide slope
stability within the limits of Zagorsk SAPP constructions
during the initial period of exploitation” were finished.
In 1999, studies were performed within the framework
of the new contract “Estimation of the influence of
engineering geological characteristics of soil masses on
the landslide slope stability within the limits of Zagorsk
SAPP constructions under conditions of the
reconstructed drainage barrier.”</p>
        <p>In 2000, the Chair accepted a new state budget
theme for five years (2000–2005) for implementation.
Three themes were worked out at the Laboratory of soil
science and technical melioration: “Petrogenetic
patterns in the formation of rock properties (by the
example of effusive and carbonate rocks)” (scientific
supervisor Golodkovskaya); “Simulation and prediction of
the deformation and destruction of soils under variable
loads” (Voznesenskii); and “Study of patterns in the
formation of properties of clay soils as components of
engineering geological and ecological geological
systems” (Korolev). The developments made in the
context of the latter were generalized by Korolev in his
monograph Purification of Polluted Soils (2001).</p>
        <p>Studies were carried out at the Laboratory of
geodynamics and substantiation of engineering protection of
territories on the theme “Patterns in the formation,
simulation, and prediction of downwarping and subsidence
of the Earth’s crust in karst areas” (scientific supervisor
Kalinin). Based on the obtained data and also on
materials of previous developments, they wrote and
published the book Simulation of Stress Fields in
Engineering Geological Masses (authors: Kalinin, Panas’yan,
Shirokov, Artamonova, and Fomenko, 2003).</p>
        <p>Investigations were performed at the Laboratory of
regional engineering geology and rational use of the
geological environment under guidance of Trofimov on
three themes: “Theory and methodology of current
regional engineering geology,” “Patterns in formation
and spatial distribution of collapsible loess rocks of
Northeastern Eurasia,” and “Engineering geological
maps.” The results of these studies were presented in
monographs Theoretical Fundamentals of Regional
Engineering Geology (Trofimov and Averkina, 2007),
Key Engineering Geological Sections of Loess Rocks of
Northeastern Eurasia (Trofimov, Andreeva, Balykova,
Ershova, and Ya.E. Shaevich, 2008), and the teaching
manual Engineering Geological Maps (Trofimov and
Krasilova, 2007),</p>
        <p>Two themes were elaborated under the guidance of
Yu.K. Vasil’chuk: “Historical geological patterns in
formation of engineering geological peculiarities of
rock masses with syngenetic ice wedges during the
Late Pleistocene and Holocene” and “Historical
geological patterns in formation of engineering geological
peculiarities of rock masses of convex-hilly peat bogs
during the Holocene.” The result of studies on the
former was Vasil’chuk’s monograph Ice Wedges:
Heterocyclicity, Heterochrony, Heterogeneity (2006).</p>
        <p>At the Laboratory of ecological geology, studies
were carried out in the framework of two themes:
“Development of theoretical fundamentals of the
doctrine on ecological functions of the lithosphere” and
“Analysis of the current state and development of
fundamentals of ecological geological mapping.” In the
context of the former, after the monograph Ecological
Functions of the Lithosphere (2000), the teaching
manual Transformation of Ecological Functions of the
Lithosphere during the Technogenic Epoch was
published in 2006 (Trofimov, Ziling, Baraboshkina,
Zhigalin, and Khar’kina). The results of the development of
the latter theme and also a contract study with the
Russian Research Institute of Hydrogeology and
Engineering Geology (VSEGINGEO) can be found in the
brochure Logic and Content of a Map of the Current State
of the Upper Horizon of the Earth’s Crust as a Factual
Base for Ecological Geological Mapping (Trofimov,
Ziling, Baraboshkina, Bogoslovskii, Zhigalin,
Krasilova, and Khar’kina, 2004) and two editions of the
teaching manual “Ecological Geological Maps”
(Trofimov, Ziling, Baraboshkina, Khar’kina, and Zhigalin,
2002, 2007).</p>
        <p>From 2001 to 2005, the number of grants that
supported the studies performed by the Chair staff
increased to 14. Let us name some of these studies:
“Time effects of the deformation and destruction of
soils” (supervisor Voznesenskii), “Patterns in the
formation of engineering geological properties of
volcanogenic soils in the lithification process” (Frolova),
“Organization and performance of complex
expeditionary studies in the Kamchatka and Karelia regions in
order to study the formation and the nature of magmatic
rock properties” (Ladygin), and “Development of a
new strategy of radiocarbon dating the Late Pleistocene
and Holocene sediments and underground ice by
accelerator mass-spectrometry and the refinement of
chronology of main paleogeographic events in the North of
Russia” (Vasil’chuk). Furthermore, 4 grants were received
by young scientists (N.A. Budantseva, E.B. Kudryashova,
V.V. Funikova, and Yu.N. Chizhova).</p>
        <p>The number of studies under economic agreements
increased to 24. The composition of tailings for a
number of concentration plants at Aihalsk, Komsomol’sk,
and Nyurbinsk diamond deposits and their effect on the
consolidation of tailings were investigated (supervisor
Korolev). The studies on the theme “Logic and content
of the map of the current state of the geological
environment as a factual base for ecological geological
mapping” by the contract with VSEGINGEO were
carried out by members of the Laboratory of ecological
geology; 14 contracts on the study of engineering
geological and ecological geological conditions of
concrete objects in different parts of the country (European
part, West Siberia, Kuznetsk Basin, Sakhalin, etc.) and
foreign countries (Moldavia) were performed under
guidance of E.A. Voznesenskii.</p>
        <p>The growth in the number of studies under
economic agreements was promoted the certification of
the Chair Laboratory of soil science and technical
melioration of soils for technical competence in
testing soils of natural sedimentation, as well as soils and
technogenic soils (including strengthened), and also in
analyzing the composition and properties of underground
and surface waters, which occurred in March 2005. The
correspondence to main requirements of the GOST RISO
MEK 17025 for testing laboratories was confirmed by
the attestation certificate No. 300.089. This extended
opportunities to the Chair for attracting off-budget
studies under customers’ contracts, and also it provided
the laboratory with modern automatic devices for
determination of physic and mechanical properties of soils.</p>
        <p>In 2006, the Chair accepted a new five-year
statebudget scientific target for investigations:
“Investigation of diversity of engineering geological and
ecological geological conditions of Russia as a requisite for
substantiation of rational use of subsoil.” Its main item
was creation of a monograph Engineering Geology of
Russia (scientific supervisor Trofimov). It consisted of
three volumes: Soils of Russia, Engineering
Geodynamics of Russia, and Engineering Geological
Structures of Russia. All lecturers and researchers of all the
scientific laboratories of the Chair take part in its creation.</p>
        <p>Development of the above scientific problem is
facilitated by investigations in the context of the project
“Diversity of soils in Russia and innovations in
managing their state and properties” (scientific supervisor
Trofimov, executive in charge Voznesenskii). The
entitlement for this project was won in a competition held
by the departmental target program “Development of
the scientific potential of higher schools (2006–2008).”</p>
        <p>The theme “Ecological geological conditions of
Russia” is currently worked out at the Laboratory of
ecological geology in the framework of this problem.
The creation of the eponymous monograph is supposed
in the issue, which must include a series of original
ecological geological maps as an essential component.</p>
        <p>Two more principally new themes are being
elaborated at the Laboratory of soil science and technical
melioration of soils owing to purchase of new
expensive scientific equipment: “Micro- and nanostructure of
natural and artificial soils: the role of different phases in
its formation” (executive in charge Sokolov) and
“Investigation of the nature and patterns of stress wave
attenuations in soils” (Voznesenskii).</p>
        <p>This state budget theme of the Chair was backed by
development of related themes in the framework of
RFBR grants and studies under economic agreements.
Thus, in 2006 the studies supported by RFBR grants
were performed on the themes “Time effects in
deformation and destruction of soils” (supervisor Voznesenskii,
executives Funikova, Samarin, Bershov, Kushnareva,
P.A. Yavlyaev, F.A. Provorov, D.V. Lagonskaya, and
M.L. Chernysheva), “Paleosoils and pedosystems of
the Permian, Triassic, and Pleistocene: comparative
morphostructural analysis, reconstruction of
paleopedogenesis and paleolandscape conditions” (Sokolov),
“Paleogeographic and paleoclimatic reconstructions of
Russian Arctic Zone based on correlation of isotopic
diagrams dated by radiocarbon of the late Pleistocene
and Holocene ice wedges with isotopic curves of
Greenland” (supervisor Vasil’chuk, executives N.A.
Budantseva, Yu.N. Chizhova, and A.A. Zhuravleva).</p>
        <p>In recent years, the number of studies under the
economic agreement increased, especially at the
Laboratory of soil science. In 2006, the studies on the
following themes were carried out: “Development of new
methods for estimation of dynamic stability of roadbed
soils” (Voznesenskii, Funikova, Samarin, Bershov,
Kushnareva, F.A. Provorov, and D.V. Lagonskaya);
“Estimation of behavior of soils at the building site for
the expected dislocation of a MFFF-R plant under
dynamic loads” (Voznesenskii); “Expertise of a report
on exploration of open pits of commonly occurring
mineral resources in GP-4, GP-5, and GP-9 regions of
Medvezhye field” (Voznesenskii, Kalinin, Shirokov,
Samarin, and Bershov); “Exploration, certification,
projection of development and recultivation of open
pits of commonly occurring mineral resources based on
novel technological solutions in the regions of
Nerutinsk, West Yagenetsk, West Jubilee, Mariettinsk,
South Padinsk areas” (Voznesenskii, Kalinin, Shirokov,
Samarin, and Bershov); “Laboratory investigations of
composition and properties of argillaceous, hard rock,
and semi-rock soils of the Plesetsk bauxite deposit”
(Voznesenskii, Ladygin, Panas’yan, Frolova, Shlykov,
V.D. Kharitonov, and Bershov); “Monitoring of the
ecological situation within experimental ground
region” (Voznesenskii, Samarin, and Bershov).</p>
        <p>Closing this section, I’d like to note that in the last
decade publications of the Chair members were
supported by RFBR publishing grants: Voznesenskii
Dynamic Instability of Soils (Publishing House
Editorial URSS, 1999); Korolev Purification of Polluted
Soils (Publishing House MAIK
“Nauka/Interperiodika,” 2001); Grigor’eva Microstructure of Loess
Rocks (Publishing House MAIK
“Nauka/Interperiodika,” 2001); Trofimov Subsidence Formation Theory
of Loess Rocks (Publishing House GEOS, 2003);
Trofimov and Averkina Theoretical Fundamentals of
Regional Engineering Geology (Publishing House
GEOS, 2007). The publishing grant of the federal target
program “State support for the integration of higher
education and fundamental science in 1997–2000” was
given to a monograph by Vasil’chuk and Kotlyakov
Principles of Isotopic Geocryology and Glaciology
(Publishing House of Moscow University, 2000), and a
grant of the federal target program “Integration of
science and higher education of Russia in 2002–2006”
was received for a monograph by Vasil’chuk Ice
Wedges: Heterocyclicity, Heterochrony, Heterogeneity
(Publishing House of Moscow University, 2006).</p>

      <title>OF THE CHAIR MEMBERS</title>
      <p>Since 1998, the Chair has organized and held
9 international scientific conferences on various
problems, including the most topical ones, of engineering
and ecological geology at the geological faculty of
Lomonosov MSU. Let us give the titles of these
conferences. They are: “Genesis and models for formation of
soil properties” (May 1998); “Theoretical problems of
engineering geology” (May 25–26, 1999); “20th
Century: figures and schools in engineering geology” (May
2000); “Novel types of engineering geological and
ecological geological maps” (May 2001); “Petrogenetic,
historical geological, and spatial problems in
engineering geology” (May 28–29, 2002); “Diversity of soils:
morphology, causes, and consequences” (May 27–28,
2003); “Engineering geology of masses of loess rocks”
(May 25–26, 2004); “Problems in engineering
geodynamics and ecological geodynamics” (February 2–3,
2006); “Monitoring of geological, lithotechnical, and
ecological geological systems” (May 24–25, 2007).</p>
      <p>The Chair staff actively participated in the
organization of Sergeev’s Readings. In the context of these
readings, the memorial portion of the program was held at
the geological faculty. Here the Chair members and
guests made reports on the importance of E.M.
Sergeev’s studies and their further development and shared
their memoirs about him. Six such sessions were held.</p>
      <p>The tradition of MSU school of engineering
geologists participating in the study of scientific
organizational have also been continued in the field of
ecological geology. The Chair staff took active part in the
organization of the first (1997), second (2001) and third
(2003) International conferences “Ecological Geology
and Rational Use of the Subsoil” along with the first
(2000) through the eighth (2007) inter–university
conferences of young scientists “The School of Ecological
Geology and Rational Use of the Subsoil.” Chair
members made general reports and lectures and leading
reports on many themes.</p>
      <p>In the last decade, the system of higher education
and economics in the country, and engineering geology,
and ecological geology at the Moscow University have
been developing in a positive direction despite all the
difficulties in the current state of science, thus
determining in many respects their development in the
country as a whole. The school of engineering geologists of
Moscow University has remained as the leading school
in Russia that successfully solves many problems of
engineering geology and higher professional
engineering geological education.</p>
      <p>During the same period, the Chair staff elaborated
the theoretical and methodological principles of
ecological geology as a new aspect of geological science.
Together with the members of other chairs of the
geological faculty, they established an essential foundation for
higher ecological geological education in our country.
