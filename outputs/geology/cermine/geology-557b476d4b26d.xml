        <p>Pingxiang Mining Area in Jiangxi Province is one of the major coal-producing areas and is prone to serious coal and gas outburst, therefore, it is of significance to research on gas geological features and its controlling factors. Based on the analysis of gas data collected from geological exploration and coal mining, the research reveals that the features of gas geology vary significantly between west part and east part of Pingxiang Mining Area, and it is characterized by high gas mines with serious coal and gas outburst in the west part and low gas mines with no coal and gas outburst in the east part. The main controlling factors to gas geology are discussed, and the great difference of gas geology between west part and east part is the result of comprehensive effect by geological factors. Concerning the gas generation, the coal rank in the west part is higher than that in the east part, which is favorable to generate more gas in the west part than in the east part. Concerning the gas preservation, the structures are characterized by gliding nappe in the west part and by tectonic window in the east part, the surrounding rocks are characterized by poor permeability in the west part and comparatively good permeability in the east part, and the characteristics of coal rank and coal body structure are favorable to gas preservation in the west part and favorable to gas emission in the east part.

      <p>Pingxiang Mining Area is located in the central part
of Pingxiang City of Jiangxi Province. The
east-towest length is about 25 km, while the north-to-south
width is about 10 km, and the coal-bearing area is</p>

      <title>about 250 km2 (Fig.1). Pingxiang Mining Area is one</title>
      <p>of the major coal-producing areas in Jiangxi Province
(Tan et al., 2009). From west to east, there are five
major coal mines in Pingxiang Mining Area named
Juyuan Coal Mine, Qingshan Coal Mine, Baiyuan
Coal Mine, Anyuan Coal Mine, and Gaokeng Coal
Mine. Pingxiang Mining Area is very serious in coal
and gas outburst (Xie et al., 2001; Chen and Wang,

      <p>The features of gas geology are significantly
different between west part and east part in Pingxiang
Mining Area, and the features are introduced respectively.</p>
      <sec id="3-1">
        <title>2.1 Gas geology’s features in the west part</title>
        <p>There are five representative coal mines in the west
part of Pingxiang Mining Area. Juyuan Coal Mine and
Qingshan Coal Mine are two state-owned coal
enterprises, while Shangguanling Coal Mine, Jiaobao Coal
Mine, and Santian Coal Mine are three local
state-owned coal enterprises. The gas geology of these

outburst. Until present, there are 21 coal and gas outbursts
happened, the mean value of outburst coal is 57.7 t,
the maximum value of outburst coal is 420 t, and the

contents are high, ranging from 7.33 to 18.31 m3/t,
aver3
aging 13.32 m /t corresponding to the buried depth
from 213 to 886 m. Gas contents from the testing
during the period of coal mining are also high, ranging
from 7.82 to 24.63 m3/t, averaging 13.00 m3/t. The
information from Identification of Classification of
Gaseous Mine reveals that the relative gas emission

maximum value of outburst gas is 39 200 m .</p>
      <p>For Shangguanling Coal Mine, the information from

      <p>For Santian Coal Mine, the relative gas emission
rate of coal mine is 13.64 m3/t. There are eight coal
and gas outbursts happened and the maximum value of
outburst coal is 14 t, and Santian Coal Mine is a high
gas mine with coal and gas outburst.</p>
      <sec id="7-1">
        <title>2.2 Gas geology’s features in the east part</title>
        <p>There are eight representative coal mines in the east
part of Pingxiang Mining Area. Baiyuan Coal Mine,
Anyuan Coal Mine, and Gaokeng Coal Mine are three
state-owned coal enterprises, while Wangkeng, Wupi,
Hongqi, Panjiachong, and Yuejin coal mines are five
local state-owned coal enterprises. The gas geology of
these coal mines is featured by low gas coal mine with
no coal and gas outburst. The gas information is
briefly given here.</p>
        <p>The gas contents from the testing during the period
of coal mining are very low (Table 2). The information
from Identification of Classification of Gaseous Mine
reveals that all these eight coal mines are low gas
mines (Table 3).</p>
        <p>From the above, in Pingxiang Mining Area, there
are significant differences between high gas area of
west part and low gas area of east part. The main
controlling factors of gas geology are discussed here.

        <title>3.1 About the gas generation</title>
        <p>In the west part, the coal ranks are high, and most of
them are high-rank bituminous or anthracite, slim coal
or meager coal for Juyuan Coal Mine, meager coal for
Shangguanling Coal Mine, and anthracite for
Qingshan Coal Mine, Jiaobao Coal Mine, and Santian Coal
Mine. But in the east part, the coal ranks are
comparatively low, and most of them are medium-rank
bituminous, coking coal for Baiyuan Coal Mine and Wupi
Coal Mine, 1/3 coking coal for Wangkeng Coal Mine,
Hongqi Coal Mine, and Panjiachong Coal Mine, fat
coal or 1/3 coking coal for Anyuan Coal Mine and
Gaokeng Coal Mine, and fat coal for Yuejin Coal
Mine.</p>
        <p>The metamorphism degree of coal and gas storage
is closely related. The higher the metamorphism
degree of coal is, the more the coal’s gas productivity is
(Zhang, 2009). Therefore, from the angle of gas
generation, the higher metamorphism degree of coal in the
west part than that in the east part means more gas
produced for coal in the west part than that in the east
part.</p>

      <title>During Middle Proterozoic to Early Paleozoic, Jiangxi Province is separated by Yangtze Plate and</title>
      <p>South China Plate. Between these two plates, there is a
combination belt, named Pingxiang-Leping
Depression. Yangtze Plate, Pingxiang-Leping Depression, and
South China Plate are three first-level tectonic units in
the northern, middle, and southern parts of Jiangxi
Province (Jiangxi Provincial Bureau of Geology and
Mineral Resources, 1984; Liu et al., 2004). Pingxiang
Mining Area is located in the north side of Wugong
Uplift (Fig.2).</p>
      <p>Fig.2 Tectonic location of Pingxiang Mining Area
(modi</p>
      <p>fied according to Liu et al., 2004)</p>
      <p>The gravitational sliding structure is well developed
in Pingxiang Mining Area (Hu, 2002; Liu, 2003).</p>
      <p>During Yanshan period, due to the strong uplift of the
Wugong Uplift and the effect of gravity balance, some
gravitational glidings are formed in north side of the
mountains of Wugong Uplift. Fig.3 is the correlation
section between Anyuan gliding block and Gaokeng
gliding block. From top to bottom, the strata of the
gliding block consist of the following: the Cretaceous
is unconformable above the Anyuan coal-bearing
strata, Anyuan coal-bearing strata is unconformable above
the Maokou Formation, the bottom of Maokou
Formation is gravitational gliding fault, and Anyuan
coal-bearing strata is under the gliding block.</p>
      <p>From the angle of geological structure, the
coal-bearing strata in the area of Qingshan Coal Mine
and Juyuan Coal Mine are under the gliding nappe.</p>
      <p>The Maokou Formation is slid over the Anyuan
Formation, so the overlying rock’s thickness of
coalbearing strata is increased, which cause the gas in coal
seams to be well preserved (Fig.4). Meanwhile,
Gaokeng Coal Mine, Anyuan Coal Mine, and Baiyuan
Coal Mine are in the area of tectonic window, and the
coal-bearing strata within the tectonic window are
exposed to ground for a long time to be favorable to gas
migration and emission. Thus, the west part of
Pingxiang Mining Area is high gas area with serious
coal and gas outburst, while the east part is low gas
area.</p>
      <p>Also, in the west part of Pingxiang Mining Area, the
small structures at Qingshan Coal Mine and Juyuan
Coal Mine are well developed, and the syncline and
anticline structures are all incomplete and very close,
which is favorable to gas preservation. Meanwhile, in
the east part, the structures are comparatively simple,
and the synclines are wide and gentle, which is
favorable to gas migration and emission.</p>

      <sec id="9-1">
        <title>3.2.2 Factor of surrounding rock of coal seam</title>
        <p>Some researches are reported concerning the
sedimentary features in Pingxiang Mining Area (Yan and
Wu, 1995; Yan et al., 1995; Xie et al., 2001; Chen and
Peng, 2005). For Qingshan Coal Mine, the coal seams
of Zijiachong Stage have good conditions to prevent
gas migration. The ratio of sandstone to mudstone
within 50 m of roof and floor is lower, and the
carbonaceous mudstone and mudstone in roof and floor are
thick and tight, so the permeability of the roof and
floor is low, which provides the favorable conditions
for gas storage. Also, for Juyuan Coal Mine, the roof
rock of the main coal-bearing section is 350 m
mud-cement siltstone, and the floor rock is 60 m tight
mudstone, which is favorable to gas preservation.</p>
        <p>On the contrary, the area of Anyuan Coal Mine and
Gaokeng Coal Mine is close to the supply area of
terrigenous clastic of Wugong Uplift. The coarse clastic
in coal-bearing strata, including sandstone and
conglomerate, are more, so the permeability of
coal-bearing strata is better than that at Qingshan Coal
Mine and Juyuan Coal Mine. About Baiyuan Coal
Mine, the coal-bearing strata of Triassic are directly
contacted with the Cretaceous red layer, and the entire
Jurassic strata are missed, which shows that a large
amount of gas is released for a long weathering and
erosion period before the sediment of Cretaceous red
layer.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="9-2">
        <title>3.2.3 Factor of coal quality</title>
        <p>The metamorphic degree of coal has considerable
influence on coal’s gas adsorption capacity. The coal’s
gas adsorption capacity increases from medium-rank
bituminous to anthracite (Zhang, 2009). The statistics
based on the data from more than 160 mining area in
China (Qin et al., 1999) reveal the enveloping line
relationship between the coal rank and gas content in
coal reservoir, that is, with the increase coal rank from
brown coal to the early stage of anthracite, the
maximum gas content of coal seam increases, and the area
with high gas content corresponds to the area with
high rank coal. However, with the increase coal rank
from middle stage to later stage of anthracite, the
methane adsorption capacity of coal seam decreases, and
correspondingly, the maximum gas content of coal
seam sharply decreases. Therefore, concerning the gas
adsorption capacity, in Pingxiang Mining Area, the
coal rank is higher in the west part than that in the east
part, which means that the coal in the west part may
have adsorpted more gas than that in the east part.</p>
        <p>In the west part of Pingxiang Mining Area, many of
the coal body structures are destroyed and tectonic
coals are widely distributed. The coals are soft and
fragile, most of them are mylonitic coal and granulated
coal, and few of them are cataclastic coals. The test of
22 samples at Qingshan Coal Mine reveals that the
consistent coefficient of coal (f value) is very small,
ranging from 0.130 to 0.283, averaging 0.204, and
index of coal’s initial speed of diffusion (ΔP) is high,
ranging from 13 to 22, averaging 16.63. The test of 13
samples at Juyuan Coal Mine reveals that f value
ranges from 0.160 to 0.460, averaging 0.251, and ΔP
ranges from 9 to 19, averaging 13.62. Therefore, the
characteristic of coal body structure is favorable to the
preservation of gas and conducive to the coal and gas
outburst (The State Administration of Work Safety,
2009).</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>(1) The features of gas geology vary significantly
between the west part and the east part of Pingxiang
Mining Area, and it is characterized by high gas mines
with serious coal and gas outburst in the west part and
low gas mines with no coal and gas outburst in the east
part.</p>
      <p>(2) The great difference of gas geology between the
west part and the east part is the result of
comprehensive effect by geological factors. Concerning the gas
generation, the coal rank in the west part is higher than
that in the east part, which is favorable to generate
more gas in the west part than in the east part.
Concerning the gas preservation, the features of geological
structures, the surrounding rocks, coal rank, and coal
body structure are all favorable to gas preservation in
the west part and favorable to gas emission in the east
part.</p>
