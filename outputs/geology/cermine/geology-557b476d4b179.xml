      <title>International Geological Congress (IGC) held</title>
      <p>20–28 August 2004 in Florence, Italy. The scientific
program of the IGC was classified into three
symposium categories: 14 Special, 38 Topical, and 24
General Symposia including a “Mathematical
Geology” symposium. Each Topical and General
symposium consisted of several sessions: six sessions
were organized for “Mathematical Geology.” This
issue of Natural Resources Research is composed of
papers from one such session; “G-13.06 Mathematical
Geology for Resource Exploration,” held the
afternoon of 22 August. The session was supported jointly
by the International Association for Mathematical
Geology (IAMG) and the International Symposium
on Mineral Exploration (ISME). Pengda Zhao
(China University of Geosciences) and I served
as convenors to select abstracts and to create the
program.</p>
      <p>ISME is an international organization of the
Division of Exploration Technology (DETEC) in the
Mining and Materials Processing Institute of Japan
(MMIJ). Since 1990, symposia sponsored or
supported by ISME have been held every 2 years; in
Japan, Canada, China, Australia, Brazil, and USA,
in conjunction with the annual conferences of IAMG
and the IGC. As Singer and Kouda (1993) correctly
noted, the purpose of ISME symposia is “to bring
together scientists actively working on some diverse
fields in order to foster the exchanges of ideas
related to the methods of resource exploration.” ISME
originally focused on mineral resources, but has since
developed to also focus on solving other natural
resources problems involving such areas as coal,
natural gas, petroleum, methane hydrate, geothermal,
groundwater, and aggregates. Its activities at the last
seventh symposium can be seen in the special issues
on the application of neural networks to earth
sciences in Natural Resources Research, v. 12, no. 3 and
part of no. 4.</p>
      <p>This session presented the eighth ISME
symposium, which was intended to cover all aspects
of mathematical geology for resource exploration.
Initially, the main topics were proposed as; advanced
data-analysis methods for exploring and assessing
renewable and nonrenewable resources, advanced
geostatistics for characterizing petroleum and
geothermal reservoirs, remote sensing for detecting
mineral manifestations, highly precise methods for
modeling geologic structures and, new paradigms for
resource assessment.</p>
      <p>There were eight oral (two cancelled out of
an original 10) and 15 poster presentations. The
oral papers could be classified into three topics:
(1) geoinformatics and mathematics for
mineralresource explorations, (2) GIS and probabilistic
applications, and (3) remote sensing for mineral
potential and geologic hazard assessment. Topic (1)
presented new paradigms of mathematical geology
for mineral-resource exploration by sensitivity
analysis of geologic spatial estimation by Koike and
Matsuda; quantifying mineral information by Zhao,
Chen, and Zhang; and valuing information
acquisition by Dimitrakopoulos and Scott. GIS
technologies in topic (2) were applied to coastal
exploration by Kouda, Kishimoto, and Kusunose;
mineralresource exploration in southwest China by Chen,
Wang, and Hou; and a Jurassic petroleum system
Shuichiro Yokota (Shimane Univ.), Nina
Gorelikova (Russian Acad. Sciences), Sinding-Larsen
(Norwegian Univ. Science and Technology), John
Schuenemeyer (Southwest Statistical Consulting),
and Chen Jianping (China Univ. Geosciences).
Sincere thanks are extended to Ryoichi Kouda
(Geological Survey of Japan) and Toshiaki Ueki (Ocean
High Technology Institute Inc.) for their efforts in
making the session a success. Papers late for this
issue will appear in a subsequent issue of the journal.</p>
      <p>The next ISME symposium (ISME-IX) will be
held 19–20 September 2006 at the Institute of
Technology Bandung (ITB), Indonesia, with the title
“Toward New Frontiers for Resource Exploration &amp;
Sustainable Development.” For sustainable
development, new technologies of resources exploration
are becoming of the utmost importance. The
symposium will cover all aspects that contribute to
innovative technologies in resource exploration. I
encourage readers to take part in the ISME-IX and to
exchange ideas on the exploration, development, and
the use of natural resources.</p>
