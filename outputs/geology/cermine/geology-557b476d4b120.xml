        <p>Several unfavorable environmental and engineering geologic conditions exist in Fargo, North Dakota. Dominantly, the behavior of smectitic clays within the proglacial Lake Agassiz sediments of the Sherack and Brenna Formations creates subsoil instability beneath engineered structures in the Fargo area and slope instability within cutbank meanders of the Red River of the North. Unfavorable engineering geologic conditions encountered include: the elastic deformation of clayey glaciolacustrine soils, shrink-swell properties, inadequate bearing capacities, and mass movements. These conditions are responsible for structural failures including the Fargo Grain Elevator</p>

      <p>The application of geology to the supporting factors of
engineered works is the sub-discipline of geology known
as engineering geology. Engineering geologists in some
form or fashion have most likely been around since
ancient times. Many of the engineered and constructed
works of the ancient world are located on generally good
natural sites and appear to take local geological
conditions into consideration.</p>
      <p>Some of the earliest types of works likely to have been
studied by engineering geologists include the
construction of tunnels for water transport and the construction
of the Roman highway (Kiersch 1991). Today, most
engineering geologists are well versed in soil and rock
mechanics, issues relating to slope stability, aggregate
resource exploration and characterization, and
groundin 1955 and the Northern Pacific
railroad grade. Bank failures along
the Red River are common due to
the inherent instability of Brenna
Formation smectitic clays which are
subject to plastic deformation in the
subsurface, with resultant block
failure of overlying Sherack
Formation. Recent alluvial sediments due
to typical fluvial action and the
continued seasonal saturation of
cutbank meanders within the
floodplain also add to soil instability.</p>
      <p>Environmental geological overview of the Fargo Area
The City of Fargo is within the Red River Valley
adjacent to the Red River of the North which drains the
majority of northeastern and eastern North Dakota. Its
sister city, Moorhead, Minnesota, continues the urban
footprint to the east and comprises the largest
metropolitan region in the state (Fig. 2).</p>
      <p>The surficial geology (defined here as the near surface
sediments most encountered during the construction of
engineered works) in the Fargo area is characterized by

Fig. 3 Generalized lithostratigraphic geologic map of the Fargo
area depicting the distribution of surficial sediments in the
southern Red River Valley. Unit Qaa consists of overbank
sediments associated with ancient river systems draining the Lake
Agassiz floodplain. Unit Qlo consists of offshore glaciolacustrine
silts and clays of the Sherack and Brenna Formations (Harris et al.
a relatively uniform blanket of glacial lake sediments
deposited during the onset of Glacial Lake Agassiz
around 11,000 years before present (bp) (Fig. 3) and
alluvial sediments that mantle the lake silts and clays
throughout the southern Red River Valley.</p>
      <p>The sediments that underlie the Fargo area consist
dominantly of glacial lake silts, sands, and clays (and
gradational combinations of each) that reach depths of
up to 46 m below the land surface (bls). The Red River
of the North incises this relatively featureless plain and
periodically delivers a healthy amount of overbank fines
to the area during seasonal flooding events (Fig. 4a, b).</p>
      <p>Sediments underlying the Fargo area that are arguably
of greatest concern consist of glaciolacustrine silts, clays,
and silty clays of the Sherack and Brenna Formations
(Harris et al. 1974). In the Fargo area these sediments
are generally found to depths slightly greater than 31 m.</p>
      <p>The generalized stratigraphy of these units (Fig. 5) is
somewhat regular with 6 m of yellow-brown laminated
silty clays of the Sherack Formation (Fig. 6) underlain
by approximately 24 m of gray, fat clays of the Brenna
Formation (Fig. 7) (Schwert 2003). Sandwiched between
1974). Unit Ha consists of Holocene age alluvium and channel
sediments deposited within the Red River floodplain and along
tributary drainages. Ice drag marks (linear black lines) and
compaction ridges (linear blue-gray lines) are also shown. Modified
from Harris et al. (2005)
these units are the West Fargo and Harwood Members
of the Poplar River Formation (Harris and others 1974;
Arndt 1977). Due to the fact that these glaciolacustrine
sediments contain high amounts of smectitic or
‘‘swelling’’ clays in their overall mineralogy these sediments
present many difficulties when structural loads are
applied due to their inherent ability to take up water within
their mineralogical framework with a resultant loss of
strength.
For the most part, the engineering geologic problems
that exist in the Fargo area are the result of the
interaction between constructed engineered works and the
underlying ‘‘load -bearing’’ sediments. The presence or
absence of water within these sediments serves to create
two major engineering geologic challenges within the
valley: soil stablility issues related to the construction of
surface engineered works and slope stability issues

      <p>Currently, environmental and engineering geologists
from the North Dakota Geological Survey and North
Dakota State University, in addition to many others,
are engaged in detailed geologic mapping studies and
public education efforts to enhance and develop the
public’s understanding of the existing geological
conditions in the Fargo area. Many of the products
created from these investigations, such as detailed
geologic and derivative maps, will serve as the primary
database for environmental and engineering geological
investigations conducted within the Fargo area in the
future.</p>
      <p>The engineering geology of the glaciolacustrine
deposits of the Sherack and Brenna Formations in the
vicinity of the Fargo area and their physical and
engineering properties, stratigraphic relationships and
environmental geological characteristics are understood.</p>
      <p>How these materials vary spatially, both in two and
three dimensions, is not yet fully documented. This work
will continue.</p>
