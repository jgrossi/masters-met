GEOLOGY AT MOSCOW UNIVERSITY The Chair of engineering and ecological geology of the
Geological Department of M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSU) is marking its
70th anniversary on February 1, 2008. For decades, it has been one of the strongest
pedagogical and scienticfi staffs of Russian engineering and environmental
geologists. In 1938, Professor M.M. Filatov organized the Chair of soil science as
the rfist independent structural unit that joined lecturers and researchers in the
efild of engineering geology at MSU. From 1938 to 1942, he was in charge of this
Chair; then the rfist associate professor and later professor S.S. Morozov replaced
him at this position (from 1942 to 1954). In 1954, after 16 years of independent
development, the Chair of soil science was transformed into the Chair of soil science
and engineering geology by amalgamating a group of engineering geologists who worked
at the Chair of hydrogeology. In August 1986, the former was reorganized into the
Chair of engineering geology and geological environment protection. From 1954 to
1988, Professor, Academician of the AN USSR E.M. Sergeev headed the Chair, and in
1989 Professor, Academician of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (RANS) and the
International Academy of Sciences of Higher Schools (IAS HS) V.T. Tromfiov took
charge of it. In 1998, the Chair was reorganized into the Chair of engineering and
ecological geology, headed by V.T. Tromfiov. Five stages can be distinguished in the
developmental history of engineering geology at Moscow University. The rfist stage is
the origin of engineering geology at Moscow University, which lasted from the end of
the 19th century until 1938. It was closely associated with the name of Academician
A.P. Pavlov and his studies in the efild of applied geology; with the studies of the
famous geologist Professor E.V. Milanovskii concerning the design of a number of the
largest hydraulic engineering constructions on the Volga, the Angara, and other
rivers, and the course on engineering geology for university students he created; and
also, with the name of Professor M.M. Filatov. It was he who established the rfist
specialization in the efild of engineering geology- Road Soil Sciencea-t Moscow
University. This was opened in 1930 at the Chair of soil science of the soil
geographical division at the physico-mathematical department, and soon (in 1934) it
was reorganized into the wider specialty of Soil Science. The second stage
(1938-1954) was the formation stage of the engineering geologist school at MSU. On
one hand, this was marked by the opening of the Chair of soil science at the
geological and soil department of MSU on February 1, 1938; and on the other hand, by
the development of other studies in engineering geology carried out by related Chairs
(of dynamic geology and hydrogeology) of this department. This resulted in a
paradoxical situation where specialties providing geological support of construction
turned out to be given by different chairs. Geological processes and engineering
geological methods of investigation were taught without engineering geological study
of soils and rocks (soil science), and specialists graduating from the soil science
Chair did not have the necessary courses on engineering geodynamics. Also, scienticfi
research study suffered from this situation because it could not be integrated. This
was changed in 1954, when, according to the decision of the scienticfi council of the
geological faculty, the USSR Ministry of Higher Education transformed the soil
science Chair into the Chair of soil science and engineering geology, and the Chair
of hydrogeology and engineering geology into the Chair of hydrogeology. The third
stage (1954-1986) was the stage of the nfial establishment of the engineering
geologist school at MSU. It was performed under the guidance of E.M. Sergeev,
Professor, Corresponding member (1966), and later Academician (1979) of the AN USSR.
This stage was characterized by the nfial formation of all scienticfi aspects of
engineering geology, soil science, engineering geodynamics, and regional engineering
geology in research areas. This was reeflcted in the next structural reorganization
of the Chair at the beginning of the 70s. Three educational scienticfi laboratories
were formed instead of the three structural units present at that time. These were:
the Laboratory of soil science and technical melioration of soils (the previously
organized laboratory of soil mechanics and the newly formed laboratory of hard rocks
entered into this laboratory); the Laboratory of engineering geodynamics (which
included the process-modeling laboratory and the problem laboratory of slope
processes); and the Laboratory of regional engineering geology. The Chair staff, both
in quantitative and qualitative terms, was changing remarkably during that stage. At
the beginning of the stage, it amounted to 35 employees, whereas the number of state
budget employees reached 60 and 54 permanent workers in expeditionary divisions at
the end. The fourth development stage (1986-1996) of engineering geology was
characterized by further evolution of scienticfi research studies in all aspects of
engineering geology directed at estimating and predicting changes in engineering
geological conditions under technological impact. In 1986, the Chair was renamed into
the Chair of engineering geology and geological environment protection. Consequently,
the research has gone in new directions concerning engineering geological
substantiation of protection and the rational use of geological environments along
with estimating the resistance of such environments to technological impacts. The
change in the Chair name also caused changes in the names of laboratories. Thus, the
Laboratory of engineering geodynamics was renamed the Laboratory of engineering
geodynamics and geological environment protection and the Laboratory of regional
engineering geology was renamed the Laboratory of regional engineering geology and
rational use of the geological environment. A portion of all the scienticfi problems
under study in all laboratories became associated with the protection and rational
use of the geological environment. In 1986, the rfist Chair graduates received a
degree in the specialization of Geological environment protection. By the end of the
fourth stage, the number of staff members was 66, among whom there were 10 doctors
and 22 candidates of sciences. The total number of Chair members was reduced by the
end of the fourth stage. This was caused by a reduction in the number of
expeditionary workers, rfist due to the curtailment and then the almost complete
termination of economic contract studies [Tromfiov, 1998]. The ffith stage (from
1996) in the Chair development was characterized by carrying out investigations, not
only in the efild of engineering geology, but also in a new aspect of geological
sciences: ecological geology. Therefore the Chair structure and its name changed. By
order of the MSU rector on May 26, 1996, a new laboratory was organized under the
name of Ecological geology, and the Laboratory of engineering geodynamics and
geological environment protection was renamed the Laboratory of engineering
geodynamics and substantiation of engineering protection of territories. Since March
26, 1998, the Chair has been called the Chair of engineering and ecological geology.
Geological engineering issues still prevailed in the scienticfi plan of the Chair
(see below). But also principally new issues appeared: ecological geology and
engineering geology, i.e., theoretical methodological foundations and relations,
development of the theoretical fundamentals of the doctrine on the ecological
functions of the lithosphere, etc. During these stages, the Moscow university school
of engineering geologists, i.e., a school at the international level, formed at MSU
and continues its successful study at the present time. Its formation is associated
with the names of M.M. Filatov, who organized the Chair of soil science in 1938; I.V.
Popov, S.S. Morozov, E.M. Sergeev, and G.S. Zolotarev. This school produced the
doctors of sciences V.M. Bezruk, Yu.K. Vasilc'huk, A.N. Vakhtangov, E.A.
Voznesenskii, S.D. Voronkevich, G.A. Golodkovskaya, B.M. Gumenskii, I.P. Zelinskii,
R.S. Ziangirov, E.V. Kalinin, K.A. Kozhobaev, E.N. Kolomenskii, I.G. Korobanova, V.A.
Korolev, V.S. Krupoderov, V.M. Kutepov, N.A. Maksimovich, V.A. Mymrin, Nguen Than
(Vietnam), V.I. Osipov, Yu.B. Osipov, V.N. Sokolov, V.E. Sokolovich, B.I. Sergeev,
V.T. Tromfiov, Sh.E. Usupaev, V.S. Fedorenko, L.V. Shaumyan, N.L. Sheshenya, more
than 254 candidates of sciences, and also more than 1300 Specialists and 51 Masters
of geology. The results of the 60-year study experience of engineering geologists of
Moscow University are concentrated in publications of different years [Gerasimova,
2001; Filatov, 1940]. The principal achievements can be formulated as follows: (1)
the Chair as one of the leading scienticfi methodological centers, the rfist in the
USSR and then Russia, played an important role in the development of higher
engineering geological education in this country; its professors have contributed
much to the elaboration of standard curricula, which underlie the specialty
preparation program for students pursuing a degree in hydrogeology and engineering
geology. Textbooks and teaching materials developed by lecturers of the Chair were
applied at geological institutes of higher education both in our country and abroad
for many years; (2) a great contribution was made to the formation of engineering
geology as a science of the geological cycle and to development of its theoretical
fundamentals. The main direction of the Chairs' scienticfi study consisted of a
systematic development of all the scienticfi aspects of engineering geology (soil
science, engineering geodynamics, and regional engineering geology), and also of a
number of applied aspects of engineering geology (engineering geology of cities and
city agglomerations, engineering geology of hydraulic power plants, engineering
geology of mineral deposits, etc.), and of the methodology for engineering geological
exploration; (3) the engineering geologists of MSU played an important role in the
organization and operation of the USSR AN Research Council on engineering geology and
soil science (from 1966 to 1980) and the USSR AN Research Council on engineering
geology and hydrogeology, and in the activities of the national group of engineering
geologists of the USSR and Russian National Committee of Geologists; they provided
close interaction between Russian engineering geologists and the International
Association of Engineering Geologists (IAEG); (4) Chair members played a leading role
in the initiation of the AN USSR Journal Engineering Geology, whose rfist issue was
published in 1979; this journal was later renamed and reoriented by its
Editor-in-Chief Academician V.I. Osipov, the Chair graduate, as the Geoecology
Journal; (5) the Chair organized many scienticfi conferences, including forums, in
cooperation with the IAEG and the International Geological Congress. The scienticfi
and educational activity of the Chair members in the efild of engineering geology was
highly appreciated in our country and abroad. The eight-volume monograph Engineering
geology of the USSR received the Lenin Award in 1982. E.M. Sergeev and I.V. Popov
(posthumously) were among the laureates of this award. Previously in 1952, I.V. Popov
and G.S. Zolotarev received the Stalin Award as the coauthors of the two-volume
monograph Manual on Engineering Geological Exploration for Hydraulic Construction. A
cycle of monographic studies and original maps on engineering geology providing
effective national economical development of Western Siberia was awarded with a USSR
State Award in 1977. Among its laureates were four members of the Chair: E.M.
Sergeev, A.S. Gerasimova, S.B. Ershova, and V.T. Tro-fi mov. In 1988, a similar award
was given to the textbook Soil science (5th edition, 1983). As well, Sergeev, G.A.
Golodkovskaya, Ziangirov, Osipov, and Tromfiov were its laureates. The participation
of Tromfiov in the creation of the vfie-volume monograph Geocryology of the USSR was
appreciated by giving him the rank of a laureate of the Russian Federation State
Award in 1993 [Gerasimova, 2001; XX vekl-ichnosti,&#x2026; 2004]. The results of
long-term studies of the Chair staff for engineering the geological mapping of
Western Siberia were distinguished by the Lomonosov Award of MSU (1st rank) in 1975,
and three major participants: Sergeev, Gerasimova, and Tromfiov, were honored with
the rank of laureates of this award. In 1998, E.A. Voznesenskii became the laureate
of the Shuvalov Award of MSU (2nd rank), which is given to young scientists, for his
monograph Soil Behavior under Dynamic Impact (published in 1997). The scienticfi
activity of the school was highly appreciated by the geological community, when
Sergeev was elected Academician of the AN USSR, Osipov, an Academician of the RAS,
V.T. Tromfiov, an academician of the RANS and IAS HS, Yu.K. Vasilc'huk an academician
of the RANS, and Voznesenskii, Voronkevich, and Korolev, as corresponding members of
the RANS. The scienticfi activities of professor S.D. Voronkevich and assistant
professor E.A. Voznesenskii received international acknowledgment: they were elected
as members of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1996. Sergeev was an honorary
doctor of the Bratislava (1972) and Warsaw (1974) Universities, and was awarded Hans
Cloos Medal (IAEG). The scienticfi and teaching activity of the Chairs' professors
was widely recognized. S.S. Morozov (1967), Popov (1969), Zolotarev, Golodkovskaya
(1992), and Tromfiov (1998) were each conferred the rank of H"onored Scienticfi
Worker of the Russian Federation. " In 1997, the Scienticfi Council of Moscow
University awarded the rank of H"onored Professor of MSU " to Golodkovskaya, and the
year before that, to Zolotarev. In 1998, this rank was conferred on Tro-fi mov, and
in 2002, he won the Lomonosov Prize of MSU for his teaching activities. The
developmental history of ecological geology at the Moscow University covers a very
short period. Only after 1990 the Chair members started to study in this principally
new aspect of geological science, which investigates the ecological functions of the
lithosphere, patterns in their formation and spaciotemporal changes under the effects
of natural and technogenic conditions due to the activities of the biota, and rfist
of all, of humans. Within three years, the rfist series of fundamental studies was
published, and in 1997, the monograph T"heory and Methodology of Ecological Geology."
The results of the study of the Chair members in the efild of ecological geology can
by brieyfl described as follows: (1) the theoretical and methodological principles of
ecological geology as a new aspect of modern geology were elaborated; (2) a
curriculum of the new specialty E"cological geology " was elaborated, and a number of
classical Universities in Russia follow it in their training of Bachelors,
Specialists, and Masters; the geological faculty of MSU rfist accepted students
pursuing this specialty in 1994; in 2000, the RF Ministry of Education approved the
State Educational Standard (SES) of specialty 013300, Ecological geology; (3) in
1996, the rfist special structure in the world was organized that is professionally
engaged in a new aspect of geology; this was the Laboratory of Ecological Geology,
and in 1998 its Chair was organized, in whose name the words ecological geology were
present; (4) the syllabi of subjects concerning ecological geology provided by the
State Educational Standard (SES) for the specialty E"cological geology "were prepared
and teaching manuals on many of them were published, including the rfist textbook on
Ecological Geology " (2002, authors Tromfiov and D.G. Ziling) in the world; (5) the
Chair organized and actively participated in three international scienticfi
conferences Ecological geology and the Rational Use of Subsoil (1997, 2000, and
2003), and also the rfist (2000) through eighth (2007) Interuniversity conferences of
young scientists The School of Ecological Geology and Rational Use of Subsoil. The
scienticfi and educational activity of the staff in the efild of ecological geology
has already received wide acknowledgment, both in our country and abroad. V.T.
Tromfiov, D.G. Ziling, and M.B. Kurinov were awarded the 1st rank prize of the Moscow
Society of Nature Explorers for their monograph Theory and Methodology of Ecological
Geology (1997). This was also expressed in that the development of SES standard
curricula and syllabi was performed within the framework of the educational methodic
council headed by professors of the geology faculty of MSU. CURRENT STRUCTURE AND
STAFF OF THE CHAIR OF ENGINEERING AND ECOLOGICAL GEOLOGY The present Chair structure
was developed in 1996. It consists of teaching and support staff and four scienticfi
laboratories: (1) soil science and technical melioration of soils; (2) engineering
geodynamics and substantiation of engineering protection of territories; (3) regional
engineering geology and rational use of the geological environment; and (4)
ecological geology. This structure has remained unchanged for the last ten years. In
contrast, the Chair staff has considerably changed. During this period, associate
professor B.A. Snezhkin, part-time professor Ziangirov (2006), and researchers A.V.
Anikeev (2001), D.A. Spiridonov (2001), and I.K. Fomenko (2004) left the Chair; since
the beginning of the 2000-2001 academic year, Osipov no longer works as a professor.
Leading research workers Gerasimova, Ziling, Kolomenskii, Z.A. Krivosheeva, and
associate professor E.N. Ogorodnikova retired. The oldest professor of the Chair,
G.S. Zolotarev, passed away in June 2006 (1914-2006). E.N. Voznesenskii was elected a
professor of the Chair (2000), T.I. Averkina, M.B. Kurinov, S.K. Nikolaeva, V.N.
Shirokov, E.N. Samarin, and I.Yu. Grigore'va were elected associate professors, and
A.V. Bershov, an assistant. The scienticfi and engineering staff of the Chair has
been largely renewed recently, because former postgraduates came to study here. The
teaching staff included 14 lecturers, 11 support workers, and 33 researchers by 2008.
At that time the deputy heads of the Chair were: general deputy Professor
Voznesenskii (from 2002), scienticfi study deputy senior researcher V.G. Shlykov (to
the middle of 1999), associate professor I.Yu. Grigore'va (from 1999), and senior
researcher T.V. Andreeva (2006-2007) during her business trip abroad; Voznesenskii
(till May 2002) and S.K. Nikolaeva (from 2002) were scienticfi secretaries of the
Chair. The teaching staff includes 5 professors (Tromfiov, Voznesenskii, G.A.
Golodkovskaya, E.V. Kalinin, and V.A. Korolev), 6 associate professors (Averkina,
I.Yu. Grigore'va, Kurinov, Nikolaeva, Samarin, and Shirokov), and an assistant
(Bershov). Moreover, in 2007 senior research workers T.V. Andreeva and Yu.V. Frolova
occupied the posts of associate professors. The teaching support staff of the Chair
that organized and helped in the teaching process consisted of 11 workers: leading
engineer M.V. Flamina, 1st category engineers N.P. Bols'hakova, O.I. Golubtsova,
T.Yu. Merkulova, V.V. Vshivtseva, and I.Yu. Silina, 2nd category engineers M.V.
Kopteva-Dvornikova, 1st category technical workers L.P. Tereshkova and E.A. Makarova,
2nd category technical worker M.M. Vorobe'va, and technical worker A.A. Zhuravleva.
During the last decade, considerable changes also took place in the scienticfi staff
of the Chair. V.N. Sokolov became the Head of the Laboratory of soil science and
technical melioration, Ziling was the alternate Head of the Laboratory of ecological
geology (until 2004), and Yu.K. Vasilc'huk became the Head of the Laboratory of
regional engineering geology. During this period, T.V. Andreeva, S.D. Balykova, T.A.
Baraboshkina, A.V. Ershova, N.A. Larionova, L.L. Panasy'an, Yu.V. Frolova, M.A.
Khark'ina, D.I. Yurkovets, V.V. Funikova et al. were elected senior researchers of
the Chair. Also the staff of engineers and technical workers changed. The body of the
laboratory of soil science and technical melioration of soils consists currently of
16 employees: Tromfiov, scienticfi supervisor; Sokolov, Head of the Laboratory;
senior researchers V.M. Ladygin, N.A. Larionova, L.L. Panasy'an, V.V. Funikova, 1 1 ,

66 and 58 specialists, among them 7 doctors and 25 candidates of sciences, 6
laureates of the USSR State Prize (Gerasimova, Golodkovskaya, Ziangirov, Zolotarev,
Osipov, and Tromfiov), a laureate of the State Prize of Russia (Tromfiov), and 2
laureates of the 1st rank Lomonosov Prize (Gerasimova and Tromfiov). TEACHING AND
METHODOLOGICAL TEACHING ACTIVITY OF THE CHAIR IN TRAINING PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD
OF ENGINEERING AND ECOLOGICAL GEOLOGY The main objective of the Chair was and still
is the preparation of high-skilled specialists in the framework of two specialties:
Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology and Ecological Geology, and also candidates of
sciences through post-graduate study and from young employees. The joint annual
loading of the Chair lecturers increased and changed within a range from 11300 to
11700 h. The total number of lecture courses delivered by the Chair staff reached 53,
5 of which are accompanied by extensive laboratory courses. The Chair lecturers not
only teach students pursuing the above specialties, but also deliver lectures on
subjects of Engineering geology, Ecological geology, and Geoecology to the students
of other specialties of the geological faculty, and the Soil science course to
students of the Chair of cryolithology and glaciology and the Chair of physical
geography of the Geographical faculty. During the decade in question, the Chair
participated in the multilevel preparation of students in the specialization
G"eology, " a new specialization in the natural science block in the list of higher
education specializations given by classical universities of Russia. In accordance
with this approach, the rfist four years of education within the framework of each
professional orientation (corresponding to common specialties) are absolutely similar
in their content and volume. Students, having completed the four-year syllabus,
receive a Bachelors' degree in geology and may continue their education to get a
Masters' degree (admission is competitive, 5-6th year of education) or a Specialist
(5th year). Altogether in the years from 1998 to 2007, the Chair prepared 178 people
in higher education: 119 Specialists, 51 Masters (3 of these were from China), and 8
Bachelors (6 from China). The preparation of students in the context of the specialty
Hydrogeology and engineering geology was realized through the specialties Engineering
geology, Soil science and articfiial lithogenesis , and Protection of the geological
environment. The rfist of these was successfully acquired by 69 people; the second,
by 2, and the third, by 25 persons; these each received a Specialists' degree. The
program Engineering geology was nfiished by 25 Masters, and 8 people got a Masters'
degree in Soil science and articfiial lithogenesis . Note that since the 2000-2001
academic year, education is occurring according to a new curriculum in compliance
with the State Educational Standard for specialty 011400: Hydrogeology and
engineering geology. This caused the need to develop a series of new courses and
revise previous ones. The curricula of all specialties were renovated with regard to
the requirements of the SES in force. All these methodical considerations were
included in collected volumes regularly published by the geological faculty of MSU.
In 2000 the Curricula and Syllabi and Educational and Practical Training were
published, and in 2002 Graduate Studies and State Examination. In 2004, a revised and
corrected edition of Curricula and Syllabi and Specializations and Masters' Programs
were published, which included curricula and programs of the courses of t"he right
side " along with abstracts of subjects of specializations and Masters' programs on
engineering geology delivered by the Chair. The preparation of students in the
Bachelors' program in the Ecological geology specialty was started by the geological
faculty in 1994 and in the Masters' program, in 1998. However, specialty 013300,
Ecological geology, as an experimental specialty was organized at MSU by the order of
the RF Ministry of Education only in October 1999. In 2000, the State Educational
Standard of specialty Ecological geology 013300 was approved for the rfist time. It
was elaborated mainly by members of the Geological Faculty and adjusted with
standards of other geological specialties in humanitarian and natural science
disciplines, differing in a larger number of hours for biological and chemical
courses. In respect to common professional subjects, the SES of the specialty
Ecological geology comprised 17 courses compulsory for all geological specialties
(including Ecological geology) and 13 new courses absent in the curricula of other
specialties. Among them are: F"undamentals of geoecology, " L"andscape science, "
S"oil science, " M"eteorology and hydrology, " E"cological geodynamics, " E"cological
hydrogeology and hydrochemistry, " E"cological geochemistry, " E"cological expertise,
" I"ndustrial Ecology, " H"uman ecology (medical aspects), " L"egal foundations of
the use of subsoil and protection of subsurface resources, "E"conomics of nature
management, "and P"rinciples of ecological geological exploration." A set of syllabus
projects for the specialty (differing from the syllabi in Bachelors ' preparation of
the specialization Geology) was presented to the Ministry of Education and approved
in 2000. The syllabi of special disciplines were revised based on the teaching
experience at MSU and SPbSU (St. Petersb. State Univ.) and reapproved by the Ministry
of Education in 2002. Among the authors of syllabi and curricula are many lecturers
of the Chair of engineering and ecological geology. These methodical elaborations
were published in the form of an abstract in the mentioned SES and collected issues
of the geological faculty of MSU. In the last decade, 23 people with a Specialists'
degree in ecogeology graduated from the Chair. Fifteen students successfully received
a Masters' degree. Furthermore, the Chair staff elaborated a syllabus of a refresher
course Engineering and ecological geology of oil and gas basins, and also the
syllabus and curriculum of the innovative Masters' project Ecological geology of
territories disturbed techogenically (TDT) in the context of the program Formation of
the system of innovative education at Lomonosov MSU. In the framework of this
project, the Chair staff has developed syllabi for new disciplines: Ecological
geology of TDT, Patterns in the formation of ecological functions of the lithosphere,
Estimation of changes in the ecological geological conditions under technogenic
impact, Riskanalysis of technocratically developed territories, Ecological geological
mapping of TDT, Ecological geodynamics of TDT, Problems in predicting changes in the
geological environment in the TDT limits, Geological factors of ecological risk,
Ecological geological conditions of Russia, Physicochemical methods of investigating
the components of ecological geological systems and ecological interpretation of
results, Geochemical factors of ecological risk and microelements, and Contamination
of TDT soils and their puricfiation . During the period from 1996 to 2006, 40 persons
entered the post-graduate degree course of the Chair. It was completed by 15 people,
and 13 of them successfully defended candidate dissertations. Moreover, candidate
dissertations were defended by 2 members of the Chair and one attached to the
post-graduate degree course. During this period, a number of textbooks and teaching
manuals were published: textbooks by Tro-fi mov and Ziling Ecological geology (2002),
Kalinin Engineering geological calculations and simulation (2006), Soil science (6th
edition, Tromfiov, Korolev, Voznesenskii, Golodkovskaya, Vasilc'huk, Ziangirov, ed.

scienticfi research study of the Chair was carried out in two aspects, the Theory of
formation of engineering geological conditions of the Earth and their evolution in
the epoch of technogenesis and Development of theoretical principles of the doctrine
on ecological functions of the lithosphere. In the context of the rfist aspect, 12
themes were developed, and 2 themes of the second were developed as well [Tromfiov,
1998]. Eight themes were reported; there were publications, including monographic
ones. The study on classifying the Earths' engineering geological structural features
resulted in the publishing of the monograph Engineering Geological Structures of the
Earth (authors Tromfiov, Averkina, Spiridonov, 2001). The monograph Engineering
Geology and Ecological GeologyT-heoretical Methodological Principles and
Interrelation (1999) nfiished the development of the eponymous theme by Tromfiov and
Ziling. The books G"enesis of Loess Soil Subsidence " (Tromfiov, 1999) and L"oess
Cover on the Earth and Its Properties "(2001) are the results of the development made
by Tromfiov, Andreeva, Balykova, and Ershova of the theme Loess Cover on the Earth
and Its Engineering Geological Peculiarities. The monograph E"cological functions of
the lithosphere " (Tromfiov, Ziling, Baraboshkina, Bogoslovskii, Zhigalin, Khark'ina,
et al., 2000) was written in the course of elaborating the theme Developing the
Theoretical Foundations of the Doctrine of Ecological Functions of the

grant. Contract studies were developing as well. From 1996 to 1998, they were carried
out along with the Ministry of Natural Resources of Russia on the theme T"heoretical
fundamentals of ecological geology " and on the theme C"ontent and methods for next
generation ecological geological mapping, " in 1999. In 1998, the studies on the
theme E"stimation of landslide slope stability within the limits of Zagorsk SAPP
constructions during the initial period of exploitation "were nfiished. In 1999,
studies were performed within the framework of the new contract E"stimation of the
inuflence of engineering geological characteristics of soil masses on the landslide
slope stability within the limits of Zagorsk SAPP constructions under conditions of
the reconstructed drainage barrier." In 2000, the Chair accepted a new state budget
theme for vfie years (2000-2005) for implementation. Three themes were worked out at
the Laboratory of soil science and technical melioration: P"etrogenetic patterns in
the formation of rock properties (by the example of effusive and carbonate rocks)
"(scienticfi supervisor Golodkovskaya); S"imulation and prediction of the deformation
and destruction of soils under variable loads " (Voznesenskii); and S"tudy of
patterns in the formation of properties of clay soils as components of engineering
geological and ecological geological systems " (Korolev). The developments made in
the context of the latter were generalized by Korolev in his monograph Puricfiation
of Polluted Soils (2001). Studies were carried out at the Laboratory of geodynamics
and substantiation of engineering protection of territories on the theme P"atterns in
the formation, simulation, and prediction of downwarping and subsidence of the

consolidation of tailings were investigated (supervisor Krasilova, 2007), Two themes
were elaborated under the guidance of Yu.K. Vasilc'huk: H"istorical geological
patterns in formation of engineering geological peculiarities of rock masses with
syngenetic ice wedges during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene " and H"istorical
geological patterns in formation of engineering geological peculiarities of rock
masses of convex-hilly peat bogs during the Holocene. " The result of studies on the
former was Vasilc'huks' monograph Ice Wedges: Heterocyclicity, Heterochrony,
Heterogeneity (2006). At the Laboratory of ecological geology, studies were carried
out in the framework of two themes: D"evelopment of theoretical fundamentals of the
doctrine on ecological functions of the lithosphere " and A"nalysis of the current
state and development of fundamentals of ecological geological mapping. " In the
context of the former, after the monograph Ecological Functions of the Lithosphere
(2000), the teaching manual Transformation of Ecological Functions of the Lithosphere
during the Technogenic Epoch was published in 2006 (Tromfiov, Ziling, Baraboshkina,
Zhigalin, and Khark'ina). The results of the development of the latter theme and also
a contract study with the Russian Research Institute of Hydrogeology and Engineering
Geology (VSEGINGEO) can be found in the brochure Logic and Content of a Map of the
Current State of the Upper Horizon of the Earths' Crust as a Factual Base for
Ecological Geological Mapping (Tromfiov, Ziling, Baraboshkina, Bogoslovskii,

E"cological Geological Maps "(Tro-fi mov, Ziling, Baraboshkina, Khark'ina, and
Zhigalin, 2002, 2007). From 2001 to 2005, the number of grants that supported the
studies performed by the Chair staff increased to 14. Let us name some of these
studies: T"ime effects of the deformation and destruction of soils " (supervisor
Voznesenskii), P"atterns in the formation of engineering geological properties of
volcanogenic soils in the lithicfiation process " (Frolova), manual Engineering
Geological Maps (Tromfiov and Korolev). The studies on the theme L"ogic and content
of the map of the current state of the geological environment as a factual base for
ecological geological mapping "by the contract with VSEGINGEO were carried out by
members of the Laboratory of ecological geology; 14 contracts on the study of
engineering geological and ecological geological conditions of concrete objects in
different parts of the country (European part, West Siberia, Kuznetsk Basin,
Sakhalin, etc.) and foreign countries (Moldavia) were performed under guidance of
E.A. Voznesenskii. The growth in the number of studies under economic agreements was
promoted the certification of the Chair Laboratory of soil science and technical
melioration of soils for technical competence in testing soils of natural
sedimentation, as well as soils and technogenic soils (including strengthened), and
also in analyzing the composition and properties of underground and surface waters,
which occurred in March 2005. The correspondence to main requirements of the GOST
RISO MEK 17025 for testing laboratories was conrfimed by the attestation certicfiate
No. 300.089. This extended opportunities to the Chair for attracting off-budget
studies under customers 'contracts, and also it provided the laboratory with modern
automatic devices for determination of physic and mechanical properties of soils. In
2006, the Chair accepted a new vfie-year statebudget scienticfi target for
investigations: I"nvestigation of diversity of engineering geological and ecological
geological conditions of Russia as a requisite for substantiation of rational use of
subsoil. "Its main item was creation of a monograph Engineering Geology of Russia
(scienticfi supervisor Tromfiov). It consisted of three volumes: Soils of Russia,
Engineering Geodynamics of Russia, and Engineering Geological Structures of Russia.
All lecturers and researchers of all the scienticfi laboratories of the Chair take
part in its creation. Development of the above scienticfi problem is facilitated by
investigations in the context of the project D"iversity of soils in Russia and
innovations in managing their state and properties " (scienticfi supervisor Tromfiov,
executive in charge Voznesenskii). The entitlement for this project was won in a
competition held V.D. Kharitonov, and Bershov); M"onitoring of the by the
departmental target program D"evelopment of ecological situation within experimental

1997-2000 "was given to a monograph by Vasilc'huk and Kotlyakov Principles of
Isotopic Geocryology and Glaciology (Publishing House of Moscow University, 2000),
and a grant of the federal target program I"ntegration of science and higher
education of Russia in 2002-2006" was received for a monograph by Vasilc'huk Ice
Wedges: Heterocyclicity, Heterochrony, Heterogeneity (Publishing House of Moscow
University, 2006). SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITY OF THE CHAIR MEMBERS Since
1998, the Chair has organized and held 9 international scienticfi conferences on
various problems, including the most topical ones, of engineering and ecological
geology at the geological faculty of Lomonosov MSU. Let us give the titles of these
conferences. They are: G"enesis and models for formation of soil properties "(May
1998); T"heoretical problems of engineering geology " (May 25-26, 1999); 2"0th
Century: gfiures and schools in engineering geology "(May 2000); N"ovel types of
engineering geological and ecological geological maps " (May 2001); P"etrogenetic,

engineering geodynamics and ecological geodynamics " (February 2-3, 2006);
M"onitoring of geological, lithotechnical, and ecological geological systems "(May
24-25, 2007). The Chair staff actively participated in the organization of Sergeevs'
Readings. In the context of these readings, the memorial portion of the program was
held at the geological faculty. Here the Chair members and guests made reports on the
importance of E.M. Sergeevs' studies and their further development and shared their
memoirs about him. Six such sessions were held. The tradition of MSU school of
engineering geologists participating in the study of scienticfi organizathe
scienticfi potential of higher schools (2006-2008)." region "(Voznesenskii, Samarin,
and Bershov). The theme E"cological geological conditions of Russia " is currently
worked out at the Laboratory of ecological geology in the framework of this problem.
The creation of the eponymous monograph is supposed in the issue, which must include
a series of original ecological geological maps as an essential component. Two more
principally new themes are being elaborated at the Laboratory of soil science and
technical melioration of soils owing to purchase of new expensive scienticfi
equipment: M"icro- and nanostructure of natural and articfiial soils: the role of
different phases in its formation " (executive in charge Sokolov) and I"nvestigation
of the nature and patterns of stress wave attenuations in soils "(Voznesenskii). This
state budget theme of the Chair was backed by development of related themes in the
framework of RFBR grants and studies under economic agreements. Thus, in 2006 the
studies supported by RFBR grants were performed on the themes T"ime effects in
deformation and destruction of soils "(supervisor Voznesenskii, executives Funikova,
Samarin, Bershov, Kushnareva, P.A. Yavlyaev, F.A. Provorov, D.V. Lagonskaya, and M.L.
Chernysheva), P"aleosoils and pedosystems of the Permian, Triassic, and Pleistocene:
comparative morphostructural analysis, reconstruction of paleopedogenesis and
paleolandscape conditions " (Sokolov), P"aleogeographic and paleoclimatic
reconstructions of Russian Arctic Zone based on correlation of isotopic diagrams
dated by radiocarbon of the late Pleistocene and Holocene ice wedges with isotopic
curves of Greenland " (supervisor Vasilc'huk, executives N.A. Budantseva, Yu.N.
Chizhova, and A.A. Zhuravleva). In recent years, the number of studies under the
economic agreement increased, especially at the Laboratory of soil science. In 2006,
the studies on the following themes were carried out: D"evelopment of new methods for
estimation of dynamic stability of roadbed soils " (Voznesenskii, Funikova, Samarin,
Bershov, Kushnareva, F.A. Provorov, and D.V. Lagonskaya); E"stimation of behavior of
soils at the building site for the expected dislocation of a MFFF-R plant under

GEOLOGY AT MOSCOW UNIVERSITY The Chair of engineering and ecological geology of the
Geological Department of M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSU) is marking its
70th anniversary on February 1, 2008. For decades, it has been one of the strongest
pedagogical and scienticfi staffs of Russian engineering and environmental
geologists. In 1938, Professor M.M. Filatov organized the Chair of soil science as
the rfist independent structural unit that joined lecturers and researchers in the
efild of engineering geology at MSU. From 1938 to 1942, he was in charge of this
Chair; then the rfist associate professor and later professor S.S. Morozov replaced
him at this position (from 1942 to 1954). In 1954, after 16 years of independent
development, the Chair of soil science was transformed into the Chair of soil science
and engineering geology by amalgamating a group of engineering geologists who worked
at the Chair of hydrogeology. In August 1986, the former was reorganized into the
Chair of engineering geology and geological environment protection. From 1954 to
1988, Professor, Academician of the AN USSR E.M. Sergeev headed the Chair, and in
1989 Professor, Academician of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (RANS) and the
International Academy of Sciences of Higher Schools (IAS HS) V.T. Tromfiov took
charge of it. In 1998, the Chair was reorganized into the Chair of engineering and
ecological geology, headed by V.T. Tromfiov. Five stages can be distinguished in the
developmental history of engineering geology at Moscow University. The rfist stage is
the origin of engineering geology at Moscow University, which lasted from the end of
the 19th century until 1938. It was closely associated with the name of Academician
A.P. Pavlov and his studies in the efild of applied geology; with the studies of the
famous geologist Professor E.V. Milanovskii concerning the design of a number of the
largest hydraulic engineering constructions on the Volga, the Angara, and other
rivers, and the course on engineering geology for university students he created; and
also, with the name of Professor M.M. Filatov. It was he who established the rfist
specialization in the efild of engineering geology- Road Soil Sciencea-t Moscow
University. This was opened in 1930 at the Chair of soil science of the soil
geographical division at the physico-mathematical department, and soon (in 1934) it
was reorganized into the wider specialty of Soil Science. The second stage
(1938-1954) was the formation stage of the engineering geologist school at MSU. On
one hand, this was marked by the opening of the Chair of soil science at the
geological and soil department of MSU on February 1, 1938; and on the other hand, by
the development of other studies in engineering geology carried out by related Chairs
(of dynamic geology and hydrogeology) of this department. This resulted in a
paradoxical situation where specialties providing geological support of construction
turned out to be given by different chairs. Geological processes and engineering
geological methods of investigation were taught without engineering geological study
of soils and rocks (soil science), and specialists graduating from the soil science
Chair did not have the necessary courses on engineering geodynamics. Also, scienticfi
research study suffered from this situation because it could not be integrated. This
was changed in 1954, when, according to the decision of the scienticfi council of the
geological faculty, the USSR Ministry of Higher Education transformed the soil
science Chair into the Chair of soil science and engineering geology, and the Chair
of hydrogeology and engineering geology into the Chair of hydrogeology. The third
stage (1954-1986) was the stage of the nfial establishment of the engineering
geologist school at MSU. It was performed under the guidance of E.M. Sergeev,
Professor, Corresponding member (1966), and later Academician (1979) of the AN USSR.
This stage was characterized by the nfial formation of all scienticfi aspects of
engineering geology, soil science, engineering geodynamics, and regional engineering
geology in research areas. This was reeflcted in the next structural reorganization
of the Chair at the beginning of the 70s. Three educational scienticfi laboratories
were formed instead of the three structural units present at that time. These were:
the Laboratory of soil science and technical melioration of soils (the previously
organized laboratory of soil mechanics and the newly formed laboratory of hard rocks
entered into this laboratory); the Laboratory of engineering geodynamics (which
included the process-modeling laboratory and the problem laboratory of slope
processes); and the Laboratory of regional engineering geology. The Chair staff, both
in quantitative and qualitative terms, was changing remarkably during that stage. At
the beginning of the stage, it amounted to 35 employees, whereas the number of state
budget employees reached 60 and 54 permanent workers in expeditionary divisions at
the end. The fourth development stage (1986-1996) of engineering geology was
characterized by further evolution of scienticfi research studies in all aspects of
engineering geology directed at estimating and predicting changes in engineering
geological conditions under technological impact. In 1986, the Chair was renamed into
the Chair of engineering geology and geological environment protection. Consequently,
the research has gone in new directions concerning engineering geological
substantiation of protection and the rational use of geological environments along
with estimating the resistance of such environments to technological impacts. The
change in the Chair name also caused changes in the names of laboratories. Thus, the
Laboratory of engineering geodynamics was renamed the Laboratory of engineering
geodynamics and geological environment protection and the Laboratory of regional
engineering geology was renamed the Laboratory of regional engineering geology and
rational use of the geological environment. A portion of all the scienticfi problems
under study in all laboratories became associated with the protection and rational
use of the geological environment. In 1986, the rfist Chair graduates received a
degree in the specialization of Geological environment protection. By the end of the
fourth stage, the number of staff members was 66, among whom there were 10 doctors
and 22 candidates of sciences. The total number of Chair members was reduced by the
end of the fourth stage. This was caused by a reduction in the number of
expeditionary workers, rfist due to the curtailment and then the almost complete
termination of economic contract studies [Tromfiov, 1998]. The ffith stage (from
1996) in the Chair development was characterized by carrying out investigations, not
only in the efild of engineering geology, but also in a new aspect of geological
sciences: ecological geology. Therefore the Chair structure and its name changed. By
order of the MSU rector on May 26, 1996, a new laboratory was organized under the
name of Ecological geology, and the Laboratory of engineering geodynamics and
geological environment protection was renamed the Laboratory of engineering
geodynamics and substantiation of engineering protection of territories. Since March
26, 1998, the Chair has been called the Chair of engineering and ecological geology.
Geological engineering issues still prevailed in the scienticfi plan of the Chair
(see below). But also principally new issues appeared: ecological geology and
engineering geology, i.e., theoretical methodological foundations and relations,
development of the theoretical fundamentals of the doctrine on the ecological
functions of the lithosphere, etc. During these stages, the Moscow university school
of engineering geologists, i.e., a school at the international level, formed at MSU
and continues its successful study at the present time. Its formation is associated
with the names of M.M. Filatov, who organized the Chair of soil science in 1938; I.V.
Popov, S.S. Morozov, E.M. Sergeev, and G.S. Zolotarev. This school produced the
doctors of sciences V.M. Bezruk, Yu.K. Vasilc'huk, A.N. Vakhtangov, E.A.
Voznesenskii, S.D. Voronkevich, G.A. Golodkovskaya, B.M. Gumenskii, I.P. Zelinskii,
R.S. Ziangirov, E.V. Kalinin, K.A. Kozhobaev, E.N. Kolomenskii, I.G. Korobanova, V.A.
Korolev, V.S. Krupoderov, V.M. Kutepov, N.A. Maksimovich, V.A. Mymrin, Nguen Than
(Vietnam), V.I. Osipov, Yu.B. Osipov, V.N. Sokolov, V.E. Sokolovich, B.I. Sergeev,
V.T. Tromfiov, Sh.E. Usupaev, V.S. Fedorenko, L.V. Shaumyan, N.L. Sheshenya, more
than 254 candidates of sciences, and also more than 1300 Specialists and 51 Masters
of geology. The results of the 60-year study experience of engineering geologists of
Moscow University are concentrated in publications of different years [Gerasimova,
2001; Filatov, 1940]. The principal achievements can be formulated as follows: (1)
the Chair as one of the leading scienticfi methodological centers, the rfist in the
USSR and then Russia, played an important role in the development of higher
engineering geological education in this country; its professors have contributed
much to the elaboration of standard curricula, which underlie the specialty
preparation program for students pursuing a degree in hydrogeology and engineering
geology. Textbooks and teaching materials developed by lecturers of the Chair were
applied at geological institutes of higher education both in our country and abroad
for many years; (2) a great contribution was made to the formation of engineering
geology as a science of the geological cycle and to development of its theoretical
fundamentals. The main direction of the Chairs' scienticfi study consisted of a
systematic development of all the scienticfi aspects of engineering geology (soil
science, engineering geodynamics, and regional engineering geology), and also of a
number of applied aspects of engineering geology (engineering geology of cities and
city agglomerations, engineering geology of hydraulic power plants, engineering
geology of mineral deposits, etc.), and of the methodology for engineering geological
exploration; (3) the engineering geologists of MSU played an important role in the
organization and operation of the USSR AN Research Council on engineering geology and
soil science (from 1966 to 1980) and the USSR AN Research Council on engineering
geology and hydrogeology, and in the activities of the national group of engineering
geologists of the USSR and Russian National Committee of Geologists; they provided
close interaction between Russian engineering geologists and the International
Association of Engineering Geologists (IAEG); (4) Chair members played a leading role
in the initiation of the AN USSR Journal Engineering Geology, whose rfist issue was
published in 1979; this journal was later renamed and reoriented by its
Editor-in-Chief Academician V.I. Osipov, the Chair graduate, as the Geoecology
Journal; (5) the Chair organized many scienticfi conferences, including forums, in
cooperation with the IAEG and the International Geological Congress. The scienticfi
and educational activity of the Chair members in the efild of engineering geology was
highly appreciated in our country and abroad. The eight-volume monograph Engineering
geology of the USSR received the Lenin Award in 1982. E.M. Sergeev and I.V. Popov
(posthumously) were among the laureates of this award. Previously in 1952, I.V. Popov
and G.S. Zolotarev received the Stalin Award as the coauthors of the two-volume
monograph Manual on Engineering Geological Exploration for Hydraulic Construction. A
cycle of monographic studies and original maps on engineering geology providing
effective national economical development of Western Siberia was awarded with a USSR
State Award in 1977. Among its laureates were four members of the Chair: E.M.
Sergeev, A.S. Gerasimova, S.B. Ershova, and V.T. Tro-fi mov. In 1988, a similar award
was given to the textbook Soil science (5th edition, 1983). As well, Sergeev, G.A.
Golodkovskaya, Ziangirov, Osipov, and Tromfiov were its laureates. The participation
of Tromfiov in the creation of the vfie-volume monograph Geocryology of the USSR was
appreciated by giving him the rank of a laureate of the Russian Federation State
Award in 1993 [Gerasimova, 2001; XX vekl-ichnosti,&#x2026; 2004]. The results of
long-term studies of the Chair staff for engineering the geological mapping of
Western Siberia were distinguished by the Lomonosov Award of MSU (1st rank) in 1975,
and three major participants: Sergeev, Gerasimova, and Tromfiov, were honored with
the rank of laureates of this award. In 1998, E.A. Voznesenskii became the laureate
of the Shuvalov Award of MSU (2nd rank), which is given to young scientists, for his
monograph Soil Behavior under Dynamic Impact (published in 1997). The scienticfi
activity of the school was highly appreciated by the geological community, when
Sergeev was elected Academician of the AN USSR, Osipov, an Academician of the RAS,
V.T. Tromfiov, an academician of the RANS and IAS HS, Yu.K. Vasilc'huk an academician
of the RANS, and Voznesenskii, Voronkevich, and Korolev, as corresponding members of
the RANS. The scienticfi activities of professor S.D. Voronkevich and assistant
professor E.A. Voznesenskii received international acknowledgment: they were elected
as members of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1996. Sergeev was an honorary
doctor of the Bratislava (1972) and Warsaw (1974) Universities, and was awarded Hans
Cloos Medal (IAEG). The scienticfi and teaching activity of the Chairs' professors
was widely recognized. S.S. Morozov (1967), Popov (1969), Zolotarev, Golodkovskaya
(1992), and Tromfiov (1998) were each conferred the rank of H"onored Scienticfi
Worker of the Russian Federation. " In 1997, the Scienticfi Council of Moscow
University awarded the rank of H"onored Professor of MSU " to Golodkovskaya, and the
year before that, to Zolotarev. In 1998, this rank was conferred on Tro-fi mov, and
in 2002, he won the Lomonosov Prize of MSU for his teaching activities. The
developmental history of ecological geology at the Moscow University covers a very
short period. Only after 1990 the Chair members started to study in this principally
new aspect of geological science, which investigates the ecological functions of the
lithosphere, patterns in their formation and spaciotemporal changes under the effects
of natural and technogenic conditions due to the activities of the biota, and rfist
of all, of humans. Within three years, the rfist series of fundamental studies was
published, and in 1997, the monograph T"heory and Methodology of Ecological Geology."
The results of the study of the Chair members in the efild of ecological geology can
by brieyfl described as follows: (1) the theoretical and methodological principles of
ecological geology as a new aspect of modern geology were elaborated; (2) a
curriculum of the new specialty E"cological geology " was elaborated, and a number of
classical Universities in Russia follow it in their training of Bachelors,
Specialists, and Masters; the geological faculty of MSU rfist accepted students
pursuing this specialty in 1994; in 2000, the RF Ministry of Education approved the
State Educational Standard (SES) of specialty 013300, Ecological geology; (3) in
1996, the rfist special structure in the world was organized that is professionally
engaged in a new aspect of geology; this was the Laboratory of Ecological Geology,
and in 1998 its Chair was organized, in whose name the words ecological geology were
present; (4) the syllabi of subjects concerning ecological geology provided by the
State Educational Standard (SES) for the specialty E"cological geology "were prepared
and teaching manuals on many of them were published, including the rfist textbook on
Ecological Geology " (2002, authors Tromfiov and D.G. Ziling) in the world; (5) the
Chair organized and actively participated in three international scienticfi
conferences Ecological geology and the Rational Use of Subsoil (1997, 2000, and
2003), and also the rfist (2000) through eighth (2007) Interuniversity conferences of
young scientists The School of Ecological Geology and Rational Use of Subsoil. The
scienticfi and educational activity of the staff in the efild of ecological geology
has already received wide acknowledgment, both in our country and abroad. V.T.
Tromfiov, D.G. Ziling, and M.B. Kurinov were awarded the 1st rank prize of the Moscow
Society of Nature Explorers for their monograph Theory and Methodology of Ecological
Geology (1997). This was also expressed in that the development of SES standard
curricula and syllabi was performed within the framework of the educational methodic
council headed by professors of the geology faculty of MSU. CURRENT STRUCTURE AND
STAFF OF THE CHAIR OF ENGINEERING AND ECOLOGICAL GEOLOGY The present Chair structure
was developed in 1996. It consists of teaching and support staff and four scienticfi
laboratories: (1) soil science and technical melioration of soils; (2) engineering
geodynamics and substantiation of engineering protection of territories; (3) regional
engineering geology and rational use of the geological environment; and (4)
ecological geology. This structure has remained unchanged for the last ten years. In
contrast, the Chair staff has considerably changed. During this period, associate
professor B.A. Snezhkin, part-time professor Ziangirov (2006), and researchers A.V.
Anikeev (2001), D.A. Spiridonov (2001), and I.K. Fomenko (2004) left the Chair; since
the beginning of the 2000-2001 academic year, Osipov no longer works as a professor.
Leading research workers Gerasimova, Ziling, Kolomenskii, Z.A. Krivosheeva, and
associate professor E.N. Ogorodnikova retired. The oldest professor of the Chair,
G.S. Zolotarev, passed away in June 2006 (1914-2006). E.N. Voznesenskii was elected a
professor of the Chair (2000), T.I. Averkina, M.B. Kurinov, S.K. Nikolaeva, V.N.
Shirokov, E.N. Samarin, and I.Yu. Grigore'va were elected associate professors, and
A.V. Bershov, an assistant. The scienticfi and engineering staff of the Chair has
been largely renewed recently, because former postgraduates came to study here. The
teaching staff included 14 lecturers, 11 support workers, and 33 researchers by 2008.
At that time the deputy heads of the Chair were: general deputy Professor
Voznesenskii (from 2002), scienticfi study deputy senior researcher V.G. Shlykov (to
the middle of 1999), associate professor I.Yu. Grigore'va (from 1999), and senior
researcher T.V. Andreeva (2006-2007) during her business trip abroad; Voznesenskii
(till May 2002) and S.K. Nikolaeva (from 2002) were scienticfi secretaries of the
Chair. The teaching staff includes 5 professors (Tromfiov, Voznesenskii, G.A.
Golodkovskaya, E.V. Kalinin, and V.A. Korolev), 6 associate professors (Averkina,
I.Yu. Grigore'va, Kurinov, Nikolaeva, Samarin, and Shirokov), and an assistant
(Bershov). Moreover, in 2007 senior research workers T.V. Andreeva and Yu.V. Frolova
occupied the posts of associate professors. The teaching support staff of the Chair
that organized and helped in the teaching process consisted of 11 workers: leading
engineer M.V. Flamina, 1st category engineers N.P. Bols'hakova, O.I. Golubtsova,
T.Yu. Merkulova, V.V. Vshivtseva, and I.Yu. Silina, 2nd category engineers M.V.
Kopteva-Dvornikova, 1st category technical workers L.P. Tereshkova and E.A. Makarova,
2nd category technical worker M.M. Vorobe'va, and technical worker A.A. Zhuravleva.
During the last decade, considerable changes also took place in the scienticfi staff
of the Chair. V.N. Sokolov became the Head of the Laboratory of soil science and
technical melioration, Ziling was the alternate Head of the Laboratory of ecological
geology (until 2004), and Yu.K. Vasilc'huk became the Head of the Laboratory of
regional engineering geology. During this period, T.V. Andreeva, S.D. Balykova, T.A.
Baraboshkina, A.V. Ershova, N.A. Larionova, L.L. Panasy'an, Yu.V. Frolova, M.A.
Khark'ina, D.I. Yurkovets, V.V. Funikova et al. were elected senior researchers of
the Chair. Also the staff of engineers and technical workers changed. The body of the
laboratory of soil science and technical melioration of soils consists currently of
16 employees: Tromfiov, scienticfi supervisor; Sokolov, Head of the Laboratory;
senior researchers V.M. Ladygin, N.A. Larionova, L.L. Panasy'an, V.V. Funikova, 1 1 ,

Tromfiov is the scienticfi supervisor of the Laboratory. The Chair staff closely
collaborates with the faculty scienticfi research laboratory investigating the
inuflence of geological factors on the physicochemical solidicfiation of soils. The
largest part of this laboratory consists of graduates or former employees of the
Chair. This laboratory has been headed by professor Voznesenskii since 2006, who was
appointed deputy dean of the Geological Faculty in 2007. At present, the staff of
this laboratory consists of 10 members. It includes 1 , L.V. Gonsenior researchers
S.D. Voronkevich charova, T.T. Abramova, T.G. Makeeva, V.I. Baranova, and V.I.
Divisilova, leading engineers V.M. Fedorov, K.E. Valieva, and E.A. Fedyaeva, and
engineer P.A. Yavlyaev. All in all, during this period the Chair staff ranged between
66 and 58 specialists, among them 7 doctors and 25 candidates of sciences, 6
laureates of the USSR State Prize (Gerasimova, Golodkovskaya, Ziangirov, Zolotarev,
Osipov, and Tromfiov), a laureate of the State Prize of Russia (Tromfiov), and 2
laureates of the 1st rank Lomonosov Prize (Gerasimova and Tromfiov). TEACHING AND
METHODOLOGICAL TEACHING ACTIVITY OF THE CHAIR IN TRAINING PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD
OF ENGINEERING AND ECOLOGICAL GEOLOGY The main objective of the Chair was and still
is the preparation of high-skilled specialists in the framework of two specialties:
Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology and Ecological Geology, and also candidates of
sciences through post-graduate study and from young employees. The joint annual
loading of the Chair lecturers increased and changed within a range from 11300 to
11700 h. The total number of lecture courses delivered by the Chair staff reached 53,
5 of which are accompanied by extensive laboratory courses. The Chair lecturers not
only teach students pursuing the above specialties, but also deliver lectures on
subjects of Engineering geology, Ecological geology, and Geoecology to the students
of other specialties of the geological faculty, and the Soil science course to
students of the Chair of cryolithology and glaciology and the Chair of physical
geography of the Geographical faculty. During the decade in question, the Chair
participated in the multilevel preparation of students in the specialization
G"eology, " a new specialization in the natural science block in the list of higher
education specializations given by classical universities of Russia. In accordance
with this approach, the rfist four years of education within the framework of each
professional orientation (corresponding to common specialties) are absolutely similar
in their content and volume. Students, having completed the four-year syllabus,
receive a Bachelors' degree in geology and may continue their education to get a
Masters' degree (admission is competitive, 5-6th year of education) or a Specialist
(5th year). Altogether in the years from 1998 to 2007, the Chair prepared 178 people
in higher education: 119 Specialists, 51 Masters (3 of these were from China), and 8
Bachelors (6 from China). The preparation of students in the context of the specialty
Hydrogeology and engineering geology was realized through the specialties Engineering
geology, Soil science and articfiial lithogenesis , and Protection of the geological
environment. The rfist of these was successfully acquired by 69 people; the second,
by 2, and the third, by 25 persons; these each received a Specialists' degree. The
program Engineering geology was nfiished by 25 Masters, and 8 people got a Masters'
degree in Soil science and articfiial lithogenesis . Note that since the 2000-2001
academic year, education is occurring according to a new curriculum in compliance
with the State Educational Standard for specialty 011400: Hydrogeology and
engineering geology. This caused the need to develop a series of new courses and
revise previous ones. The curricula of all specialties were renovated with regard to
the requirements of the SES in force. All these methodical considerations were
included in collected volumes regularly published by the geological faculty of MSU.
In 2000 the Curricula and Syllabi and Educational and Practical Training were
published, and in 2002 Graduate Studies and State Examination. In 2004, a revised and
corrected edition of Curricula and Syllabi and Specializations and Masters' Programs
were published, which included curricula and programs of the courses of t"he right
side " along with abstracts of subjects of specializations and Masters' programs on
engineering geology delivered by the Chair. The preparation of students in the
Bachelors' program in the Ecological geology specialty was started by the geological
faculty in 1994 and in the Masters' program, in 1998. However, specialty 013300,
Ecological geology, as an experimental specialty was organized at MSU by the order of
the RF Ministry of Education only in October 1999. In 2000, the State Educational
Standard of specialty Ecological geology 013300 was approved for the rfist time. It
was elaborated mainly by members of the Geological Faculty and adjusted with
standards of other geological specialties in humanitarian and natural science
disciplines, differing in a larger number of hours for biological and chemical
courses. In respect to common professional subjects, the SES of the specialty
Ecological geology comprised 17 courses compulsory for all geological specialties
(including Ecological geology) and 13 new courses absent in the curricula of other
specialties. Among them are: F"undamentals of geoecology, " L"andscape science, "
S"oil science, " M"eteorology and hydrology, " E"cological geodynamics, " E"cological
hydrogeology and hydrochemistry, " E"cological geochemistry, " E"cological expertise,
" I"ndustrial Ecology, " H"uman ecology (medical aspects), " L"egal foundations of
the use of subsoil and protection of subsurface resources, "E"conomics of nature
management, "and P"rinciples of ecological geological exploration." A set of syllabus
projects for the specialty (differing from the syllabi in Bachelors ' preparation of
the specialization Geology) was presented to the Ministry of Education and approved
in 2000. The syllabi of special disciplines were revised based on the teaching
experience at MSU and SPbSU (St. Petersb. State Univ.) and reapproved by the Ministry
of Education in 2002. Among the authors of syllabi and curricula are many lecturers
of the Chair of engineering and ecological geology. These methodical elaborations
were published in the form of an abstract in the mentioned SES and collected issues
of the geological faculty of MSU. In the last decade, 23 people with a Specialists'
degree in ecogeology graduated from the Chair. Fifteen students successfully received
a Masters' degree. Furthermore, the Chair staff elaborated a syllabus of a refresher
course Engineering and ecological geology of oil and gas basins, and also the
syllabus and curriculum of the innovative Masters' project Ecological geology of
territories disturbed techogenically (TDT) in the context of the program Formation of
the system of innovative education at Lomonosov MSU. In the framework of this
project, the Chair staff has developed syllabi for new disciplines: Ecological
geology of TDT, Patterns in the formation of ecological functions of the lithosphere,
Estimation of changes in the ecological geological conditions under technogenic
impact, Riskanalysis of technocratically developed territories, Ecological geological
mapping of TDT, Ecological geodynamics of TDT, Problems in predicting changes in the
geological environment in the TDT limits, Geological factors of ecological risk,
Ecological geological conditions of Russia, Physicochemical methods of investigating
the components of ecological geological systems and ecological interpretation of
results, Geochemical factors of ecological risk and microelements, and Contamination
of TDT soils and their puricfiation . During the period from 1996 to 2006, 40 persons
entered the post-graduate degree course of the Chair. It was completed by 15 people,
and 13 of them successfully defended candidate dissertations. Moreover, candidate
dissertations were defended by 2 members of the Chair and one attached to the
post-graduate degree course. During this period, a number of textbooks and teaching
manuals were published: textbooks by Tro-fi mov and Ziling Ecological geology (2002),
Kalinin Engineering geological calculations and simulation (2006), Soil science (6th
edition, Tromfiov, Korolev, Voznesenskii, Golodkovskaya, Vasilc'huk, Ziangirov, ed.

scienticfi research study of the Chair was carried out in two aspects, the Theory of
formation of engineering geological conditions of the Earth and their evolution in
the epoch of technogenesis and Development of theoretical principles of the doctrine
on ecological functions of the lithosphere. In the context of the rfist aspect, 12
themes were developed, and 2 themes of the second were developed as well [Tromfiov,
1998]. Eight themes were reported; there were publications, including monographic
ones. The study on classifying the Earths' engineering geological structural features
resulted in the publishing of the monograph Engineering Geological Structures of the
Earth (authors Tromfiov, Averkina, Spiridonov, 2001). The monograph Engineering
Geology and Ecological GeologyT-heoretical Methodological Principles and
Interrelation (1999) nfiished the development of the eponymous theme by Tromfiov and
Ziling. The books G"enesis of Loess Soil Subsidence " (Tromfiov, 1999) and L"oess
Cover on the Earth and Its Properties "(2001) are the results of the development made
by Tromfiov, Andreeva, Balykova, and Ershova of the theme Loess Cover on the Earth
and Its Engineering Geological Peculiarities. The monograph E"cological functions of
the lithosphere " (Tromfiov, Ziling, Baraboshkina, Bogoslovskii, Zhigalin, Khark'ina,
et al., 2000) was written in the course of elaborating the theme Developing the
Theoretical Foundations of the Doctrine of Ecological Functions of the
Lithosphere.<component x="49.6" y="308.29" width="241.01" height="427.2" page="5"

themes of the performed studies supported by techogenic product permitted the
teaching manual the program F"undamental Studies of Higher Schools. They were as
follows: C"omposition, structure, properties, and patterns of clay mineral
transformation under different conditions of dia- and epigenesis "(Voznesenskii);
E"cological functions of the lithosphere " (Tro-fi mov); F"unctional analysis of
ecological geological systems: methodology, methods, exploration experience "
(Golodkovskaya); D"evelopment of unconventional principles and methods of prevention
and elimination of technogenic impact (damage, destruction, and pollution) on

themes, and assignment "(Ziling); S"imulation of dynamics and evolution of
engineering geological conditions during the technogenic epoch " (Spiridonov). E.A.
Voznesenskii performed the studies E"xtended energy approach in the dynamics of soils
"supported by the INTAS grant and L"ow-cost reduction of the environment pollution at
exploiting oil and gas efilds "supported by the Institute for Sustainable Communities
grant. Contract studies were developing as well. From 1996 to 1998, they were carried
out along with the Ministry of Natural Resources of Russia on the theme T"heoretical
fundamentals of ecological geology " and on the theme C"ontent and methods for next
generation ecological geological mapping, " in 1999. In 1998, the studies on the
theme E"stimation of landslide slope stability within the limits of Zagorsk SAPP
constructions during the initial period of exploitation "were nfiished. In 1999,
studies were performed within the framework of the new contract E"stimation of the
inuflence of engineering geological characteristics of soil masses on the landslide
slope stability within the limits of Zagorsk SAPP constructions under conditions of
the reconstructed drainage barrier." In 2000, the Chair accepted a new state budget
theme for vfie years (2000-2005) for implementation. Three themes were worked out at
the Laboratory of soil science and technical melioration: P"etrogenetic patterns in
the formation of rock properties (by the example of effusive and carbonate rocks)
"(scienticfi supervisor Golodkovskaya); S"imulation and prediction of the deformation
and destruction of soils under variable loads " (Voznesenskii); and S"tudy of
patterns in the formation of properties of clay soils as components of engineering
geological and ecological geological systems " (Korolev). The developments made in
the context of the latter were generalized by Korolev in his monograph Puricfiation
of Polluted Soils (2001). Studies were carried out at the Laboratory of geodynamics
and substantiation of engineering protection of territories on the theme P"atterns in
the formation, simulation, and prediction of downwarping and subsidence of the
Earths' crust in karst areas "(scienticfi supervisor Kalinin). Based on the obtained
data and also on materials of previous developments, they wrote and pubTechnogenic

Binder Soils Based on Their Mineral Structural and Thermodynamic Indices. Development
of Fundamental Principles of Modeling and Predicting Behavior of Clay Soils in the
Technogenic Zone for Optimization of Exploration and Solution of Ecological Problems
(Korolev, Sokolov, Shlykov, et al.); Patterns in the Formation of Engineering

researchers and lecturers of the Chair actively carried out, along with state budget
themes, scienticfi studies and projects supported by grants received on a competitive
basis from various foundations (RFBR, FSP I"ntegration, "RF Ministry of Science and
Education, program U"niversities of Russia, " INTAS, Institute for Sustainable
Communities, etc.). Thus, RFBR grants supported the following themes: T"ime effects
of deformation and destruction of soils " (supervisor Voznesenskii), C"lassicfiation
of engineering geological structures of the Earth and their characteristic "
(Tromfiov), L"ogical and actual diversity of engineering geological structures of the

consolidation of tailings were investigated (supervisor Krasilova, 2007), Two themes
were elaborated under the guidance of Yu.K. Vasilc'huk: H"istorical geological
patterns in formation of engineering geological peculiarities of rock masses with
syngenetic ice wedges during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene " and H"istorical
geological patterns in formation of engineering geological peculiarities of rock
masses of convex-hilly peat bogs during the Holocene. " The result of studies on the
former was Vasilc'huks' monograph Ice Wedges: Heterocyclicity, Heterochrony,
Heterogeneity (2006). At the Laboratory of ecological geology, studies were carried
out in the framework of two themes: D"evelopment of theoretical fundamentals of the
doctrine on ecological functions of the lithosphere " and A"nalysis of the current
state and development of fundamentals of ecological geological mapping. " In the
context of the former, after the monograph Ecological Functions of the Lithosphere
(2000), the teaching manual Transformation of Ecological Functions of the Lithosphere
during the Technogenic Epoch was published in 2006 (Tromfiov, Ziling, Baraboshkina,
Zhigalin, and Khark'ina). The results of the development of the latter theme and also
a contract study with the Russian Research Institute of Hydrogeology and Engineering
Geology (VSEGINGEO) can be found in the brochure Logic and Content of a Map of the
Current State of the Upper Horizon of the Earths' Crust as a Factual Base for
Ecological Geological Mapping (Tromfiov, Ziling, Baraboshkina, Bogoslovskii,
Zhigalin, Krasilova, and Khark'ina, 2004) and two editions of the teaching manual
E"cological Geological Maps "(Tro-fi mov, Ziling, Baraboshkina, Khark'ina, and
Zhigalin, 2002, 2007). From 2001 to 2005, the number of grants that supported the
studies performed by the Chair staff increased to 14. Let us name some of these
studies: T"ime effects of the deformation and destruction of soils " (supervisor
Voznesenskii), P"atterns in the formation of engineering geological properties of
volcanogenic soils in the lithicfiation process " (Frolova), manual Engineering
Geological Maps (Tromfiov and Korolev). The studies on the theme L"ogic and content
of the map of the current state of the geological environment as a factual base for
ecological geological mapping "by the contract with VSEGINGEO were carried out by
members of the Laboratory of ecological geology; 14 contracts on the study of
engineering geological and ecological geological conditions of concrete objects in
different parts of the country (European part, West Siberia, Kuznetsk Basin,
Sakhalin, etc.) and foreign countries (Moldavia) were performed under guidance of
E.A. Voznesenskii. The growth in the number of studies under economic agreements was
promoted the certification of the Chair Laboratory of soil science and technical
melioration of soils for technical competence in testing soils of natural
sedimentation, as well as soils and technogenic soils (including strengthened), and
also in analyzing the composition and properties of underground and surface waters,
which occurred in March 2005. The correspondence to main requirements of the GOST
RISO MEK 17025 for testing laboratories was conrfimed by the attestation certicfiate
No. 300.089. This extended opportunities to the Chair for attracting off-budget
studies under customers 'contracts, and also it provided the laboratory with modern
automatic devices for determination of physic and mechanical properties of soils. In
2006, the Chair accepted a new vfie-year statebudget scienticfi target for
investigations: I"nvestigation of diversity of engineering geological and ecological
geological conditions of Russia as a requisite for substantiation of rational use of
subsoil. "Its main item was creation of a monograph Engineering Geology of Russia
(scienticfi supervisor Tromfiov). It consisted of three volumes: Soils of Russia,
Engineering Geodynamics of Russia, and Engineering Geological Structures of Russia.
All lecturers and researchers of all the scienticfi laboratories of the Chair take
part in its creation. Development of the above scienticfi problem is facilitated by
investigations in the context of the project D"iversity of soils in Russia and
innovations in managing their state and properties " (scienticfi supervisor Tromfiov,
executive in charge Voznesenskii). The entitlement for this project was won in a
competition held V.D. Kharitonov, and Bershov); M"onitoring of the by the
departmental target program D"evelopment of ecological situation within experimental
ground Closing this section, Id' like to note that in the last decade publications of
the Chair members were supported by RFBR publishing grants: Voznesenskii Dynamic
Instability of Soils (Publishing House Editorial URSS, 1999); Korolev Puricfiation of
Polluted Soils (Publishing House MAIK N"auka/Interperiodika, " 2001); Grigore'va

Tromfiov Subsidence Formation Theory of Loess Rocks (Publishing House GEOS, 2003);
Tro-fi mov and Averkina Theoretical Fundamentals of Regional Engineering Geology
(Publishing House GEOS, 2007). The publishing grant of the federal target program
S"tate support for the integration of higher education and fundamental science in
1997-2000 "was given to a monograph by Vasilc'huk and Kotlyakov Principles of
Isotopic Geocryology and Glaciology (Publishing House of Moscow University, 2000),
and a grant of the federal target program I"ntegration of science and higher
education of Russia in 2002-2006" was received for a monograph by Vasilc'huk Ice
Wedges: Heterocyclicity, Heterochrony, Heterogeneity (Publishing House of Moscow
University, 2006). SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITY OF THE CHAIR MEMBERS Since
1998, the Chair has organized and held 9 international scienticfi conferences on
various problems, including the most topical ones, of engineering and ecological
geology at the geological faculty of Lomonosov MSU. Let us give the titles of these
conferences. They are: G"enesis and models for formation of soil properties "(May
1998); T"heoretical problems of engineering geology " (May 25-26, 1999); 2"0th
Century: gfiures and schools in engineering geology "(May 2000); N"ovel types of
engineering geological and ecological geological maps " (May 2001); P"etrogenetic,
historical geological, and spatial problems in engineering geology " (May 28-29,
2002); D"iversity of soils: morphology, causes, and consequences " (May 27-28, 2003);
E"ngineering geology of masses of loess rocks" (May 25-26, 2004); P"roblems in
engineering geodynamics and ecological geodynamics " (February 2-3, 2006);
M"onitoring of geological, lithotechnical, and ecological geological systems "(May
24-25, 2007). The Chair staff actively participated in the organization of Sergeevs'
Readings. In the context of these readings, the memorial portion of the program was
held at the geological faculty. Here the Chair members and guests made reports on the
importance of E.M. Sergeevs' studies and their further development and shared their
memoirs about him. Six such sessions were held. The tradition of MSU school of

and Bershov). The theme E"cological geological conditions of Russia " is currently
worked out at the Laboratory of ecological geology in the framework of this problem.
The creation of the eponymous monograph is supposed in the issue, which must include
a series of original ecological geological maps as an essential component. Two more
principally new themes are being elaborated at the Laboratory of soil science and
technical melioration of soils owing to purchase of new expensive scienticfi
equipment: M"icro- and nanostructure of natural and articfiial soils: the role of
different phases in its formation " (executive in charge Sokolov) and I"nvestigation
of the nature and patterns of stress wave attenuations in soils "(Voznesenskii). This
state budget theme of the Chair was backed by development of related themes in the
framework of RFBR grants and studies under economic agreements. Thus, in 2006 the
studies supported by RFBR grants were performed on the themes T"ime effects in
deformation and destruction of soils "(supervisor Voznesenskii, executives Funikova,
Samarin, Bershov, Kushnareva, P.A. Yavlyaev, F.A. Provorov, D.V. Lagonskaya, and M.L.
Chernysheva), P"aleosoils and pedosystems of the Permian, Triassic, and Pleistocene:
comparative morphostructural analysis, reconstruction of paleopedogenesis and
paleolandscape conditions " (Sokolov), P"aleogeographic and paleoclimatic
reconstructions of Russian Arctic Zone based on correlation of isotopic diagrams
dated by radiocarbon of the late Pleistocene and Holocene ice wedges with isotopic
curves of Greenland " (supervisor Vasilc'huk, executives N.A. Budantseva, Yu.N.
Chizhova, and A.A. Zhuravleva). In recent years, the number of studies under the
economic agreement increased, especially at the Laboratory of soil science. In 2006,
the studies on the following themes were carried out: D"evelopment of new methods for
estimation of dynamic stability of roadbed soils " (Voznesenskii, Funikova, Samarin,
Bershov, Kushnareva, F.A. Provorov, and D.V. Lagonskaya); E"stimation of behavior of
soils at the building site for the expected dislocation of a MFFF-R plant under
dynamic loads " (Voznesenskii); E"xpertise of a report on exploration of open pits of
commonly occurring mineral resources in GP-4, GP-5, and GP-9 regions of Medvezhye
