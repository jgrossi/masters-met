enviAbstract ronmental and engineering geologic conditions exist in Fargo, North
Dakota. Dominantly, the behavior of smectitic clays within the proglacial Lake
Agassiz sediments of the Sherack and Brenna Formations creates subsoil instability
beneath engineered structures in the Fargo area and slope instability within cutbank
meanders of the Red River of the North. Unfavorable engineering geologic conditions
encountered include: the elastic deformation of clayey glaciolacustrine soils,
shrink-swell properties, inadequate bearing capacities, and mass movements. These
conditions are responsible for structural failures including the Fargo Grain Elevator
in 1955 and the Northern Pacific railroad grade. Bank failures along the Red River
are common due to the inherent instability of Brenna Formation smectitic clays which
are subject to plastic deformation in the subsurface, with resultant block failure of
overlying Sherack Formation. Recent alluvial sediments due to typical fluvial action
and the continued seasonal saturation of cutbank meanders within the floodplain also
add to soil instability. Clay soils &#xC6; Foundation Keywords failure &#xC6; Glacial

meanders along the Red River of the North along the North Dakota border with
Minnesota. Previous workers (Moran 1972; Arndt 1974; Schwert 1997, 2003) have
documented several significant engineering geologic conditions throughout the Red
River Valley. Some examples are the elastic deformation of clayey glaciolacustrine
soils, shrink-swell properties, inadequate bearing capacity, and mass movements.
Elastic deformation of clay-rich soils has been documented throughout the Red River
Valley. Under certain cases of loading and unloading, such as in the construction,
use, and subsequent failure of the Fargo grain elevator in 1955 (Fig. 8), soils
beneath the structure deform in response to the increased load upon them, resulting
in an adverse structural effect. Upon removal of the load, these materials restore to
their previous condition. Volumetric expansion of clayey rich soils under differing
moisture conditions has also been documented. During significantly wet periods,
subsurface soils increase in their capacity to accept water into their mineralogical
framework, with a resultant loss of bearing capacity. Conversely, during periods of
drought the opposite occurs, resulting in overall volumetric reduction of material.
Taken in concert, these changes in soil volume over time have the cumulative effect
of destroying the underlying foundation stability. Many structural failures have
occurred due to the inherent weakness of clay-rich soils in the Red River Valley and
their inability to accept uniform or nonuniform loads. Three significant failures
noted include the Transcona Elevator in Winnipeg, Manitoba (Peck and Bryant 1953),
the Fargo Grain Elevator in 1955 (Nordlund and Deere 1970), and the failure of the
Northern Pacific railroad grade, best chronicled by Schwert (1997). These types of
failures have occurred simply by the overloading of unstable foundation soils in the
subsurface, which deformed through an increase in load with a resultant decrease in
effective stress and increase in pore water pressure with further expansion of
materials around the structures (much like placing a brick in a box of mud). The
solution has been to drive supporting structures through the glacial lake sediments
into the more stable underlying subglacial sediments. Mass movements of unstable
soils within the Fargo area have also been extensively documented by Harris (2003)
and Schwert (2003). Failures of materials within cutbank meanders along the banks of
the Red River are persistent and common and are related to the inherent instability
of underlying Brenna Formation sediments which undergo plastic deformation in the
subsurface with the resultant block failure of overlying Sherack and recent alluvial
sediments and repeated seasonal flooding (Figs. 9, 10). If surrounding geology is
ignored in the construction of engineered works, then that geology will most
certainly assert its influence on any engineered structures.<component x="48.19"

materials around the structures (much like placing a brick in a box of mud). The
solution has been to drive supporting structures through the glacial lake sediments
into the more stable underlying subglacial sediments. Mass movements of unstable
soils within the Fargo area have also been extensively documented by Harris (2003)
and Schwert (2003). Failures of materials within cutbank meanders along the banks of
the Red River are persistent and common and are related to the inherent instability
of underlying Brenna Formation sediments which undergo plastic deformation in the
subsurface with the resultant block failure of overlying Sherack and recent alluvial
sediments and repeated seasonal flooding (Figs. 9, 10). If surrounding geology is
ignored in the construction of engineered works, then that geology will most
certainly assert its influence on any engineered structures.<component x="48.19"

majority of the engineering geologic problems that are encountered in the Fargo area
are the result of the inherent physical properties of the Glacial Lake Agassiz
offshore sediments and the underlying stratigraphic relationships of these materials.
Problem areas must be identified prior to site utilization and other areas with more
favorable geologic conditions considered. However, when the geologic condition is
pervasive and is common across a large pre-existing urbanized area (Arndt and Moran
1974) it may be possible to engineer around the problem, or more<component x="303.31"
