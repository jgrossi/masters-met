lies to the north of the Pan county basin. It belongs to the Upper Yangtze area,
bounded to the north by the Waterside town (Ya) Ziyun fault, and to the south by the
Mount Cock anticline. It runs from northwest to north-northwest, exhibiting a
ribbon-like shape. The traps were formed by the coal measures of the upper permian,
above which are the late and middle Triassic coasts. The cores of the syncline in the
east and west were formed by the upper Triassic series and Jurassic. The northern
alar was incised by northwestern and northeastern faults. The basin of Gemudi has an
area of 2 523 km of coal; the coal formation is 35 201 m thick, 413 m on average.
Commercial beds are buried less than 2 000 m deep, generally less than 1 500 m. The
main commercial beds are the Longtan formation and Changxing formation (Fig.1). A
lagoon, peat marsh, distributary channel, tide flat, tidal channel, delta front, sand
bank and marsh make up the transition environment. They are in an unconformable
contact with the underlying upper permian basalts and in conformable contact with the
overlying lower Triassic Feixianguan formation. 2 Coalbed methane occurrence
conditions in studying areas 2.1 Structural feature of the study area The Gemudi
syncline lies to the north of the Pan county basin, which is bounded to the north by
the Waterside town (Ya) Ziyun fault, to the south by the Mount Cock anticline,
exhibiting a ribbon-like shape. The coal measures of upper permian form the enclo-
Fig.1 The isopachous map of workable seam of Gemudi syncline sure. The western and
eastern cores of the Gemudi syncline are made up of the upper Triassic series and
Jurassic, above which are the late and middle Triassic coasts. The northern alar was
incised by northwestern and northeastern faults. The whole structure is complex and
belongs to medium-sized type (Huang, 1991). 2.2 Country rock conditions Coalbed
methane reservoirs need appropriate conditions for generating, storing and capping. A
gas- bearing formation is good at generating and storing coalbed methane. Cap rock,
specifically country rock condition, has a direct influence on the coalbed methane
reserve, and the properties of the country rock are decided by lithological
characteristics and ventilative power of the bed roof and floor. The Gemudi syncline
coal-bearing formation (including Longtan and Changxing formations) is located in the
paralic district, to the east of which is a shallow marine district, while to the
west is a continental deposit area (Ao, 2006). Mudstone and siltite make up the
primary part of lithology, occupying 41%~62% of the coal-bearing formation. The
lesser in this district is made of limestone, pack sand, and sandstone inserted
conglomerate. Mudstone, yakatagite and argillaceous sandstone make up the main part
of the lithology of the bed roof and floor. A single layer of mudstone, argillaceous
flour sand in this district is 4 to 12 m in thickness. It is a better cap rock in the
gas-bearing reservoir group that can transform the reserve layer into a good
enclosure. The lower Triassic series Feixianguan formation or Yelang formation,
belongs to the shallow bank marine deposit, having purple mudstone, argillaceous
flour sand rock inserted pack rock widespread; the thickness is constant, reaches 43
580 m thick, and is a good regional cap rock. Because of the very low carrying of
permeability at the Gemudi baseplate and good traps that can prevent the longitudinal
dissipation of coalbed methane, its country rock condition is very good for storing
coalbed methane. 2.3 Buried condition Generally speaking, it is more difficult for
coal- bed methane to escape outward with the increase of stratum pressure influenced
by the depth of the coal- bearing formation. Most coalbed methane exists in sorption
state and it is not easy for deep formations to form crannies, making the coalbed
methane well stored. According to wildcat materials outside the area, the content of
coalbed methane in the Gemudi syncline increases with increase of depth. It is
greater than 3 15 m /t of the content of the main working seam which is buried less
than 500 m deep. The contents of formations buried 800~1 000 m deep is constant, and
for formations that are about 200~1 500 m deep, the 2 coal seam area can reach 403 km
, coalbed methane 8 3 resource is about 2 063&#xD7;10 m , and resource abun8 3 2
dance degree is 5.20&#xD7;10 m /km . All these help store coalbed methane in the
aspects that the stratum coal seam is continuous and coal seam seldom appears. 2.4
Geohydrologic conditions The siltstone and pack stone of the Longtan formations in
the Gemudi synclinal keep the pressure- bearing crevice water, limestone stores the
karst crevice water; limestone has stronger permeability than sandstone. Watery
sandstone and limestone present intermediate layers lying in mudstone, sandy mudstone
and coal bearing formations, which are as thick as 45~65 m in total. Therefore, the
Longtan coal bearing formation shows weak watery characteristics. The Changxing coal
bearing formation where erosion crannies exist develops into a medium-sized rich
watery layer. A weak watery layer, and also the regional water barrier present are
Emeishan basalts at the bottom of the Longtan formations. The amount and velocity of
groundwater have a certain influence on the storage, exploitation and utilization of
coalbed methane. In the area where groundwater flows fast, coalbed methane relatively
reduces. The upside of the Feixianguan formation, which deposits on the Changxing
formation, also shows weak watery characteristics, so the whole area is very suitable
for cap rock superposition, forming multi-layer traps longitudinally. There are close
negative structural traps and possible sealing faults in the lateral direction. Water
power of the basin has a sys- tem of its own, enabling coalbed methane storage in
coal bearing formations. 3 The physical property of coal reservoir 3.1 Content of
coalbed methane New Star of the Chinese Petroleum Company has implemented a shallow
natural gas (including coalbed methane) evaluation and investigation project in the
western region of Guizhou Province, constructing 5 test pits, and has tried to drain
water and product gas. After conducting sand fracturing in 5 strata in Qianhong No.1
and No.2 well and Guimei No.1 well, the company started to drain water and product
gas for 7 months starting March 2000. The daily gas production of a single well was
dozens of cubic meters (Jiang, 2008). The gas production rate of Qianhong No.1well 3
/d, the cumulative gas production was was 29 to 38 m 3 . Meanwhile, the fluid
production rate was 7 258.5 m 3 /d and the cumulative fluid production 0 to 30.40 m 3
. The gas production rate of Qianhong was 294.48 m 3 /d, the cumulative gas No.2 well
was 2.10 to 10.20 m 3 , the fluid production rate production was 663.60 m 3 /d and
the cumulative fluid producwas 0 to 9.05 m 3 . The gas production rate of Guimei tion
was 67.86 m 3 /d, the cumulative gas No.1 well was 29.40 to 33.00 m 3 , the fluid
production rate production was 5 311.23 m 3 /d and the cumulative fluid prowas 8.65
to 26.95 m 3 . Total production of the 3 duction was 5 234.41 m 3 ; total liquid
production was wells was 13 253.33 m 3 . 5 596.75 m According to existing data, the
maximum gas 3 content in Gemudi Basin is 37.66 cm /g, the average 3 content is 12.84
cm /g, which has the tendency of high 3 in the south and low in the north; 19.03 cm
/g in the 3 south wing and 14.11 to 16.90 cm /g in the north wing(Fig.2).<component

lateness="0.75" reference_score="16.21">3.2 Characteristic of coal property The rank
of coal metamorphism's impact on the content of coalbed methane are mainly shown in
two aspects: First, with the increasing of the degree of coalification, the amount of
coalbed methane increases gradually, reaching a maximum by anthracite stage. Studies
have suggested that the total production of 3 coalbed methane can reach 4 000 m /t as
the coal turns into anthracite. Second, the absorbing amount of coalbed methane of
the coal seam increases constantly as the degree of coalification rises by anthracite
stage. Inside the coal seam, it produces a large number of pores, joints and
microcracks, which lead to the adsorbtion surface area reaching the maximum. The gas
3 content of the coal seam can reach 40 m /t. Therefore, the high degree of coal
metamorphism created conditions for the formation and accumulation of coalbed
methane. The higher the rank of coal metamorphism is, the bigger the gas content of
the coal seam is. The coal lithotype of Longtan group in the Gemudi coal Basin
includes half clarain, bright coal mixed with semidull coal; the group of Changxing
consists of semidull-half bright coal. Coal luster strengthens from east to west in
the Gemudi Basin Shuicheng area, half clarain and clarain increase; the coal
lithotype of Liuzhi Basin is mainly half clarain. Coal macerals are mainly vitrinite
(38.4%~98.6%); the content of vitrinite is greater than 50%, except for parts of the
Gemudi Basin and Liuzhi Basin. The intertinite takes up 1.4% to 59.3%, except for
some parts of the Gemudi Basin and Liuzhi Basin which are greater than 45%, the
others are smaller than 10%. The content of exinite and inertinite in the Qianxi coal
Basin is very high, the content of inertinite is 21.0% to 44.8%, among which fusinite
and half fusinite have comparative advantage, the content of exinite is 6.0% to 8.5%.
The ash content of the coal rock is 14.63% to 38.21%, belonging to ash coal and is
partly bone coal. The northeast is slightly low, while the southwest is relatively
high, general ash content is 20% to 30%. 3.3 Coal seam porosity and permeabilities
(1) Porosity The microstructure determination of the Gemudi coal sample by mercury
intrusion porosimetry indicated that there is a spike of mercury intrusion when the
pressure is under 0.1 MPa, another peak appeared when the pressure transited to 10
MPa. This proves that the coal rock has a double pore structural characteristic. We
determined 16 samples, with 6 samples having macropore as the core; the others are
with fine pore and micropore. Coal rock cryogenic nitrogen adsorption and desorption
test proved that it contains storage pore and open space in the coal; the

of gas in the coal rock pore. The cryogenic nitrogen adsorption determined pore
volume and average pore diameter and proved that the pore volume and average pore
diameter distribution rewidespread, and have a strong randomness. The specific
surface area of the coal 2 sample is determined to be 0.1 m /g. The northwest area of
the Gemudi Basin is like a long band, and the development of cleat is quite different
as the direction and intensity of stress in every part is different. According to the
macroscopic and microscopic statistical analysis of the coal seam (Table 1), the
direction of the main cleat and outstanding tectonic direction are roughly the same,
though with a slight offset; the direction of cleat development still varies with
structural trend. The direction of secondary cleats is basically identical with
secondary structure line. Thus, the porosity in this area is comparatively good, and
is favorable to adsorption and deposition of coalbed methane. Table 1 Statistical
form of cleats in Gemudi synclinal colliery<component x="56.7" y="463.25"

influences air output during the development of coalbed methane is the permeability
of the coal beam. In the area where the structure stress is close, it is relatively
low, while in the area where the structure stress is lax the permeability is high.
The coefficient of permeability of coal seam in 2 2 &#x2022; Shuicheng, Gemudi is
0.17 m /(MPa d). The coal seam permeability in this district is relatively low, 3
generally smaller than 0.1&#xD7;10 m and not exceed3 3 of the coal seam is

coal deposit condition is similar and the coefficient of 3 2 th permeability of coal
seam is 0.81&#xD7;10 m on the 9 coal seam, with developing cracks and high porosity
in this district, we can conclude that the coefficient of permeability of coal seam
in Gemudi is relatively high too. 4 Conclusions (1) The coalbed methane occurrence
conditions at the Gemudi syncline is good. The adjacent rock is mainly mudstone and
siltstone in the study area with a good capped ability. It will be difficult for the
coalbed methane in the coal reservoir to escape; the buried depth of minable seam and
main minable seam is generally smaller than 1 000 m, the depth is moderate. The
activity of ground water is weak, and every coal seam has independent ground water
regime and the connectivity is not very good, which promotes coalbed methane
accumulation. (2) The physical property of the coal reservoir of the Gemudi syncline
is good. The gas content of the coal reservoir in the study area is high, the maximum
3 3 is 37.66 cm /g, the average is 12.84 cm /g. The coal is mainly meager coal and
lean coal, the rank of coal metamorphism is relatively high; pore sand crack
abundance is relatively high, the permeability of most 3 2 main mineral seam exceeds
0.1&#xD7;10 m . (3) In sum, the coal reservoir in the Gemudi syncline in the west of
Guizhou Province has good coalbed methane hosting feature and physical property. The
most suitable place for coalbed methane exploration and exploitation lies in the
southeast of the study area. References Ao C, 2006. The hosting features of coalbed

of coal metamorphism's impact on the content of coalbed methane are mainly shown in
two aspects: First, with the increasing of the degree of coalification, the amount of
coalbed methane increases gradually, reaching a maximum by anthracite stage. Studies
have suggested that the total production of 3 coalbed methane can reach 4 000 m /t as
the coal turns into anthracite. Second, the absorbing amount of coalbed methane of
the coal seam increases constantly as the degree of coalification rises by anthracite
stage. Inside the coal seam, it produces a large number of pores, joints and
microcracks, which lead to the adsorbtion surface area reaching the maximum. The gas
3 content of the coal seam can reach 40 m /t. Therefore, the high degree of coal
metamorphism created conditions for the formation and accumulation of coalbed
methane. The higher the rank of coal metamorphism is, the bigger the gas content of
the coal seam is. The coal lithotype of Longtan group in the Gemudi coal Basin
includes half clarain, bright coal mixed with semidull coal; the group of Changxing
consists of semidull-half bright coal. Coal luster strengthens from east to west in
the Gemudi Basin Shuicheng area, half clarain and clarain increase; the coal
lithotype of Liuzhi Basin is mainly half clarain. Coal macerals are mainly vitrinite
(38.4%~98.6%); the content of vitrinite is greater than 50%, except for parts of the
Gemudi Basin and Liuzhi Basin. The intertinite takes up 1.4% to 59.3%, except for
some parts of the Gemudi Basin and Liuzhi Basin which are greater than 45%, the
others are smaller than 10%. The content of exinite and inertinite in the Qianxi coal
Basin is very high, the content of inertinite is 21.0% to 44.8%, among which fusinite
and half fusinite have comparative advantage, the content of exinite is 6.0% to 8.5%.
The ash content of the coal rock is 14.63% to 38.21%, belonging to ash coal and is
partly bone coal. The northeast is slightly low, while the southwest is relatively
high, general ash content is 20% to 30%. 3.3 Coal seam porosity and permeabilities
(1) Porosity The microstructure determination of the Gemudi coal sample by mercury
intrusion porosimetry indicated that there is a spike of mercury intrusion when the
pressure is under 0.1 MPa, another peak appeared when the pressure transited to 10
MPa. This proves that the coal rock has a double pore structural characteristic. We
determined 16 samples, with 6 samples having macropore as the core; the others are
with fine pore and micropore. Coal rock cryogenic nitrogen adsorption and desorption
test proved that it contains storage pore and open space in the coal; the

of gas in the coal rock pore. The cryogenic nitrogen adsorption determined pore
volume and average pore diameter and proved that the pore volume and average pore
diameter distribution rewidespread, and have a strong randomness. The specific
surface area of the coal 2 sample is determined to be 0.1 m /g. The northwest area of
the Gemudi Basin is like a long band, and the development of cleat is quite different
as the direction and intensity of stress in every part is different. According to the
macroscopic and microscopic statistical analysis of the coal seam (Table 1), the
direction of the main cleat and outstanding tectonic direction are roughly the same,
though with a slight offset; the direction of cleat development still varies with
structural trend. The direction of secondary cleats is basically identical with
secondary structure line. Thus, the porosity in this area is comparatively good, and
is favorable to adsorption and deposition of coalbed methane. Table 1 Statistical

influences air output during the development of coalbed methane is the permeability
of the coal beam. In the area where the structure stress is close, it is relatively
low, while in the area where the structure stress is lax the permeability is high.
The coefficient of permeability of coal seam in 2 2 &#x2022; Shuicheng, Gemudi is
0.17 m /(MPa d). The coal seam permeability in this district is relatively low, 3
generally smaller than 0.1&#xD7;10 m and not exceed3 3 of the coal seam is
0.69&#xD7;10 ing 0.61&#xD7;10 m. As the coefficient of permeability 2 m in the

coal deposit condition is similar and the coefficient of 3 2 th permeability of coal
seam is 0.81&#xD7;10 m on the 9 coal seam, with developing cracks and high porosity
in this district, we can conclude that the coefficient of permeability of coal seam
in Gemudi is relatively high too. 4 Conclusions (1) The coalbed methane occurrence
conditions at the Gemudi syncline is good. The adjacent rock is mainly mudstone and
siltstone in the study area with a good capped ability. It will be difficult for the
coalbed methane in the coal reservoir to escape; the buried depth of minable seam and
main minable seam is generally smaller than 1 000 m, the depth is moderate. The
activity of ground water is weak, and every coal seam has independent ground water
regime and the connectivity is not very good, which promotes coalbed methane
accumulation. (2) The physical property of the coal reservoir of the Gemudi syncline
is good. The gas content of the coal reservoir in the study area is high, the maximum
3 3 is 37.66 cm /g, the average is 12.84 cm /g. The coal is mainly meager coal and
lean coal, the rank of coal metamorphism is relatively high; pore sand crack
abundance is relatively high, the permeability of most 3 2 main mineral seam exceeds
0.1&#xD7;10 m . (3) In sum, the coal reservoir in the Gemudi syncline in the west of
Guizhou Province has good coalbed methane hosting feature and physical property. The
most suitable place for coalbed methane exploration and exploitation lies in the
southeast of the study area. References Ao C, 2006. The hosting features of coalbed
