remote-sensing technologies in topic (3) were applied effectively to mapping of
mineral compositions in porphyry copper belts by Sanga and co-authors; and to
detection of highly susceptible landslide areas by Ueki and co-authors. The posters
had wider topics areas than the oral presentations. Main topics were informatic and
probabilistic appraisals of natural resources, geostatistical modeling of ore
deposits, numerical simulation for basin modeling, integration of diverse geologic
information, and statistical characterization of rock fractures and mineral textures.
I hope that the participants were able to follow the advances and new trends in
mathematical geology for natural resource exploration through both the oral and
poster presentations. As a result of a request made to all session speakers after the
32nd IGC, the papers in this special issue were submitted for peer review. I
sincerely thank the authors submitting to this issue for their effort and diligence,
and the following reviewers for their valuable comments that contributed greatly to
edit this special issue: Tetsuya Shoji (Univ. Tokyo), Donald Singer (USGS), Jorge
Yamamoto (Univ. Sao Paulo), Roussos Dimitrakopoulos (McGill Univ.), Scott Margaretha
(Univ. Queensland), Sumihiko Murata and Youqing Chen (Kyoto Univ.), Weiren Lin
(JAMSTEC), Shuichiro Yokota (Shimane Univ.), Nina Gorelikova (Russian Acad.
Sciences), Sinding-Larsen (Norwegian Univ. Science and Technology), John Schuenemeyer
(Southwest Statistical Consulting), and Chen Jianping (China Univ. Geosciences).
Sincere thanks are extended to Ryoichi Kouda (Geological Survey of Japan) and
Toshiaki Ueki (Ocean High Technology Institute Inc.) for their efforts in making the
session a success. Papers late for this issue will appear in a subsequent issue of
the journal. The next ISME symposium (ISME-IX) will be held 19-20 September 2006 at
the Institute of Technology Bandung (ITB), Indonesia, with the title "Toward New
Frontiers for Resource Exploration &amp; Sustainable Development." For sustainable
development, new technologies of resources exploration are becoming of the utmost
importance. The symposium will cover all aspects that contribute to innovative
technologies in resource exploration. I encourage readers to take part in the ISME-IX
and to exchange ideas on the exploration, development, and the use of natural
resources.<component x="67.84" y="369.6" width="227.17" height="344.2" page="2"
