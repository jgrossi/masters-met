shield particularly the granite-greenstone terrain of the Dharwar craton is a complex
amalgamation of the Western and the Eastern Dharwar cratons (WDC, EDC) respectively.
The intricate relationship between the gneisses and supracrustals from parts of the
Dharwar craton continues to be debated (e.g. Swami Nath and Ramakrishnan, 1981; Naqvi
and Rogers, 1987; Ramakrishnan, 1994; Radhakrishna and Vaidyanadhan, 1997;
Ramakrishnan and Vaidyanadhan, 2008). The same is true for the gneissic rocks that
belong to various episodes that have been broadly included under the Peninsular
Gneissic Complex. A systematic study of the gneissic complex and its relationship
with the greenstones from critical areas can yield significant information on the
Precambrian crustal evolution and the palaeo-tectonics of this region. Goa is
situated in the northwestern part of the WDC where t he Shi moga-Goa supracrust al
bel t ext ends contiguously until it is concealed beneath the Arabian Sea and the
Deccan Traps in the north. The belt possibly continues beneath the Traps up to the
Narmada, where the Narmada-Son lineament terminates this supracrustal belt. The
Shimoga-Goa belt extends NNW-SSE over a length of approximately 250 km and has a
maximum width of about 120 km at Dharwar. The western margin of the belt is marked by
large domal masses of gneissose rocks such as the Chandranath granite gneiss and the
Canacona granite. The eastern margin is faulted, whereas the southern section appears
to have been deposited in shallow waters. The latter is associated with subaerial
mafic volcanic rocks at Kumbharwada, and north of Karwar and Ankola. The thickest
accumulation of mafic volcanics of this schist belt is, however, centred at Bababudan
and Kudremukh which forms the southern extensions of this belt (Harinadha Babu et al.
1981a). A thick sequence of greywackes occupy the northern section of the basin. The
southern section in general, is characterized by orthoquartzite/basic lava
association that denotes subaerial environments and intermittent volcanic activity in
a coastal sand environment under stable conditions. The limestone-iron-manganese ore
sequence of Goa and north Kanara (Castlerock band) in the northern part (Maclaran,
1904) of the Shimoga belt is in physical continuity with that in the southern part
and serves as the marker horizon to show the continuity of the rocks over the entire
length of the belt. The granitic-gneisses from Goa were assigned either a syntectonic
or post-tectonic status (Harinadha Babu et al. 1981a; Gokul et al. 1985) in relation
to the deformational episodes exhibited by the supracrustals. However, there is a
considerable lack of clarity as regards the interrelationship among the granitic
gneisses on the one hand and between the gneisses and the supracrustal greenstones on
the other. The supracrustal sequences in particular, consist of metavolcanics and
clastics each with peculiarities of its own, yet both have been included under one
stratigraphic group namely the Goa Group (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985).<component

examined by Fermor (1909) and later by Dunn (1942). A formal stratigraphic
classification was, however, provided by Oertal (1958) who divided the rocks into two
groups: (i) the lower infraconglomerate group and (ii) the upper metalliferous group.
The granitic rocks occurring at Quepem, Canacona and Dudhsagar were considered by him
to be intrusive into the schistose rocks. The Goa region in general, is largely
occupied by schistose rocks (Pascoe, 1950; Dhepe, 1954) but for the northeastern
corner of the State where Deccan Traps (late Cretaceous to Eocene) overlie the
Dharwar metasediments. Recent geological mapping (GSI, 1996) has shown that the basal
sequences are made of metavolcanics with intercalations of metasediments overlain by
a larger proportion of clastics, dominated by greywackes. In these respects, they are
similar to the Dharwar-type greenstones of Radhakrishna and Vaidyanadhan (1997).
Gokul et al. (1985) proposed a modern scheme of stratigraphic classification and
grouped the lithounits of Goa into four formations. The stratigraphic succession
proposed by Gokul et al. (1985) is presented in Table 1 along with the proposed
revision. In their scheme of classification all the granitic gneisses and the
granites from Goa were considered coeval and intrusive into the metasediments (e.g.
Harinadha Babu et al. 1981b; Gokul et al. 1985). The basement for the supracrustal
sequence was not clearly identified. The Goa Group typically has a greenstone
dominated sequence at the base which is overlain by a metaconglomerate over which
rests a dominantly clastic sequence. The metaconglomerate (tilloid) was assigned the
status of a para-conglomerate. The granitic gneisses in Goa are exposed at four
different localities and are referred to as (i) Chandranath granite gneiss, (ii)
Tamdi felspathic gneiss, (iii) Dudhsagar granite, and (iv) Canacona granite. They are
all considered as intrusives into the supracrustals (greenstones) by Gokul et al.
(1985). The Chandranath granite gneiss was considered to be syntectonic with the
first phase of folding, the Tamdi felspathic gneiss and the Dudhsagar granite were
considered to be synkinematic with the second phase, whereas the Canacona granite was
considered to be post-tectonic (Gokul et al. 1985). In the light of the recent work
(Dhoundial et al. 1987; Devaraju et al. 2007, 2010; Dessai et al. 2009) especially on
the granitic gneisses, greenstones and the intrusive granites from representative
sections, it is proposed to revisit the classification of the greenstones from this
area. The Goa Group of Gokul et al. (1985) needs to be integrated (see also Devaraju
et al. 2010) with the contiguous Dharwar Supergroup of WDC, as otherwise it would
give an erroneous impression of forming a separate stratigraphic entity within the
Dharwar craton. The Goa Group (e.g Gokul et al. 1985) denotes a local classification
confined to Goa and is here devided into two groups namely the Barcem Group and the
Ponda Group which correspond respectively to the Bababudan and Chitradurga Groups of
the Dharwar Supergroup in the unified regional classification. The proposed
stratigraphic scheme is listed in Table 1.<component x="56.64" y="98.36"

exposed at Anmode (Tamdi felspathic gneiss of Gokul et al. 1985) along the
Panaji-Belgaum National Highway (NH 4A) and is amongst the oldest gneisses from India
that has yielded an Rb/Sr whole-rock age of 3400-140 Ma (Dhoundial et al. 1987).
Recent Sm-Nd and U-Pb work has provided ages of about 3300 Ma (Devaraju et al. 2007).
Temporally the gneiss is nearly equivalent to the Gorur Gneiss from Hassan district
of Karnataka [34 point Rb/Sr isochron age of 3315-54 Ma (Beckinsale et al. 1980);
with 87 86 very low Sr/ Sr ratio of 0.7006] that has yielded an equally older age.
These grey gneisses, that are older than 3,000 Ma, are included along with the
younger ones (~ 2600 Ma) under the Peninsular Gneissic Complex. It consists of a
complex assemblage of migmatites, gneisses and granitoids and forms a back-drop for
the schist belts scattered within the gneisses. Most workers agree to its polyphase
and polymigmatitic nature, which has been supported in recent years by isotope
studies and radiometric dating. The Anmode Ghat gnei ss i s fi ne grai ned, granul at

the extraction of partial melt that formed the TTG suite. The hornblende within the
schistosity defines a preferred WNW-ESE Chandranath Granite Gneiss :It is exposed at
Paroda, Quepem (Gokul and Srinivasan, 1976) and extends in general E-W from Sanguem
in the east to Colva-Banaulim in the west over a length of more than 22 km and is
over 11 km wide. It is well foliated, the foliation trends NE-SW and o dips by 50
east. Gokul et al. (1985) and Dhoundial et al. (1987) considered it to be intrusive,
synkinematically with the first phase of folding of the metasediments. However,
distinct intrusive relationship between the gneiss and the metasediments is no where
available for observation (also Ramakrishnan, per.comm.). It is a grey granitic
gneiss that varies in composition from granodiorite to quartz-diorite. The Rb/Sr age
obtained for it is 2650-100 Ma (Dhoundial et al. 1987). Recent SmNd isotope studies
provide model ages of about 2900 Ma (Devaraju et al. 2007) indicating that the
protoliths are either younger than the trondhjemites or are less enriched in light
rare earth elements. A similar gneiss exposed along the eastern border of the State
and referred to as the Londa migmatitic gneiss is considered to be contemporaneous
with the Chandranath granite gneiss. The recent age data (e.g. Devaraju et al. 2010)
suggest that these gneisses are distinctly younger that the basement trondhjemite
gneisses Canacona Granite: It is exposed at Char Rasta-Chauri, Palolem and Agonda, in
Canacona taluka (Srinivasan and Gopalakrishnan, 1985). Harinadha Babu et al. (1981b)
and Gokul et al. (1985) have included this granite as equivalent to the Chandranath
granite gneiss. As per the latest geological and mineral map of Goa (GSI, 1996), the
granite is depicted as intrusive into the TTG gneisses. It has been dated at 2395-390
Ma (e.g. Dhoundial et al. 1987), however, due to the large error factor, the age data
are rather suspect. The granite is distinctly late, unfoliated, and exhibits a
discordant relationship with the WNW-ESE foliation of the older TTG gneiss/migmatite
(Fig. 1). It is potassic in comparison with the host gneiss/migmatite which is
strongly foliated, and relatively sodic. Exposures at Palolem and Agonda occur as
bosses and plutons. The contacts are sheared, patches and shreds of older gneiss can
be traced on either sides of the younger intrusive phase. The granite is coarse to

evidence of plastic and brittle deformation. The granite can be traced up to Palolem
sea shore in the west and continues north up to Agonda. In the south it occurs
discontinuously up to Polem and even beyond to Sadashivgarh and Karwar in Karnataka.
Enclaves and rafts of metasediments are invariably intruded by aplite-pegmatite
veins. The rock is often porphyritic with megacrysts and phenocrysts of microcline,
perthitic feldspar and plagioclase in a groundmass dominated by quartz, biotite and
hornblende. Felspar megacrysts surround and include plagioclase and biotite of older
generation. New K-felspar (microcline) has grown and it is interconnected with
similar phases probably indicating melt injection. The rock is high in K (2.91-3.7
wt% K O; Na O/K O: 0.57), Rb (103-162 2 22 ppm) and moderate Sr (118-250 ppm)

2395-390 Ma, but the dates cannot be considered definitive. However, considering its

lateness="0.9" reference_score="9.17">In the light of the aforesaid, a revision of
the classification of the Goa Group (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985) is warranted. The
lithological characteristics of the supracrustal rocks permit the subdivision of the
Goa Group (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985) into two sequences of greenstones (Fig.2). The
lower sequence that rests on the TTG gneisses with a quartz-pebble conglomerate is
largely dominated by mafic volcanics with intercalated clastics. It was designated as
the Barcem Formation of the Goa Group by Gokul et al. (1985). This sequence is
elevated to the status of a 'Group' which is formally named as the Barcem Group. The
'Group' as per the provisions of international stratigraphic guide (Hedberg, 1976,
p.34) should consist of more than one Formation. However, considering the
lithological and the facies variation within the Barcem Formation, it is felt that
detailed mapping may eventually lead to its division into more than one Formation. It
bears many similarities with the lower part of the Kalaspura Formation of the
Bababudan Group. The upper sequence of supracrustals, that makes up the three
formations namely the Sanvordem, Bicholim and Vagheri, is assigned to a new
stratigraphic group for which the formal term Ponda Group is proposed. This seems to
be appropriate and reasonable. Moreover, the correlation of this group with the
Chitradurga Group of the Dharwar Supergroup is justified in agreement with Gokul et
al. (1985). The characteristics of the lithounits are described below. Barcem Group
The newly identified Barcem Group is best developed to the southeast of Barcem
village and account for a thickness of over 2 km, however, in the northwest between
Margao and Vasco-da-Gama the rocks attain a thickness of about 2.5 km (Ram Das and
Ramprasad Rao, 2001). It has a quartzpebble conglomerate at the base and the
lithounits consist of metavolcanics with intercalations of quartzites and pelites.
The volcanics are represented by basic and felsic (?) lavas, agglomerates and tuffs.
The metasediments consist of quartzites, quartz-sericite-schists,
quartz-chlorite-schists and minor phyllites. Non-vesicular metabasalts are exposed
around Astagal, Polem, Padi and Subdalem in the south and Tisk (Usgao)Dharbandora in
central Goa. Vesicular metabasalts are exposed to the north of Gulem, at Barcem and
along the Saleri-Vagon road in Canacona taluka. At places phyllitic intercalations
are noticed. These probably represent the metamorphosed tuffs. Well preserved pillow
lavas are described from Gokuldem-Maina section (Gokul et al. 1985). The basalts at
the base of the Mormugao headland are schistose and at places vesicular. Those from
Bogmalo are vesicular, amygdaloidal and are dominated by pyroxene and at places
contain olivine (Devaraju et al. 2010). The basalts in general, consist of
saussuritised plagioclase and uralitised pyroxene forming actinolite, chlorite,
epidote, clinozoisite along with opaques. Metavolcanics that could be silicic lavas
or pyroclasts are exposed at Barcem. They are represented by quartzsericite-schists
and quartz porphyry. At places they are crushed and contain porphyroclasts of quartz
in a pulvurised quartz-sericite matrix. Ponda Group The Ponda Group is best developed
around Ponda town where most of the lithologies are well exposed. It comprises three
formations which in ascending order are the Sanvordem Formation, Bicholim Formation
and the Vagheri Formation, all of which are dominated by clastics with very
subordinate mafics only in the Vagheri Formation. Around Ponda, the total thickness
of this group is about 8.8 km (Ram Das and Ramprasad Rao, 2001). Sanvordem Formation:
The Sanvordem Formation rests on the Chandranath granite gneiss with a polymict met
acongl omerat e at t he base and compri ses metagreywacke, and argillites. The
conglomerate consists of stretched and elongated pebbles of quartzite and gneiss in a
schistose chlorite matrix. The proportion of lithologies varies considerably from
place to place, so much so that one single lithology may be present to the complete
exclusion of the other members. The best section of this formation is exposed along
the railway tract between Sanvordem railway station and Periudoc. In this section it
has a thickness of over 1.2 km. To the east of Kalay railway station the lithounit is
a metagreywacke which containds intercalations of metaconglomerate. It is also well
exposed between Bati and Keri south of river Tiracol. Exposures occur at Ribandar in
the vicinity of Panaji where it consists of metagreywacke with subordinate
metaconglomerate. The exposures across River Mandovi between Aguada and Baga are
dominated by thinly bedded ( laminated) argillites. The metaconglomerate consists of
stretched lenticular pebbles and boulders of quartzite and granite gneiss
(particularly at Sanvordem) that vary in size from 10 x15 x 25 cm along the longer
dimension and are enclosed in a schistose matrix dominated by chlorite. The
metagreywackes are faintly schistose and show graded bedding. The rock consists of
sub-angular quartz, plagioclase and lithic fragments in a matrix of sericite,
chlorite and quartz. The argillites are light to deep grey and consist of quartz in a
sericite-chlorite matrix with opaques. Rarely biotite has formed at the expense of
chlorite. A detailed account of the petrography of the conglomerates is available in
Devaraju et al. (2010). Bicholim Formation: This Formation can be traced over the
entire length of Goa (~ 185 km) in a NW-SE direction from Naibag in the northwest to
Salgini in the southeast. The average true thickness of the Formation is about 1.4 km
(Gokul et al. 1985). It consists of amphibole schists, ferruginous and manganiferous
phyllites, limestones and banded ferruginous quartzites (BHQ) that occur as
intercalations within the phyllites. The BHQs serve as the protores for the iron ore
deposits that are extensively developed in this formation. The BHQs are thinly
laminated and consist of alternate laminae of hematite/magnetite and chert. Magnetite
is invariably martitised. The banded iron formation (BIF) consists of two subfacies-
the haematite sub-facies and the magnetite sub-facies, both of which show
interdigitated relationship. The hematite sub-facies predominates in the northwestern
and central part (from Advalpal to Dharbadora) of the State whereas the magnetite
sub-facies is largely confined to the central and the southeastern part (Costi to
Barazana-Villiena). Calcareous (carbonate facies of BIF) and carbonaceous (sulphide
facies) intercalations are common. Manganese being an inseparable associate of iron
in almost all BIF the world over, both these exhibit a zonal distribution pattern.
Broadly the iron-rich protores are confined to the northern part of the formation,
northwest of Sanguem, whereas the manganese-rich protores are confined to the
southern part of the State, largely to the south of Sanguem between Rivona and
Salgini. The dominant lithology is represented by quartz-chloritetremolite schists
followed by ferruginous phyllites which is Rationale for the Identification of the
Barcem Group Although the Goa Group of Gokul et al. (1985) is considered younger,
similar to the Chitradurga Group (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985), it lacks the polymictic
granite-clast conglomerate at the base, as seen for example in the Chitradurga and
Shimoga schist belts, where the Talya and Kaldurga conglomerates respectively, mark
the base of the depositional sequence. A conglomerate, similar to the Talya
conglomerate does occur within the Goa Group, however, it is not basal for the latter
Group, but occurs above the Barcem Group, and at the base of the overlying Sanvordem
Formation. Recent work has shown, that the basal part of the greenstones (e.g. Gokul
et al., 1985), namely the newly established Barcem Group is characterized by a
quartzpebble conglomerate overlain by mafic rocks (with clastic intercalations), some
of which show pillow structures whereas others are vesicular (also see Devaraju et
al. 2010). Palaeoenvironmental Considerations The mafic volcanics at the base of the
Barcem Goup indicate volcanic activity both under subaerial and subaqueous conditions
in a nascent basin. Possibly recognizing this fact, Oertal (1958) included the lower
sequence of mafic rocks under the 'lower infraconglomerate group'. The basinal
conditions at the time of deposition of t he Ponda Group were di fferent t han t
hese. The metaconglomerate indicates shallow water deposition, proximal to the
basinal uplift whereas the volcaniclastics represent distal deposits. The BIF of the
Bicholim Formation is suggestive of chemogenic precipitation under quieter conditions
in relatively deeper parts in closed environments. Lateral variations with the
haematite sub-facies in the north progressively grading into the magnetite sub-facies
in the central and south Goa represents platformal-type of deposition. Minor
limestones and silica suggest presence of algal activity. A change from shelf facies
to deeper water facies is indicated by the presence of the manganesecarbonate marker
horizon and by the greywacke-argillite association (with intercalated volcanics) of
the Vagheri Formation. This unit was deposited under turbidite conditions as evident
from abundant turbitite structures seen at Aguada. The supracrustal assemblage was
intruded by the layered mafic-ultramafic complex. The intrusion of the Canacona
granite possibly marked the close of sedimentation of this group. Thus, although the
Goa rocks in general show characteristics typical of the 'Dharwar-type'
sedimentation, strictly the Goa Group of Gokul et al. (1985) conforms neither to the
Bababudan nor to the Chitradurga Groups but share peculiarities of both. Hence the
division of the supracrustal rocks into two stratigraphic groups, that are distinctly
unconformable on their respective basements, is justified.<component x="306.0"

al. (1985) are divisible into two stratigraphic groups. The older group formally
named the Barcem Group, has a poorly developed quartz-pebble conglomerate at the
base. The Group consists of metavolcanics with intercalations of metasediments and
rests on a basement of 3300-3400 Ma Anmode Ghat trondhjemite gneiss. This group is
unconformably overlain by the Ponda Group which is a clastics-dominated sequence
lithologically similar to the Chitradurga Group and rests on a basement of 2700-2900
Ma Chandranath granite gneiss with a distinct polymict, granite-clast conglomerate at
the base. It consists of three formations namely the Sanvordem, Bicholim and the
Vagheri (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985) in ascending order. The supracrustal sequence is
intruded by the Bondla layered mafic-ultramafic complex which is strongly controlled
by a major NW-SE trending shear zone. The post-tectonic Canacona granite distinctly
intrudes the trondhjemite-tonalite gneisses and marks the close of sedimentation in
the Goa basin. It is an anatectic, potassic granite which is temporally equivalent to
the late phases of the Closepet granite activity. Acknowledgements: M. Ramakrishnan

shield particularly the granite-greenstone terrain of the Dharwar craton is a complex
amalgamation of the Western and the Eastern Dharwar cratons (WDC, EDC) respectively.
The intricate relationship between the gneisses and supracrustals from parts of the
Dharwar craton continues to be debated (e.g. Swami Nath and Ramakrishnan, 1981; Naqvi
and Rogers, 1987; Ramakrishnan, 1994; Radhakrishna and Vaidyanadhan, 1997;
Ramakrishnan and Vaidyanadhan, 2008). The same is true for the gneissic rocks that
belong to various episodes that have been broadly included under the Peninsular
Gneissic Complex. A systematic study of the gneissic complex and its relationship
with the greenstones from critical areas can yield significant information on the
Precambrian crustal evolution and the palaeo-tectonics of this region. Goa is
situated in the northwestern part of the WDC where t he Shi moga-Goa supracrust al
bel t ext ends contiguously until it is concealed beneath the Arabian Sea and the
Deccan Traps in the north. The belt possibly continues beneath the Traps up to the
Narmada, where the Narmada-Son lineament terminates this supracrustal belt. The
Shimoga-Goa belt extends NNW-SSE over a length of approximately 250 km and has a
maximum width of about 120 km at Dharwar. The western margin of the belt is marked by
large domal masses of gneissose rocks such as the Chandranath granite gneiss and the
Canacona granite. The eastern margin is faulted, whereas the southern section appears
to have been deposited in shallow waters. The latter is associated with subaerial
mafic volcanic rocks at Kumbharwada, and north of Karwar and Ankola. The thickest
accumulation of mafic volcanics of this schist belt is, however, centred at Bababudan
and Kudremukh which forms the southern extensions of this belt (Harinadha Babu et al.
1981a). A thick sequence of greywackes occupy the northern section of the basin. The
southern section in general, is characterized by orthoquartzite/basic lava
association that denotes subaerial environments and intermittent volcanic activity in
a coastal sand environment under stable conditions. The limestone-iron-manganese ore
sequence of Goa and north Kanara (Castlerock band) in the northern part (Maclaran,
1904) of the Shimoga belt is in physical continuity with that in the southern part
and serves as the marker horizon to show the continuity of the rocks over the entire
length of the belt. The granitic-gneisses from Goa were assigned either a syntectonic
or post-tectonic status (Harinadha Babu et al. 1981a; Gokul et al. 1985) in relation
to the deformational episodes exhibited by the supracrustals. However, there is a
considerable lack of clarity as regards the interrelationship among the granitic
gneisses on the one hand and between the gneisses and the supracrustal greenstones on
the other. The supracrustal sequences in particular, consist of metavolcanics and
clastics each with peculiarities of its own, yet both have been included under one
stratigraphic group namely the Goa Group (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985).<component

examined by Fermor (1909) and later by Dunn (1942). A formal stratigraphic
classification was, however, provided by Oertal (1958) who divided the rocks into two
groups: (i) the lower infraconglomerate group and (ii) the upper metalliferous group.
The granitic rocks occurring at Quepem, Canacona and Dudhsagar were considered by him
to be intrusive into the schistose rocks. The Goa region in general, is largely
occupied by schistose rocks (Pascoe, 1950; Dhepe, 1954) but for the northeastern
corner of the State where Deccan Traps (late Cretaceous to Eocene) overlie the
Dharwar metasediments. Recent geological mapping (GSI, 1996) has shown that the basal
sequences are made of metavolcanics with intercalations of metasediments overlain by
a larger proportion of clastics, dominated by greywackes. In these respects, they are
similar to the Dharwar-type greenstones of Radhakrishna and Vaidyanadhan (1997).
Gokul et al. (1985) proposed a modern scheme of stratigraphic classification and
grouped the lithounits of Goa into four formations. The stratigraphic succession
proposed by Gokul et al. (1985) is presented in Table 1 along with the proposed
revision. In their scheme of classification all the granitic gneisses and the
granites from Goa were considered coeval and intrusive into the metasediments (e.g.
Harinadha Babu et al. 1981b; Gokul et al. 1985). The basement for the supracrustal
sequence was not clearly identified. The Goa Group typically has a greenstone
dominated sequence at the base which is overlain by a metaconglomerate over which
rests a dominantly clastic sequence. The metaconglomerate (tilloid) was assigned the
status of a para-conglomerate. The granitic gneisses in Goa are exposed at four
different localities and are referred to as (i) Chandranath granite gneiss, (ii)
Tamdi felspathic gneiss, (iii) Dudhsagar granite, and (iv) Canacona granite. They are
all considered as intrusives into the supracrustals (greenstones) by Gokul et al.
(1985). The Chandranath granite gneiss was considered to be syntectonic with the
first phase of folding, the Tamdi felspathic gneiss and the Dudhsagar granite were
considered to be synkinematic with the second phase, whereas the Canacona granite was
considered to be post-tectonic (Gokul et al. 1985). In the light of the recent work
(Dhoundial et al. 1987; Devaraju et al. 2007, 2010; Dessai et al. 2009) especially on
the granitic gneisses, greenstones and the intrusive granites from representative
sections, it is proposed to revisit the classification of the greenstones from this
area. The Goa Group of Gokul et al. (1985) needs to be integrated (see also Devaraju
et al. 2010) with the contiguous Dharwar Supergroup of WDC, as otherwise it would
give an erroneous impression of forming a separate stratigraphic entity within the
Dharwar craton. The Goa Group (e.g Gokul et al. 1985) denotes a local classification
confined to Goa and is here devided into two groups namely the Barcem Group and the
Ponda Group which correspond respectively to the Bababudan and Chitradurga Groups of
the Dharwar Supergroup in the unified regional classification. The proposed
stratigraphic scheme is listed in Table 1.<component x="56.64" y="98.36"

exposed at Anmode (Tamdi felspathic gneiss of Gokul et al. 1985) along the
Panaji-Belgaum National Highway (NH 4A) and is amongst the oldest gneisses from India
that has yielded an Rb/Sr whole-rock age of 3400-140 Ma (Dhoundial et al. 1987).
Recent Sm-Nd and U-Pb work has provided ages of about 3300 Ma (Devaraju et al. 2007).
Temporally the gneiss is nearly equivalent to the Gorur Gneiss from Hassan district
of Karnataka [34 point Rb/Sr isochron age of 3315-54 Ma (Beckinsale et al. 1980);
with 87 86 very low Sr/ Sr ratio of 0.7006] that has yielded an equally older age.
These grey gneisses, that are older than 3,000 Ma, are included along with the
younger ones (~ 2600 Ma) under the Peninsular Gneissic Complex. It consists of a
complex assemblage of migmatites, gneisses and granitoids and forms a back-drop for
the schist belts scattered within the gneisses. Most workers agree to its polyphase

over 11 km wide. It is well foliated, the foliation trends NE-SW and o dips by 50
east. Gokul et al. (1985) and Dhoundial et al. (1987) considered it to be intrusive,
synkinematically with the first phase of folding of the metasediments. However,
distinct intrusive relationship between the gneiss and the metasediments is no where
available for observation (also Ramakrishnan, per.comm.). It is a grey granitic
gneiss that varies in composition from granodiorite to quartz-diorite. The Rb/Sr age
obtained for it is 2650-100 Ma (Dhoundial et al. 1987). Recent SmNd isotope studies
provide model ages of about 2900 Ma (Devaraju et al. 2007) indicating that the
protoliths are either younger than the trondhjemites or are less enriched in light
rare earth elements. A similar gneiss exposed along the eastern border of the State
and referred to as the Londa migmatitic gneiss is considered to be contemporaneous
with the Chandranath granite gneiss. The recent age data (e.g. Devaraju et al. 2010)
suggest that these gneisses are distinctly younger that the basement trondhjemite
gneisses Canacona Granite: It is exposed at Char Rasta-Chauri, Palolem and Agonda, in
Canacona taluka (Srinivasan and Gopalakrishnan, 1985). Harinadha Babu et al. (1981b)
and Gokul et al. (1985) have included this granite as equivalent to the Chandranath
granite gneiss. As per the latest geological and mineral map of Goa (GSI, 1996), the
granite is depicted as intrusive into the TTG gneisses. It has been dated at 2395-390
Ma (e.g. Dhoundial et al. 1987), however, due to the large error factor, the age data
are rather suspect. The granite is distinctly late, unfoliated, and exhibits a
discordant relationship with the WNW-ESE foliation of the older TTG gneiss/migmatite
(Fig. 1). It is potassic in comparison with the host gneiss/migmatite which is
strongly foliated, and relatively sodic. Exposures at Palolem and Agonda occur as
bosses and plutons. The contacts are sheared, patches and shreds of older gneiss can
be traced on either sides of the younger intrusive phase. The granite is coarse to

evidence of plastic and brittle deformation. The granite can be traced up to Palolem

discontinuously up to Polem and even beyond to Sadashivgarh and Karwar in Karnataka.
Enclaves and rafts of metasediments are invariably intruded by aplite-pegmatite
veins. The rock is often porphyritic with megacrysts and phenocrysts of microcline,
perthitic feldspar and plagioclase in a groundmass dominated by quartz, biotite and
hornblende. Felspar megacrysts surround and include plagioclase and biotite of older
generation. New K-felspar (microcline) has grown and it is interconnected with
similar phases probably indicating melt injection. The rock is high in K (2.91-3.7
wt% K O; Na O/K O: 0.57), Rb (103-162 2 22 ppm) and moderate Sr (118-250 ppm)

the classification of the Goa Group (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985) is warranted. The
lithological characteristics of the supracrustal rocks permit the subdivision of the
Goa Group (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985) into two sequences of greenstones (Fig.2). The
lower sequence that rests on the TTG gneisses with a quartz-pebble conglomerate is
largely dominated by mafic volcanics with intercalated clastics. It was designated as
the Barcem Formation of the Goa Group by Gokul et al. (1985). This sequence is
elevated to the status of a 'Group' which is formally named as the Barcem Group. The
'Group' as per the provisions of international stratigraphic guide (Hedberg, 1976,
p.34) should consist of more than one Formation. However, considering the
lithological and the facies variation within the Barcem Formation, it is felt that
detailed mapping may eventually lead to its division into more than one Formation. It
bears many similarities with the lower part of the Kalaspura Formation of the
Bababudan Group. The upper sequence of supracrustals, that makes up the three
formations namely the Sanvordem, Bicholim and Vagheri, is assigned to a new
stratigraphic group for which the formal term Ponda Group is proposed. This seems to
be appropriate and reasonable. Moreover, the correlation of this group with the
Chitradurga Group of the Dharwar Supergroup is justified in agreement with Gokul et
al. (1985). The characteristics of the lithounits are described below. Barcem Group
The newly identified Barcem Group is best developed to the southeast of Barcem
village and account for a thickness of over 2 km, however, in the northwest between
Margao and Vasco-da-Gama the rocks attain a thickness of about 2.5 km (Ram Das and
Ramprasad Rao, 2001). It has a quartzpebble conglomerate at the base and the
lithounits consist of metavolcanics with intercalations of quartzites and pelites.
The volcanics are represented by basic and felsic (?) lavas, agglomerates and tuffs.
The metasediments consist of quartzites, quartz-sericite-schists,
quartz-chlorite-schists and minor phyllites. Non-vesicular metabasalts are exposed
around Astagal, Polem, Padi and Subdalem in the south and Tisk (Usgao)Dharbandora in
central Goa. Vesicular metabasalts are exposed to the north of Gulem, at Barcem and
along the Saleri-Vagon road in Canacona taluka. At places phyllitic intercalations
are noticed. These probably represent the metamorphosed tuffs. Well preserved pillow
lavas are described from Gokuldem-Maina section (Gokul et al. 1985). The basalts at
the base of the Mormugao headland are schistose and at places vesicular. Those from
Bogmalo are vesicular, amygdaloidal and are dominated by pyroxene and at places
contain olivine (Devaraju et al. 2010). The basalts in general, consist of
saussuritised plagioclase and uralitised pyroxene forming actinolite, chlorite,
epidote, clinozoisite along with opaques. Metavolcanics that could be silicic lavas
or pyroclasts are exposed at Barcem. They are represented by quartzsericite-schists
and quartz porphyry. At places they are crushed and contain porphyroclasts of quartz
in a pulvurised quartz-sericite matrix. Ponda Group The Ponda Group is best developed
around Ponda town where most of the lithologies are well exposed. It comprises three
formations which in ascending order are the Sanvordem Formation, Bicholim Formation
and the Vagheri Formation, all of which are dominated by clastics with very
subordinate mafics only in the Vagheri Formation. Around Ponda, the total thickness
of this group is about 8.8 km (Ram Das and Ramprasad Rao, 2001). Sanvordem Formation:
The Sanvordem Formation rests on the Chandranath granite gneiss with a polymict met
acongl omerat e at t he base and compri ses metagreywacke, and argillites. The
conglomerate consists of stretched and elongated pebbles of quartzite and gneiss in a
schistose chlorite matrix. The proportion of lithologies varies considerably from
place to place, so much so that one single lithology may be present to the complete
exclusion of the other members. The best section of this formation is exposed along
the railway tract between Sanvordem railway station and Periudoc. In this section it
has a thickness of over 1.2 km. To the east of Kalay railway station the lithounit is
a metagreywacke which containds intercalations of metaconglomerate. It is also well
exposed between Bati and Keri south of river Tiracol. Exposures occur at Ribandar in
the vicinity of Panaji where it consists of metagreywacke with subordinate
metaconglomerate. The exposures across River Mandovi between Aguada and Baga are
dominated by thinly bedded ( laminated) argillites. The metaconglomerate consists of
stretched lenticular pebbles and boulders of quartzite and granite gneiss
(particularly at Sanvordem) that vary in size from 10 x15 x 25 cm along the longer
dimension and are enclosed in a schistose matrix dominated by chlorite. The
metagreywackes are faintly schistose and show graded bedding. The rock consists of
sub-angular quartz, plagioclase and lithic fragments in a matrix of sericite,
chlorite and quartz. The argillites are light to deep grey and consist of quartz in a
sericite-chlorite matrix with opaques. Rarely biotite has formed at the expense of
chlorite. A detailed account of the petrography of the conglomerates is available in
Devaraju et al. (2010). Bicholim Formation: This Formation can be traced over the
entire length of Goa (~ 185 km) in a NW-SE direction from Naibag in the northwest to
Salgini in the southeast. The average true thickness of the Formation is about 1.4 km
(Gokul et al. 1985). It consists of amphibole schists, ferruginous and manganiferous
phyllites, limestones and banded ferruginous quartzites (BHQ) that occur as
intercalations within the phyllites. The BHQs serve as the protores for the iron ore
deposits that are extensively developed in this formation. The BHQs are thinly
laminated and consist of alternate laminae of hematite/magnetite and chert. Magnetite
is invariably martitised. The banded iron formation (BIF) consists of two subfacies-
the haematite sub-facies and the magnetite sub-facies, both of which show
interdigitated relationship. The hematite sub-facies predominates in the northwestern
and central part (from Advalpal to Dharbadora) of the State whereas the magnetite
sub-facies is largely confined to the central and the southeastern part (Costi to
Barazana-Villiena). Calcareous (carbonate facies of BIF) and carbonaceous (sulphide
facies) intercalations are common. Manganese being an inseparable associate of iron
in almost all BIF the world over, both these exhibit a zonal distribution pattern.
Broadly the iron-rich protores are confined to the northern part of the formation,
northwest of Sanguem, whereas the manganese-rich protores are confined to the
southern part of the State, largely to the south of Sanguem between Rivona and
Salgini. The dominant lithology is represented by quartz-chloritetremolite schists
followed by ferruginous phyllites which is Rationale for the Identification of the
Barcem Group Although the Goa Group of Gokul et al. (1985) is considered younger,
similar to the Chitradurga Group (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985), it lacks the polymictic
granite-clast conglomerate at the base, as seen for example in the Chitradurga and
Shimoga schist belts, where the Talya and Kaldurga conglomerates respectively, mark
the base of the depositional sequence. A conglomerate, similar to the Talya
conglomerate does occur within the Goa Group, however, it is not basal for the latter
Group, but occurs above the Barcem Group, and at the base of the overlying Sanvordem
Formation. Recent work has shown, that the basal part of the greenstones (e.g. Gokul
et al., 1985), namely the newly established Barcem Group is characterized by a
quartzpebble conglomerate overlain by mafic rocks (with clastic intercalations), some
of which show pillow structures whereas others are vesicular (also see Devaraju et
al. 2010). Palaeoenvironmental Considerations The mafic volcanics at the base of the
Barcem Goup indicate volcanic activity both under subaerial and subaqueous conditions
in a nascent basin. Possibly recognizing this fact, Oertal (1958) included the lower
sequence of mafic rocks under the 'lower infraconglomerate group'. The basinal
conditions at the time of deposition of t he Ponda Group were di fferent t han t
hese. The metaconglomerate indicates shallow water deposition, proximal to the
basinal uplift whereas the volcaniclastics represent distal deposits. The BIF of the
Bicholim Formation is suggestive of chemogenic precipitation under quieter conditions
in relatively deeper parts in closed environments. Lateral variations with the
haematite sub-facies in the north progressively grading into the magnetite sub-facies
in the central and south Goa represents platformal-type of deposition. Minor
limestones and silica suggest presence of algal activity. A change from shelf facies
to deeper water facies is indicated by the presence of the manganesecarbonate marker
horizon and by the greywacke-argillite association (with intercalated volcanics) of
the Vagheri Formation. This unit was deposited under turbidite conditions as evident
from abundant turbitite structures seen at Aguada. The supracrustal assemblage was
intruded by the layered mafic-ultramafic complex. The intrusion of the Canacona
granite possibly marked the close of sedimentation of this group. Thus, although the
Goa rocks in general show characteristics typical of the 'Dharwar-type'
sedimentation, strictly the Goa Group of Gokul et al. (1985) conforms neither to the
Bababudan nor to the Chitradurga Groups but share peculiarities of both. Hence the
division of the supracrustal rocks into two stratigraphic groups, that are distinctly
unconformable on their respective basements, is justified.<component x="306.0"

al. (1985) are divisible into two stratigraphic groups. The older group formally
named the Barcem Group, has a poorly developed quartz-pebble conglomerate at the
base. The Group consists of metavolcanics with intercalations of metasediments and
rests on a basement of 3300-3400 Ma Anmode Ghat trondhjemite gneiss. This group is
unconformably overlain by the Ponda Group which is a clastics-dominated sequence
lithologically similar to the Chitradurga Group and rests on a basement of 2700-2900
Ma Chandranath granite gneiss with a distinct polymict, granite-clast conglomerate at
the base. It consists of three formations namely the Sanvordem, Bicholim and the
Vagheri (e.g. Gokul et al. 1985) in ascending order. The supracrustal sequence is
intruded by the Bondla layered mafic-ultramafic complex which is strongly controlled
by a major NW-SE trending shear zone. The post-tectonic Canacona granite distinctly
intrudes the trondhjemite-tonalite gneisses and marks the close of sedimentation in
the Goa basin. It is an anatectic, potassic granite which is temporally equivalent to
the late phases of the Closepet granite activity. Acknowledgements: M. Ramakrishnan
