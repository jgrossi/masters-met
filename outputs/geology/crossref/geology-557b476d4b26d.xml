Pingxiang Mining Area is located in the central part of Pingxiang City of Jiangxi
Province. The east-to- west length is about 25 km, while the north-to-south width is
about 10 km, and the coal-bearing area is 2 about 250 km (Fig.1). Pingxiang Mining
Area is one of the major coal-producing areas in Jiangxi Province (Tan et al., 2009).
From west to east, there are five major coal mines in Pingxiang Mining Area named
Juyuan Coal Mine, Qingshan Coal Mine, Baiyuan Coal Mine, Anyuan Coal Mine, and
Gaokeng Coal Mine. Pingxiang Mining Area is very serious in coal and gas outburst
(Xie et al., 2001; Chen and Wang, 2009; Zhang et al., 2010). Therefore, it is of
significance to research on gas geological features and its controlling factors. The
coal seams in Anyuan Formation are the mining Fig.1 Distribution of five major coal
mines in Pingxiang Mining Area objects in Pingxiang Mining Area. Anyuan Formation is
unconformable above Maokou Formation, Longtan Formation of the Permian, or Daye
Formation of the Triassic. From bottom to top, Anyuan Formation (T 3a) is subdivided

the coal ranks are high, and most of them are high-rank bituminous or anthracite,
slim coal or meager coal for Juyuan Coal Mine, meager coal for Shangguanling Coal
Mine, and anthracite for Qingshan Coal Mine, Jiaobao Coal Mine, and Santian Coal
Mine. But in the east part, the coal ranks are comparatively low, and most of them
are medium-rank bituminous, coking coal for Baiyuan Coal Mine and Wupi Coal Mine, 1/3
coking coal for Wangkeng Coal Mine, Hongqi Coal Mine, and Panjiachong Coal Mine, fat
coal or 1/3 coking coal for Anyuan Coal Mine and Gaokeng Coal Mine, and fat coal for
Yuejin Coal Mine. The metamorphism degree of coal and gas storage is closely related.
The higher the metamorphism degree of coal is, the more the coal's gas productivity
is (Zhang, 2009). Therefore, from the angle of gas generation, the higher
metamorphism degree of coal in the west part than that in the east part means more
gas produced for coal in the west part than that in the east part. 3.2 About the gas
preservation 3.2.1 Factor of structure During Middle Proterozoic to Early Paleozoic,
Jiangxi Province is separated by Yangtze Plate and Fig.2 Tectonic location of
Pingxiang Mining Area (modified according to Liu et al., 2004) The gravitational
sliding structure is well developed in Pingxiang Mining Area (Hu, 2002; Liu, 2003).
During Yanshan period, due to the strong uplift of the Wugong Uplift and the effect
of gravity balance, some gravitational glidings are formed in north side of the
mountains of Wugong Uplift. Fig.3 is the correlation section between Anyuan gliding
block and Gaokeng gliding block. From top to bottom, the strata of the gliding block
consist of the following: the Cretaceous is unconformable above the Anyuan
coal-bearing strata, Anyuan coal-bearing strata is unconformable above the Maokou
Formation, the bottom of Maokou Formation is gravitational gliding fault, and Anyuan
coal-bearing strata is under the gliding block. From the angle of geological
structure, the coal-bearing strata in the area of Qingshan Coal Mine and Juyuan Coal
Mine are under the gliding nappe. The Maokou Formation is slid over the Anyuan
Formation, so the overlying rock's thickness of coal- bearing strata is increased,
which cause the gas in coal seams to be well preserved (Fig.4). Meanwhile, Gaokeng
Coal Mine, Anyuan Coal Mine, and Baiyuan Coal Mine are in the area of tectonic
window, and the coal-bearing strata within the tectonic window are exposed to ground
for a long time to be favorable to gas migration and emission. Thus, the west part of
Pingxiang Mining Area is high gas area with serious coal and gas outburst, while the
east part is low gas area. Also, in the west part of Pingxiang Mining Area, the small
structures at Qingshan Coal Mine and Juyuan<component x="56.7" y="61.31"

gliding block and Gaokeng gliding block (according to Liu et al., 2003) amount of gas
is released for a long weathering and erosion period before the sediment of
Cretaceous red layer. 3.2.3 Factor of coal quality The metamorphic degree of coal has
considerable influence on coal's gas adsorption capacity. The coal's gas adsorption
capacity increases from medium-rank bituminous to anthracite (Zhang, 2009). The
statistics based on the data from more than 160 mining area in China (Qin et al.,
1999) reveal the enveloping line relationship between the coal rank and gas content
in coal reservoir, that is, with the increase coal rank from brown coal to the early
stage of anthracite, the maximum gas content of coal seam increases, and the area
with high gas content corresponds to the area with high rank coal. However, with the
increase coal rank from middle stage to later stage of anthracite, the methane
adsorption capacity of coal seam decreases, and correspondingly, the maximum gas
content of coal seam sharply decreases. Therefore, concerning the gas adsorption
capacity, in Pingxiang Mining Area, the coal rank is higher in the west part than
that in the east part, which means that the coal in the west part may have adsorpted
more gas than that in the east part. In the west part of Pingxiang Mining Area, many
of the coal body structures are destroyed and tectonic coals are widely distributed.
The coals are soft and fragile, most of them are mylonitic coal and granulated coal,
and few of them are cataclastic coals. The test of 22 samples at Qingshan Coal Mine
reveals that the consistent coefficient of coal (f value) is very small, ranging from
0.130 to 0.283, averaging 0.204, and index of coal's initial speed of diffusion ( P)
is high, ranging from 13 to 22, averaging 16.63. The test of 13 samples at Juyuan
Coal Mine reveals that f value ranges from 0.160 to 0.460, averaging 0.251, and P
ranges from 9 to 19, averaging 13.62. Therefore, the characteristic of coal body
structure is favorable to the<component x="77.46" y="61.66" width="463.94"

and gas outburst (The State Administration of Work Safety, 2009). 4 Conclusions (1)
The features of gas geology vary significantly between the west part and the east
part of Pingxiang Mining Area, and it is characterized by high gas mines with serious
coal and gas outburst in the west part and low gas mines with no coal and gas
outburst in the east part. (2) The great difference of gas geology between the west
part and the east part is the result of comprehensive effect by geological factors.
Concerning the gas generation, the coal rank in the west part is higher than that in
the east part, which is favorable to generate more gas in the west part than in the
east part. Concerning the gas preservation, the features of geological structures,
the surrounding rocks, coal rank, and coal body structure are all favorable to gas
preservation in the west part and favorable to gas emission in the east part.

the coal ranks are high, and most of them are high-rank bituminous or anthracite,
slim coal or meager coal for Juyuan Coal Mine, meager coal for Shangguanling Coal
Mine, and anthracite for Qingshan Coal Mine, Jiaobao Coal Mine, and Santian Coal
Mine. But in the east part, the coal ranks are comparatively low, and most of them
are medium-rank bituminous, coking coal for Baiyuan Coal Mine and Wupi Coal Mine, 1/3
coking coal for Wangkeng Coal Mine, Hongqi Coal Mine, and Panjiachong Coal Mine, fat
coal or 1/3 coking coal for Anyuan Coal Mine and Gaokeng Coal Mine, and fat coal for
Yuejin Coal Mine. The metamorphism degree of coal and gas storage is closely related.
The higher the metamorphism degree of coal is, the more the coal's gas productivity
is (Zhang, 2009). Therefore, from the angle of gas generation, the higher
metamorphism degree of coal in the west part than that in the east part means more
gas produced for coal in the west part than that in the east part. 3.2 About the gas
preservation 3.2.1 Factor of structure During Middle Proterozoic to Early Paleozoic,
Jiangxi Province is separated by Yangtze Plate and Fig.2 Tectonic location of
Pingxiang Mining Area (modified according to Liu et al., 2004) The gravitational
sliding structure is well developed in Pingxiang Mining Area (Hu, 2002; Liu, 2003).
During Yanshan period, due to the strong uplift of the Wugong Uplift and the effect
of gravity balance, some gravitational glidings are formed in north side of the
mountains of Wugong Uplift. Fig.3 is the correlation section between Anyuan gliding
block and Gaokeng gliding block. From top to bottom, the strata of the gliding block
consist of the following: the Cretaceous is unconformable above the Anyuan
coal-bearing strata, Anyuan coal-bearing strata is unconformable above the Maokou
Formation, the bottom of Maokou Formation is gravitational gliding fault, and Anyuan
coal-bearing strata is under the gliding block. From the angle of geological
structure, the coal-bearing strata in the area of Qingshan Coal Mine and Juyuan Coal
Mine are under the gliding nappe. The Maokou Formation is slid over the Anyuan
Formation, so the overlying rock's thickness of coal- bearing strata is increased,
which cause the gas in coal seams to be well preserved (Fig.4). Meanwhile, Gaokeng
Coal Mine, Anyuan Coal Mine, and Baiyuan Coal Mine are in the area of tectonic
window, and the coal-bearing strata within the tectonic window are exposed to ground
for a long time to be favorable to gas migration and emission. Thus, the west part of
Pingxiang Mining Area is high gas area with serious coal and gas outburst, while the
east part is low gas area. Also, in the west part of Pingxiang Mining Area, the small
structures at Qingshan Coal Mine and Juyuan<component x="56.7" y="61.31"

gliding block and Gaokeng gliding block (according to Liu et al., 2003) amount of gas
is released for a long weathering and erosion period before the sediment of
Cretaceous red layer. 3.2.3 Factor of coal quality The metamorphic degree of coal has
considerable influence on coal's gas adsorption capacity. The coal's gas adsorption
capacity increases from medium-rank bituminous to anthracite (Zhang, 2009). The
statistics based on the data from more than 160 mining area in China (Qin et al.,
1999) reveal the enveloping line relationship between the coal rank and gas content
in coal reservoir, that is, with the increase coal rank from brown coal to the early
stage of anthracite, the maximum gas content of coal seam increases, and the area
with high gas content corresponds to the area with high rank coal. However, with the
increase coal rank from middle stage to later stage of anthracite, the methane
adsorption capacity of coal seam decreases, and correspondingly, the maximum gas
content of coal seam sharply decreases. Therefore, concerning the gas adsorption
capacity, in Pingxiang Mining Area, the coal rank is higher in the west part than
that in the east part, which means that the coal in the west part may have adsorpted
more gas than that in the east part. In the west part of Pingxiang Mining Area, many
of the coal body structures are destroyed and tectonic coals are widely distributed.
The coals are soft and fragile, most of them are mylonitic coal and granulated coal,
and few of them are cataclastic coals. The test of 22 samples at Qingshan Coal Mine
reveals that the consistent coefficient of coal (f value) is very small, ranging from
0.130 to 0.283, averaging 0.204, and index of coal's initial speed of diffusion ( P)
is high, ranging from 13 to 22, averaging 16.63. The test of 13 samples at Juyuan
Coal Mine reveals that f value ranges from 0.160 to 0.460, averaging 0.251, and P
ranges from 9 to 19, averaging 13.62. Therefore, the characteristic of coal body
structure is favorable to the<component x="77.46" y="61.66" width="463.94"

and gas outburst (The State Administration of Work Safety, 2009). 4 Conclusions (1)
The features of gas geology vary significantly between the west part and the east
part of Pingxiang Mining Area, and it is characterized by high gas mines with serious
coal and gas outburst in the west part and low gas mines with no coal and gas
outburst in the east part. (2) The great difference of gas geology between the west
part and the east part is the result of comprehensive effect by geological factors.
Concerning the gas generation, the coal rank in the west part is higher than that in
the east part, which is favorable to generate more gas in the west part than in the
east part. Concerning the gas preservation, the features of geological structures,
the surrounding rocks, coal rank, and coal body structure are all favorable to gas
preservation in the west part and favorable to gas emission in the east part.
