development of technologies associated with consumer electronics, renewable energy,
and specialty steel have sparked demand for a " " range of specialty mineral
commodities. These commodities are quite diverse and include, among others, rare
earth elements, (REEs: lanthanides, Y, and Sc), Ga, In, W, platinum group elements
(PGEs: Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt), Co, Nb, Mg, Mo, Sb, Li, V, Ni, Ta, Te, Cr, Mn, Se,
Ti, Sr, graphite, Sn, Ge, Be, Zr, Bi, F, and Cd. Most of these commodities have
small, restricted markets, - and, in some cases, supply is restricted concentrated in
either a small group of countries or producing companies. Some elements, such as In,
Ga, Cd, Se, and Te, are produced as by-products of the extraction of base metals.
Although the amount of these commodities produced can be quite small (annual global
production of Re, for example, was ~50 t in 2012: www.comtrade.un.org/db), they can
be hi ghl y cr i t i cal f or some manuf act ur i ng i ndust r i es. Consequently, a
number of countries, including USA (United States Department of Energy 2010), UK
(British Geological Survey 2012), Japan (JOGMEC 2010), Korea (Bae 2010), the European
Union (European Commission 2010), and Aust r al i a (Ski r r ow et al . 2013), have
commissioned reports on critical commodities. Most of these reports concentrated on
economic aspects, with few discussing the geological occurrence of critical
commodities. Although the details differed, most of these reports

Ga, In, W, PGEs, Co, Nb, Mg, Mo, Sb, Li, V, Ni, Ta, Te, Cr, and Mn as being highly
critical (see Skirrow et al. 2013 for summary). Interestingly, some of these reports
identified more traditional commodities, such as Zn, as critical. This Thematic Issue
is the result of a symposium at the 34th International Geological Congress in
Brisbane, " Australia in August 2012 entitled New age metals: the geology and genesis
of ores required for a changing " economy and a carbon constrained world . The
purpose of this symposium was to discuss the geology and, to a lesser extent, the
economics of critical commodities. This thematic issue presents some of the results
of this symposium and related research. The first paper in this issue (Simandl 2014)
presents an overview of the geology and market dependency of REE resources. This
analysis indicates that in recent years, changes in Chinese government policy have
had a major impact on the supply and price of REEs, and that the production of these
elements is highly dependent upon metallurgical characteristics and the ratio of
heavy to light REEs in the ores. At present, most REEs are produced from carbonatite
and related alkaline rocks. Recycling of these elements is in its infancy. Geological
and geochemical descriptions of the Cummins Range deposit in Australia and of
Bastn&#xE4;stype deposits in the Bergslagen district in Sweden are presented by
Downes et al. (2014) and Holtstam et al. ( 2014), r espect i vel y. I mpor t ant r
esul t s f r om t he Cummins Range deposit include recognition of shear zone-host ed,
REE-ri ch apatite-monazite-(Ce) rocks formed by the hydrothermal remobilization of
REEs from carbonatites within the complex, and that the carbonatitic melts were
derived from a subductionmodified mantle source (Downes et al. 2014). Holtstam et al.
(2014) found that Bastn&#xE4;s-type deposits formed when high temperature (&gt;400
&#xB0;C) magmatic fluids of Svecofennian age (ca. 1,900 Ma) interacted with dolomitic
rocks in supracrustal assemblages. These fluids carried Fe, REEs, Cu, Mo, Bi, and Au
as ore metals, along with Si, F, Cl, S, and CO . 2 H&#xF6;hn et al. (2014) describe
the geology and geochemistry of clay deposits in the Czech Republic and in Austria.
In particular, they assess whether REEs could be recovered as by-products of
kaolinite production. Although REE-bearing minerals are enriched in the by-products
of kaolinite extraction, the quantities produced are insufficient to justify
extraction. Migdisov and Williams-Jones (2014) consider the hydrothermal geochemistry
of REE transport and demonstrate that, under many geological conditions, chloride
complexes, rather than fluoride complexes, were the most likely transporting agents
for REEs. This has significant implications when consi deri ng t he mechani sms and
envi ronment s of REE deposition. Simandl et al. (2014) document the application and
reliability of hand-held X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis to exploration for REE
deposits. They determined analytical uncertainties and detection limits for a range
of REEs and related elements, demonstrating that this technique can be used
effectively for REE, particularly light REE, exploration. Horiuchi et al. (2014) also
discuss the utility of hand-held XRF spectrometry for REE exploration, in this case
for the Blockspruit deposit in South Africa. They show that handheld XRF analysis of
termite mounds in the field can effectively map the distribution of both light and
heavy REE mineralization where exposure of outcropping rocks is poor. Finally, Mackay
and Simandl (2014) explore the history and uses of Ta and Nb, including the growing
demand for conflict ""columbite-tantalite concentrates from Africa. These elements
are extracted from a range of geological sources, including pegmatites and related al
l uvi al s f or Ta, and weat hered carbonat i t es and peralkaline complexes for Nb.
An important conclusion of this study is that in the long-term, the supplies of Ta
and Nb should be assured. Mi neral i um In addi t i on t o t hi s t hemat i c i ssue,

topics of highly specialized studies. Perhaps, the current emphasis on critical
commodities may spur a better understanding of the metallogeny of these unusual, but
