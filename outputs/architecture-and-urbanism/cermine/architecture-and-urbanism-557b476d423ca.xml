      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Continuing a series of conceptual articles about the
constructed environments and climate in a tropical climate
situation [1–3], this article discusses urbanism (or the
architecture of public spaces) and its interaction with the
environment—normally defined according to the climate of
European countries [4–8]—from a tropical country’s
perspective.</p>
      <p>The main changes that urban design should go through
are unnoticed in the work of a designer—since his/her
theoretical concepts about shape, esthetics, and
landscaping have been elaborated without considering local
climate and, consequently, without considering the needs
of the users, either. As European open spaces need
protection against cold winds as well as to take advantage
of solar radiation and of low sky luminance, the different
climatic conditions in the tropics should be considered for
the benefit of all users.</p>

      <p>Many of the conceptual differences between the
approach to urbanism design in the tropics and in the
European countries are not well understood, mostly as a
consequence of the economic and, moreover, the cultural
dependency since colonial times. Unfortunately, Latin
American universities are still working with this
uncontested colonialist frame of mind. Thus, the purpose of
integrating urbanism and climate in tropical countries is
still very incipient (see for example Ref [9]). The several
points of view referred in this paper intend to contribute
with a reflection about the subject.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>2. Concepts about the interaction between climate and urban</title>
      <p>The microclimate of an environment in the tropics—
regions characterized by low latitude and excessive solar
radiation—is determined by the thermodynamic balance
between absorbed solar energy and dissipated energy,
based on four mechanisms: the emission of long wave
radiation (from the surrounding surfaces), the materials
heat conduction, the water evaporation, and heat
convection from surfaces to the air [10–12].
Energetic balance of external surroundings near the
building can lead to two questions: how microclimate
elements affect energy consumption in the architectonic
space [13] and how the building system affects the
microclimate [14].</p>
      <p>The manifestation of heat islands is a principal topic to
consider. It depends directly on urban design, such as the
streets and the grid shapes, the location of green spaces, the
building ensemble that modulates the environment shape,
the recovering materials, and the quality of surfaces.</p>
      <p>In general, reaching thermal comfort and decreasing the
electrical energy consumption in the tropics is possible, by
working with an urban design that modifies the wind path
in a convenient way, the shadows, and the presence of
water. The constructed environment with different colored
surfaces and with reflective properties is also important in
order to control the in-coming solar energy and the wind.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="3">
      <title>3. Heat islands</title>
      <p>Heat islands are microclimate regions with temperatures
higher than in their surroundings [15–17]. In countries with
cold climate, they are advantageous during the winter time,
since they decrease the demand of energy for heating. In
tropical countries, these islands may occur when the heat
dissipation by infrared radiation is smaller than the
thermal energy increase due to a large exposition to solar
radiation. They become larger or smaller depending on the
size of sky view factors and ventilation, and also on the
urbanization design. They directly influence the
airconditioning consumption of electric energy [13].</p>
      <p>It is worth mentioning that the rate of ventilation in open
spaces may rise or may lower the heat islands’ temperature
(the latter could be called a ‘‘cold island’’). Surface colors of
paved surroundings with different temperatures, emissivity
and reflectivity, different diffusivity and effusivity of
materials can modify an environment causing
uncomfortable sensations to their users, who withdraw from using the
spaces [18]. These elements are important to determine wind
standards disturbances, turbulences, and doldrums, and to
determine the wind shadow spaces.</p>
      <p>Heat islands formation is not always bad. It depends on
the influence on the people’s thermal comfort and on the
energy consumption through air conditioning. It should be
acknowledged that temperatures fluctuate throughout the
day. A region could be a heat island during the day and a
cold island at night, or vice versa. If we take the building
occupation period into consideration—or the occupation
period of a town section, whose buildings use follows the
same pattern—a heat island may lose its importance. For
example, a nightly heat island in a district of buildings with
daily occupation, such as office-buildings, does not
interfere in the thermal comfort issue nor in terms of
energy consumption through air conditioning. The same
occurs with a daily heat island in a section of buildings with
nightly use. If avoiding heat islands formation was possible
by urban design, what needs to be taken care of is to
prevent their occurrence during the day, in daily occupied
sections, and at night, in nightly occupied areas.</p>
      <p>That is why several geometric relations that link buildings
height and streets width to heat islands need revision based
on the above concepts. There is no doubt that the relationship
between daylight versus height will not change, but the results
may vary when promoting or obstructing the wind corridors.
At the same time, the sky view factors must be read from a
different perspective in relation to European urban projects,
since the differences of solar exposition as well as of infrared
emissions should be taken into account.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the daily occupation of urban sections should
have reduced sky view factors to avoid a great exposition
to solar radiation and to be less permeable to daily winds,
which bring air masses with higher temperatures than that
of the microclimates. Nightly occupation sections, as
dormitory buildings quarters, should have large sky view
factors and be permeable to winds, so as to dissipate the
hot air masses formed during the day.</p>
      <p>Regarding the soil occupation, it must be reminded that
all anthropogenic heat sources contribute to increase the
heat islands temperatures. As it was said, in the case of cold
countries, these islands behave as sources that help to
produce thermal comfort sensation, which is not true in the
tropics. Just to have an idea of how much heat people may
produce, it could be compared to the energy that comes
from the sun: the solar energy that the city of Sa˜ o Paulo
receives by square meter of the horizontal surface is of
150 kWh/m2 month. The average energy produced by each
inhabitant, per square meter, is of 187 kWh/m2 month, i.e.,
20% more energy than the incident solar energy. Certainly,
this average proportion increases when considering zones
of greater population density—it is well known that park
temperatures are always lower than in inhabited areas. The
fact that the towns present lower temperatures during
weekends confirms the anthropogenic heat contribution to
heat islands formation. Many authors have registered the
correlation between zones of industrial, commercial, and
services concentration—based on a great deal of
concrete—and the raise of temperature and pollution.2</p>
      <p>Therefore, contrary to the conclusions of the cold
countries urbanism, cities in the tropics should not have
a compact shape, but rather a loose shape of built
environment, in order to reduce the possibilities of heat
islands. It must be highlighted that this constitutes a real
problem in huge cities, but not when it comes to small ones.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="4">
      <title>4. Streets and grids shapes</title>
      <p>The possibility of using local winds to low the buildings’
thermal charge also depends on the town’s shape. Streets
orientation and the shape of its grids were—or are—
determined by the European cultural influence or by traffic
engineers (town planned for cars flow and not for
2LOMBARDO [19] referred to a correlation between heat islands in Sa˜ o
Paulo, in regions with more than 3000 inhabit/ha, more than 20 years ago.
pedestrians), instead of influence by local climate and the
people comfort.</p>
      <p>The choice of the grid and the geometric relations
between the buildings height and the street widths
determine where and when there should be shadow and
which winds should be at pedestrian level. In big cities, the
compact shapes—determined by the construction industry
speculation—obstruct natural winds. In case the vehicles’
circulation is very intense during all the day, the wind will
follow the traffic flow up to the third floor level. But, two
factors dissuade the use of these air currents: the intense
noise and the air mass pollution [20]. Therefore, dwelling
apartments should be located over the third floor.</p>
      <p>The orientation of streets and urban ways must take into
account the local solar trajectories and the principal
frequencies of winds. It is strongly unadvisable to design
East-West straight streets, because they cause visual
discomfort in the early morning and in late afternoon
and extreme thermal discomfort near noon.3</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="5">
      <title>5. Green spaces</title>
      <p>The distribution of green spaces among the quarters is
also important because the trees’ transpiration by
evaporation reduces the air temperature in summer. One needs to
be careful with these spaces in humid places, since humidity
rises very easily, bearing in mind, also, that if the canopies
are too thick they would block the ventilation. Therefore,
urban design must consider the kind of vegetation that
would adjust better in tropical climate region, humid or
dry. Another consideration is about how much solar
radiation the vegetation reflects and how much it absorbs,
its transmission coefficient (the shadow quality), how many
liters it transpires (or takes out from the soil), how much of
the infrared radiation emitted by the soil it blocks, how
much is emitted by its leaves, etc., because these factors
have a decisive influence for the thermal and visual comfort
of citizens.</p>
      <p>The presence of vegetation or of green areas is of great
significance, since it is capable of absorbing almost 50% of
the incident solar radiation. The World Health
Organization (WHO) recommends a minimum of 12 m2/inhab of
arboreous zone.4 On the other hand, the increase of the
impermeable covering area (or the modification of the
urban soil permeability) means a decrease of soil
evaporation. The greater the area covered by buildings and
constructions, the greater impermeability will result from
the relation between the paved soil and the naked but
compacted soil.5 Impermeabilization is one of the elements
3It is worth noting that this recommendation opposes what is well
known suggested to be applied in predominately cold countries (see for
example Ref. [21]).</p>
      <p>4Arborisation data for Brazilian towns: Curitiba, 46; Rio de Janeiro, 36;
Belo Horizonte, 6; Porto Alegre, 5; S a˜o Paulo, 4 (m2 of arborized zone/

that have influence on the reduction of the relative air
humidity, on the infrared radiation increase, which results
from the superficial temperature raise, and on the thermal
energy accumulated, as well as on floods and mud slides
provoked by intense raining.</p>
      <p>The size of squares (plazas) or other open spaces will
promote the movement of the nearby air at the pedestrian
level—knowing that the corridors formed by streets
increase the wind flow—creating calm zones near the floor.
The width of the open space, the kind of soil covering,
vegetation, and type and shape of the closing surfaces
determine the air movement [22]. In terms of spaces where
people traverse with great intensity, it is fundamental to
have control over the incident solar energy, which besides
promoting thermal comfort will help to prevent skin
cancer. It is possible to take actions to deal with direct
and diffuse radiation (obstructing it with different kinds of
a coverage) and/or the reflected radiation (obstructing it by
confinement or by modifying adjacent spaces) in order to
reduce their incidence over pedestrians.</p>
      <p>It is worth remembering that once the design’s objective
related to people thermal and visual comfort is clearly
focused, those spaces with intense human occupation can
be classified, just for operational aspects, as ‘‘Living
Spaces’’ (with specification about the kind of activity
and/or the function the space is meant to hold), ‘‘Passing
Spaces’’ (where people must pass by to reach to other
spaces and/or activities), and ‘‘Adjacent Spaces’’. This
work needs to consider knowing the schedules of the
population use, the amount of people that use them, the
kind of clothing people wear, besides the microclimate
data, the seasons’ characteristics, topography, and/or the
open space surrounding elements.</p>
      <p>The fundamental issue here is that solar radiation must
be reduced, surface temperatures must also be lowered, in
order to decrease the infrared radiation liquid flow, as well
as the air temperature (if this is done by evaporative
cooling, never exceed 80% of the final relative humidity).
The temperature of surrounding surfaces must be reduced
by cold pavements, water curtains, and confined water
slides or by sprinkled coverings, to reduce the infrared
radiation flow. The convective flow reduction can be
obtained by lowering the air temperature (sensitive or
latent cooling) and by aiding the movement of cooled air
(canalize the breezes or use fans or water streams).</p>

    <sec id="6">
      <title>6. Environmental shape, materials, and surfaces</title>
      <p>Public sideways must be designed for the activities and
the period of occupation they are meant for, thus that they
may correspond to the thermal and visual comfort of their
users. For uncovered places with a great movement of
people, the use of vegetal or artificial coverings to protect
them from the solar radiation is fundamental. The
environmental protection—reflection of inner solar
radiation or of the great quantity of infrared radiation emitter
by nearby surfaces—must be treated to eliminate or reduce</p>
      <p>O.D. Corbella, M.A.A.A. Magalha˜es / Renewable Energy 33 (2008) 1019–1023
these sources of thermal and visual discomfort. Galleries,
marquises, tense screens, or vegetation over the heads of
the pedestrian, or the open places under stilts (‘‘pilotis’’),
are of extreme importance, protecting them from intense
solar radiation or tropical rains.</p>
      <p>Materials employed and the buildings sizes affect the
thermal comfort of pedestrian on the pavement. The
diffusivity of the materials will affect the internal thermal
comfort and the electricity consumption of the air
conditioning, but its superficial effusivity,6 i.e., its capacity
to retain and send back thermal energy, will be responsible
for the pedestrian comfort. The colors of the surrounding
surfaces are also important due to its capacity to absorb
different amounts of solar radiation. These amounts will be
determined by the facility of radiation to reach these
surfaces, considering the existing elements that reduce
radiation, such as marquises, trees, etc. Surface colors and
reflectivity and the surrounding materials diffusivity and
effusivity modify infrared radiation and therefore the
comfort sensation for pedestrian.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="7">
      <title>7. Wind, shadows, and water</title>
      <p>In the humid tropics, air renewal brings benefits not only
because it incorporates air masses with lower temperature,
but because the renewed air brings less relative humidity
than in the case of inhabited regions. Consequently, during
occupation period it is important to promote ventilation
where people are present. But, if ventilation with hot winds
is promoted in uninhabited regions, the result is the town
simply heating without benefits for the thermal comfort,
because nobody is there. The direct sprinkling of water on
people’s skin raises the comfort sensation. However, this is
only true for those persons whose skin have been
moistened with droplets; for others, whose skin has not
been moistened, the discomfort sensation becomes worse
because of the higher air relative humidity. This situation
makes it difficult to evaporate transpiration—the most
significant way to lower the skin temperature in the tropics.</p>
      <p>Shadow and fountains may have a fundamental
importance in the dry tropics [23], or in regions with long
periods of dryness. In relation to the latter, there are many
microclimates with these characteristics in the Brazilian
central plateau and in the northeast regions. In these cases,
the adoption of an urban design that changes the features
with the season’s changes is recommended. As it happens
with several European parks, where there are trees with
falling leaves with plenty of shadows during the summer,
letting the desired sun get trough in the winter, public
spaces of tropical regions should also provide fountains
and/or water curtains during the dry seasons, forbidding
the use of such equipments and promote ventilation in the
wet periods. Similar considerations must be made referring
to artificial lakes or decorative water mirrors, which can be

their applications to a built environment, see Ref. [20].
good for dry regions but lead to thermal discomfort in
humid regions. In addition to the solar energy absorption
increase—in several hours of daytime—the reflection of the
water surface may cause glazing.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="8">
      <title>8. Solar and wind control</title>
      <p>In open spaces, solar radiation and wind must be
considerably controlled to provide human thermal comfort
to guarantee the use of these public spaces. Referring to the
geometry, sun trajectory diagrams and solar masks,
corresponding to the place latitude, must be known and
taking into account. Shadowing areas by constructed
elements (pergolas, marquises or kiosks) or by the
disposition of trees, together with the use of low absorbing
or reflective surface materials, can minimize the problems
provoked by excessive solar radiation—first by the control
of solar radiation that arrives directly on people and also
by diminishing the environmental temperature. In the same
way, space design must guarantee the penetration of
breezes that cause well being and refreshing sensations in
the environment, as well as blocking the undesirable winds.</p>
      <p>Among the principal effects of wind in urban climate, it
can be pointed out the stilts, the corner, the matting, the
whirl, the barrier, Venturi, different pressure zones, the
canalization, and the pyramid effects, studied by European
authors with the principal aim of reducing the thermal
(cold) and security discomfort of pedestrian [24]. The
security measures for the users of these open spaces will be
the same in the tropics, but the effects that control the
thermal comfort must be the opposite: the wind must be
directed to people instead of protecting people from it, to
improve the comfort sensation. The induced air movement,
if correctly used, could carry an additional comfort
lowering the temperature of surrounding surfaces in the
adjacent spaces.</p>
      <p>It must be observed that the difference of surfaces
temperature, produced by incident solar radiation, creates
air flows of climb the hills up and down, or flows between
heat islands and parks. Then, the climate of a town will be
a function of the soil use, of the geometry of the
environment, of the materials and surfaces, and of the
presence of vegetation.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="9">
      <title>9. Colors and reflections</title>
      <p>It is worth to acknowledge that daylight design in most
cases is not taken into account by tropical urban designers.
Since the ‘‘tropical sky’’ luminance is high, all European
measures suggested to increase it make no sense in a
brilliant sky landscape. Therefore, a usual urban design for
the tropics does not take daylight into consideration, but
does not realize that other kinds of problems are present.
Excessive daylight does not mean visual comfort. Because
of this misunderstanding, no attempts are made to reduce
the illumination level, nor to reduce the contrast produced
by the environmental reflection [25].</p>
      <p>In relation to the buildings envelope, to the areas that are
too exposed to sunlight, it is well known that highly
reflective colors reduce the internal temperature but, on the
other hand, they raise the thermal and visual discomfort of
the pedestrian. Nevertheless, the mirrored buildings are the
main big problem because, besides the inner thermal
discomfort created by the large glazing, they multiply the
negative effects of solar radiation on pedestrians.</p>
      <p>That is why Schools of Architecture in tropical countries
must inform to their students that, when they import
design solutions from a European town to a tropical one,
they are importing factors that will change history and
climate. Perhaps, this would be a correct attitude if the
urban planner aim is to provoke these changes. But, if the
changes occur based on a misunderstanding, in terms of the
climate interaction with the town, these solutions are
certainly not correct. A simple historical example of an
imported change from a different climate: with the
introduction of the ‘‘city for cars’’ conception, streets
paved with stone bricks were asphalted making the
temperature to rise, a very good solution for Paris, but a
very bad one for Rio de Janeiro.</p>
      <p>Integration ‘‘climate-town’’ is sustained by a regionalist
politic vision, commonly well accepted by the European
governments, but contested by the developed countries’
regime (Globalization) when to be applied in Latin America.</p>
      <p>Globalization proposes Global Towns for South America,
with first world enclaves, surrounded by miserable and
violent suburbs. In the enclaves, architecture and urbanism
conceptions are dictated by the formal standards of
developed countries, but climate and local environment are totally
disregarded. As a result of this, huge amounts of money and
energy are used to adapt these spaces, thus creating pollution
and social differences (basis of violence), as well.</p>
      <p>The bioclimatic conception, which should be taught at the
schools of architecture in the tropics, searches for integrating
architecture and urbanism with the local environment. It
redeems the right of citizens to have a better quality of life
and a better relationship with their history and climate.</p>
