        <p>The Fukushima catastrophe has led to important practical and conceptual shifts in contemporary Japanese architecture which in turn has led to a re-evaluation of the influential 1960s Japanese modern architecture movement, Metabolism. The Metabolists had the ambition to create a new Japanese society through technoutopian city planning. The new generation of Japanese architects, after the Fukushima event, no longer seek evolutionally social change; rather, the disaster has made them re-consider what architecture is and what architects can do for people who had everything snatched from them by technology (nuclear power station) and nature (earthquake and tsunami). Drawing on the architectural projects of Tange Kenzo and Metabolists in the 1960s and Ito Toyo's 'Home-for-All project' in 2011, the paper explores this major paradigm shift in Japanese architectural theory and practices.</p>

      <p>On 11 March 2011, a mega earthquake of magnitude 9.0 hit the Pacific
coast of Tohoku, Japan. Now known as the Great East Japan
Earthquake, it was the most destructive earthquake ever to have hit
Japan and the fifth most powerful earthquake in the world since 1900.
It was responsible for the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station
incident which has produced a series of ongoing serious problems from
leaking radiation. Over 250,000 people are still living in public temporary
accommodation, hospitals, and relatives’ houses or renting private flats.1
The accompanying massive tsunami which reached 40.5 meters at the
highest point wiped away almost everything in the affected area. The
official casualty record on 10 March 2014 shows 15,884 deaths and
2633 missing2 plus over 400,000 houses and buildings destroyed.3
These series of incidents caused extensive and severe damage to not
only the infrastructures of the affected area but also the Japanese
people’s psyche.</p>
      <p>Confronting the ruins has prompted the Japanese to not only
reconsider how to rebuild their lives, but also to work towards an alternative
understanding of the complex human-nature relationship. This particular
combination of natural and man-made disasters inevitably raises
questions about Japanese modernity and the faith in modernization in the
post-war era. One of Japan’s leading architects, Toyo Ito, remarks:
The reported scene of a fishing village in Sanriku [northern coast of
the Tohoku region facing the Pacific Ocean] devoured in seconds by
the tsunami struck me and made me wonder what Japan’s 60 years
of modernization since the war was all about. . . . I am amazed by
the fragile state of things despite all the economic and technological
‘strength’ Japan has been so proud of. . . . Was our achievement of
the past several decades a house of cards? (Koolhaas and Obrist,
2011: 697)
Japan is now faced with finding a different way of living which
problematizes many fundamental features of Japanese society. Yet this was,
nevertheless, not the first time this type of experience had occurred in
Japanese history. The massive destruction of Japanese cities in the
Second World War created a feeling of emptiness and despondency, at
the same time as it produced a great opportunity to transform
architectural philosophy and practice. Given the need to rebuild the devastated
cities along with reinvigorating the economy, new urban planning
proposals were needed. As a defeated nation, Japan suffered from a crisis of
national identity and thus sought to re-construct its cities as well as to
remake the new image of Japan.</p>
      <p>The modern architectural movement Metabolism originated in the
1960s and represented a new conceptualization of architecture and
the city landscape which embraced utopian futurism. Metabolism offered
the opportunity to re-construct the national image and to establish the
social role of modern architects in Japan. In doing so, the Metabolists
followed the modern utopian architectural assumptions in believing that
architects could change society and people’s habits for the good: in effect,
they saw their mission as ‘social architects’.</p>
      <p>Their architectural conception was based on the mega scale and the
total city plan. Rather than designing single, or sets of, large buildings,
they sought to design the whole city. The Metabolists’ ambitious dream
largely relied on the concept of ‘megastructure’, engaging with futuristic,
high-tech and utopian architectural design and total city regulation
systems. Here we can see there is an inescapable paradox between their
idealistic philosophical conception and their aim to practically design
the city (see Lin, 2010: 95). On the one hand, the Metabolists pursued
the goal of egalitarian and democratic living environments for as many
people as possible. They believed that the mass production and
systematic quality control of materials by development architectural technology
could make it possible to create innovative living spaces. On the other
hand, the central control system for the megastructure ultimately
requires centralization and planned control, in line with the
Metabolists’ main ambition to be ‘social architects’ and social engineers.</p>
      <p>The Metabolists, then, believed that their new conceptualization of
urban design helped legitimate not only their identity as modern
architects but also established a more utopian image of a future Japan. In
developing their theory, the Metabolists sought to promote the idea that
the city could be regarded as a supra-individual organism which could
generate its own autopoetic momentum/force. The concept of
metabolism is profoundly associated with ideas of natural processes and
organismic development. The architecture of the 20th century, ‘the age of the
machine’, was often characterized by Le Corbusier’s declaration that the
home was a machine for living. For him, ‘the futurist city of Antonio
Sant’Elia was an expression of the dynamism of the machine’
(Kurokawa, 1994: 16). The machine seemed to promise a dream-like
future. In contrast to ‘the age of the machine’, the Metabolists advocated
‘the age of life’. As one of the renowned Metabolists, Kisho Kurokawa,
remarks: ‘Machines do not grow, change or metabolise of their
own accord. “Metabolism” was indeed an excellent choice for a
key word to announce the beginning of “the age of life”’ (Kurokawa,
1994: 24).</p>
      <p>Although Rem Koolhaas’s (1995) architectural philosophy (city
without history – the city that acknowledges its debt to the past) and the
Metabolists’ (city with history) had very different senses of history,
there are some interesting common resonances with Koolhaas’s notion
of the generic city with its emphasis on ‘mutations’ and ‘autopoesis’.</p>
      <p>Rem Koolhaas and Hans Ulrich Obrist’s recent book, Project Japan,
appeared in 2011. It consists of interviews with the surviving members of
Metabolism and people around them, along with a good deal of archival
information and brilliant images. The book provides ‘a vivid
documentary of the last avant-garde movement and the last moment that
architecture was a public rather than a private affair’ (Koolhaas and Obrist,
2011: cover comment). Metabolism can be looked back on as the
nostalgic glory-days of Japanese architects. The Metabolists sought to
establish a higher and more influential social status for architects who could
reinvent the concept of modern architecture.</p>
      <p>Recent architectural thought has become more in tune with the
business climate and follows the principle of free-market capitalism or, in
other words, neoliberalism. Architects today can no longer expect to be
the powerful engine of modernization. They can no longer plan to
transform the nation via public architectural power in conjunction with a
strategic government alliance.</p>
      <p>After the zenith of their movement at Expo ’70, Metabolism started to
decline with the 1973 oil crisis. This shows the fragility of the power of
public architecture and points to the vulnerability of modern
architectural beliefs. The mega scale of the city plan with the concept of the
megastructure was put into question and became domestically
unrealizable, yet they found alternatives in ‘the combined demands of
independence of Africa, a modernizing Islam in North Africa and the Middle East,
and the emergence of Singapore, where the Metabolist aesthetic is first
established on the scale of an entire city-state (not by the Japanese, but
by gifted locals)’ (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 14). This can easily remind
us of OMA’s own astonishing, but also problematic, works in the Persian
Gulf and China where there was a concern with national branding
through the creation of extraordinary buildings.</p>
      <p>One of the questions Koolhaas and Obrist address is whether the
promotion of avant-garde architecture with major city plans to alter a
nation’s physical and political landscape can only be realized if they are
given a tabula rasa. For Koolhaas, the utopian idealism of the new urban
plan suggests that Metabolism can be seen as the golden age of
architecture. At the same time, his concern is that it can be looked on with
nostalgia, because it is hard to realize in contemporary neoliberal society.</p>
      <p>Hence, Metabolism can be seen as a telling example to illustrate the
contemporary dilemma about the power and significance of architecture.
This paper considers Metabolism as a modern architectural movement,
and discusses the way in which Metabolism’s techno-utopian futurism
might be understood through Japanese sensitivities. It also explores the
socio-cultural role of Japanese architects since the 1960s. In the first part,
the focus is on one of the most influential Japanese architects, Kenzo
Tange, who made an enormous contribution to Metabolism before and
after the Second World War. In the second part, the paper focuses more
on the conceptual level of Metabolism and considers their problematic
philosophy as utopian modern architects. It considers the ways in which
the concept of megastructure was deeply controversial in terms of the
realization of people’s autonomy to create their own aesthetic lifestyles
and sensibilities and to guarantee their equality and freedom. This was
because the centralization of the total city system was inevitably
programmed into the concept of megastructure and thus entailed the risk
of censorship/surveillance at every level of the inhabitants’ urban life. To
conclude, the paper seeks to position Metabolism in continuity with
classical utopianism and situate it against the background of the 1960s
Japanese social context to argue that the Metabolists could usefully be
characterized as ‘social architects’. Metabolism is therefore a useful
example to illustrate the critical conflicts between architectural
philosophy and the exigencies of the market in contemporary neoliberal
societies.</p>
      <p>The Emergence of Metabolism
The Debut of Metabolism
Kenzo Tange was the key person who nurtured and developed the
Metabolism movement. After the success of his Hiroshima Peace
Memorial Park project, which was recognized by Josep Lluis Sert at
Le Corbusier’s studio, he was invited to participate in the Congre` s
International d’Architecture Moderne (CIAM) conference in
Hoddesdon, England, in 1951 (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 110).
Tange’s plan was well received and appealed to participants in the
CIAM conference. This was the moment when Tange’s reputation
become established as an internationally well-known modern architect.4
The expansion of Tange’s international network accordingly provided his
students at the University of Tokyo with new perspectives through the
encounter with the modern architectural movements in the West.5</p>
      <p>Tange’s growing international reputation made it possible to invite the
world’s leading modern architects (Louis Kahn, Alison and Peter
Smithson and Ralph Erskine) to the World Design Conference which
took place in Tokyo in 1960. Tange’s assistant, Takeshi Asada, took the
initiative for the preparation and selection of the conference committee
and working group which consisted of young active architects,
architectural critics and designers. Thanks to Asada’s leadership and his broader
vision of the future of Japanese architecture, the group grew into the
avant-garde architectural activist movement known as Metabolism.</p>
      <p>With the strong support of Asada, Noboru Kawazoe, Noriaki (Kisho)
Kurokawa, Kiyonori Kikutake, Masato Ota, and Fumihiko Maki, all
initial members of Metabolism, completed a short pamphlet, ‘Metabolism
1960: The Proposal for New Urbanism’, which was distributed by
Kurokawa and Kiyonori Awazu to the international avant-garde
dele</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>gates of the World Design Conference for their own purposes.6</title>
      <p>In the introduction, Kawazoe wrote:
Metabolism is the name of the group, in which each member
proposes future designs of our coming world through his concrete
designs and illustrations. We regard human society as a vital process
– a continuous development from atom to nebula. The reason why
we use such a biological word, metabolism, is that we believe design
and technology should be a denotation of human vitality. We are
not going to accept metabolism as a natural historical process, but
we are trying to encourage active metabolic development of our
society through our proposals.</p>
      <p>Thanks to their successful informal debut at the World Design
Conference, the Metabolists consequently became internationally
acknowledged as avant-garde architects who developed a new concept
of the future city along with innovative architectural design.
The term Metabolism (metaborisumu) was used as the group’s name to
express the basic idea of architectural design and city planning. They
believed that the city was an organic entity which has the function of
metabolism (shinchintaisha). This meant ‘regeneration’ or ‘replacement
of the old with the new’ and was seen as ‘one of the most essential
features of living things’ (Kawazoe cited in Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 235).
Kawazoe was the person who chose the term Metabolism, which
appeared first in his introduction to the pamphlet ‘Metabolism 1960’.
For him, Metabolism was regarded as the most appropriate term to
refer to the idea that architecture and the city should be continuously
able to grow, change and renew as if they were organic processes of life.7
Cities were seen not as static and fixed arrays of material structure but as
corresponding to metabolic processes which develop to adjust to
everchanging environments.</p>
      <p>‘Organic’ was a leitmotiv not only for the Metabolists but also for
their western counterparts. In his book Towards an Organic Architecture
(1950), Bruno Zevi argues that the structure of organic architecture is
‘like an organism that grows in accord with the laws of its own individual
existence, with its own specific order, in harmony with its own functions
and with its environment’ (cited in Neder, 2008: 132). This architectural
concept was followed by Walter Curt Behrendt, who was identified by
Frank Lloyd Wright as the founder of organic architecture. Behrendt
also used plants as a metaphor to describe his buildings (Neder, 2008:
122–33). Like their western counterparts who developed the idea of the
organism as the key concept to describe the nature of urban evolution,
members of the Metabolists also believed that with modern technology
and design, modern architecture could change society and people’s
everyday lives.</p>
      <p>Megastructure: The City as a Building
One of the most important concepts was ‘megastructure’. In the 1950s
and the 1960s, the idea of megastructure was used by architectural
movements and became an important architectural topic both inside and
outside Japan. Megastructure refers to the mega scale of the city plan
which contains all the functions and systems for the city. Reyner
Banham, in his book Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past
(1976), explains that a megastructure can be seen as a single structural
framework with numerous modular units which are able to extend and
change when each unit needs to be renewed. More interestingly,
Jonathan Barnett offers a much clearer definition of megastructure as
‘the city as a building’ in his book The Elusive City: Five Centuries of
Design, Ambition and Miscalculation (1986).</p>
      <p>The idea of megastructure has always been central to the concept of
modern architecture and linked to the realization of the utopian future
city.8 Although a mega scale of city planning was not totally new in
architectural history, the development of the idea of megastructural
superblocks in the 1950s and 1960s can be found in works of ‘Team
X’, which emerged from the International Congress of Modern</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="3">
      <title>Architecture (CIAM).9 One of the influential members, Georges</title>
      <p>Candilis, began to design housing in Morocco in 1951 and introduced
‘megaform’ and ‘clusters’ as key concepts for the mega scale of urban
development (Ragon cited in Holden, 2009).10</p>
      <p>Archigram, one of the avant-garde architectural groups formed in the
UK in 1961, also developed the ‘Plug-In City Scheme’. An influential
member, Peter Cook, devised a plug-in principle which combined many
elements of megastructure: ‘the principle of collectivity, of
interchangeable units and the incorporation of rapid transport links’ (Sadler, 2005:
14). The Plug-In City was designed for the accelerating flux of city life;
what Cook would call the ‘come-go’ of Plug-In City was opposed to the
orthodox urban planning with its characteristics of clean, zoned, and
hierarchical separation. ‘Plug-In planning promoted architecture as an
event that could only be realized by the active involvement of its
inhabitants’ (Sadler, 2005: 16; emphasis in original).</p>
      <p>Archigram is often compared to Metabolism to point out the
uniformity that emerged at the time with their common futuristic and
technoutopian views of architecture and optimistic imagery. However, the
most significant contrast between them was their fundamental
assumptions about what were the major elements and agents in ‘the city’.
Archigram was strongly concerned with ‘plug-in’ spaces for provoking
new lifestyles for individual inhabitants (with the quality of everyday
life). On the other hand, the Metabolists and Tange embarked on
metastructural schemes for the total city system for the mass population, rather
than focusing on the city’s inhabitants (individuals in the city) as the key
entity. With their fascination for the idea of megastructure, Tange and the
Metabolists developed numerous future city plans of unprecedented scale:
Kikutake’s ‘Tower Shaped Community’ (1959) and ‘The Marine City’
(1963), Kurokawa’s ‘Helix City’ (1961), Isozaki’s ‘City in the Air’ (1961)
and Tange’s ‘Plan for Tokyo 1960’ are good examples.</p>
      <p>Like the European avant-garde of the 1920s, their megastructure
projects were not accomplished, but their techo-utopian vision of new
urbanism supported by a strong belief in technological innovation was
accepted in post-war Japanese society. Tange stated:</p>
      <p>In challenging reality, we must prepare and strive for a coming era
which must be characterized by a new type of technological
revolution . . . the control and planning of the production and
distribution of energy while creating productivity far surpassing that of the
present. . . . In the not too distant future the impact of a second
technological revolution will change the basic nature of overall
society. (cited in Jencks, 1973: 71)
Hence, the Metabolists’ megastructures can be found to have some
commonalities with their counterparts in the West: the fundamental premise
is the strong belief that 20th-century advanced technology could open up
the new paradigm of utopian human life. Some of the main
characteristics include:
1. megastructures consist of a ‘core’ (main framework), ‘jointed-together’ units,
capsules or cells and constructed collective units;
2. individual units, capsules or cells can be ‘plugged-in’ or ‘clipped-on’ to the
core framework and ‘plugged-out’ from the core framework;
3. the core framework has stronger and longer sustainability than the jointed
units or modules. Jointed units, such as capsules, can be replaced without
major construction;
4. there is the capacity to extend and regenerate without limit; in other words, it
is never complete, therefore it is continuously ‘growing’ and ‘dying’;
5. units, capsules or cells are standardized so that it is convenient for mass
production and decreasing unit cost.11</p>
      <p>The Metabolist architects tried to apply the concepts, jointed core,
units and capsules to their various projects, but it was only applied
metaphorically or symbolically to mega scale city plans and only used
practically for some building projects. All the projects mentioned above never
took place (except Kurokawa’s Nakagin Capsule Tower Building), in
part because of declining economic growth and the technological
limitations of the time. While they were not sufficiently developed in practical
schemas, these unrealized projects evoked a powerful image of the
techno-utopian future city.</p>
      <p>The Generic City and the Utopian City
The architectural ideas the Metabolists suggested can be related to
Koolhaas’s notion of the generic city. In his book S.M.L.XL, he
claims that if there is to be a ‘new urbanism’ it will no longer aim for
stable configuration but for the creation of enabling fields that
accommodate processes that refuse to be crystallized into definitive form (1995:
969). He also elaborates that cities are uncontrollable and keep infinitely
mutating. It seems that the generic city is free from existing urban values
but pursues the changing, never-stable and to some extent
over-pragmatic city. Thus the generic city can emerge and survive whenever it
mutates. The generic city is characterized by its ‘continuity’ and
‘autopoetic’ nature, which can recall the Metabolists’ architectural concept of
the city as a living organism.</p>
      <p>However, the generic city is based on Koolhaas’s criticism of
traditional urbanism and the need to deal with rapid urbanization in the
age of ‘globalization’ in the 1990s. It embraces the chaotic and
indeterminate along with disorder and ‘the staging of uncertainty’ (Koolhaas
et al., 1995: 969).</p>
      <p>It [the generic city] is easy. It does not need maintenance. If it gets
too small it just expands. If it gets old it just self-destructs and
renews. It is equally exciting – or unexciting – everywhere. It is
‘superficial’ – like a Hollywood studio lot, it can produce a new
identity every Monday morning. (1995: 1250)</p>
      <p>Throughout his statements about the generic city, Koolhaas
emphasizes, on the one hand, its intensity and never-ending excitement, yet it
also sounds gloomy, pessimistic and cynical. At the end of S.M.L.XL,
Koolhaas uses the metaphor of a film theatre to capture the essence of
the future city and concludes: ‘The city is no longer. We can leave the
theatre now’. In this sense, Koolhaas’s generic city can only be explained
through its opposition to the utopian future city, whereas the
Metabolists’ new urbanism evoked a totally affirmative utopian vision.
The Utopian City and Its Paradox
The Metabolists had a strong conviction that the qualities of everyday
life could be enhanced by the power of technology in the view of
utopianism.12 They believed that communal spaces in the ideal future city
would permit greater respect for people’s autonomy and help establish
democratic relationships. Although all the members of Metabolism did
not always share the same theories, ideas and schemes of urban planning,
they had more or less a common vision of huge communal living spaces.
The communal space was often represented as ‘artificial land’. Their
megastructure on ‘artificial land’ often contained individual living
spaces.13 The mass production of housing units or capsules required
standardization of prefabricated components. However, the
Metabolists insisted that prefabricated parts/units should not constrain
the expression of the inhabitants’ individuality, but rather provide
various combinations subject to the individuals’ tastes, styles and
necessities. They also thought that the increasing mobility and restless
metabolic change of the modern city led to weaker ties between people and a
particular place or land (see Lin, 2010: 91ff.).</p>
      <p>In opposition to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Broadacre City, which was
based on the idea that the ‘citizen of the United States would be given
a minimum of one acre of land per person’, the Metabolists believed that
freedom from the land led to greater freedom and mobility for the
people. Thus, they proclaimed that the land should be owned and
organized by a public institution, not by individuals. The total city system
should also be controlled and governed by a central administration.</p>
      <p>In this sense, despite the Metabolists’ basic philosophy, which
embraced progressive human development with greater autonomy for
people to choose their own lifestyles, what they actually wanted to
create was in danger of turning into the opposite. There is a fundamental
contradiction between their philosophical conception and the practical
design of the city (Lin, 2010: 95). On the one hand, they promised
democracy and freedom in everyday life; on the other hand, they thought that
life in the future city could be governed though a centralized system.14 To
this end, they considered the architects to be the most influential people
in the city system who should take the initiative to design not only the
physical layout of the city but also control people’s lives. A few selected
professional architects could be seen as ‘city architects’. When it comes to
megastructure, a group of professionals, such as architects and city
planners, should have the power to govern, because they believed that the
design of physical layout and environment can determine people’s
everyday practices in the society in which they live.</p>
      <p>This contradiction was not limited to the Metabolists but can be
found in many utopian modernists. They all have the same contradiction,
and thus the Metabolists’ contradiction can be seen in continuity with
classical utopianism. In some ways, it was part of the Metabolists’
mission to believe in the transformation of society. Although utopias are
hard to realize, they can still provide a sense of optimistic future
imaginary.</p>
      <p>This was a similar principle to that of their western counterparts, such
as Le Corbusier and Lloyd Wright, who sought to create a new order for
the world at large (Lin, 2010: 94). Le Corbusier’s famous slogan
‘Architecture or Revolution’ and Wright’s belief that architecture had
‘an independent role in shaping social life’ suggested that they believed
that they were able to ‘correct society on the drawing board’ (Schapiro
cited in Scott, 2007: 28). The Metabolists also had similar social ideals
and believed that they were able to design the ‘total’ planning of the city
in order to create a new society and therefore they would be able to
become the dominant social agent and powerful creator of the new
Japan.</p>
      <p>It was clear that the Metabolists embraced technocratic principles in
line with classic utopian thought. Although the Metabolists’ idea of
urbanism claimed to pursue the realization of people’s autonomy,
freedom and democratic lives, they clearly embraced technocratic principles
in line with classic utopian idealism. Kenzo Tange was particularly aware
of the new opportunity for architects to become powerful social
engineers, and so he called himself a ‘social architect’ (Lin, 2010: 94).15
The Decline of Utopian Metabolism
The Metabolist movement developed and culminated in the heyday of
the early 1970s but began to decline in the changing economic climate of
the mid-1970s. Given greater business competitiveness and the expansion
of people’s financial capacities along with the development of modern
consumer culture, the projects of the Metabolists became more entangled
with commercial interests. A good example was the 1970 Osaka Expo,
which was supposed to be a good opportunity for the Metabolists to
display their architecture, especially their image of the utopian future city.</p>
      <p>Although their buildings (pavilions) were supposed to express their
utopian idealistic city concepts, based on modern architectural
technology and the drive to represent a new image of Japan, their designs turned
into eye-catching billboards forcefully driven by sponsors’ commercial
interests. Metabolism almost lost its autonomy to express a distinctive
era and become a slave to commercialism. They had to shift gradually
their philosophical orientation from utopian modernism to neoliberal
capitalism. Another factor was the economic recession after the oil
crisis of 1973, given that the Japanese economy mainly relied on
imported oil from the Middle East. The declining economic growth
and the increasing instability of the architectural industry meant that
many aspects of the Japanese economy had to be reconsidered and,
therefore, the mega-scale of urban development became problematic.
More importantly, they had a fundamental methodological and
theoretical problem. The Metabolists’ urban theory largely depended on
megascale urban design and technological development along with
super-utopian optimism in order to pursue the organic system of the future city.
However, there was always the doubt that megastructures could be
realized with limited technological progress coupled with suspicion about
the optimistic utopian vision itself.</p>
      <p>Although Isozaki was sympathetic to some Metabolist ideas such as
‘the city as a process’, he was always suspicious of the Metabolists’
overoptimistic linear view of the continuous development of the city. For the
Metabolists, urban development amounted to an organic system which
could be more or less predictable and controllable. Whereas, for Isozaki,
‘the city is formless and accidental’ (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 37) and
therefore could face unpredictable catastrophic destruction. He argued
that organic metabolism in nature is always evolving and incalculable
and thus could not be planned – likewise the city.</p>
      <p>Japan has experienced military destruction and contingent events,
such as the atomic bomb, several massive natural disasters such as the
Kanto great earthquake in 1923 which destroyed and burned most of
Tokyo and, most recently, the 2011 Fukushima tsunami and nuclear
power station radiation leakage. These provide clear evidence of
Isozaki’s assumption that city development could be interrupted by
tragic accidents and thus could not be seen as linear. Consequently,
because of all sorts of reasons mentioned above, we can understand
that the Metabolists’ super-utopian techno-urban development could
not be sustained as the leading position in Japanese architecture. If the
Metabolism movement was ‘a circumstantial product of a particular time
and place’ (Maki cited in Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 307), it too must
necessarily come to a conclusion with the end of the era.</p>
      <p>Metabolists’ Utopian and Dystopian Inflections
In order to contextualize the Metabolists’ techno-utopian vision, it could
be useful if we look back to the time when the Metabolists emerged,
around the turn of the 1960s.16 The 20th-century utopia can be seen in
continuity with the 19th-century evolutionary utopian vision of society.17</p>
      <p>The first generation of modern architects in the ‘machine age’, such as
Le Corbusier, were inspired by industrial society: the steam engine, the
automobile and the airplane, which seemed to bring humanity
emancipation from labour and promise greater social equality. Later, the newer
generations, such as ‘Team 10’ and ‘Archigram’, sought to express
technologically-determined society in hypothetical architectural visions. The
Metabolists can also be positioned in continuity with those visions which
were based on trust in the independence of humanity from nature and the
belief that human beings could live in an artificial world produced by
advanced technology.</p>
      <p>Yet they started to become aware that the artificial world they lived in
caused negative side-effects, such as pollution and the deterioration of the
ecosystem, including humans. On the one hand, science and technology
rapidly progressed: IBM’s first commercial scientific computer, IBM 701,
was announced to the public in 1952; the double helix structure of DNA
was discovered in 1953; the national aeronautics and space
administration in the United States was created in 1958. On the other hand,
humanmade environments started to degenerate and threaten human life; the
Vietnam War started in 1962, raising criticism about its brutal
technologically-advanced weapons; Minamata disease in Japan was first
diagnosed in 1956 and was one of the earliest and most influential
incidents to make Japanese people aware of the risks of modern life.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, there has been a gradual shift away from na ı¨ve
technooptimism since the 1960s. The demystification of scientific rationality
gave rise to risk consciousness. In his book Risk Society, Beck claims
that civilization brought about threats which we find when we see
ourselves ‘exposed to radiation’ (e.g. the Fukushima nuclear power station
incident), or ingesting ‘toxic levels’ (e.g. Minamata disease), and in the
anxieties of a ‘nuclear holocaust’ (e.g. the Hiroshima atomic bomb)
(Beck, 1992: 72). His account fits surprisingly well both the historical
and current Japanese social contexts.18</p>
      <p>An invisible world becomes rendered visible, a dangerous world which
closely resonates with a dystopian vision of the future, and we can only
perceive the world we live in largely through the critical risk
consciousness of a dystopian culture. In Japanese history, people had repeatedly
encountered major disasters and calamities. When the Kanto great
earthquake occurred in 1923, Tange was 10 years old (and his mentor, Kunio
Maekawa, was 18 years old – he also faced the bombing of Tokyo in 1945
and was terrified but at the same time delighted by the potential to
reconstruct Tokyo). When the world’s first (Hiroshima) and second
(Nagasaki) atom bombs exploded in 1945, Arata Isozaki was 14 years
old and the youngest Metabolist, Kisho Kurokawa, was 11 years old.19
They were undoubtedly shocked and traumatized by those
unprecedented events. The profound tragedies they experienced would reflect
their perception of the future world. They could not believe in an eternal
stable society. For them, a future world could be characterized more by
the precognition of catastrophe than expectations of utopia.</p>
      <p>Yet the need for utopia can always be found in the middle of dystopian
times as utopia offers ‘compensatory escapism’ (Levitas, 1982: 53) or the
moratorium of the future status quo. If the Metabolists were fatalistic
they would need a utopia, because establishing continuity from the
(catastrophic) present to the hopeful future was so challenging. The more
catastrophic the society in which you live, the more you need a utopian
fantasy. Hence, it can be said that the Metabolists’ techno-utopianism
emerged amidst the dystopian vision prominent in Japanese society in
the 1960s.
As has been argued, Metabolism can be seen as a distinct modern
architectural movement which entailed a paradigm shift in architectural
aesthetics in relation to not only form and design but also architectural
concepts and philosophy in the context of 1960s Japan. In the wake of
severe war-time destruction, Metabolism had the ambition to create a
new Japanese image and national identity by representing the futuristic
utopian modern city. Although their primary intention failed, they
eventually created Japanese techno-utopian aesthetics in their architectural
philosophy. In both backstage and frontstage areas of the movement,
Kenso Tange was arguably the most influential mentor for the
Metabolists as the leading Japanese architect. He was devoted to
reconstructing the national image through his architectural vocabulary and
practice in the decades before and after the war. Given the new social
environment, he embraced technological progress, along with the
megastructure city planning supposed to help re-create a new image of
post-war Japan. The Metabolists were strongly inspired by Tange’s
architectural practices, theoretical articulation of city planning and
professional identity as a social architect.</p>
      <p>Clearly, the Metabolists were influenced not only by the global modern
architectural movements but also by dramatic technological advances and
the progress of science. Therefore their concepts were inspired by genetics,
biology, space technology, computer science, communication technology
and modern art in the 20th century. The term Metabolism referred to a
biological world of metamorphosis and transformation (Pernice, 2007:
358–9). The city was seen as a living organism, growing in symbiosis
with its own functions and environments. This suggests an appreciation
of the mutability of nature and the recognition that the practice of building
should be attuned to such natural processes.20</p>
      <p>The Metabolists believed that the city is a process and changeable, thus
it is formless and ‘non-plan’ (Hughes and Sadler, 2000). However,
architects paradoxically need to make a plan for the city. Although they
embraced people’s autonomy and freedom in the future society, their
major concept, megastructure, was accompanied by the idea of a central
administrative system where professional architects could play a key role
in designing and controlling urban life. Here is the contradiction. This was
the idea that ‘a single creator can build a society wherein a huge number of
people will live’ (Otaka cited in Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 35).
Individuals are required to adapt to and live under the technocrat society.</p>
      <p>This resonates with Tange’s philosophy of the role of the architect. He
sought to establish the social role of architects and anticipated that
modern architecture should play a key role in the transformation of
the city and city habits. Thus they should thrive in creating a new
image for Japan. The idea of the social role of architects was an essential
belief of the utopian modernists in both the West and Japan. In order to
re-create a new image of Japan, it was impossible for the Metabolists to
separate the city from its historical past, and for them it was important
that the city was seen as a vehicle for embodying memories.</p>
      <p>The generic city, on the other hand, is ‘the city without history’
(Koolhaas et al., 1995: 1250). This was Koolhaas’s response to a paradox
in contemporary urbanism. ‘The commitment to the historical concentric
form of the [European] city leads to the search to both preserve the
authentic city of the historical inner cities and the drive to constantly
modernize them to make sure they also keep their role as centres of
society’ (Hajer, 1999: 140). For him, ‘Not proximity but connectivity, not
history but adaptations are the key variables’ (p. 141). The generic city as
a global contemporary city no longer evokes homogeneous identity
but can be multiple. The Metabolists’ urbanism sought to create
Japaneseness through historical memories.</p>
      <p>In terms of the ambition of creating a national image and the image of a
future Japan, the mega-city plan was the most important productive
avenue explored by the Metabolist movement. However, they
overemphasized the city ‘megastructure’ as entailing a new paradigm of
urbanism. Tange’s ‘Tokyo City Plan 1960’, for instance, was the project which
attempted to create ‘a total system of the city’ for populations of ten
million or more. His perception of the mega scale of the city was inspired by
modern architects in the West. He became increasingly conscious of the
issue of scale through visiting large-scale European architecture and was
inspired by Le Corbusier’s Unite d’Habitation in Marseille in 1951. The
huge scale of urban architecture against the human fascinated him (Tange,
2011 [1984]: 218). Consequently the emphasis on mass, the flow of people
and cars,21 brought the danger that the sense of individuality and
autonomy could be erased; it made it easier to embrace the idea of meritocracy,
managerialism and technocracy.22 As mentioned above, Tange and the
Metabolists invoked a biological analogy and advocated a city in which
‘the natural force of the city continues to renew itself like an organism’.
However, this natural force comes from living entities – individuals and
existing nature. As long as people live in the city, the city keeps producing
‘happenings’, ‘events’, ‘stories’, ‘meanings’, and ‘emotions’ which can
never be destroyed by the mechanical force.23</p>
      <p>The increasing power of consumerism and the economic recession
badly impacted on the further development of Metabolism. This could
be seen as one of the most serious critical defects of Metabolism. More
significantly, the Metabolists tended to ignore the fact that the city is
always full of performers. Their city was modelled on biology but
focused on the buildings, city structure and system and, therefore,
neglected the living organic entities, the human beings, which are not passive
but active and living inside the city. For the Metabolists, individuals as
performers in the city amounted to ‘invisible entities’.24 In this respect,
the idea of designing ‘human spaces’ in the form of a set of capsules or
‘cells’ in order to integrate humans into the mega-systems was part of the
ambitious intention of the Metabolists to change social life, to influence
human habitus and to change everyday lifestyles (the classic idea that
humans should follow structure and system).</p>
      <p>Coda: New Architectural Climate in Contemporary Japan
As a postscript, it can be said that the new generation of Japanese
architects, contrary to the Metabolists, are no longer involved in
creating a mega-scale project in the city, but they work on
individual buildings which amount to ‘sheltered enclaves where
their clients could hide from hostile environments in the city’ (Lin,
2010: 229).</p>
      <p>The new generation of Japanese architects has re-discovered
architectural aesthetics in the space inhabited by living organic entities –
individuals – as the major actors. If urban life is constituted and constructed by
unexpected, unanticipated and incalculable possibilities and risks and
thus is always changing and never stable, the individuals in urban life
have to negotiate and interchange with their surroundings and need to
continuously be recreating and managing ‘the horizon of what we
consider to be life’ (see AbdouMaliq, 2011: 355). If this is the case, new
urbanism developments cannot be easily contextualized, theorized and
hypothesized. This suggests that ‘people and materials that operate
within any space actively or potentially can step in and out of different
senses of what is required and possible, different performances and
framing devices, different vertically layered strata of articulation and different
ways of paying attention and of being implicated in what is going on’
(AbdouMaliq, 2011: 356).</p>
      <p>It is important, then, to see that megacities are ‘living’ and ‘evolving’
complex and fluid intensities which are transformed by how
individuals are performing. Here, it is clear that the focus has shifted from
longing for the centralization of the city system and megastructure to
hoping to realize the individualization of living space for urban
individuals.25</p>
      <p>Unlike the Metabolists, today’s Japanese architects no longer
consider the speculative future city tinged by romanticism but seek
realizable ‘sheltered’ living spaces for individuals. They no longer seek an
evolutionary change of society; rather, they long for a self-controlled
sanctuary from the hostile and risky outside world. Yet a
self-controlled sanctuary doesn’t mean a self-imposed quarantine but a place
which can be sustained by restless interactive relationships with the
outside world. Here, one of the leading new generation of
contemporary architects, Kengo Kuma, emphasizes relationships between human
beings and all the entities in environments though architectural forms.
For him, the relationalities with the outside world provide the key
concept.</p>
      <p>Emphasizing the mutual relationship between architecture and the
environment is also a concept found in the early stage of Koolhaas’s
architectural theory. In his interview about the ‘Berlin Wall as
Architecture’ (Obrist, 2003: 508), Koolhaas explains that he tried to
see the Berlin Wall as architecture to understand the real power of
architecture. He found the meanings of the Wall could be determined by both
political and physical environments. He observed ‘how West Berlin was
actually imprisoned by the Wall, yet paradoxically West Berlin was called
“free” and that the much larger area beyond the Wall was not considered
free’. He also found that:
. . . the Wall was not really a single object but a system that
consisted partly of things that were destroyed on the site of the Wall,
sections of buildings that were still standing and absorbed or
incorporated into the Wall, and additional walls, some really massive and
modern, others more ephemeral, all together contributing to an
enormous zone. That was one of the most exciting things: it was
one wall that always assumed a different condition. . . . In permanent
transformation, it was also very contextual, because on each side
it had a different character; it would adjust itself to different
circumstances.</p>
      <p>He emphasizes, then, that architecture is not just contextualized by
different environments but that architecture itself contextualizes
environments. In this permanently changing inter-rationality, architecture is not
just a transforming entity – it becomes a ‘phenomenon’ (Kuma, 2009).
Continuing this line of thought, Kuma insists that ‘the architect must
consider to whom, when and how the building will appear, and those
calculations must include an idea of to whom, when and how the
building will be invisible’ (Kuma, 2009: 49).</p>
      <p>To understand this complex relationship and focus on much broader
sensory modalities which include not only geopolitical conditions but
also biological natural environments, he proposes ‘a new organic
architecture’ based on a new view of organisms. He argues that ‘an organism
is not autonomous but instead by assimilating and excreting external
matter at amazing speed escapes an increase in entropy and manages
to live on’ (Kuma, 2009: 57–8). For him, like an organism, ‘architecture
cannot be autonomous and can only exist as relationships’. He thinks
that ‘the overwhelmingly more powerful environment determines
whether we live or die’ (Kuma, 2009: 60).</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the environment today is clearly deteriorating and thus
we feel more dystopian sensitivities about our future life. His starting
point is not trying to control or change existing environments, but to
find the best way to harmonize with the present world we are facing.
Whereas the Metabolists concentrated on the total city system as a
self-efficient system and tended to ignore what is outside the city
system, Kuma’s scope provides a much broader framework for
understanding the inter-relationalities between culture/human beings
and nature/environments through not aggressive but temperate
architectural forms.</p>
      <p>Kuma’s architectural philosophy, which is to some extent shared by
contemporary Japanese architects, had not completely crystalized until
the apocalyptic disaster of the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami and the
accompanying Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station incident, still
an ongoing serious crisis. This disaster meant that over 100,000 people
lost their homes and were forced to live in public shelters (relief centres)
without privacy and with limited space. Hastily built temporary housing
can only provide ‘empty shells’ (Turnbull (ed.) 2012: 135).</p>
      <p>Toyo Ito expressed these sentiments after visiting the affected areas
and witnessing the devastating conditions (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011:
697). One outcome was his proposal ‘Home for All’, which was a call for
design submissions for ‘communal gathering spaces they can build in the
disaster areas in between the relief centres and temporary housing’ (Ito
et al., 2012: 135) in summer 2011. This was a joint proposal with Riken
Yamamoto, Hiroshi Naito, Kazuko Sejima and Kengo Kuma. What
they initially found in the affected area was that ‘people try to smile
and make do, using empty boxes for dining tables, staging amateur
concerts in cramped quarters in extreme circumstances’ (Ito et al., 2012: 135).
The group of architects stated:</p>
      <p>What we see here are the very origins of architecture, the minimal
shaping of communal spaces. An architect is someone who can
make such places for meagre meals show a little more humanity,
make them a little more beautiful, a little more comfortable.
Here they no longer pursue the creation of megacities but are dedicated
to creating simple communal spaces where individuals can communicate,
perform and carry out their everyday practices. Ito suggests that ‘we
[architects] need to start by questioning the way we relate to nature
[environments]’ and questions again ‘the people or community which
we [architects] always argue for in our architecture – aren’t they just
an abstracted scheme?’ (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 697).</p>
      <p>Architects, then, can seek to reassert the power of people as significant
active agents who can bring vitality and re-vitalized space – both for
architecture and for cities. As long as individuals, as living entities, in
the city do not lose their autonomy and keep performing across
information and material networks in everyday transactions, the city won’t
lose its inherent feature, which is to restlessly produce ‘events’,
‘happenings’, ‘memories’ and ‘histories’. As long as architects continuously
endeavour to better understand both mental and spatial environments
for human lives in urban landscapes, they can potentially create a new
paradigm of architectural concepts and an image of the future city.</p>
      <p>The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami and the Fukushima Daiichi
Nuclear Power Station incident clearly have brought a new urgency to
the question of how we can better integrate human imperatives with
those of nature without destroying our fragile ecological system. The
question is how to find a better paradigm to facilitate a dynamic shift
from 20th-century politics of science to the recognition of natural
environments as not only limited and endangered resources, but also
uncontrollable assets for human technology. This raises the question of
‘how can we modernize modernization?’ (Beck, 1992), a question which
we are still far from finding a way to adequately answer. As long as
human technologies, such as nuclear power, continue to produce
unforeseen events which can escalate beyond our control, the sense of living in a
dystopian time would be more realistic.
(which was published in L’Architecture d’aujour d’hui in 1962). He used the
model of the spiral shape of the DNA helix to plan the future city and
predicted it had the same function as the organic system which duplicates
itself like DNA. For him, ‘the spiral design of the towers was explicitly
opposed to the Cartesian model of a priori master-mass plan which . . .
could not account for the natural curvilinear evolution of environments’

and diffused their ideas of structuralism (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema)
and brutalism (Alison and Peter Smithson).
11. Kikutake’s Tower Shaped Community and The Marine City presented the
mega tower buildings which were constructed via several meters tall concrete
cylinders and dwellings and other accommodation attached to the core
cylinders. He proposed ‘vertical land’ (on the ground and beneath the
sea). Part of The Marine City plan was accomplished as Aquapolis for
the International Ocean Expo, Okinawa, Japan, 1975.</p>
        <p>Kurokawa’s ‘Helix City’ (1961) envisioned a module system which was a
reflection of the discovery of the structure of DNA. This was constructed
with gigantic scale spiral towers (each with a capacity for 10,000 people)
which were joined by an infrastructure of bridges. His ‘Nakagin Capsule
Tower Building’ was not a city plan but epitomized well Metabolism’s
fundamental concept. According to their different ‘metabolic cycles’,
Kurokawa divided the Nakagin Building into two basic components: the
mega-structure (two reinforced concrete shafts connected with bridged
units every three storeys) with the total set of capsules providing 144
individual living units. They were designed with different lifespans: the main
shafts would last 60 years, while the capsules would be up for replacement
in 25 years.</p>
        <p>Isozaki’s ‘City in the Air’ (1961) proposed a ‘forest-like’ city plan which
applied the ‘joint core system’. Each ‘tree-like’ mega scale ‘vertical core
provides the path for public transport with “branches” (lateral paths of
movement) emanating from this core which in turn sustain “leaves” (the
housing units), which intertwine and link-up to generate a network in the
air’ (Isozaki, 2001: 74). The multiplication of treelike structures produces
finally a ‘forest’.</p>
        <p>Tange’s ‘Plan for Tokyo 1960’ was designed for the rapidly increasing
industrial and urban sprawl, to provide a new urban proposal for the city’s
future. In this plan, the most striking idea was to fill up Tokyo Bay to create
artificial land which was intended to cross the bay with a mega-scale linear
expansion of interlocking communication routes. This was based on the idea
of the linear city with a tree-like structure.
12. If we think about the social context in which we live, utopianism seems a
completely dated and inappropriate concept. However, a number of
theorists believed that utopia can act as a catalyst for social change and that we
cannot live meaningful lives without utopias. Karl Mannheim’s ‘Ideology
and Utopia’ (1952), for example, makes this argument against ‘the
relinquishment of utopias’ (Mannheim cited in Mazlish, 2003: 44). This was not
a pragmatic ideal but more an emphasis on ‘spiritual significance’ (Turner,
1992: 187) and hope. What the Metabolists envisaged was the hope of a
future city which embodied the idea of democracy, egalitarianism,
classlessness and the freedom of the individual.
13. The capacity for units of individual living spaces ranged from 2000 in
Kurokawa’s ‘Agricultural City’ to 500,000 in Kikutake’s ‘Ocean City’
(Lin, 2010: 74).
14. Recent concerns about the issues of democracy and freedom in
contemporary urban life have been exacerbated in the debates about the
implementation of advanced computer informational systems, such as the use of ‘citizen
sensors’ (Gabrys, 2014), to improve resource efficiencies, sustainable
environments and secure everyday practices. Ubiquitous computing systems
potentially make it possible for citizens to input their level of energy
consumption in various everyday activities to the central database. On the one
hand, citizen participation in urban sustainability schemas can create
the chance for greater public intervention in the governance of cities. Yet
on the other hand it can also open the door to greater surveillance, so as to
further by stealth governance of citizens’ urban life. In this respect, it raises
the question of how far inhabitants as citizens can perform democratically.
15. However, his main social responsibility to be a social architect did not go
beyond the role of an agent of the government until he announced the ‘Plan
for Tokyo 1960’. The plan first appeared on Japan’s national television
network NHK as a special TV programme, and its ideas were not published
in any architectural journal but instead in the popular news journal Shukan
Asahi [Asahi Weekly]. As a result of this, the plan received instant public
attention. This gesture suggested that his plan was not commissioned by the
government and therefore it was his own proposal of a future Tokyo (Lin,
2010: 144–6). The plan was eventually taken up by the Japanese Minister of
Transportation as a potential national project. Although the plan was never
realized, at this point Tange become an autonomous social reformer or
social engineer, not just an agent.
16. If a utopia is ‘a circumstantial product’ of the time, like the notion of
‘modern’, utopias could be always emerging from surrounding social
environments at any time and place. Thus each era and society has its own
utopian idealism. Levitas states: ‘If you look at the history of the English
utopia, the kind of utopia prevalent in the 19th century forms a special
case, and that, by extension, one can see that utopias do indeed exist in
the present time, they are merely different in content and in social role,
because they are predicated on different assumptions about social
development, time and power’ (Levitas, 1982: 54).
17. ‘The utopias of the 19th century were predicated on a view of social
development that was evolutionary – i.e. continuous and progressive, and on the
assumption of human control over that evolution’ (Levitas, 1982: 54).
18. Beck states that ‘dangerous, hostile substances lie concealed behind the
harmless facades. Everything must be viewed with a double gaze,
and only be correctly understood and judged through this doubling.
The world of the visible must be investigated, relativized and evaluated
with respect to a second reality, only existent in thought and yet concealed
in the world. The standards for evaluation lie only in the second, not in the
visible world’ (Beck, 1992: 72).
19. Kurokawa developed the concept of impermanence, derived from Shintoism
and also Buddhism. He believed that the concept of impermanence could be
used to apply the idea that the city and architecture are continuously
changing and growing. For him, ‘everything we see is impermanent. Whole cities
can vanish in a day of warfare. It’s this idea that the Japanese believe in, not
the outward form. It’s the philosophy’ (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 385).
20. Metabolism can be contrasted to Koolhaas’s ‘generic city’. Koolhaas saw
the city as ‘liberated from the captivity of centre, from the straitjacket of
identity’. A city in which ‘if it gets small it just expands. If it gets old it just
self-destructs and renews’ (Koolhaas et al., 1995: 1249–50). This idea of
selfmaintenance by ‘mutation’ resonates with the Metabolists’ organic city.
21. He argued that the mega-city, like Tokyo, urgently needed to change its
old structure and system in order to solve the problem of rapid expansion
along with a radically growing population. In this view, he explained
that the transportation system was particularly significant for dealing with
the increasing mobility. Thus, mobility can determine the structure of
the city.
22. Over 60 years after the emergence of Metabolism, there is a continuous strain
of this idea in the present debate about the contemporary city plan. With the
growing attention given computational information programmes, especially
digital tracking systems, a new type of urban planning concerned with the
sustainability of the city has become a key issue for contemporary society.
‘All urban actors, at whatever scale – from the pedestrian to the megacity
itself – respond to embedded regularities they help to materialize and
normalize, in cognitive, affective and rhythmic ways’ (Crandall, 2010: 71).
23. This could resonate with Archigram’s ‘Living City’ which sought to not only
liberate people in the city by celebrating technological innovation but also
empower the inhabitants to create their own way of life. Archigram focused
more on the inhabitants as individuals who were incalculable living entities,
and acknowledged that the individuals were significant active entities who
could contribute to creating a ‘Living City’, which appreciated the
immediacy and feeling for urban life. ‘The future would not be the architect’s total
design, but a collaboration between architect and inhabitants’ (Sadler, 2005:
65). In other words, for them, the city was not seen as architecture with
hardware, but as ‘the individuals, “bare and naked man” with his complex
of personal beliefs and motives’ (Sadler, 2005: 65).
24. Unlike the other Metabolists, such as Kurokawa and Kikutake, Fumihiko
Maki rarely proposed megastructures and was primarily interested in
urbanism, not technology. He invented ‘group-form’, which was inspired
by seeing cities and villages in North Africa, India, the Middle East and
Europe. He learnt ‘a variety of vernacular human settlement and was
particularly impressed by their repetitive patterns and the intricate order with
the grouping of building’ (Lin, 2010: 32). Through this trip, he became much
concerned with individual units, which are largely subject to vernacular
human activities, and focused on a human-oriented vision of city planning.
25. AbdouMaliq also emphasizes the uncertainty of urbanism, which is always
in process and progress. He remarks: ‘The exigencies of dwelling require a
constant process of converting what is accessible into the tools of new
possibilities and attention’, adding that ‘The distance between reiteration
and change is always uncertain, and long histories of repetition need not
constitute likely guarantees’ (2013: 245).
