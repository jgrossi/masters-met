        <p>Privately built satellite cities are becoming an increasingly common urban development concept in peri-urban areas of South-east Asian cities. While these projects are beginning to receive academic attention, the majority of studies have a limited capacity to explain why and how they are produced. Most satellite cities built in the past five years have some degree of foreign influence from other East Asian countries in terms of invested capital, planning concepts or urban design and architecture. The majority of this influence originates from within the East Asian region. This paper argues that an investigation which incorporates both the relational and the territorial can increase an understanding of the production of satellite cities. This argument is illustrated with empirical research on two satellite city projects in Phnom Penh, Cambodia: one by a Korean developer and another by Indonesian conglomerate Ciputra.</p>

      <p>normally constructed in peri-urban areas
on rice-growing agricultural land or
reclaimed marshland. In this paper, a
distinction is drawn between satellite cities and
gated communities, some of which are also
situated on the urban edge. While there are
many similarities, satellite cities are typically
of a larger size and, more significantly, they
integrate various functions—residential,
commercial and leisure—that are normally
present in an urban area.</p>
      <p>As this paper highlights, Phnom Penh is
but the latest location for a trend that
permeated the larger cities of Indonesia in the
1980s and 1990s and that has since moved
into Cambodia, Vietnam and elsewhere.
The growing popularity of the satellite city
concept is in part due to the increasing
entrepreneurialism of urban governance, in which
a greater premium is placed on attracting
private-sector investment (Shatkin, 2011).
Related to this are the relatively weak
planning laws in some South-east Asian cities
which make it possible for such large urban
development projects to materialise. The
trend also reflects the demand from the
growing middle classes for housing and
better infrastructure, and from businesses for
modern office space in less congested areas.</p>
      <p>While the proliferation of private-sector
satellite city development is beginning to attract
scholarly attention (for example, Chen et al.,
2009; Douglass and Huang, 2007; Shatkin,
2011), there has until now been a lack of
emphasis on the role of intraregional networks
in the production of satellite cities. More than
a decade ago, Kris Olds suggested that
it would be useful for analysts of the UMP
[urban mega project] development process in
both consumption-orientated and
production- orientated projects to work with new
urban theories which focus on economic and
cultural interconnections, flows, linkages, and
interdependencies (Olds, 1995, p. 1736).
Shatkin (2011, p. 79) initiates this line of
analysis in the context of satellite cities by
stating that they are perhaps the ‘‘purest
form of inter-referenced urbanism’’ as they
symbolise the complete adoption of urban
planning and design principles ‘‘based on
an interpretation of how a global urbanism
should look and function’’.</p>
      <p>While the satellite cities in Indonesia
were built by domestic companies, the
more recently developed projects in other
South-east Asian countries are mainly
funded by intra-Asian foreign direct
investment. They are also based on models of
urban design and governance practices in
other Asian cities, or they utilise best
practice examples which are extracted and
emulated from other cities. The mobility of
capital, concepts and expertise has been
and remains central to the process of
diffusion of these urban projects throughout
South-east Asia. By examining the networks
through which satellite cities are produced,
this paper exposes the diverse connections
between cities. It also continues the project
of avoiding positioning cities in the North
Atlantic world, at the leading edge of urban
theory and practice (Robinson, 2002).</p>
      <p>There is currently in the literature a
growing clamour for caution in applying
Western-centric urban theories to cities in
other contexts. Receptive to the call from
Jennifer Robinson (2002, 2006), a number
of urban scholars have appreciated the
importance of considering all cities as
‘ordinary’ in order to post-colonialise the
discipline of urban studies, thus contributing to
‘‘develop[ing] a more cosmopolitan account
of city-ness’’ (Robinson, 2002, p. 532).
Robinson’s (2002) fundamental argument is
that there has been a persistent and
unhelpful polarisation in the field of urban studies
between analyses of global and world cities
on the one hand, and developmentalist
accounts on the other.
The ‘ordinary city’ approach aims to
promote urban theory that acknowledges the
relational webs of interaction between cities
and highlights connections beyond those
merely of business services. Robinson’s
ideas have been amplified by a number of
urbanists who have suggested that research
should approach the varied ‘worlding’
process of cities (Roy, 2009), and that work on
cities in the global South should not simply
‘add on’ case studies to existing Western
theory (McFarlane, 2008). Similar debates
have been initiated within the field of
economic geography (Pollard et al., 2009).
These arguments have been driven forwards
by relational comparative theorising that
moves beyond ‘‘static theorisations of place,
space and scale’’ (Ward, 2010, p. 473),
viewing the city as ‘‘open and constituted in and
through relations that stretch across space
and are territorialised in place’’ (Ward,
2010, p. 481). While the relational is
important, it must be balanced by an
understanding of place-specificities, such as how local
urban actors manage the impacts of and
interact with these global/regional flows
(McCann and Ward, 2010).</p>
      <p>Researchers have begun to consider the
ways in which cities in non-Western
contexts are interlinked. Such research includes
Bunnell and Das’ (2010) work on urban
policy transfer between Kuala Lumpur and
Hyderabad, while Lowry and McCann
(2011) and Roy and Ong (2011) have
written on ways in which Asian cities are acting
as models for other cities in Asia and the
West. This is part of a broader movement
towards considering the ‘worlding’
processes of Asian cities and the ways in which
they are becoming models that are
subsequently replicated throughout the region
(Roy and Ong, 2011). It is important,
however, not to relocate the problem of
Western-centric essentialism by creating a
new Eastern version, as Hogan et al. (2012)
have observed. Nor should it be suggested
that the East Asian region is a bounded
unit. The processes of regionalisation and
globalisation are interlinked and
overlapping (Ching, 2000) and, in practical terms,
activities in other parts of the world have
considerable ramifications for Asia.</p>
      <p>This paper builds on the aforementioned
theoretical ideas by using the empirical
example of satellite city development in
Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Urban issues in
Cambodia have been under-researched
compared with cities in other South-east
Asian countries. Phnom Penh is a city that
was totally abandoned during the Khmer
Rouge regime of 1975–79, but has seen rapid
changes in the past decade, as Cambodia has
become more integrated into the regional
and global economic system. The increase in
real estate development and investment,
twinned with rapid in-migration from rural
areas and low capacity for urban planning,
has created many challenges for sustainable
urban development. The central city has
witnessed numerous new high-rise buildings
and shopping malls, sometimes on land
previously occupied by low-income housing.
On the urban edge, a number of satellite city
mega projects are under construction, the
two most advanced being Camko City
undertaken by World City Co. Ltd from
South Korea and Grand Phnom Penh
International City by Indonesian company
Ciputra. These two projects will be discussed
in detail later in the paper. However, this is
not solely a story about private-sector
actors. The national state and the local state
have a role to play both in Cambodia and in
the countries from which the flows of capital
and expertise originate.</p>
      <p>The empirical research draws on
approximately 30 interviews with urban planning
professionals, local and national
government officers, non-governmental
organisations, real estate agents and developers
conducted between October 2010 and
August 2011. It also makes considerable use
of data gathered from a variety of sources
including newspapers, research reports,
investment statistics, legal documents and
government policies, as well as 20 shorter
interviews with people living near the two
satellite cities discussed.</p>
      <p>The remainder of the paper is divided
into five parts. It begins by offering an
overview of the development of satellite cities in
South-east Asia, tracing their origin and
increasing popularity as a form of urban
development. The second section provides a
brief overview of recent urban development
in Phnom Penh. The paper then moves on
to examine the production of satellite cities
in Phnom Penh. This includes a detailed
account of the two case studies and an
analysis of how they are produced. It draws
attention to the diversity of networks involved, as
well as the role of local institutions.</p>
      <p>Satellite Cities in South-east Asia
The satellite cities that have been developed
in the peri-urban areas of South-east Asian
cities since the 1990s differ on a number of
counts from the new towns constructed in
the post-war period. Post-war new towns
were largely developed by the state and
favoured no particular social class or income
group as residents (Chen et al., 2009). The
new town concept, stemming originally
from the ideas of Ebenezer Howard on
garden cities, became widespread in East
and South-east Asia in the cities of British
colonial territories such as Singapore,
Malaysia and pre-1997 Hong Kong. Garden
cities and new towns also became a feature
of cities outside Britain’s direct sphere of
influence such as Tokyo, Seoul and Taipei,
as well as those influenced by Soviet
planning initiatives, such as Beijing, Shanghai
and Tianjin (Phillips and Yeh, 1987).</p>
      <p>In the city-states of Singapore and Hong
Kong, the planning of new towns was a
response to population pressure because of
rapid industrialisation. These new towns—
for example, Ang Mo Kio in Singapore and
Sha Tin in Hong Kong—were mainly
designed to provide public housing (Pun,
1987; Wang, 1987), only later beginning to
have social services, amenities and
employment opportunities. New towns were built
to provide new housing, but also as tools
for the decentralisation of urban growth in
a region characterised by primate cities,
much as new towns were developed in the
south-east of Britain in the post-war period
to ease housing congestion in London.</p>
      <p>The satellite cities that form the focus of
this paper are different from their garden
city and new town antecedents because
they are developed by private companies
on a for-profit basis. This kind of
development originated in the 1970s and
represented a new type of urban development on
the edge of South-east Asian cities,
originating on the periphery of Jakarta. These
settlements are generally entirely financed
and planned by a single private developer
and designed for (newly) prosperous local
families and expatriates. Dick and Rimmer
(1998) suggest that initially, new towns in
Jakarta developed because of the response
from private land developers to a demand
from the growing middle class, especially
ethnic Chinese. Integrated urban
development projects are more profitable for
developers than single-purpose projects since
they incorporate several functions,
including residential, business, retail, leisure and
recreation into one development where
functions feed off one another to form an
aggregated urban system.</p>
      <p>The first private-sector satellite city in the
Jakarta urban agglomeration was Pondok
Indah. Initiated in 1975, this 720-hectare
middle- and upper-class housing
development was built on former rubber plantation
land. It was established by Ciputra in
collaboration with Lim Sioe Liong (also referred
to by his Indonesian name, Sudono Salim)
(Winarso, 1999). Lim, once the wealthiest
businessperson in Indonesia, was founder of
the Salim Group, one of the three most
prominent Indonesian ethnic-Chinese
development companies, the other two being
Ciputra Group and the Lippo Group. The
Lippo Group developed satellite cities such
as Lippo Karawaci and Lippo Cikarang,
two examples of the 20 or so satellite cities
over 500 hectares already constructed or
approved as of 1997 (Firman, 2004). The
mega projects of the Lippo Group appear to
be modelled on the design principles of the
garden city movement and the later
stateplanned new towns. At the same time, they
evoke 19th-century traditions of
familybased development capital working in a
somewhat unregulated environment with
little contractual trust between companies
(Hogan and Houston, 2002).</p>
      <p>The Lippo Group has two main goals
according to one of the company’s senior
executives: to make profits from real
estate development and to design
selfcontained cities which can be a model to
be emulated both in Jakarta and the wider
region (Benton, 2000). Satellite city
developments are commonly seen as
reinforcing spatial segregation as they shift the
wealthy into scattered residential
developments. Developers rather than local
governments perform urban management
tasks while the local state acts as a body
for expediting the development of satellite
city projects (Zhu, 2010).</p>
      <p>In the past 10 years, the development of
private satellite cities in the peri-urban
areas of South-east Asia has become
increasingly common as governments
increasingly view the urban periphery as
the most appropriate arena for privatised
urban growth (Leaf, 2002). Douglass and
Huang (2007) have examined a number of
examples of this phenomenon that have
been recently completed or are still under
construction. Phu My Hung (‘Saigon
South’) in Ho Chi Minh City is financed by
Taiwanese developers and will cover 33
square km of land and house one million
people (see also Waibel, 2006). Na Be New
Town is being built by a Korean developer
and is modelled on successful satellite cities
already constructed in Korea. The largest of
the satellite city projects surrounding Ho
Chi Minh City, called the North West
Metropolitan Area, is currently in the early
stages of construction. A Malaysian
company is undertaking this project, which will
cost an estimated US$3 billion and will be
some 18 kilometres long and 5 kilometres
wide. It is a similar picture in Hanoi, where
the Indonesian developer Ciputra is
building a satellite city under the name Ciputra
International City, and a Korean developer
is constructing an even larger project called
An Khanh (Star World). It is worth
mentioning that private-sector-developed
satellite cities are not unique to Asia. Similar
developments are located on the desert
periphery of Cairo, financed by UAE-based
companies and modelled on comparable
projects in Dubai (Singerman and Amar,
2006). The process of ‘Dubaisation’ has
infused urban development practices
throughout the Middle East and Africa,
in Khartoum, Sudan and Nouakchott,
Mauritania (Choplin and Franck, 2010).</p>
      <p>Foreign companies are not behind the
construction of all satellite cities and,
furthermore, smaller developments often
represent more significant drivers of
change. Labbe´ and Boudreau (2011), in
their research on Hanoi, caution against
overemphasising the imposition of
‘spectacular’ foreign urban development models,
arguing that such an emphasis is
inappropriate because foreign capital is behind
only a small minority of satellite city
projects. While much of the extant research
focuses on a select number of foreign
projects (as mentioned earlier), Labbe´ and
Boudreau draw attention to the roughly
500 new residential developments around
Hanoi developed for the most part by
state-owned Vietnamese companies and
with a variety of built forms, financial
arrangements and target populations. In
and around Phnom Penh, many large
residential developments have appeared over
the past decade, normally built by local
Cambodian-Chinese enterprises. However,
most of these are solely residential estates.
The two most advanced examples of
mixed-use ‘satellite city’ projects are
Camko City and Grand Phnom Penh
International City, which are used as the
primary case studies in this paper. Because
Phnom Penh is smaller than most other
South-east Asian capitals (it has a
population of less than two million), satellite cities
form an even more significant feature of its
urban landscape.</p>
      <p>It is apparent that satellite cities are
becoming a common phenomenon
throughout the region. As already shown,
what started in Jakarta has spread
throughout the Asian region from Hanoi and
Phnom Penh to Kolkata. This paper, in
agreement with Shatkin (2011), first, seeks
to argue that urban networks are central to
their development. Such networks may
consist of capital investment, the movement of
particular architectural, urban design or
governance styles, or the reification of the
imagined qualities of certain ‘paradigmatic’
cities. Kolkata West International City, for
example, is financed through a joint venture
between Salim Group and Ciputra of
Indonesia and Universal Success Enterprises
Ltd of Singapore. Secondly, certain urban
design styles are replicated, often as a result
of the involvement of consultants. Surbana,
a spin-off company of Singapore’s Urban
Redevelopment Authority, works on
satellite city masterplanning in various
countries, exporting the urban development
knowledge accrued at home. Thirdly,
specific cities are deemed successful and
replicated in other contexts. Citra Raya,
another Ciputra project, is located in
Surabaya. The city is marketed as a
‘miniSingapore’, capitalising on the city-state’s
image as wealthy, modern and liveable. The
urban landscape is planted with trees and
public space is adorned with Singapore
icons such as statues of the Merlion and
Stamford Raffles.</p>
      <p>Although the concept and design may be
evocative of American suburbia and gated
communities, the production process is
firmly grounded within East Asia. In this
sense, there is need for a revision of Dick
and Rimmer’s (1998) argument that in the
age of globalisation there is a convergence
in urban form between South-east Asian
cities and those in the West. On the
simplest level, satellite city urban form borrows
heavily from the style of American gated
communities. In the case of the Lippo
Group, it has been said that this is because
the head of the company, James Riady,
spent time in California whilst studying for
a graduate business degree (Silver, 2008).
However, a deeper examination of the
production of East Asian satellite cities requires
a more thorough look beyond urban form
towards the networks through which they
are produced.</p>
      <p>Phnom Penh’s Recent Development
Our particular focus in this paper is on
Phnom Penh, where a number of satellite
city projects have been proposed or are
currently under construction. The two major
satellite cities funded by foreign investors
are Camko City and Grand Phnom Penh
International City, developed respectively
by Korean (World City Co. Ltd) and
Indonesian (Ciputra Group) companies,
the latter acting in partnership with a local
Cambodian company. These projects are
sited in close proximity to each other in the
peri-urban districts of Sensok and Russei
Keo (Figure 1). Camko City is located on
the very edge of the existing built-up area
of Phnom Penh city, whilst Grand Phnom
Penh International City is situated 5 km
further north. Another satellite city, built
by a local company, Overseas Cambodian
Investment Corporation and known as
Chrouy Changvar City of the Future, was
recently given approval by the government.
There are also approximately 90 housing
developments (known as borei in Khmer)
being undertaken by local companies
(Municipality of Phnom Penh, 2011a).
These are not all ‘gated communities’ and
many are targeted at lower- and
middleincome buyers. Some of them are very
large, up to 2000 hectares, such as Borei
Santepheap III and AZ City.</p>
      <p>The development of satellite cities is set
in the context of Cambodia’s political
economy and changing position in global capital
networks. During the 1990s, political
instability linked to the remaining Khmer
Rouge factions and the 1997 fighting
between the Cambodian People’s Party and
FUNCINPEC,3 meant that there were only
small investments in urban development.
There was little pressure on land and prices
thus remained mostly very low. Yet between
2004 and 2007, the price of land in central
Phnom Penh increased exponentially from
around US$250 to US$2000 per square
metre (GTZ, 2009). This increase was due
to a combination of interrelated factors.
The elections of 2003 gave way to a period
of relative political stability (Albritton,
2004). Talk of political stability gave the cue
to foreign investors that now was the time
to put money into Cambodia, where there
was the potential for higher returns than
could be had in more developed countries.
This was augmented by the fact that tighter
regulations in financial centres such as
Singapore resulted in capital flowing to
places with looser legal environments such
as Cambodia, where the government was
receptive to foreign direct investment
(FDI). According to the most recent data,
China is the largest source of FDI in
Cambodia, with investments worth US$893
million in 2009, while Korea was the largest
foreign investor in Cambodia in 2006 and
2008, with figures of US$1.009 billion and
US$1.237 billion respectively (KOTRA,
2010). In terms specifically of real estate
and urban development capital, South
Korea heads the rankings. Real estate and
construction accounted for 71 per cent of
the total South Korean investment during
2010 (KOTRA, 2010). Concurrently,
wealthy Cambodians began to bring back
money stored in overseas bank accounts
(Cambodia Daily, 2005). Land is seen as
one of the very few secure places in which
to invest money in a country where
suspicion of the banking system remains and
where speculation has been widespread.</p>
      <p>In 2008 the global economic crisis began
to have an impact on Cambodia’s urban
development, although it primarily affected
projects financed by foreign investors. Real
estate prices fell, economic growth slowed
and banks began to restrict loans for
developers and customers as global capital
markets slowed down. Many of the projects
announced in the boom period were either
cancelled (for example, GS Engineering and
Construction’s (E&amp;C) International
Financial Centre), put on hold (POSCO
E&amp;C’s Star River condominiums) or
paused mid-way through construction
(Gold Tower 42). All of these three were
Korean developments.</p>
      <p>Although the city centre has changed
spectacularly with the construction of
shopping malls and high-rise buildings, much of
the new development has occurred in
periurban areas. In terms of population growth,
the outer four districts experienced an
increase of between 90 per cent and 180 per
cent in the decade from 1998 to 2008.
Meanwhile, all but one of the central
districts saw a small decline in population
(Municipality of Phnom Penh, 2011b).
This population growth in peri-urban areas
is due to new housing developments,
garment factory worker accommodation and
the relocation of poor urban communities
from the centre to the periphery of the city.
In 2009, 72 per cent of poor urban families
were living in the four outer districts, up
from 50 per cent in 1997 (STT, 2009).
Between 1990 and 2011, 30 000 families
(accounting for about 150 000 people) in
Phnom Penh were displaced (STT, 2011),
two-thirds of them since 2000.</p>
      <p>As the former paddy fields around
Phnom Penh have been sold for
development, the government has expanded the
boundary of the municipality to encompass
districts of Kandal province in an attempt
to improve urban planning (Phnom Penh
Post, 2010a). Land prices in peri-urban
areas peaked in 2006–08 at approximately
$200–250 per square metre, while in 2011
the price had fallen to around half that level
(Phnom Penh Post, 2011), still a big increase
from a decade earlier when land values
were just a few dollars per square metre.
The drivers of peri-urbanisation in Phnom
Penh are clearly similar to those in other
major cities in the South-east Asian region:
land at lower prices and unclear and weak
spatial planning policies (Hudalah et al.,
2007; Webster, 2002).</p>
      <p>The Production of Satellite Cities</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>in Phnom Penh</title>
      <p>Camko City is a $2 billion project, planned
to cover 120 hectares when, and if, all phases
are constructed as originally intended. The
concept originated from a visit by several
Korean businesspeople to Cambodia in the
mid 2000s. They felt that there was no
suitable office space for global businesses. At the
time, most companies were located in
converted villas or small office buildings, and
they were often subject to electricity cuts
and monsoon season flooding. Opinion was
mobilised behind the construction of a
modern office district with high-quality
infrastructure located outside the congested
city centre. Hence the company’s name
‘World City Company’ and the slogan
branding Camko City as ‘‘the first global city
in Phnom Penh’’. Commercial space is the
primary objective, but related to this is the
construction of luxury houses and
apartments, as well as leisure facilities, an
international school and a hospital. Camko City
was designated as a ‘Financial Development
District’, a type of special economic zone
with incentives from the Ministry of
Commerce to attract financial industries,
especially those from Korea. Cambodia’s
new stock exchange was originally planned
for Camko City but is now due to open in
Canadia Tower, the first high-rise office
building in central Phnom Penh, because of
delays in Camko City’s construction.</p>
      <p>In addition to the main investment and
project management company, Landmark
World-wide, Camko City involves a roll call
of related Korean companies in financing
(Shinhan Bank and Busan Sangho Bank),
construction (Hanil), construction
management (Korea Power Engineering Company)
and infrastructure planning (Yooshin).
Urban design and architecture were
undertaken by K2A, a company based in Hong
Kong. The international consultancy
company AECOM, which has offices in most
large cities in the region, was employed to
conduct a market assessment and
positioning study in Phnom Penh.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing (October 2011),
the first phase, consisting of villas,
townhouses and several high- and mid-rise
condominiums, has been completed. Despite
the fact that there are over 1000 units
completed and they are 90 per cent sold out
(interview, Camko City management), it is
apparent that these sales have been mainly
speculative as only 150 families are living
there. In mid 2010, the government passed
a new law to deregulate the property market
by allowing foreigners to own property
above the first floor of a building, up to a
maximum limit of 70 per cent foreign
ownership in one particular development
(Phnom Penh Post, 2010b). Since then,
approximately 30 per cent of the high-rise
units in Camko City have been sold to
foreigners, mainly from Korea and Singapore.
Villas and townhouses are bought
principally by wealthy, high-ranking government
officials and business people. The cost of
condominiums ranges from $150 000 to
$300 000, while landed properties range
from $200 000 to well over $500 000 for the
larger villas. Most of the condominiums are
bought as investments to rent and are
advertised at around $600–800 per month.
Grand Phnom Penh International City
Located nearby is Grand Phnom Penh
International City, a 260-hectare
development undertaken through a joint venture
between Ciputra Group of Indonesia and
the YLP Group of Cambodia. Within the
joint venture, YLP Group initially owned
and prepared the land, while Ciputra is
responsible for the design, planning and
construction. Surbana designed an
underground infrastructure system for
communications and utilities.</p>
      <p>This development is more
consumptionoriented than Camko City and is built
around a large golf course. According to the
master plan for the development, it will
house 4000 families upon completion and
contain facilities such as schools, a hospital,
water amusement park, hotel, shopping mall
and office buildings. As of 2011,
approximately 200 houses and the golf course have
been completed since the project’s inception
in 2007 (interview, planner, Ciputra).
Ciputra do not anticipate completing the
project until at least 2020. Prices range from
$100 000 for the smallest houses (‘Sicily’) to
over $600 000 for the largest property
(‘Chateau 3’). Only Cambodian citizens can
purchase houses here as they are landed
property rather than a condominium in a
co-owned building.
South Korea is the largest investor in real
estate and construction projects in
Cambodia. South Korean companies were
among the first to open garment factories
in the 1990s, later being pioneers in the real
estate and urban development industries.
Koreans began investing in real estate
projects in 2004/05, when the Korean
domestic market was in a downturn (Postlewaite,
2008), and investment increased rapidly until
2008 and the global financial crisis. Korean
projects have predominantly focused on
high-rise condominium buildings as well as
Camko City.</p>
      <p>Parallel to these investment flows
has been the formation of significant
Korean business networks, with at least 550
Korean companies operating in Cambodia
(KOTRA, 2010). Korean capital has been
brought in through Korean banks;
construction machinery and materials have
been imported from Korea with generous
import tax exemptions; and Korean
construction companies, architects, engineers,
surveyors and property lawyers are working
in partnership with developers. All this has
resulted in a significant migration of
Korean professionals to Cambodia;
estimates range from 4000 to 7000 (Phnom
Penh Post, 2008). In Camko City, almost all
of the materials and construction
machinery was imported from Korea.</p>
      <p>A number of factors explain the Korean
interest in urban development projects in
Phnom Penh. Korean businesses were the
first to see the potential in Cambodia. The
situation in Cambodia reminded them of
what they had experienced in Korea after the
Korean War, when the country developed
rapidly and property prices and land values
increased exponentially (interview, Korean
trade organisation official). They predicted
that the same would happen in Cambodia
and they argue that their prediction was
accurate, at least until 2009. On a similar note,
Korea’s rapid urbanisation and development
meant that Korean companies have gained
considerable expertise in urban development.
This is particularly the case regarding the
technologies and construction techniques
required for high-rise apartment buildings.
The urban development arms of large Korean
conglomerates such as POSCO Engineering
and Construction E&amp;C, Nuri E&amp;C and GS
E&amp;C have for some time been looking for
overseas opportunities in South-east Asia,
China and the Middle East as they have
outgrown the domestic market. On the political
front, there is a close diplomatic relationship
between Cambodia and Korea. Indeed, Lee
Myung Bak, president of South Korea at the
time of writing, had previously held an
appointment as an economic advisor to
Cambodia’s prime minister.</p>
      <p>The political and economic situation in
Korea is a major determinant of Korean
influence in Cambodia. In the period after
the Korean War, inward investment and
domestic growth were promoted over FDI.
Nevertheless, as Korea developed rapidly,
local opportunities began to be exhausted
and wage increases reduced the
competitiveness of Korean products compared with
lower cost countries (Jae, 2007). Combined
with state efforts to encourage
internationalisation, this increased the number of
Korean businesses, particularly the chaebol
(large conglomerates with close political
ties), expanding overseas (Wad, 2002).</p>
      <p>While Korean companies dominate the
field of foreign investment in urban
development in Cambodia, they are not the only
players. As mentioned earlier, Grand Phnom
Penh International City is being developed
by the Indonesian company Ciputra. The
project in Cambodia is modelled on similar
cities already built in the developer’s country
of origin. All of Ciputra’s satellite city
projects share broadly similar architectural styles
and urban forms, regardless of their
location, particularly the imposing entrance
archway and a residential architecture
reminiscent of historical European styles.
Although the exterior and interior design is
European in appearance and the names of
each type of house are Italian and French,
they retain some adaptation to Asian climate
and culture such as open-air kitchens.
Additionally, Ciputra’s developments are
modified to fit local cultural contexts. In the
Cambodian case, the design team undertook
market research and ascertained that
Cambodian buyers prefer larger houses than
their Indonesian customers (interview,
planner and designer, Ciputra). They also named
houses after places in France, reflecting the
country’s history as a French protectorate.</p>
      <p>In comparison with Korea, Indonesia
does not have a particularly large presence
in Cambodia in terms of investment, or
significant political ties. The satellite city
development is driven more by the
networks of the Ciputra company itself, which
has begun diversifying its business activities
overseas to Phnom Penh, as well as Kolkata,
Hanoi and Shenyang in China (Jakarta
Globe, 2009). The company name originates
from that of the company founder, Ir.
Ciputra (his original Chinese name was Tjie
Tjin Hoan), and still remains an
ethnicChinese family business. The company
anticipates that greater profits can be had
abroad (Jakarta Post, 2011). Ciputra’s
regional expansion emanates from its
position as one of the leading property
developers in Indonesia. Its strong position is
primarily due to the company’s ability to
obtain large areas of cheap rural land, along
with the rights to convert that land into
urban usage. Large developers with
privileged access to finance and close political
connections were able to do this (Leisch,
2002; Rimmer and Dick, 2009). Ciputra, for
example, aligned itself with the Salim
Group, which had close links with President
Suharto (Dieleman, 2011; Dieleman and
Sachs, 2008).</p>
      <p>Local Interactions with Regional Flows
Mutually constitutive with the regional
flows are local forces, particularly the
interactions with the local and national state.
Real estate and construction is one of the
national government’s four economic
priority areas because of its perceived
potential for job creation (Hun Sen, 2008);
it accounted for 20 per cent of economic
growth between 1998 and 2006 (Ear, 2008).
The Council for the Development of
Cambodia is tasked with ensuring an easy
passage for potential investments as well as
promoting Cambodia overseas as a
destination for foreign direct investment.
Cambodia, in fact, has a very open
economy. Companies can be foreign owned in
almost all sectors of the economy; there is a
low corporate tax rate (20 per cent) and
profits can be freely repatriated. A draft
summary of the city’s master plan, which is
still in the process of being finalised,
mentions explicitly that the East Asian region is
one from which capital can be mobilised.
Over 90 per cent of cross-border real estate
investment in Asia originates from within
the region (CBRE, 2009).</p>
      <p>At the city scale, satellite city
development has occurred through large land
acquisitions enacted through sub-decrees signed
at the highest levels of government. A
satellite city project proposed by a local company
the Ly Yong Phat Group, was preceded by a
sub-decree legally changing the status of
1300 hectares of land from state/public to
state/private property (Cambodia Daily,
2011). Another, named Chrouy Changvar
City, is being built by Overseas Cambodia
Investment Corporation on the site of a
cancelled Malaysian project named Sunway
City. In this case, the national government
designated the land as a ‘development zone’,
leaving the Municipality of Phnom Penh the
task of announcing and regulating a ban on
all land sales, new construction and
earthworks within the zone, as well as
compensating landowners (Municipality of Phnom
Penh, 2011c). Local companies are
undertaking both these projects, although it is not
clear from where all of the financing
originates. The land for Camko City was
purchased by Korean investors from two local
companies who had previously prepared the
land for development (interview, Camko
City management). Grand Phnom Penh
International City was developed through
collaboration with the YLP Group, owned
by a military family. The opaqueness of the
planning process helps the interests of
wellconnected developers, a situation that is
similar to satellite city developments in
Indonesia (Firman, 2000).</p>
      <p>There are a number of challenges to
effective urban planning in Phnom Penh in
addition to the rather top–down nature of
project approvals alluded to in the previous
paragraph. In particular, the legal
framework for urban planning has not kept up
with the influx of capital in urban
development and the large size of new projects.
The most relevant piece of urban planning
legislation, Sub-decree No. 86 on
construction permits, was designed for individual
buildings rather than developments of the
size of an urban district. This is beginning
to change with the introduction of
Subdecree No. 39 on the management of borei
housing developments. This law seeks to
manage the impact of large urban
development projects and covers issues such as
landownership transfers and means of
avoiding environmental problems for
surrounding communities. In addition, there
are many other difficulties facing urban
planning in Cambodia for which there is
not sufficient space here to explore. These
include the lack of government budget and
human resources for urban planning, the
low priority given to urban issues and the
extent of illegal urban development.</p>
      <p>Urban development projects are by and
large decided at high levels of government
before a real urban planning process takes
place at the local level. This means that the
social and environmental impacts are not
fully taken into account. As has been
suggested in the comparable case of Hanoi
(Monthe´ard, 2010; DiGregorio, 2011),
periurban developments such as satellite cities
can destabilise existing populations and
endanger people’s livelihoods because of
the wider transformation of the landscape
even if no actual displacement takes place.
Satellite cities can damage the environment
through the filling-in of much-needed
floodwater run-off areas. The severe
flooding that engulfed parts of central Cambodia
and Thailand in the autumn of 2011
testifies to the importance of this. While
focusing on the construction of urban facilities
for the transnational rich, it is important to
remain aware of the serious impact that
these have on the livelihoods of peri-urban
farmers and other long-time residents. In
this paper we have focused on the processes
behind these urban development projects,
but that should not lead to a neglect of
underlying issues of social displacement.
Satellite cities are becoming an ever more
common feature in the peri-urban areas of
South-east Asian cities. They are significant
because of both their size and the
configuration of the roles of public and private actors.
In the majority of cases, satellite cities
materialise through foreign influence in terms of
financing or design, much of which
originates from within the East Asian region. The
paper focused on Phnom Penh, examining
Camko City and Grand Phnom Penh
International City. Methodologically, the
paper sought to understand the process of
satellite city development by taking into
account the relational and territorial aspects.
The development of Camko City can be
partly explained by the expertise of Korean
urban development companies as well as the
dense network of relations between the two
countries. Grand Phnom Penh International
City, on the other hand, is less dependent on
close political relationships. It is contingent
on the motivations of the ethnic-Chinese
Ciputra company to regionalise and the
company’s history and experience of satellite
city development in Indonesia.</p>
      <p>We attribute the energies devoted to
these urban development projects to a
number of factors. The lack of state capacity
for urban planning and appetite for city
building creates the conditions in which
private companies undertake urban
development projects of an enormous size. In
addition, the state’s failure to provide
adequate urban infrastructures encourages the
private sector to move in. This caters to a
growing demand for satellite city living
from middle- and upper-income groups,
who are wooed by images of a cosmopolitan
lifestyle. Businesses too evince the desire to
move out of makeshift space in the city
centre into the appropriately international
setting of a satellite city. At the same time,
governments have become increasingly
entrepreneurial in order to attract
investment from regional urban development
companies. We have shown here that much
of the investment in satellite city projects
originates from within the East Asian
region, including much but not all of it
from Korea and Indonesia. It is indeed
predominantly from regional firms that
citybuilding expertise and experience come.
This conclusion suggests the need for a
reconceptualisation of Dick and Rimmer’s
(1998) by-now rather dated assertion that
satellite cities represent a convergence
around American styles of urbanism. In
underlining the role of regional capital and
expertise, we hope to have contributed to
scholarly attempts to understand cities in
East Asia on their own terms as part of
regional trends and processes and not
simply through the lens of Western theory.</p>

        <title>1. In this paper, we use the term ‘satellite city’</title>
        <p>throughout, but the terms ‘new town’, ‘urban

and ‘privatopolis’ are also used by developers
to refer broadly to the same type of urban

bear in mind that, in the academic and
