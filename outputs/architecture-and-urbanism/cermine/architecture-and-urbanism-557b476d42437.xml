        <p>The food markets at Les Halles, in nearly continuous operation since the tenth century, were a primary connection between Paris and its surrounding territory. Due to the centrality and visibility of the market district, Les Halles came under enormous pressure to showcase the ability of the government to manage the circulation of products from agricultural land to the city. Conceived variously as the “stomach of Paris” or the heart of the city, the site at which all flows are organized, Les Halles has played a crucial role--both symbolic and material--in elaborating spatial schemes to enable mass food consumption. From the 1763 construction of the Halle au blé, to the 1851 ground-breaking on architect Victor Baltard's market pavilions, then to the removal of the markets to the suburb of Rungis in 1969, the markets at Les Halles were regularly redesigned and rebuilt to accommodate and/or produce shifting notions of architectural, social, and financial order. Such renovations became a source of inspiration and knowledge to communities of architects and helped to define the capacities of architecture to produce bodily and social transformation. Although Les Halles' markets have long since been moved from the site, spatial and discursive architectural forms elaborated through transformations to the architecture of provisioning still nourish contemporary debates about disciplinary capacities of architecture. Shifting beliefs in the ability of architecture and urbanism to manage the relationship between the city, the market, and the bodies of Parisian citizens have generated new biopolitical roles for architecture and urbanism at Les Halles and beyond.</p>

      <p>necessity to maintain a successful market, one that would resist cycles of
abundance and famine and one that would make affordably priced food
continuously available to Parisians. Although private merchants managed the
purchasing, distribution, and sale of food in the city’s markets, provisioning
was not something that could be entrusted to private commerce alone. A
balance had to be struck between food merchants and government, and it was up
to the police to regulate Les Halles’ markets to ensure that they maintained
sufficient order, food supply, and low prices to provision the city.2</p>
      <p>As historian Steven Kaplan has explained, grain provisioning was especially
important to market authorities due to its political and nutritional significance.3
Charged with overseeing Paris’s grain markets under Louis XV, the police
developed a series of new regulatory techniques to ensure that Paris would be
appropriately provisioned by grain merchants. In the 1760s, one police inspector in
particular, a certain Poussot, was instrumental in imagining a new architecture
for grain commerce at Les Halles. His ideal was “constant abundance,” which
would in theory lead to stable and affordable bread and grain prices in Paris.4 Yet
this ideal seemed to be continually resisted by material conditions at the grain
markets. It was difficult to force merchants to sell grain at Les Halles, where sales
could be monitored more easily, since it was often more convenient and less
expensive for them to do so outside of the district. Those who did sell within the
marketplace had to endure poor sanitation and overcrowding, which could lead
to disputes amongst merchants, injuries, and disease, not to mention
administrative discontent. As reports of spoiled flour, overcrowding, theft, and disorder
accumulated, Poussot recognized the need to make both spatial and
organizational changes in the space where grains were sold.5</p>
      <p>With the support of grain merchants, Poussot organized a campaign to
build a more permanent structure for grain sale, and in 1762, the National
Assembly agreed to construct a new grain market and storage center, the Halle
au blé.6 The new Halle au blé would provide more space for the grain trade
than the previous open-air grain market, and, in contrast to the former straw
structures at the site, would provide secure and sanitary conditions for storing
grain within the city. Plans for the building were drawn up by architect
Nicolas Le Camus de Mézières, and the building was constructed between 1763 and
1767.7 Made of stone, the Halle was built in the shape of a ring with an open
interior courtyard. Light and shadow played across its curved walls and
torquing interior staircases. Stalls within the building provided space for
merchants to sell grain on the first floor and storage space intended to keep the
grains from catching on fire on the second floor.8 The many entrances to the
building suggested its permeability to trade, while the presence of the gates on
its exterior wall underscored the degree to which the products inside were
subject to protection, regulation, and surveillance. With its regularly positioned
doors, the building seemed almost to be a synecdoche for Paris itself.</p>
      <p>Yet the form of the Halle au blé was not simply symbolic; it was also
imagined to formalize and facilitate many of the police principles that inspired its
construction. Its circular form, reminiscent of not only the Pantheon, but also
Jeremy Bentham’s Panopticon, would facilitate the program of centralizing and
surveying the grain trade within Paris.9 With entrances positioned in regular
intervals along an exterior wall, the Halle au blé would enable traffic to
approach the building from all sides, decreasing congestion in the immediate
neighborhood. The Halle’s open courtyard would facilitate transport of
commodities within the building, and, most crucially, permit merchants or police
inspectors entering the market to immediately apprehend the quantity of grain
stored therein.10 Yet only a year after the Halle opened, a temporary structure
had to be built in the courtyard to provide more space for grain sale, which
somewhat limited surveillance.11 Twelve years later the courtyard was
permanently covered by a large wooden cupola, a structural and formal marvel
designed by the architects Jacques-Guillaume Legrand and Jacques Molinos.
The roof protected the merchandise inside, provided more space for storage,
but enclosed the building more than its architects originally intended,
suggesting less an open market than a temple to grain. Ironically––since the grain
inside was supposed to be protected from fire––, the roof burned in 1802 and
was replaced by an iron cupola designed by François-Joseph Bélanger and the
engineer François Brunet in 1813. Among architects, the Halle au blé was
admired for its formal elegance as well as for the technological accomplishment
of the long span of Legrand and Molinos’ pot-belly shaped roof. Its
construction intensified architectural interest in market halls as an architectural type.12</p>
      <p>This interest in the potential of the market hall to protect Parisians from
famine directly preceded a more comprehensive rethinking of the
relationships between urban architecture and the health of urban populations during
the late eighteenth century. After the Hôtel-Dieu was destroyed by fire in 1772,
for instance, debates about the design of hospitals provided an opportunity to
link architectural design to health. As disease spread within densely populated
cities, Parisian doctors began to understand that the general health of an
urban population was limited by the illnesses of the city’s more impoverished
citizens. Finding ways to improve their health would not only protect the
well-being of other members of the population, and act as a form of charity for
the sick, but would also increase the productive power of the city overall.13</p>
      <p>With this understanding of the relationship between the hospital and the
city, the Académie des Sciences convened a commission to reconsider the
design of the Hôtel-Dieu in 1785. Medical reformers concentrated on
developing mechanical systems to increase the ventilation of hospitals, as this was
seen to be a primary renovation that would improve the health of the
hospital’s patients. In the words of Doctor Jacques-René Tenon, the perfectly
ventilated hospital could be a “machine à guérir,” or curing machine, an apparatus
capable of producing predictable effects in its patients’ health. Michel Foucault
has shown that this medicalization of architectural knowledge expanded the
power ascribed to architecture by imagining how it could be capable of
producing effects within bodies––not just in bodies of hospital patients, but in
bodies of the population of the city as a whole. Foucault’s description of the
hospital is one of the first examples he gives of a spatial engagement with a
noso-politique, or biopolitics, in which “equipment and techniques” for
managing the biological traits of a population become politically important since
they will increase health and thus the overall productivity of a population.14</p>
      <p>Doctors standardized their plans for ventilation in hospitals so that their
plans could be recreated elsewhere. In generating this ideal of a consistent and
repeatable set of design rules intended to translate desires for health into the
form of the hospital, medical reformers assigned previously unimagined health
effects to material components of the hospital’s architecture. In contrast to
older conceptions of architectural knowledge of order, symmetry, and
ornamentation, late eighteenth-century architectures of health or provisioning also
concerned themselves with the management of health through program, or
the arrangement of spaces for various activities within a single building.
Programming the hospital to increase the circulation of air, doctors translated their
desires for the effects that the building would produce into spatial form. This
spatial knowledge about the health effects of a properly ventilated hospital was
initially the domain of medical specialists. But it eventually helped to define
the ground upon which architects would rely for an ideal of architectural
functionality. As architects claimed the ability to manage health-inducing program
as one of their many skills, architecture extended its capacities. In the late
eighteenth-century hospital, bodily need thus fed the architectural imagination
and expanded the disciplinary and political purview of architecture.15</p>
      <p>The construction of the Halle au blé should be understood in the context
of this transformation of architectural capacities. Both the market hall and the
hospital were buildings that sought to confine activities deemed potentially
dangerous to the overall population (faulty commerce, disease) by putting in
place an architecture to incite circulation––of air, in the case of Tenon’s
hospital, and of grain and money, in the case of the Halle au blé. In so doing, they
would thus supposedly combat population-wide health problems such as
disease and famine. Managing the Halle au blé required the presence and
regulations of Poussot and other members of the police and thus was not imagined
to automatically ensure health like Tenon’s “curing machine” or automatically
ensure discipline like Bentham’s Panopticon (which was also apparently of
interest to Tenon, and whose form resembled that of the Halle au blé).16 Yet
architecture would improve the ability of the police to regulate grain trade.
Although the Halle au blé was lauded for its formal elegance and the ways in
which it elevated the grain trade by providing it with a monumental structure
in the center of a gentrifying district, its architecture is strikingly similar to
that of other buildings of discipline and reform such as the hospital and the
prison. This creates an odd sort of equivalence between commerce and the
poor, the criminal and the infirm. They are all entities that would be relegated
to a circulation-controlling building in order to improve the overall health
and productivity of the urban population at large.</p>
      <p>The construction of the Halle au blé did not alone solve the problems of
overcrowding or food security that its designers intended.17 Rather, it stood
for governmental attentiveness to these problems, and it provided a form for
imagining the effects of these attentions. And in the case of both the
hospital and the new Halle au blé, the investment of members of the police in
commissioning these structures meant that the intended effects of these buildings
were not merely localized within the buildings themselves, but were
supposed to extend to the city as a whole. Unclogging the overcrowded and
undefined open-air space of the Halle au blé with a newly organized stone
structure meant not only creating a more permanent and elegant space for
the activity of buying, selling, and trading grain, but it also irrevocably tied
the activities at the building to the bodies of citizens whose only direct link
to the Halle was through the bread they ate. The Halle au blé was thus
invested with biopolitical significance.
As trade through Les Halles intensified, its markets continued to be the target
of campaigns to improve the city’s overall health and hygiene. The putrescent
Cimetière des Innocents was cleaned and replaced with the Marché des
Innocents, where fruits and vegetables were sold. A new Halle aux draps designed by
Legrand and Molinos was completed in 1787, and improvements were made to
the Marché des Prouvaires during the early nineteenth century.18 Yet it was not
until 1851 that any significant construction activity at Les Halles began to take
place. A series of projects designed by architect Victor Baltard, who later worked
in collaboration with architect Félix Callet, engaged many of the concerns that
emerged in prior renovations at the Halle au blé.19 Yet they also considerably
shifted terms of the debate about how architecture would negotiate the
biopolitics of provisioning. Whereas the cupola of the stone Halle au blé enclosed the
market and made it into a monument to abundance, Baltard’s pavilions
provided a new form for an architecture of regulated circulation.</p>
      <p>Several proposals to improve conditions at Les Halles preceded Baltard’s
projects. In the beginning of the nineteenth century the district’s problems
were readily apparent: it was crowded with unorganized merchants and
foodstuffs. Vegetables spilled out of overcrowded market stalls. Prostitutes and
informal commerce surrounding the market generated an impression of
disease and moral contagion whose containment was essential to the health of
the district.20 As part of a more general call to improve communication and
circulation in Paris, in 1808 the Préfet de la Seine, Nicolas Frochot, made a
proposal to improve the hygiene of Les Halles. Frochot suggested that the markets
take on a more regular form, and that they be further separated from
residential districts. In 1811, Napoléon Bonaparte, who had once lived in an
apartment overlooking the Halle au blé, declared that improvements to the Halles
were one of the most important priorities of the nation.21 In decrees of 24
February and 19 May, Les Halles became the “Grandes Halles,” a national center
for the food trade. This allowed the markets (which sold meat, fowl, fish,
shellfish, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, butter, eggs, cheese, salt, flowers, and
cloth––not only retail to consumers but also wholesale and semi-wholesale as
well) to be regulated and redesigned as an ensemble and subjected them to
more comprehensive forms of renovation. Architects Joseph Bélanger,
PierreLouis Fontaine, and Louis Bruyère submitted design schemes to improve the
flow of food in and out of Les Halles and to improve the spaces in which this
food was bought, sold, and traded.</p>
      <p>In 1835, the Préfet de la Seine, the Comte de Rambuteau, ordered the
destruction of the old market buildings to make it possible to widen streets in
the area. Although several members of the Paris Municipal Council
subsequently argued for moving the markets out of the area entirely, this plan was
eventually rejected as unfeasible.22 Baltard, who was then Inspecteur des
Travaux de la Ville de Paris, was selected to be the chief architect for
renovations to the markets in 1843, and the Municipal council created a new
commission to study this project on 19 July 1844. Several questions needed to be
worked out: the placement of the markets within Paris, the arrangement of
different markets within the ensemble of the Halles, and the form that these
markets would take. Over the next ten years, first under Rambuteau and later
under Baron Haussmann, Baltard developed a series of plans intended to
translate desires for a more hygienic market into spatial form.23</p>
      <p>Plans that Baltard initially prepared in 1843 show an irregular ensemble of
market buildings, with differently shaped buildings for each food market
surrounding a nearly rectangular central building. Yet Préfet de la Police Gabriel
Delessert expressed a preference for rectangular pavilions arranged
rectilinearly, a scheme that Baltard followed in his subsequent plans.24 Though
markets would still be separated by the type of food that they sold, they would
appear to be uniform from the exterior. In 1848, Baltard prepared plans for a
series of eight stone buildings arranged on an east-west axis from the Halle au
blé to the rue de la Lingerie; these plans were revised over the next several
years. Solicited and unsolicited, many architects proposed other schemes for
an ensemble of markets at Les Halles. A famous counterproposal by Hector
Horeau, for example, suggested expanding the market district to the south so
as to connect them to the Seine. However, Baltard’s plans were approved in
1851; in May of that year Napoléon III laid the building’s first stone.</p>
      <p>In 1847, Rambuteau had requested that the markets be of a monumental
character, which would imply that they be made of stone. Baltard’s plans
respected this request, employing stone cladding on the lower floors, but also
took advantage of then-modern iron framing that would allow for large open
spaces for the market inside the building; a series of iron-gabled roofs would
open the building to light and air. Dissatisfaction with these plans was
immediate; it appeared to many to be a fortress, a building of control rather than an
open space. Merchants had requested that the ground floor of their markets
remain open, protesting that without making their wares visible to passersby,
they would lose the ability to make necessary spur-of-the-moment sales.25
Construction was halted as the first market building was near completion in
1853, and Haussmann again solicited new proposals for the renovation of the
markets. This time, Haussmann and Napoléon III insisted that the building be
nearly entirely constructed of iron, which was less expensive to build with
than stone and had been used to great effect at the Gare de l’Est.26 Baltard and
Callet submitted a stunning project, which preserved much of the program of
their previous proposal but did away with its stone cladding. Evoking both the
Gare de l’Est and Joseph Paxton’s famous 1851 Crystal Palace, a model of glass
construction and a popular sensation, these new plans for Les Halles were
approved in 1853. Haussmann promoted the project, expropriated adjoining
residential property, and secured funding to enable construction to begin on
the new structures early in 1854.</p>
      <p>In contrast to the Halle au blé, which emphasized the very idea of
concentration and regulation in its ring-like form, Baltard’s famously transparent
iron-and-glass market pavilions enclosed commerce without seemingly
concentrating it. The pavilion’s tectonic allusion to then-modern rail stations
suggested that Les Halles were a place for new circulatory freedoms. Yet this was
somewhat of a cover for contemporaneous changes that were made to
regulations concerning the circulation of products within the market. As Victoria
Thompson has shown, these regulations impacted who could buy and sell
goods within the new Halles and had the effect of limiting the economic
liberties of women who worked in the marketplace. Profitable positions in the
pavilions were given to more bourgeois and correct stall owners, and the
periphery was intended for those that had not sufficiently espoused bourgeois
systems of management (i.e., those that were intermittent, headed by women,
without creditors, etc.). Stall owners could only employ members of their own
family; hiring assistants was prohibited, as the young female assistants were
considered to be too similar to prostitutes, and administrators prohibited
female stall owners from passing on market stalls to anyone except their own
daughters.27 These renovations at Les Halles provided an excuse to “clean up”
the behaviors and morals of its largely female merchants, limiting their
economic power as a class and providing an opportunity to further manage the
behavior and morality of those attempting to participate economically in
marketplace exchanges.28</p>
      <p>Baltard and Callet’s monograph of etchings of the 1853 plans for Les
Halles, published retrospectively in 1863, show several understandings of the
relevance of such desires for regulation of commerce and commercial
behavior to the architectural, urban, and technological renovations of the markets.29
Initial plates displayed Les Halles in its urban context, emphasizing the
transition of Les Halles from a series of small heterogeneous markets to a single
market complex. Plans II and III superimposed the locations of the new and
old markets, showing a patchwork of markets spread throughout the
neighborhood of Les Halles: prior to the renovation, butter and fish markets were
adjacent to one another, with vegetables and fruits immediately to their left.
A few blocks to the south was the Marché des Innocents, where food was sold
directly to consumers, and a separate market for potatoes. In Baltard’s new
plans, each of these markets was moved into its own pavilion, and the
ensemble was organized in a rectilinear form, following Delessert’s suggestions.
Wholesale and retail commerce would coexist. In plan, the markets, arranged
by the type of food that they sold, with little architectural differentiation
between spaces intended for different foods or types of commerce, appeared to
be almost interchangeable.</p>
      <p>Though the distribution of the market buildings and the materials used to
build them bore the influence of the mandates of Haussmann, Delessert, and
Napoléon III, details that Baltard (and perhaps Callet) invented for the market
pavilions further envisioned the relationship between the goods of the market
and the ordering function of its architecture. In their plans for the “Petits
Pavillons, détails des combles,” wrought-iron curlicues abstracted from flowers
and vines and evocative of products sold within the markets fancifully filled
the spaces between structural joints. Iron latticework, another nonstructural
element, filled the spaces below the arches in the second roof gable, echoing
the rectilinear image of the newly organized ensemble of markets in plan. The
juxtaposition of these two stylistically different embellishments suggests an
easy aesthetic coexistence between domesticated vegetables and an organized
market. The architectural historian Siegfried Giedion would later claim that
the architecture of Baltard’s Halles was insignificant, little more than
“greenhouse” architecture writ large (as was gardener/architect Joseph Paxton’s
Crystal Palace).30 Yet the new Halles’ resemblance to a greenhouse elevated to the
scale of an international exhibit may not be reason for criticism; an
embellished greenhouse would in fact be the perfect symbol of the ordered
cultivation and bourgeois scopic pleasure that undergirded Haussmann and Napoléon
III’s desires for the renovation of the market.</p>
      <p>While the Halle au blé attempted to improve circulation by enabling
storage and surveillance of grain, Baltard’s designs improved circulation of
foodstuffs, water, air, and light within the marketplace itself, again almost as a
synecdoche for the renovations to the city underway under Haussmann.
Baltard and Callet’s drawings demonstrated elaborate plumbing and cleaning
systems that would perfect the flow of water and waste through the buildings.
Storage space for provisions was provided in the basement of the market
buildings, away from moving foodstuffs aboveground. The circulation of air was
also important in this design: the high ceilings of the pavilions encouraged
ventilation, which was less worrisome as a marker of disease than as an
olfactory nuisance. The focus of these designs was not to illustrate the concern of
the monarchy for the alimentary fulfillment of the population, as it had been
in the eighteenth century, or necessarily to formally illustrate an idealized
relationship between government and commerce, but rather to manage
circulation in miniature via the infrastructure of the market.</p>
      <p>Baltard and Callet’s plans emphasized the ability of the market’s new
organization to bring aesthetic order to both the interior and the exterior of the
markets. For example, their drawings of the fixtures of market stalls (détails de
l’entablements) showed Madame Ledoux’s vegetable shop and Madame Dubois’
fish shop.31 In plans for the meat market, a detail of a stallfront (façade
principal d’un étal) showed a meat shop belonging to a Monsieur Aubry.32 These
gender assignments––of men to meat and women to fish and
vegetables––corresponded to prerenovation expectations of who would sell different types of
products. In addition to this standardized signage, the sizes and placement of
fixtures in the markets suggest an ordered and consistent environment. It is
easy to see that the notion of hygienic reform at Les Halles was not merely an
attempt to use architecture to affect health, but also an aesthetic decision. If
the markets appeared orderly, they would in turn function in an orderly
manner. It is clear from accounts of regulation inside the market that architecture
alone could not in and of itself produce this effect. It did, however, stand as a
sign of changes to the economic and social ordering of the market.</p>
      <p>Nineteenth-century renovations to Les Halles altered the provisioning
program of the ancien régime, so much so that by the time that most of Baltard’s
pavilions were completed, the Halle au blé, half empty and in disrepair as
better grain storage was available in entrepôts outside of the city, was transformed
into the Bourse au Commerce.33 The 1889 renovation of the structure by
architect Henri Blondel announced this shift. Architecture was not simply intended
to assist in the maintenance of affordable and regular grain supplies to hungry
Parisians, as was the case at the Halle au blé. Rather, larger-scale operations of
both architecture and urbanism were needed to improve the process of food
sales. The nature of surveillance was also transformed in the marketplace. Les
Halles’ transparent and orderly architecture did not merely enable observation
of quantities of food, but also permitted their reach of surveillance to extend
into the bodies of the market workers themselves. New technologies for
managing the flow of foodstuff, commerce, and the movements and activities of
merchants were coupled with new architectural technologies facilitating
inexpensive construction and hygiene. In spite of these differences, state, market,
and body remained intertwined at the new Les Halles.</p>
      <p>A Market in the Suburbs
By the beginning of the twentieth century, the markets at Les Halles were again
clogged with food and traffic. Trucks stopped up streets designed for smaller
modes of transport. Speculators caused prices to shift radically. By 1950, the
market had fallen out of favor with large-scale food vendors, who were
incapable of selling large quantities of food at Les Halles and were increasingly
moving their business operations outside of the market. The number of
purchases made in the market declined, and Les Halles risked becoming a place
that would only supply an immediately local population, rather than a market
capable of provisioning a region, or even a nation.34 In postwar France, only 5
to 6 percent of food was distributed to consumers through supermarkets (the
figure was 70 percent in the United States).35 Centralized wholesale markets like
Les Halles were still essential facets of the national food distribution network.
To ensure the food supply and to fulfill aesthetic expectations for the center of
Paris, Les Halles thus needed to be modernized.</p>
      <p>Although finance and agricultural ministers in charge of overseeing the
market discussed plans to move parts of Les Halles to open space at Bercy or La
Villette, they tended to feel that Paris was no longer capable of accommodating
large-scale food trades and that the market should be moved to the suburbs.
Critics ranging from Situationists Abdelhafid Khatib and Guy Debord to historian
Louis Chevalier and medialogue Jean Baudrillard lamented that the removal of
Les Halles was irrevocably part of the long process of removing popular Paris to
the periphery of the city, a perpetuation of a Haussmanian legacy; they claimed
that the activity that had once been the foundation of urbanity was no longer
proper to it.36 Yet it was nearly impossible to contest the move. If suburban space
was the only territory open, invisible, and manipulable enough to accommodate
a market, then the political imagination of the relationship between government
and consuming bodies had somehow shifted. These relationships did not need to
be demonstrated experientially in the heart of Paris. They could just as easily be
put into place outside of the city in a new wholesale food market at Rungis.</p>
      <p>Located approximately ten kilometers from the southern border of Paris,
in a largely agricultural area adjacent to Orly airport, Rungis was a place where
relationships between urbanism and the biopolitics of provisioning were
further developed. In 1961, the ministers of the Interior, Finance, Public Works
and Transport, Agriculture, Construction, and National Commerce signed a
decree authorizing the creation of a société d’économie mixte (a public-private
partnership) charged with studying and developing a new market at Rungis.
Initially headed by Camille Nicolle, and later by former Algerian market
administrator Libert Bou, this partnership laid out a series of goals for a new
suburban market. Nicolle wanted to modernize market infrastructure, to
organize high-volume sales through the rapid diffusion of information, and to
create a means of regulating and simplifying “fair prices” for the consumer
without overburdening their food budgets.</p>
      <p>To accomplish these goals, the Rungis market would impose minimum
standards for business volume, eliminating smaller-scale business that
supposedly raised prices in order to cover their higher costs. It would place limitations
on the succession of businesses, which would eliminate some of their
speculative quality. In the wake of decolonization, market administrators wanted to
intensify exports to other countries and encourage the sale of “normalized and
regularized” French food products. To improve health, they wished to raise the
number of fresh fruits and vegetables consumed daily. All of this would result
not only in better health for the consuming population, but in more
competition, which would lower food prices for consumers and free household budgets
for other expenditures, which would drive the postwar economy. The need of
the food consumer––not, this time, for affordable sustenance, but rather, for
the ability to purchase other non-food goods––was again the excuse for
marketplace renovation. Administrators envisioned that by 1990, the market
region would reach a population of approximately 12 million.</p>
      <p>Within the market, Rungis’s planners also sought to improve the
conditions of food sale. They wanted to reduce the necessity to move products
around manually inside the market; the famous forts des halles would no longer
be necessary in a modern market. They wanted storage space that would
maintain even temperatures for a variety of foods. These would not merely be
material improvements, but would also provide a form of cultural “renovation” for
marketplace workers, who would have better conditions in which to work. All
of this could be accomplished in a cheaper, larger, more open suburban space.
Finally, rebuilding the market outside of the city would again improve traffic
and hygiene within Paris. An added benefit would be the higher real estate
prices that could be commanded in a newly gentrified Halles district.</p>
      <p>Precisely because Rungis was intended to unclog Parisian traffic, planners
insisted that the new market have links to highways, rail lines, and even the
new airport at Orly. This concern with improved traffic circulation is present
everywhere in plans for the market. In plans drawn up just prior to the 1964
groundbreaking of the new market at Rungis, the market’s architects, led by
Prix de Rome laureate Henri Colboc, sought a form for these circulatory desires.
Published in 1964, in the French magazine of architecture and engineering,
Techniques et Architecture, the market’s plans expose the visual imagination of its
planners. A thicket of rail lines leads directly into the markets (see Figure 1).
Diagrams and drawings of the market focus on the movement of food into and
out of its various pavilions. Whereas Baltard invoked the aesthetics of the Gare
de l’Est in his design for Les Halles, at Rungis the market-as-train-station is
taken literally: each pavilion was called a “marché-gare.”37</p>
      <p>Thirteen years prior, also in Techniques et Architecture, similar circulation
diagrams were used to show off the recently developed libre-service Monoprix
grocery store (see Figure 2), whose goal was to allow customers to
anonymously and efficiently purchase their own provisions. The architects of both
spaces use the same representational techniques to imagine the utility of the
new markets; the wholesale food market follows the example of private
commerce and extends its circulatory logic to its wholesale spaces. And the
significance of both is that they are ideal spaces to logically extend technocratic
circulatory and transportation patterns developed in previous centuries by
circulation-obsessed architects. As one of Rungis’s engineers, P. Barre, explained
in a special issue on the new markets at Rungis in Techniques et Architecture,
“These markets are also stations for merchandise: in effect, they constitute the
point of arrival and departure for these food products that are not really meant
to stay in one place, but to be in transit in the best possible conditions: of
speed, price, and comfort.”38 Barre does not tell us whether these traveling
vegetables will end up in a restaurant, a libre-service, or simply in a hungry
belly. What is important is that there is no material, social, or urban resistance
to their movement.</p>
      <p>Rather than policing the spatial organization of the marketplace or the
behavior of shopkeepers, as was done following the previous renovations at
Les Halles, Rungis’s engineers sought to control commodities themselves.
This control would be achieved by tracking the movement of food
throughout the market, recording and displaying the prices at which the food was
sold, producing maximum transparency and data. Such surveillance would
not be enabled by architecture, as it was in the eighteenth-century Halle au
blé, but by early computer and telecommunication technologies, images of
which are liberally featured in publicity material for the market. At Rungis,
food became an informational commodity as much as something to eat. This
is technocratic market planning taken to its limits. The social functions of the
market, so heavily invested with political and moral significance during the
Monarchy and the Empire, had been totally stripped from the program of
provisioning during the trente glorieuses. The form of twentieth-century
Rungis was reduced to an image of pure circulation, an architecture of low
prices. This architecture and infrastructure is today repeated in suburban Paris
in hypermarchés such as the Carrefours and Auchans situated next to RER
stations and highway exits.</p>
      <p>Returning to Les Halles
After the departure of the food markets from Les Halles in 1969, formal
representations of biopolitical relations elaborated through the markets’
architecture seemed to have been demolished along with Baltard’s pavilions. Rungis,
visible only to market workers, needed little formal embellishment. However,
a short distance away, many of the concerns that had once been expressed in
Les Halles’ architecture of provisioning entered into discourse about a building
with an entirely different purpose. In 1971, shortly after the last Baltard
pavilion was disassembled, President Georges Pompidou announced that architects
Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano had been awarded the commission to design
a new center for art and culture, the Centre Beaubourg (which was renamed
the Centre National d’Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou after Pompidou’s
death). The Centre Beaubourg was to be constructed on the Plateau
Beaubourg, an open plot of land that had been cleared in the 1930s to prevent
the spread of tuberculosis and that had more recently been used as a parking
lot for Les Halles’ vendors. Though Pompidou had supported the demolition
of Les Halles, the competition for his museum of contemporary arts seemed to
be an attempt to resuscitate a selected set of desired characteristics of the
former market and the social activity that had taken place in Baltard’s
pavilions after the market’s removal.39 The Centre Beaubourg (as it was initially
called) would be a popular space, open to the public, animating the
neighborhood, another “Louvre of the People.”</p>
      <p>One of its most celebrated aspects was that its interior walls could easily
be reconfigured, given that all of the structural and infrastructural elements of
the building were worked into its shell. In a sense, Piano and Rogers’s building,
a mere shelter for the unforeseen activities that would occur in its interior, was
the realization of Napoléon III’s ideal of Les Halles as a series of simple
“umbrellas” that would protect the marketplace. A space with such an open
plan could accommodate art appreciation or happenings as easily as it could
food selling. Piano and Rogers made this explicit in the commentary
accompanying their plans. The building’s physical flexibility allowed the cultural
center to be programmatically flexible as well; no longer did a building have
to be tailored to a specific use or set of sociopolitical desires. At one point,
Piano stated, “Now [Beaubourg is] a cultural center, and after that perhaps an
Open University, later on, I don’t know. A cattle market?”40 Peter Rawstone,
one of the project’s architects, added, “Things change all the time anyway.
Houses, factories, today become museums tomorrow. Maybe one day our
museum might become a foodstore, a supermarket. We want to make a loose
infrastructure in which people can move, criss-cross on the way somewhere,
live, eat, enjoy themselves, do things, and make decisions which can, if
necessary, change the building.”41 The Centre Pompidou was even called “the
building with its tripes on its outside.”42 Les Halles’ alimentary ghosts lurked
in the colored ductwork of the new Centre Pompidou.</p>
      <p>Contemporary Les Halles and Rungis
Before discussing contemporary Les Halles and Rungis, it seems worthwhile to
summarize some of the transformations that have accompanied renovations
to both spaces. In eighteenth-century renovations to the Halle au blé, market
managers charged with preventing hunger and famine felt that regulating the
flow of grains would improve the food supply to the Parisian populace.
Architecture activated and symbolized their goals of inciting competition and
selfgovernance throughout the market. In the nineteenth-century reconstruction
of the entire Halles market district, excess as well as need provided a spur for
marketplace renovation. This time, renovation would improve the conduct of
an exceptional class of female merchants, rather than the material conditions
for an exceptional trade. Architectural structure, ornament, and infrastructure
were charged with demonstrating a commitment to maintaining a liberal
circulation of goods just as regulation of market activities proved that this was a
myth. In the twentieth century, as Les Halles’ markets were moved to Rungis,
the infrastructure for food commerce was excised from Paris, and the people
required to keep the markets running were largely replaced by mechanical
and electronic systems to keep food moving. At Rungis, food, in addition to
market workers, was the target of surveillance. Market renovators shifted their
attentions from producers to consumers, who would be able to purchase
increased amounts of mass-market goods after lower food prices left room in
household budgets for such purchases. Rungis required no ornamentation.
Architectural innovation was instead reserved for the programmatically
flexible cultural center rising at Beaubourg.</p>
      <p>At both Les Halles and Rungis in the twenty-first century, similar yet
reconfigured concerns are in evidence. Both sites still manage the circulation
of goods, money, and consumers and relationships between the city and its
exterior, as well as producers and consumers. Rungis has remained the world’s
largest wholesale food market, and recently changed the meaning of its
acronym, M.I.N., from marché d’intérêt national to marché international.</p>
      <p>The market’s public relations department has embarked on a intensive
campaign to increase public awareness of Rungis’s role in assuring food
quality and safety, distributing “I provision at Rungis” stickers to grocers and
restaurants for display in their shop windows. The application of these
marketing techniques is a symptom of food’s transformation from something
necessary for health and survival to a discretionary expense, the minimization of
the discourse of biological need that originally inspired Les Halles’
architecture. And although Rungis initially consolidated the food industry, it now also
supports small-scale and local food businesses by providing them with a
central place to sell their goods and facilitating the distribution of their food
products by giving them access to a wide variety of consumers (restaurants,
catering services, épiceries, institutions, etc.) For this, Rungis is studied by
market administrators worldwide.</p>
      <p>In contrast, at the Carrefour hypermarché, a retail food shopping center
that echoes the scale and distribution logics innovated for wholesale
commerce at Rungis (and perhaps the only publicly accessible contemporary space
where food is sold at a scale comparable to the former Les Halles), controversy
erupted after a December 2006 decision by the management of the
Rosnysous-Bois (Seine-Saint-Denis) store to prohibit minors unaccompanied by
adults from entering the store. Located in a shopping complex adjacent to the
Rosny-sous-Bois RER station, the Carrefour is directly connected to the Forum
des Halles through the rail network. It is also a hangout for teenagers who, as
one shop owner suggested, congregate there because they may not be able to
afford the five euro round-trip train ticket to Paris.43 For these teenagers, the
Carrefour had become a place for leisure and high jinks (perhaps even a new
“Louvre of the People”?) rather than a space for purchase alone. As in the
Halles of the Second Empire, exceptionalism based on biological traits is still
at work in such contemporary retail spaces of provisioning. What is at stake is
no longer the right of women to earn their livelihoods within the markets, but
the right of the young to occupy the market; in fact, opposition to the
Carrefour’s policy focused on the ways in which teenagers’ subjectivity as
browsers or consumers had been denied. Now, however, inventing and
enforcing these regulations is not a public activity of the police, but rather a private
process carried out by local management of large multinational corporations
who assume the authority to police their own markets.</p>
      <p>Similar questions about the productive and regulatory potential of
architecture and urban design are still very much at play in contemporary
Île-deFrance. After the 2004 competitions for the redesign of Les Halles, we can
further understand the relevance of such biopolitical questions to the future of
renovations at Les Halles. Reviewing debates about which of the two leading
finalists in the competition would be chosen, Rem Koolhaas/OMA or David
Mangin/SEURA, it is clear that questions about program, the relationship
between city and suburb, and the transformative potential of architecture are
still at play.</p>
      <p>In the project briefs submitted for a new Les Halles, Rem Koolhaas/OMA
emphasized that their plans would improve connections between the city
and the suburbs.44 Koolhaas’s plan features a series of “perfume
bottle”shaped buildings intended to host a variety of activities to be determined by
yet-undisclosed political or commercial forces. These buildings transect the
space between the subterranean Forum des Halles and RER train station and
the park space above ground, providing an immediately recognizable visual
link between the site’s above- and below-ground spaces. By tying together
underground Les Halles, which many understand to be the only space that
has any relationship to the “popular” for which Les Halles was once lauded
(i.e., the Les Halles not comprised of tourists, or wealthy locals, but rather
commuters and suburban teens), and the rest of the city, critics understand
that Koolhaas’s project was the most committed to providing a
rapprochement between the urban and suburban spaces that convene at Les Halles.45
Koolhaas’s buildings, whose program or function is not immediately
specified, are intended to be placeholders for the processes of programming a
site. Koolhaas’s vision is thus firmly situated within a trajectory of
architectural design that has its origins in eighteenth-century debates about the
productive potential of architecture. His project attempts to keep buildings as a
sign of architecture’s disciplinary potential to redirect movement, to
organize the flow of bodies through the district; they also seem to be attempts to
replicate the successes of the supposedly program-free Centre Pompidou. In
a sense, the Koolhaas project is the most historically contiguous with prior
renovations, as it still claims that architectural program––a capacity of
architecture and urban planning that stems from biopolitical expectations and
desires once generated at Les Halles––remains the primary motor for design
of the site.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the most clear formal gesture of David Mangin/SEURA’s
project (the project finally selected by Parisian mayor Bertrand Delanoë) is the
way that it reimagines the public space above the Forum des Halles as a garden
and a boulevard for slow flânerie à la Barcelona’s Ramblas. Mangin’s
aboveground project calms the frenetic circulatory energy of the underground RER
station, reducing the neighborhood scale of Les Halles and
demonumentalizing the formal gardens installed in the 1980s. In this sense, Mangin’s project
seems to do exactly the opposite of Koolhaas’s; that is, it creates spaces with
distinct formal vocabularies, speeds, and modes of use above and below
ground, and these spaces are intended for entirely different populations (local
residents and tourists above ground, suburban commuters below ground). By
concentrating the gesture of renovation in an above-ground garden, Mangin’s
project makes no clear architectural link between it and the subterranean
suburban-urban circulation through the RER train station. In formal terms,
Mangin’s plan seems to perpetually reproduce the difference between city and
suburb. What is historically proper to the urban architecture at Les Halles––its
very ability to concentrate, monitor, and perhaps socially transform people
passing time there––is relegated to mere digestion in the intestinal and
overlooked tunnels of the RER.</p>
      <p>Instead, Mangin’s project brings the suburbs to the city not by bringing
suburban populations into the center of Paris, but by importing
nineteenthcentury landscapes of suburban leisure. This use of landscape design rather
than the construction of new buildings is somewhat of a departure from past
projects at Les Halles, which imagined that the neighborhood would be a
conduit for circulating products of the land, rather than a place capable of
generating these products itself. (No one has yet decided to install community
agricultural plots at the site!) This work with landscape makes the plan more
open to easy modification as it is simpler to redesign a garden than it is to
construct a new building. Critics have seized on this argument against the project.
The fear among architects is not only that the city has missed an opportunity
to think out the spatial politics of mixité at one of the city’s most charged sites,
but also that it has favored unambitious landscape design over more
“architectural” renovations, that Les Halles will be devoted to images of biological
productivity aligned with the garden, rather than social productivity aligned
with architecture. Professionals in architecture and urbanism thus wish to
maintain the primacy of the designed space (even as the practices and
materials that design itself encompasses have changed), while politicians are still
using the site as a means of representing the relationships between
government and a population defined in relationship to consumption.</p>
      <p>As the history of modifications to Les Halles shows, renovation is
simultaneously an occasion to reframe priorities for social space and an occasion to
imagine new spatial forms. And in both Mangin/SEURA and Koolhaas/OMA’s
projects, architecture’s loosening of its hold on program is of concern.
Without representations of the eventual use of the site, we must ask who will work
out new programs at Les Halles: market forces, municipal regulation,
community groups, or merchant associations? It is crucial to debate what an aesthetic
of a functioning Les Halles might be and to discuss the new exclusionary
regulations that may be put into place in order to make the site function.</p>
      <p>This is where architecture must enter the picture. Its role at Les Halles has
always been its ability to envision desired effects of renovation, and these
effects could be understood more comprehensively than is evident in current
plans. What kind of people and activities will Les Halles welcome, and which
will be excluded? How will these spaces be policed and monitored? Is it
possible, given any of the current plans, to imagine more creative and innovative
formal or programmatic connections between suburban and urban Paris?
Instead of attempting to cover over the flow from outside the city that has
always nourished Paris, could a new Les Halles acknowledge the city’s debt to
its periphery? Instead of suggesting that urban and suburban residents have
fundamentally different needs and spaces to occupy, could the architecture at
Les Halles acknowledge or generate new regional Parisian identities or
reorganize the separation between city and suburb? What rapprochement between
city and suburb, between cities, markets, and bodies––and what new
biopolitics––could a new Les Halles inspire?
