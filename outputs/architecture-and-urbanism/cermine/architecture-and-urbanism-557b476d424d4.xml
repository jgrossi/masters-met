      <abstract>
        <p>This article analyzes articulations among urban enclaves, finance capital, and glass architecture by exploring MGM's corporate investments in the Las Vegas CityCenter development and the Chinese enclave of Macau. CityCenter is an unsuccessful $9 billion master-planned urban community financed by MGM and Dubai World. Macau is a former Portuguese colony and Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China which has, since its return to the PRC in 1999, replaced Las Vegas as the world's most lucrative site of casino gaming revenue. Taken together, CityCenter and Macau are illustrative of the political economy and cultural logics of financialization. Foreign investment from Las Vegas entrepreneurs has vitrified Macau, transforming it into a phantasmagoria of glass resorts. Macau in turn plays a crucial functional role in capitalism's recomposition in East Asia, similar to the autochthonous role of the Italian city-states of Venice and Genoa in the historical origins of capitalism. In order to 'read' the cities of Las Vegas and Macau, I explore intertextual legibilities among fictitious capital that relies on glass fiber-optic technology to enable grand architectural projects; expressionist fictional representations of glass architecture and its utopian transformative potential; and glass buildings that themselves dissimulate in a manner not unlike fiction.</p>

      <p>The September 2010 headline sounded more like science fiction than a
news report: ‘Pool-side death ray singes Las Vegas hotel guest’ (CNN,
2011). ‘It felt like I had a chemical burn’, reported the victim, a
vacationing Chicago attorney who was subjected to intense heat as he reclined
poolside at his luxury hotel. ‘I couldn’t imagine why my head was
burning. Within 30 seconds, the back of my legs were burning. My first
thought was, Jesus, they destroyed the ozone layer!’ (Daily Mail, 2010).</p>
      <p>Despite apocalyptic overtones, the ray was not a product of the
ravages of climate change but a direct outcome of a different nexus of
nature, culture, and economics: Mojave Desert sunlight refracted off
the sleek, curved, glass surface of the new Vdara Hotel-Condominium
on the Strip. Due to a design flaw the glass wall of the hotel inadvertently
directs the sun above the urban oasis onto the pool area in a condensed,
magnified, and potent beam of light, increasing the poolside temperature
by 20 degrees at the height of the midday sun. The beam melts plastic
drinking cups and scorches guests, moving slowly across the deck
expanse as the earth rotates to complete the effect that the hotel
management dismisses as a ‘solar convergence phenomenon’.</p>
      <p>The Vdara Hotel, designed by Uruguayan ‘starchitect’ Rafael Vinoly,
is part of Las Vegas’ dazzling new CityCenter complex. CityCenter is a
remarkably ambitious $8.7 billion development, jointly financed by Las
Vegas-based MGM Resorts International and Dubai World, the
investment company of the emirate (Berzon, 2010; see Figure 1). Construction
of the five-year project was completed in 2011. Conceived as a
selfcontained residential, gambling, and shopping enclave on the Strip,
complete with iconic buildings designed by celebrity architects, ‘pocket parks’
and notable public artworks, CityCenter is reportedly the most expensive
privately-funded construction project ever built in the USA, and perhaps
one of the most audacious attempts in world history to conceive and
construct an encapsulated urban neighborhood. It is also arguably a
resounding failure. The property’s soft opening in 2009 coincided with
the global economic crisis, and no doubt the immense amount of debt
incurred in construction of the glass towers of CityCenter contributed in
some small way to the crunch. The development’s subsequent
underperformance is illustrative of both the political economy and cultural logics
of financialization.</p>
      <p>‘Financialization must be understood as a profoundly spatial
phenomenon, holding out as it does the promise of a financial, spatial-temporal
fix for the crisis tendencies of capitalism’ (French et al., 2011: 814). Both
the urban enclave of CityCenter and glass architecture of the Vdara
Hotel may be understood as spatial expressions of financialization.
While Manuel Castells (2000: 434) claims that the 21st-century mega-city
is the ‘new spatial form’ of the global financial economy and information
society, I suggest that the enclosed enclave in its many guises, from
special economic zones to gated communities, is the locus of capital
containment for our age (Easterling, 2005, 2007; Jameson, 1990). Indeed,
these claims are not incompatible. For Castells, the defining feature of
the mega-city is its discontinuous and disjunctive social geography, the
‘distinctive feature of being globally connected and locally disconnected’
(2000: p. 436); I argue that the enclave is such a ‘locally disconnected’
site. The enclave is a scalar surrogate for both the nation-state that
organized and regulated the Fordist economy and the modernist city
that was the locus of industrial production and collective consumption.
Both the perils and the promise of the contemporary city emanate from
such locales. CityCenter’s lackluster performance is indicative of Las
Vegas’ downturn in the wake of the global financial crisis, but also of
the current vivication of the gaming industry in the Chinese enclave of
Macau and the recomposition of capitalism itself in East Asia. As a
Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the PRC located within the
Pearl River Delta mega-city, Macau is a ‘globally connected and locally
disconnected’ locale whose phantasmagoric glass cityscape is now the
world’s most lucrative site of casino gaming revenue.</p>
      <p>In this article I analyze MGM’s glass projects in Las Vegas and Macau
in order to explore the formal relations among financialization, enclave
urbanism, and glass architecture, and the importance of each to the
contemporary economy of derivative speculation that itself increasingly
resembles a global casino. Taken together, CityCenter and Macau are
revealing of the state of the city, as well as the importance of the city to
the state – indeed, of the city-state – in the current composition of global
capitalism. The enclave may be understood as a commodified and
derivative urban form. Much like a derivative financial instrument, the
enclave’s value is derived from a potent speculative package of assets,
indices, and underliers, to form what Keller Easterling (2005: 1) calls a
‘spatial product’ or ‘real estate cocktail’. Like a mortgage-backed
security, the disposition of this mixture can be volatile. When the speculation
is wrong, as was the case with CityCenter, the scale of lost revenues may
be so significant that it has reverberations for the global economy: the
entire edifice may eventually implode under the weight of failed financial
expectations. However, when the wager pays off like it has in the
quasistate of Macau – with its unique regime of legal exceptionalism and
strategic management of cross-border flows of people and capital – the
result is an occult explosion of liquid profits.</p>
      <p>Glass Architecture as Material Component and Aesthetic
Feature of Financialization
Finance capital seeks reproduction in enclaves – Special Administrative
Regions, corporate cities, quasi-states, and various other zones of
encapsulated urbanity or juridical exception – yet financialization takes its
tangible form in glass architecture like the Vdara Hotel. The Vdara
Hotel’s fac¸ ade is not merely application of an architectural aesthetic
technique but can be understood as a ‘formal overtone’ (Jameson,
1998: 44) of the finance capitalism used to construct the hotel and the
larger project. While the relationship among glass and financialization
may not be immediately apparent, I will argue that glass is as important
to contemporary post-Fordist capitalism as was the railroad or copper
wire to earlier stages. Fiber-optic cables facilitate financialization as
instantaneous capital movements rely on transcontinental
telecommunications networks, what Stephen Graham (1999) has called ‘global grids
of glass’. These cables conjoin glass and light to circulate the digitized
information of the network society that appears on our computer screens
and mobile devices, forming the ‘space of flows’ (Castells, 2000), the
architecture of contemporary social life that is as ubiquitous as it is
invisible. Fiber optics are not only a key component of flexible forms
of accumulation but enable flexible specialization, flexible time,
‘Toyotist’ supply chain management, locational strategies of production,
and essentially all other factors of the post-Fordist economy. As I will
discuss later, the glass curtain wall shares homologies with the terminal
screen, and the reflective surfaces of post-industrial cities appear
increasingly like mediated space (McQuire, 2008). The networked economy is an
economy of glass.</p>
      <p>However, glass is not only an integral material component of
fiberoptic communications, it also embodies the sleek, seductive aesthetic of
financialization. In their analysis of contemporary corporate advertising,
Goldman and Papson (2011) analyze the discursive Landscapes of Capital
that are conjured in these mediated representations of the financial
economy. They find ‘the representational equivalent of hyperreal capital’
(p. 51) in images and evocations of speed, flexibility, and technological
integration in the advertisements produced by companies like Wachovia,
Enron, Cisco, and Merrill Lynch, which are (or were) key players in the
financial economy. In these discursive evocations and mediations of
capital, economic life enabled by digital telecommunications and
deregulation appears smooth, frictionless, and transparent, much like the surface
of the glass curtain wall of the Vdara Hotel. ‘The dream of Capital is a
friction-free network in which information and commodities flow at
unlimited rates’ (Goldman and Papson, 2011: 20). Understood in this
way, glass architecture – particularly in relation to the ‘beams of light’
that in corporate advertisements become ‘the most common signifier of
the flow of ideas’ (p. 33) – embodies both functional and representational
features of financialization.</p>
      <p>In short, the immaterial economy of post-Fordism seeks a spatial fix in
the enclave, while the dematerialized capital of fiber optics enabled
financialization finds its form in glass architecture. French et al. (2011) ‘argue
that work on financialization has been insufficiently attentive to: the role
of space and place; the geography of money and finance; and earlier work
in the Marxist and international political-economy tradition that
effectively focused on the problem of financialization before the neologism was
coined and mobilized.’ I will bring these very factors – social space,
financial geography, political economy – together to explore the form
and function of glass architecture in Las Vegas and Macau. I will first
trace the importance of glass to historical formations of capitalism and
the critical and utopian responses it has provoked from Walter Benjamin,
Paul Scheerbart, and Fredric Jameson. Then I will analyze the ‘fictitious
capital’ of financialization and its materialization in the glass resorts of
Las Vegas and Macau. I hope to address both the functional and
representational dimensions of glass architecture. In order to ‘read’ the
contemporary cities of Las Vegas and Macau, I seek intertextual legibilities
among fictitious capital that enables grand architectural projects in city
centers around the world; expressionist fictional representations of glass
architecture and its utopian transformative potential; and actual glass
buildings that themselves dissimulate in a manner not unlike fiction.
I proceed through a series of inter-referential vignettes and parables,
ranging from cultural history to political economy to literary criticism
to architectural theory to journalistic reportage that, taken together,
I hope will illuminate the complex articulations among urban enclaves,
glass buildings, and fictitious capital. ‘It is difficult’, I agree, ‘to
exaggerate the relationship between fiction and architecture.’
The new glass resorts of Las Vegas and Macau have a vitreous lineage.
The modern glass industry was established principally in the city-state of
Venice in the 13th to 16th centuries; the industry developed alongside the
historical development of capitalism, and glass itself became a key
component of accumulation. The specific role or function of glass has varied
in different stages of capitalist development, serving as a commodity itself
in Italy to producer of the commodity fetish in France; and from
utopian crystalline technology in the expressionist pre-war dreams of
Weimar Germany, to the depoliticized architectural form of the
International Style.
Glass was an early commodity that Venice produced for trade. Fine
glassware was an element of European civility and refinement during
the Renaissance, one material manner in which people could display
new types of distinction enabled by the new wealth generated by
capitalism (McCray, 1998). Glassmaking was one of the oldest industries in
France as well, though until the 17th century French glass production
was generally of a common variety that could not compare with the work
of the Venetian artisans. In 1687, however, French glassmaker Bernard
Perrot developed an innovative technique of plate glass production that
involved casting the glass rather than blowing it, and Paris ultimately
became the site of the most pervasive developments in glass architecture
(Scoville, 1941, 1942; Fierro, 2003: 9; Richards, 2008).</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the lethal luminosity of Las Vegas, Paris was the
original ‘city of light’, center of not only philosophical enlightenment
but of fashion, art, and culture; urban planning, banking, and finance;
cafes, department stores, and arcades. Glass was crucial to this
constellation. Constructed in the early 19th century, the arcades were a triumph
of iron and glass architecture, arching over passages between buildings to
create interior consumer spaces that were precursors to the department
store, shopping mall, and hotel atrium (see Missac, 1995).1 When Walter
Benjamin visited the arcades in the 1920s, they appeared to him like the
ur-form or natural history of capitalist modernity, a repository of the
utopian dreams of a previous epoch.</p>
      <p>Expressionism and Weimar Germany
In the imagination of fin de sie`cle German expressionist writer Paul
Scheerbart as well as his intellectual contemporaries who formed the
Crystal Chain, glass had a didactic transformative potential.
Scheerbart was fascinated by glass architecture, writing a book on the
subject as well as a number of playful utopian stories in which it featured
(Scheerbart, 1972, 2001, 2010). Scheerbart saw in glass construction and
ornamentation a key to architectural change that he thought would
enable wholesale cultural evolution. From Scheerbart’s perspective the
largely brick building materials of industrial capitalism led to necessarily
‘closed rooms’ that reflected closed minds and closed relationships
(Bletter, 1975, 1981); growth would only be possible to the extent that
glass construction opened environments to the elements. ‘Glass opens up
a new age’, he suggested prophetically, while ‘Brick building does only
harm.’ Thus, the advantage of glass architecture over brick was not
simply technical or economic, but moral.</p>
      <p>Scheerbart’s best known work is probably Glass Architecture. It is easy
to misread this peculiar book, comprised of 111 aphorisms, transparently
as a kind of ‘how to’ guide of practical and technical recommendations to
integrate glass features into homes, botanical gardens, and public spaces.
‘As air is one of the worst conductors of heat’, he writes, ‘the double glass
wall is an essential condition for all glass architecture’ (Scheerbart, 1972:
42). Or: ‘it is clearly advisable to build glass houses only in the temperate
zones’ (p. 42). When designing the Vdara Hotel, Rafael Vinoly probably
should have paid heed to Scheerbart’s admonition: ‘An occasional
mirrorwall close to a pool is worth considering. But not too many’ (p. 42).</p>
      <p>Viewed from a more opaque angle, however, and in the context of
Scheerbart’s interest in the alchemical properties of crystal (Bletter, 1981)
and his experiments with perpetual motion (Scheerbart, 2011), Glass
Architecture is no design primer. It is nothing less than a fantastical
account of an errant glass addition to a veranda that spontaneously
crystallizes and expands across the garden and beyond, eventually
growing into a glass cityscape that ultimately covers the entire earth’s surface.</p>
      <p>Whoever has provided his veranda with colour-ornamented glass on
three sides will soon want to have more glass architecture. One thing
leads to another, and to stop the process is unthinkable. So the
veranda continues to grow; in the end it emancipates itself from
the main building, and may become the main building itself. To
promote this evolution of the veranda will be the chief task of
every glass architect. (Scheerbart, 1972: 44)
Once unleashed, Scheerbart implies, crystallization inhabits its own form
of perpetual motion and takes a material and sensible shape in
architecture and cityscapes. We will see later how this belief in divine vitrification
resonates with the devout discourses deploying deregulatory practices
and fiber-optic technology to enable financialization.</p>
      <p>Scheerbart and fellow visionaries like his architect friend Bruno Taut
imagined this alchemical potential of glass architecture and its crystalline
properties; they conceived of glass structures that would transform
people who passed through them in the same manner that crystal
transforms light. ‘Coloured glass/destroys hatred’, penned Scheerbart, words
that were etched on Taut’s Glass Pavilion, a structure built for display at
the Cologne Werkbund Exhibition of 1914. The multi-colored glass
structure and kaleidoscopic interior lights of the pineapple-shaped pavilion
were designed to create an immersive crystalline effect that would serve to
uplift the spirit and moral countenance of visitors.</p>
      <p>The Transparent Rationalism of the International Style
While Taut’s glass house did not survive the exhibition, his forays into
glass design influenced his contemporaries. In the early 20th century,
refined glass and steel materials became key components of the
architectural movement known as the International Style whose proponents
eschewed ornamental facades to emphasize the ‘honest expression of
structure’ and the truthful display of the function of materials in the
construction of buildings. Glass served to highlight ideals of
transparency and verity of architectural design, and such buildings came to define
the cities of industrial capitalism.</p>
      <p>Glass architecture of the International Style was not simply a
container for 20th-century capitalist enterprise, it played a functional role
in technological and financial innovation. Reinhold Martin (2003)
demonstrates that with the technological and economic changes of the
post-war military-industrial complex, a modular and flexible corporate
architecture emerged in the United States that enabled the subjection of a
new type of technocratic organization man steeped in the dual guises of
profit-driven innovation and corporate ‘human relations’. Martin’s
account of this ‘organizational complex’ reads like a dystopian
application of the transformative possibilities that fascinated Scheerbart and</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>Taut.2 Architects like Eero Saarinen and the firm of Skidmore,</title>
      <p>Owens &amp; Merrill covered the corporate offices of such companies as
IBM, General Motors, and Bell Telephone – the latter whose labs were
the site of important developments in glass fiber-optic technology – with
increasingly thin glass curtain walls creating an ‘affect [that] approached
the glare of the photographic plate or of the television screen’ (Martin,
2003: 10). The aim was not simply pre-fabricated modular flexibility but
crafting an organizational identity befitting a mass consumer culture.3
The glass surfaces of the buildings reproduced and replicated the more
generalized social experience of media distraction. According to Martin,
‘like network television – its historical contemporary – the architecture of
the curtain wall is a medium to be watched in passing rather than looked
at like an artwork’ (p. 6).</p>
      <p>Glass as a ‘Formal Overtone’ of Finance Capital
To understand their relation to capital, the glass resorts of CityCenter
and Macau must be situated within the preceding historical context, but
their function becomes evident only when examined from a
contemporary vantage point. The Vdara Hotel death ray enabled by the glass fac¸ ade
calls to mind Jameson’s (1998) evocative comments about the
architecture of late capitalism, structures which are characterized by the
immateriality of the glass curtain wall. If Scheerbart saw the transition from
brick to glass materials as indicative of moral progress, Jameson
investigates the underlying economic logic. Searching for the series of
mediations ‘which leads from finance capital through land speculation to
aesthetics and cultural production itself’, Jameson finds in the ‘enclosed
skin volumes’ of post-modern glass architecture a ‘formal overtone’ of
finance capitalism. From this perspective, the glass skin of a building like
the Vdara Hotel ‘dematerializes without signifying in any way
spirituality’ (Jameson, 1998: 44) in the same manner in which the finance
economy creates an abstracted and dematerialized form of capital. This
contemporary glass architecture is homologous with both the
fiberoptic materials that enable financialization as well as the frictionless
form of its discursive representation. In the case of the Vdara Hotel,
the errant ray of light refracted off the building’s surface into a ‘death
ray’ mimics the play of glass and light in a fiber-optic cable. It is
architecture appropriate for a post-Fordist economic regime.</p>
      <p>For Marx, fictitious capital was simply credit, capital that was
assumed to come from the earnings of future production. Today,
fictitious capital presumes profits will accrue without production (see
Comaroff and Comaroff, 2000), and may be derived simply by
commodifying the credit risk itself in endless aleatory cycles. This is the utopian
fantasy of fiber-optic enabled financial capital – ‘that it can surmount its
own crisis tendencies and overcome its own limits by generating value
through its own pure circulation’ (Goldman and Papson, 2011: 21). This
contemporary incarnation of alchemy displaces Scheerbart’s and Taut’s
belief in crystal power to the 21st century: both faiths rely on the enabling
function of glass. Political commitment to deregulation of financial
markets in the 1980s similarly converged with new technical innovations in
glass – in this case fiber-optic information technologies – and emerging
utopian assumptions about the planetary connectivity of
telecommunications (Castells, 2000; Taylor, 2004). With the rapid expansion of the
financial economy, exponential salary increases for finance executives
lured young mathematicians and physicists away from once-coveted
cold-war corporate research jobs in the military-industrial complex and
to the finance industry where they now engineer increasingly complex
trading algorithms and derivative instruments that colonize fiber-optic
networks to monetize the future; the end result is the ‘financialization of
everything’ (Harvey, 2007: 33). This hermetic feature of financialization
enhanced by incessant neoliberal evangelization has made the global
financial system today appear like ‘nothing as much as a vast casino’
(Strange, 1986: 1).</p>
      <p>Therefore, if the political economy of 19th-century industrial
production required the solid foundations of brick construction that Scheerbart
thought created closed cultures, and the modular glass-curtain corporate
architecture of IBM and Bell Laboratories communicated flexibility and
integration for the cybernetic capitalism of the cold war (Martin, 2003),
then the ‘materialist sublimation’ (Jameson, 1998: 44) of the financial
economy is best rendered in curving glass walls like those of the Vdara
Hotel. It is architecture appropriate for an era in which accumulation
seems to have been decoupled from production and financial profits are
derived from the opaque perambulations of finance itself. But more than
that, it is architecture that is directly produced by financialization and
which makes the built environment in its own image: fragile, brittle
‘global grids of glass’.</p>
      <p>The mediation of contemporary glass architecture I am proposing is
distinct from Jameson’s famous description of the Bonaventure Hotel,
where ‘the glass skin achieves a peculiar and placeless disassociation of
the Bonventura from its neighborhood’ (1998: 82) and the interior
constitutes a delirious and depthless hyperspace which locates the subject
experientially in an otherwise ungraspable global economic system.
Rather, in a manner homologous with the commodified urban enclave,
I am proposing new glass architecture as an intimation of derivative and
securitized property. One thing that distinguishes the contemporary
phase of finance capital from earlier phases is its reliance on the
securitization of mortgages and other forms of real estate, ‘a profound
institutional transformation in which the real estate sector has come to
resemble an economic sector composed of finance markets and
instruments rather than a sector defined by producer markets’ (Gotham, 2009:
357). According to Kevin Fox Gotham (2009), the desire to overcome the
time lag between constructing the built environment and realizing
accumulation from subsequent production or rent, and to quickly convert
capital fixed in the built environment into profit, has led to this wave of
real estate securitization that aims to transform ‘opaque and illiquid
assets into liquid and transparent securities’: adjustable rate mortgages,
mortgage-backed securities, real estate investment trusts, and so on
(Gotham, 2009: 357). This breathless impatience for immediate returns
from what was formerly treated as a long-term investment in real estate is
enabled by the time-space compression that results from fiber-optic
technologies and the space of flows. ‘Time is critical to the profit-making of
the whole system. It is the speed of the transaction, sometimes
automatically preprogrammed in the computer to make quasi-instantaneous
decisions, that generates the gain – or the loss’, contends Castells (2000: 466).</p>
      <p>Furthermore, a significant and growing number of financial
transactions are based on making value out of the capture of future time
in present transactions, as in the futures, options, and other
derivative capital markets. Together these new financial products
dramatically increase the mass of nominal capital vis-a` -vis bank deposits
and assets, so that everybody bets on and with future money
anticipated in computer projections. (2000: 466)
Perhaps this cybernetic compression of time and space similarly decreases
the historical distance of the critical gaze in a manner that might orient
our perspective toward glass architecture today. This immediacy and
contemporaneity distinguishes our age from earlier phases of capitalism.
Benjamin’s revolutionary critique was driven by his retrospective
attention to the detritus of the previous era. Benjamin’s insights about the
mythology of capitalism emanated from his discovery of its pre-history
in the iron and glass Parisian arcades a generation after their demise. But
today, fiber-optic technology has produced a new temporality that has
eradicated that historical distance. The ‘truth’ of fiber-optic-enabled
financialization resides directly in the surfaces of the new glass
architecture of the Global Style (Foster, 2011), despite the fact that it seems so
naked, bare, and transparent.4 As capital switches from the primary
circuit of industrial manufacturing to the secondary circuit of real estate
investment, glass architecture mediates the dialectical relation between
illiquid spatial fixity on one hand, and financial liquidity on the other.
This form of transparent crystalline real estate investment in
commodified urban enclaves emerges from the very process of ‘converting
opaque and illiquid assets into liquid and transparent securities’
(Gotham, 2009: 357).</p>
      <p>The Violence of Finance Capital
If the design of the Vdara Hotel may be understood as a formal
representation of an economy dominated by the logic of financialization which
dematerializes capital itself and transforms the built environment into a
precarious security, then the manner in which the Vdara Hotel’s glass
fa c¸ade fashions sunlight into a lethal ray is an apt metaphor for the very
real ‘violence of financial capitalism’. For Christian Marazzi (2010), this
violence results from the post-Fordist ‘attempt, in certain ways
“parasitic” and “desperate,” to recuperate on the financial markets that
which capital could no longer get in the real economy’ (p. 27); this
recuperation has ‘devastating effects on employment, wages, and retirement’,
writes Marazzi. That is, not only on the bare, unprotected skin of
prostrate vacationing attorneys lounging beneath the desert sun, but ‘on the
bare life of entire populations’ (p. 10). Glass architecture plays a formal
role in this process. Crystallization of both communication networks and
glass architecture across global cityscapes mirrors the spread of the
derivative fictitious capital of neoliberal financialization. Once unleashed
by deregulation in the 1980s global economy steered by Paul Volker,
Ronald Reagan, and Margaret Thatcher, financialization has crept
beyond insurance actuarial tables into retirement pension funds, junk
bonds, currency trading algorithms, securitized mortgages, credit default
swaps, collateralized debt obligations, and all manner of derivative
instruments and opportunistic rent-seeking regulatory efforts to gamble
against the future ‘on the bare life of entire populations’. ‘One thing leads
to another’, as Scheerbart says, ‘and to stop the process is unthinkable.’
Las Vegas, Dubai, and the CityCenter
The profits accumulated from the bare life of consumer-citizens, the glass
curtain walls that feature in iconic architecture of the Global Style, the
violence of dematerialized forms of capital produced by a post-Fordist
economic regime – these subjects and spaces converge in the CityCenter
of Las Vegas today. CityCenter occupies 67 acres of land on the Las
Vegas Strip and comprises 18 million square feet of indoor space. Aside
from the Vdara Hotel, the complex has another hotel-condominium,
Mandarin Oriental, as well as two 400-room boutique hotels, Aria and
Harmon, and a dual-towered condominium construction called the Veer
Towers. At the base of the buildings sits Crystals (a name that would
have delighted Sheerbart), a 500,000 square-foot luxury shopping mall
designed by Daniel Libeskind, the renowned architect behind the Jewish
Museum in Berlin and the post-9/11 World Trade Center reconstruction.</p>
      <p>The gleaming towers of CityCenter were designed by a who’s who of
celebrity architects and architectural firms, including not only Vinoly but
Norman Foster, Cesar Pelli, Helmut Jahn, Kohn Pederson Fox, and
Gensler, which oversaw the master plan. CityCenter features $40 million
of public artworks by Robert Rauschenberg, Claus Oldenberg, Frank
Stella and Henry Moore, and pieces commissioned especially for the
site by Jenny Holzer, Nancy Rubins, and Maya Lin (Friess, 2009).
When Dubai World announced its $2.96 billion purchase of 50 percent
of the CityCenter project equity in 2007, the Chairman of the company,
His Excellency Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, called it ‘one of the most
exciting private sector developments in modern history. CityCenter is the
most ambitious real estate project ever undertaken in Las Vegas’,
he claimed, ‘and rivals any similar project around the world. Its global
significance cannot be underestimated’ (MGM Mirage, 2009).</p>
      <p>The decision to build iconic glass towers rather than themed
simulations more typical of the resorts on the Strip was not motivated merely by
evolving architectural tastes. It was, rather, an attempt to fashion what
Castells calls a ‘node’ for accumulation. According to Castells (2000), ‘the
nodes of the space of flows include residential and leisure-oriented spaces
which, along with the location of headquarters and their ancillary
services, tend to cluster dominant functions in carefully segregated spaces,
with easy access to cosmopolitan complexes of arts, culture, and
entertainment’ (2000: 446–7). MGM Mirage CEO Jim Murren, who conceived
of the original plan, described the project as ‘a very ambitious
masterplanned community’ (quoted in Freiss, 2009) ostensibly constructed for
the elites of the information society. ‘They’ve heard of Rafael Vinoly and
Cesar Pelli and Norman Foster and Daniel Libeskind, and they’ve stayed
at the Mandarin’, he said. ‘They are the multibillionaires, the
centimillionaires, some of the wealthiest people in the world, people who are doing
business in Abu Dhabi, Cairo, Mumbai’ (Freiss, 2009).</p>
      <p>The CityCenter project was plagued by problems long before the death
ray. The complex was conceived at the height of Las Vegas visitor
arrivals and a booming economy and real estate sector in the city, but over
the five year construction process the original $5 billion project ballooned
to nearly $9 billion while the severe world economic downturn led to
falling rates of tourism and consumption that was particularly
detrimental to Las Vegas resort revenues. MGM Mirage flirted with bankruptcy
and in 2009 Dubai World sued their partner for mismanagement of the
project’s construction, though it eventually dropped the suit and the
Sultan of Dubai attended the opening celebration (Benston, 2009). By
the time the initial phase of CityCenter was ready to open to the public,</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="3">
      <title>Las Vegas suffered the worst housing market in the nation.5 Dubai</title>
      <p>World no doubt came to regret its role in the project. By the date of
the December 2009 opening of the first phase of CityCenter, Dubai’s
economy was in freefall as the Emirate had announced just a month
before the inability to meet repayment obligations on nearly $25 billion
of loans (Sharif and Hall, 2011). The sultan who had masterminded the
territory’s equity purchase of half of the CityCenter venture amassed a
staggering $40 billion debt for Dubai World. Within a year he was
removed from his post as chairman of the company, proving prescient
his own 1997 prediction about CityCenter: ‘Its global significance cannot
be underestimated.’ A host of development projects in Dubai either sit
partially completed or never got past the drawing board as economic
woes have severely tempered the aspirations of Dubai’s sovereign to
create his own Ville-Lumiere, complete with rows of glittering glass
towers along Sheik Zayad Road and around the Dubai Marina, and
brought many of the Emirate’s ambitious projects to a standstill.</p>
      <p>If it is correct that finance is a spatial phenomenon, then ‘In order
to understand processes of financialization and their complex
geographies . . . it is vital to follow the networks of contemporary
financialized capitalism wherever they may lead’ (French et al., 2011: 809). We
will see in this case that these networks lead from CityCenter to not only
the city-states of Dubai and Macau, but ultimately to sovereign states as
far afield as Pyongyang, Beijing, Reykjavik, and Washington, DC.
Crucial to the neoliberal experiment launched in the West by Reagan and
Thatcher was Deng Xiaopeng’s transformation of China’s socialist
economy (see Harvey, 2007). In 1978 Deng took the first steps in his project to
establish a market economy with his Southern Tour to the Special
Economic Zone (SEZ) of Shenzhen. According to Deng’s strategy,
both Shenzhen and the Zhuhai SEZ, respectively located adjacent to
the colonies of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as a string of other
SEZs along the south China coast, would function collectively as
laboratories of production where the PRC would allow Western companies to
establish enterprises in order to study techniques of capitalist production,
manufacturing, management, and private property (Chuihua et al.,
2001).</p>
      <p>This process eventually formed what is for Castells (2000: 436) the
prototypical network society mega-city, the ‘Hong
Kong-ShenzhenCanton-Pearl River Delta-Macau-Zhuhai metropolitan regional
system’. Deng’s experiment has succeeded beyond anyone’s expectations,
and we will see that Macau plays a crucial role in enabling the circulation
of capital through this system. Today rural China is urbanizing on a vast
scale. China is pursuing urbanism itself as an accumulation strategy (Wu,
2009) and using macroeconomic policy to encourage domestic
consumption, resulting in a wholesale transformation of not only the landscape
but of the Chinese subject. This transformation is evidenced by the sight
of eager Chinese tourists queuing outside of Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and
Chanel shops in Macau and Hong Kong. The future of Chinese
consumption will depend on these members of the emerging middle class
who increasingly visit Macau on tourist visas enabled by new central
government policies.</p>
      <p>Capitalism’s ongoing recomposition in the market-socialist regime of
the PRC involves merging the post-Fordist and post-socialist economies
in interstitial sites like Macau and the SEZs and transforming those
overaccumulated Chinese workers into consumers; perhaps they will, in turn,
help address the over-accumulations of capital in the West. Scheerbart
and Benjamin might have pointed to the transformative potential of glass
architecture in such a project. If the SEZs were laboratories of
production, the city-state of Macau SAR could be understood as a
laboratory of post-socialist consumption, a site where the central
government of the PRC tests policies to stimulate tourism while Chinese
subjects hone habits conducive to consumerism (Simpson, 2009, 2011).
The enclave subsumes the functions heretofore managed by the state
which often capitalizes off enclaves in the sort of tribute system that
has existed in East Asia for several millennia. Such sites are central to
capitalist expansion in the region today. Specifically, to use Castell’s
(2000: 443) terminology, Macau is both a ‘hub’ and a ‘node’ in the
mega-city region. As an interstitial tourist city, paradoxically both
inside and outside the PRC, and visited by 28 million people in 2012,
it is a communication hub. As the only site of legal casino gambling in the
PRC, as well as a destination for select Chinese nationals from relatively
affluent cities and provinces to whom the central government grants
special travel visas to visit the SARs, Macau’s juridical exceptionalism
makes it a strategic node for the circulation of capital and the pedagogy
of capitalist enterprise. Macau’s potent ‘spatial cocktail’ includes
investment in the built environment from transnational actors; porous borders
combined with an interstitial identity; graduated management of
mainland Chinese tourist arrivals; and a peculiar gaming regulatory regime
that was forged during Portugal’s weak colonial administration.
Macau’s Transformation into a Glass City-State
The first and last European colony in Asia, Macau was returned by
Portugal to the PRC in 1999 after nearly half a millennium of
Portuguese rule. Gambling has been legal in Macau since 1847, and
the modern casino industry dates back 70 years, during which time it
has operated as a monopoly concession granted by the local Portuguese
administration in exchange for a percentage of the profits. Hong Kong
billionaire Stanley Ho controlled that monopoly from 1962 to 2002.
When the PRC regained control of Macau, the government dissolved
the monopoly and liberalized Macau’s gaming industry, ultimately
allowing six companies to operate as concessionaires. Through this
process MGM Resorts International, as well as Las Vegas entrepreneurs
Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson, entered the Macau casino market.</p>
      <p>Over the past decade the post-colonial cityscape of Macau,
characterized by a combination of quaint pastel-colored Portuguese churches and
municipal buildings built in the 17th to 19th centuries, has been
transformed into a postmodern phantasmagoria. Scheerbart’s prediction of
the inevitable expansion of glass architecture across the globe seems
prescient, and indeed financialization has crystallized the territory.
Today Macau’s cityscape sparkles with all manner of glass and
crystalline amusements which might serve as ‘formal overtones’ of fictitious
capital. The dome-shaped base of Ho’s flagship Grand Lisboa Casino,
which opened in 2007, is comprised of the world’s largest integrated LED
screen, featuring colorful displays of animated roulette wheels and rolling
dice (see Figure 2). The mediated screen surface of the building that
resembles Taut’s glass pavilion conjoins glass architecture, crystalline
ornamentation, fiber optics, and images of gambling in a perfect mimetic
representation of financialization. Displayed in the lobby of the casino is
the world’s largest cushion diamond, the 218 carat Star of Stanley Ho,
bought by its namesake for $100 million. Macau’s Sands Casino, built by
rival Adelson and covered in golden glass, features the world’s largest
crystal chandelier. Wynn’s eponymous resort as well as his Encore
property are covered in a tasteful brown glass curtain wall, and the MGM
Macau, Grand Waldo, Star World, Altira, Galaxy, and City of Dreams
properties have remade Macau into a glass state. Even strange glass
sculptures have begun to appear around the city (see Figures 3 &amp; 4).
This glass architecture stands alongside themed resorts like Adelson’s
$2.4 billion Venetian Macau; the largest building in Asia, the simulated
Venice is a self-contained enclave within the enclave of Macau.</p>
      <p>Themed environments and glass architecture function in a pedagogical
project to transform the socialist proletariat of the People’s Republic into
capitalist consumers. Three parables about MGM’s glass resorts and
fictitious capital in the casino economy of Macau will demonstrate the
articulations of each with global finance.</p>
      <p>Capital Fictions in Macau
MGM’s Role in Iceland’s Financial Economy
If MGM made a serious misstep with CityCenter, the company’s decision
to seek a concession in Macau has proved enormously successful. The
MGM property in Macau is jointly-owned by MGM Grand and Pansy
Ho Chiu-king, one of Stanley Ho’s 17 children (by four wives). The
company obtained its Macau gaming license by purchasing a
sub-concession of Stanley Ho’s own license for $200 million, and
subsequently opened the MGM Grand Macau, an undulating 35-storey
building featuring a tri-colored glass fa c¸ade. The hotel and casino are
connected to One Central Macau, a residential and retail property
developed by Stanley Ho’s company Shun Tak, for which Pansy Ho is
managing director. The property includes three apartment buildings, a
Mandarin Oriental Hotel, and a luxury shopping mall. The towers
were designed by Kohn Pederson Fox, the architectural firm that</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="4">
      <title>designed the Mandarin Oriental property at CityCenter.6</title>
      <p>MGM’s One Central Macau became a footnote to the global financial
crisis in October 2006 when Iceland’s financial services and insurance
company Sjova-Almennar Tryggingar HF purchased one entire tower
in the as-yet-not-completed project from Shun Tak for $101 million.
The Nordic company was a global trendsetter for the edgy, high-risk
investments that came to typify the speculative bubble that preceded the
crash in 2008. Within two years Iceland’s economy would be in tatters;
deregulated less than a decade earlier, its three banks faced a massive
collective collapse which was to prove in real terms the worst national
banking disaster in global history, and the country teetered on the edge
of bankruptcy. For their part, the people of Iceland felt the full violence
of financial capitalism as the value of the krona was in free fall, inflation
soared, and the economy plunged into a deep recession. The assets of
Iceland’s pension funds fell by up to 25 percent, and individual
retirements were plundered to service the debt. The prime minister of Iceland
who oversaw the collapse faced criminal charges for malfeasance.
Finance and Organized Crime in Macau’s Gaming Industry
In this context of ethical iniquity the seemingly disorganized capitalism
(Lash and Urry, 1987) that propelled the financial crisis might be
understood from another vantage point as a form of organized crime, a
sophisticated instrument of derivative larceny. Predatory lending practices
fueled the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States, eventually
resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in fines levied on guilty
mortgage companies (see Gotham, 2009: 364). The rampant and often illegal
foreclosing on properties in the wake of the crisis is an act of
accumulation by dispossession on a scale so massive it was described by a
Florida Supreme Court Justice as ‘the largest seizure of private property
ever attempted by banks and government entities’ (quoted in Harvey,
2012: 54). Ironically, during the financial crisis the spoils of drug
trafficking was the only source of liquidity accessible to some banks, and they
did not shy away from these ill-gotten gains (Saviano, 2012). Wachovia
admitted its role in laundering Mexican drug war profits, while HSBC
handled transactions by not only drug traffickers but Al Qaeda affiliates
and Iranian financiers trying to avoid US sanctions; the eventual fines on
the two banks totaled more than one billion dollars. The abuses were
systemic and systematic. ‘ABN Amro, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Lloyds
and ING have reached expensive settlements with regulators after
admitting to executing the transactions of clients in disreputable countries like
Cuba, Iran, Libya, Myanmar and Sudan’ (Saviano, 2012: 20).</p>
      <p>Macau is no exception. In order to hold a casino license in a
jurisdiction in the United States operators must be clear of criminal connections
in any jurisdiction in which they operate, and the Macau business
practices of both Adelson and Wynn are currently under investigation by
authorities in the United States. In May 2009 the New Jersey Division of
Gaming Enforcement released the results of an investigative report that
claimed that Stanley Ho had ties to Chinese criminal concerns. Since Ho
is a business associate of his daughter Pansy, herself in partnership with
MGM, this allegation threatened the gaming license of MGM’s Borgata
Casino in Atlantic City. Given Atlantic City’s poor economy and the
pecuniary potential of Macau, MGM made a relatively simple decision
to divest its stake in New Jersey and throw the company’s full weight
behind the China venture, regardless of the concerns raised about the
business practices of the Ho family. When MGM Macau went public on
the Hong Kong stock market in May 2011 and Pansy Ho sold a portion
of her 50 percent share of the partnership with MGM, the return on her
original $5 million investment was $1.5 billion. The deal made her the
youngest billionaire in Hong Kong, as well as the city’s wealthiest woman
(Gough, 2011; see Figure 5).</p>
      <p>New Jersey’s allegations about Ho’s underworld ties were not news to
industry insiders. In fact, Ho has long-term business interests with
Chinese triads in operating the VIP gambling concerns in his Macau
casinos. The triads act essentially as institutional loan sharks, fronting
gambling money to high-stakes players from mainland China who
cannot otherwise easily move cash across the tightly-regulated borders
of the PRC (Siu, 2007). Wealthy individuals from China who want to risk
millions of dollars in Macau’s casinos need access to cash loans in the
territory on the agreement that they will repay gambling losses to the
granter of the loan once they return to the mainland. However, this is
complicated by the fact that gambling debts are not legally enforceable
on the mainland; therefore anyone who makes loans in Macau must be
confident of their ability to coerce re-payment through extra-judicial
means. Chinese triads have thus played an instrumental role in Macau
casinos since at least the 1980s, and an innovative vernacular ‘rolling
chips’ operation funds huge gambling stakes in Macau’s casinos
(Leong, 2002).</p>
      <p>In 2006 Macau’s casino revenues were the largest in the world, and by
2010 Macau gaming revenues were quadruple the combined casino
revenues of the entire state of Nevada. Seventy percent of that revenue came
from high-stakes baccarat. The local government tax of nearly 40 percent
on gaming revenue generated $15 billion for government coffers in 2012,
making the administration complicit in the system based on collusion
between an oligarchy of state-sanctioned concessionaires and organized
crime. Cash handouts to residents in Macau’s wealth-sharing scheme
inaugurated in 2008 take on the appearance of hush money, making
the local population complicit. In 2013 each resident received payments
of MOP 8000 ($1000). However, it is difficult to escape regular reminders
that these profits are derived off the bare life of populations.</p>
      <p>A [Hong Kong] man took a HK$10,700 government grant meant
for the burial of his maternal grandmother and gambled it away in
Macau, leaving the woman’s body to languish in a morgue for a
year until police and the Social Welfare Department buried her.
(Man, 2010)
Fictitious Capital from the DPRK
Ho has alleged ties not only to independent Chinese criminal
brotherhoods, but also to North Korea, which the United States claims is a
state-run crime syndicate. Ho has operated a casino in a hotel in
Pyongyang since 1995 (Lintner, 2007). The older half-brother of North
Korean leader Kim Jong-un resides in Macau and often gambles in the
city’s casinos. But it is the relationship between the DPRK and another
Macau concern that provides an additional nuance to the movements of
fictitious capital.</p>
      <p>In September 2005 the US State Department used the Patriot Act to
designate Macau’s family-owned Banco Delta Asia as a ‘primary money
laundering concern’, with allegations that the bank was facilitating North
Korea’s criminal actions. The US Treasury Department intoned: ‘Banco
Delta Asia has been a willing pawn for the North Korean government to
engage in corrupt financial activities through Macau, a region that needs
significant improvement in its money laundering controls’ (Gaylord,
2008: 297). The move prompted a run on the bank that resulted in
panicked depositors withdrawing $133 million before the Macau
Monetary Authority put the bank in receivership. The accusations
against North Korea involved allegations of drug trafficking and
circulating counterfeit US cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, and currency. The
counterfeit currency in question is $100 ‘supernotes’, the holy grail of
faux money which can only be manufactured with presses and paper
identical to those used by the US Mint. For this reason, there is
skepticism about North Korea’s ability to manufacture supernotes. Many
participants in a 2006 Interpol conference dedicated to the supernotes
concluded that the US government itself must be the source of the
counterfeit notes; suspicion lingers that the CIA prints the currency in a
facility near Washington, DC in order to fund covert operations outside the
oversight of Congress (Gaylord, 2008: 295).</p>
      <p>The disturbing possibility that Macau’s glass casino resorts could be
laundering counterfeit dollars printed by the CIA and fronted by the
Chinese mafia to post-socialist gamblers from the PRC, all the while
running afoul of the State Department’s own prosecution of the
Patriot Act, provides a new chapter to Marx’s story of fictitious capital.
‘As capital investment sometimes ceases to have a necessarily immediate
relationship with material production’, write Goldman and Papson
(2011), ‘it becomes an end in itself, chasing its tail through the circuitry
of financial instruments where the referent is no longer necessarily the
world of infrastructure, labor, production, or commodities, but rather a
bond, or a security, or a securitized debt package’ (p. 52). Or in this case,
the referent is simply money itself. In the ruse of the counterfeit, even
hard currency becomes another type of derivative, its value derived from
the money form which it emulates. This game of three-card Monte is
reminiscent of Enron’s ‘special purpose vehicles’, the shell companies it
created to purchase assets from itself so the revenue could appear on the
company’s books while the debt remained hidden (Goldman and Papson,
2011: 57). Enron’s ultimate fortunes may foreshadow this fraudulent
financial fable’s denouement.</p>
      <p>Global Grids of Glass
I have tried to take seriously the claim that financialization is a spatial
phenomenon and analyzed how finance capital is fixed for purposes of
accumulation in contemporary enclave spaces which feature glass
architecture. Indeed, as I have noted, technologies of glass production were
crucial to the historical development of capitalism, from the goblets of
the city-state of Venice, to the arcades and display windows of
19thcentury Paris and Weimar Germany (Lungstrum, 1999), to the sleek
surfaces of the North American corporate buildings that served the
post-war cybernetic economy. Glass material has merged with
technological innovations to create mediated cityscapes. The networked space
of flows on which financialization depends today is enabled by the
coupling of glass and light in fiber-optic technology which circulates
fictitious and hyperreal forms of capital in what increasingly appears to be a
global casino. I have suggested that glass architecture in enclave gaming
developments in Las Vegas and Macau is a product of the financial
economy which creates these structures in its own image: smooth,
transparent, frictionless, fragile, and fictitious. To comprehend the
relationship of glass architecture to fictitious capital and consumer subjection we
must explore not only the technical features of the buildings themselves
but imaginative accounts of the transformative qualities of glass.
Alchemical phantasms of crystallization animate the deistic convictions
of central bank economists who deregulate financial flows and securities
traders who colonize fiber-optic networks to engineer the economy of
dematerialized capital. These glass constructions reproduce both the
technological function and aesthetic form of financialization.</p>
      <p>Influenced by Scheerbart and in the wake of the techno-human
brutality of the Second World War, Benjamin (1999) opined that the glass
and steel of the International Style had the value of being traceless: ‘they
have created rooms where it is hard to leave traces’ (p. 734). Benjamin
thought that those who lived through the war would benefit from this
detachment from the past, that glass architecture would constitute a
generational tabula rasa. ‘Objects made of glass have no “aura”’, he
said. ‘Glass is an enemy of secrets. It is also an enemy of possession’
(p. 734).7 But today, in a typically Benjaminian dialectical reversal, both
fiber-optics technology itself and fiber-optics-enabled financialization
have ironically transformed glass into a material which accumulates
both possessions and secrecy, converting illiquid architectural assets
into liquid capital. Glass reproduces capitalism’s endemic violence in
the very guise of traceless transparency and the utopian immediacy of
universal communications.</p>
      <p>The Derivative Cityscape and the Implosion of Value
This returns us, then, to CityCenter, the enclave neighborhood
development on the Las Vegas Strip. ‘Utopian space is an imaginary enclave
within real social space’, suggests Jameson (2005: 15). For Jameson, in a
move that echoes Benjamin’s analysis of the Parisian arcades, the enclave
is ‘something like a foreign body within the social’ that may potentially
‘offer a space in which new wish images of the social can be elaborated
and experimented on’ (p. 16).8 Perhaps CityCenter, not to mention the
city-state of Macau, operates in this manner, a dialectial image
counterposing the utopian dreams of the collective against the neoliberal
delusions of fictitious and hyperreal capital. Built on billions of dollars of
debt, CityCenter is not only an effort to erect a planned urban
community; it also inadvertently embodies the deflationary direction of the
derivative-driven global economy, where capital is fixed in space to create
self-contained islands of accumulation, and dematerialized
financialization finds its physical form in glass architecture.</p>
      <p>Next to the Vdara Hotel in CityCenter sits the Norman
Fosterdesigned Harmon Hotel. Foster is the epitome of the starchitect and
his buildings define the contemporary Global Style (Foster, 2011). He
is responsible for notable glass designs the world over, ranging from
futuristic airports in Hong Kong and Beijing, Zayad National Museum
in the United Arab Emirates, the UAE Pavilion at the Shanghai Expo,
and even another City Center in Washington, DC. But the Harmon
Hotel has not fared so well and its failures belie the empty promise of
fictitious capital today. Originally designed to have 49 floors, structural
problems in the foundation led to the decision in 2009 to eliminate nearly
half of the building, rendering a completed edifice of only 26 storeys.
However, subsequent problems halted the project prior to completion,
and it now sits empty on the Strip. The completed external structure of
the building stands intact but the interior has not been finished and it
remains unoccupied.9 Subsequent evaluation led an engineering firm to
declare the Harmon unsafe due to its inability to withstand an
earthquake, which assessors charged would collapse the tower in what would
be yet another perfect storm of nature, culture, and economics (Garcia,
2011). Citing the danger posed by the Harmon tower, MGM Mirage is
seeking to implode the building, and is currently engaged in a lawsuit
with the construction company; that company claims that the building
can be repaired and alleges that MGM Mirage is proffering a fiction in
order to cut its financial losses (Glass, 2011; Green, 2011).</p>
      <p>The glass fa c¸ade of the Harmon Hotel today exists only as the world’s
most expensive billboard, publicizing the Elvis Review show playing next
door– and thus constituting an unhappy convergence of the dual guises
of hyperreal capital: advertising and glass architecture. By combining an
enticing lambent surface with an empty structure, the Harmon Hotel
vitrifies the very fetish quality – not of the Fordist commodity which
so fascinated Benjamin, but of the commodified and derivative risk
that underpins the post-Fordist financial economy. Effectively a
subprime asset located in a volatile spatial derivative, the Harmon Hotel
building stands patiently waiting to be imploded, eventually no doubt
contributing one more spectacle to the nighttime reveries of the city’s
tourists, and one more means of extracting some form of value from the
violence of finance capital, the destruction of the city and of the dreams
that reside there. ‘With the upheaval of the market economy’, lamented
Benjamin (1968: 88), in words even more poignant in an era of finance
capital today that takes its form in glass structures, ‘we begin to
recognize the monuments of the bourgeoisie as ruins even before they have
crumbled’.
