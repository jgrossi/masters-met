      <abstract>
        <p>This article explores the theoretical and substantive connections between iconicity and consumerism in the field of contemporary iconic architecture within the framework of a critical theory of globalization. Iconicity in architecture is defined in terms of fame and special symbolic/aesthetic significance as applied to buildings, spaces and in some cases architects themselves. Iconic architecture is conceptualized as a hegemonic project of the transnational capitalist class. In the global era, I argue, iconic architecture strives to turn more or less all public space into consumerist space, not only in the obvious case of shopping malls but more generally in all cultural spaces, notably museums and sports complexes. The inspiration that iconic architecture has provided historically generally coexisted with repressive political and economic systems, and for change to happen an alternative form of non-capitalist globalization is necessary. Under such conditions truly inspiring iconic architecture, including existing architectural icons, may create genuinely democratic public spaces in which the culture-ideology of consumerism fades away. In this way, a built environment in which the full array of human talents can flourish may begin to emerge.</p>

      <p>Iconic, in general, refers to events, people and/or objects that (1) are
famous for those within the ¢elds in question (notably popular culture,
fashion and sport) and often also for the public at large and (2) have special
symbolic/aesthetic signi¢cance attached to them. Icons are famous not simply
for being famous, as is the case for various forms of celebrity, but famous
for possessing speci¢c symbolic/aesthetic qualities, qualities that are the
subject of considerable debate within the specialist ¢elds and, increasingly,
with the recent rise of the blogosphere, debate to which the general
public actively contributes. In a previous paper (Sklair, 2006) I distinguish
between two contrasting meanings of iconic in architecture, namely the
stereotypical copy, like the iconic Palladian villa or iconic mosque (Iconic I),
and something unique as in unique selling point (Iconic II). Both meanings
are, confusingly, in use in current debates ^ here it is the second meaning
that is intended.</p>
      <p>Consumerism ^ or more accurately, the culture-ideology of
consumerism ^ refers to a set of beliefs and values, integral but not exclusive to the
system of capitalist globalization, intended to make people believe that
human worth is best ensured and happiness is best achieved in terms of
our consumption and possessions. This is relentlessly reinforced by an
infrastructure of transnational cultural practices within capitalist globalization.1
Globalization is conceptualized in terms of transnational practices, practices
that cross state borders but do not necessarily originate with state agencies,
actors or institutions. These practices are analytically distinguished on
three levels ^ economic, political and culture-ideology ^ constituting the
sociological totality. At this point, the distinction between generic
globalization, capitalist globalization and alternative (non-capitalist) globalizations
can usefully be introduced. Generic globalization may be de¢ned in terms
of four criteria ^ the electronic revolution, postcolonialism, the creation of
transnational social spaces, and new forms of cosmopolitanism.2 Generic
globalization is an abstract framework for analysis, it is not actually existing
globalization. In the concrete conditions of the world as it is today, a world
largely structured by global capitalism, the transnational practices of
capitalist globalization are typically characterized by major institutional forms.
The transnational corporation is the major locus of transnational economic
practices; the transnational capitalist class is the major locus of
transnational political practices; and the major locus of transnational
culture-ideology practices is to be found in the culture-ideology of consumerism. Not
all culture is ideological, even in capitalist societies. Culture-ideology
indicates that consumerism in the capitalist global system can only be fully
understood as a culture-ideology practice where cultural practices reinforce
the ideology and the ideology reinforces the cultural practices. The ‘Books
are just the beginning’ marketing campaign of the Boston Public Library
is a telling example of the culture-ideology of consumerism ^ not even
libraries are exempt (see F|gure 1).3</p>
      <p>My argument is that iconicity plays a central role in promoting the
culture-ideology of consumerism in the interests of those who control capitalist

globalization, namely the transnational capitalist class, largely through their
ownership and/or control of transnational corporations.4 While such
connections have been made for the ¢elds of popular culture, fashion and sport,
there has been very little systematic research on the links between iconic
architecture and capitalist consumerism.
Architecture and Globalization
Iconic architecture is de¢ned as buildings and spaces that (1) are famous for
those in and around architecture and/or the public at large and (2) have
special symbolic/aesthetic signi¢cance (see Sklair, 2006).5 The argument is
located within a diachronic thesis suggesting that in the pre-global era
(roughly the period before the 1960s) iconic architecture tended to be
driven by the state and/or religion (though there are, of course, many
famous buildings before the 1960s that were inspired by neither states nor
religions), while in the era of capitalist globalization the dominant force
driving iconic architecture is the transnational capitalist class. In cities this is
organized in the form of globalizing urban growth coalitions (Sklair, 2005).</p>
      <p>Iconic architecture and architects connect analytically with generic
globalization, in the ¢rst instance, through the capacity that the electronic
revolution provides to design and build spectacular buildings with new
materials in ways that were not previously possible. As capitalism
globalizes, and the culture-ideology of consumerism begins to take hold, iconic
architecture starts to be used in more deliberate ways to transform the
built environment, particularly in globalizing cities. With the emergence
and development of computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided
manufacturing (CAM), qualitatively new patterns of production in
architecture and engineering are rapidly disseminated. Tombesi (2001), for example,
shows how technological innovations, particularly in the realm of computer
software and increasing availability of hardware, have promoted a new
international division of labour between architectural o⁄ces in the First World
and in the Third World, and Chung et al. (2001) vividly illustrate how this
works in China. The use of computers to help design and build
extraordinary architecture started with what may be called the ¢rst architectural
icon of the global era ^ the Sydney Opera House ^ whose tortuous building
process lasted from 1957 to 1973, surviving the resignation of the architect,
Jorn Utzon, in 1966.</p>
      <p>The Opera House could not have been built without computers. If the
project had been attempted ten years earlier it simply could not have been
done in the way it was because the computers were not available to process
the vast quantities of data involved in the structural analysis of the shells.
(Messent, 1997: 509, n.28)
A booklet published in 1971 by the Opera House Trust estimated that the
work carried out even on these primitive computers would have taken 1000
mathematicians more than 100 years to do (1997: 509, n.28). Many
celebrated living architects readily accept that they could not have made their
most famous designs without the help of CAD. Prominent examples are
Norman Foster’s Reichstag Dome in Berlin, the Great Court in the British
Museum and the Swiss Re Building in London, and Frank Gehry’s
Guggenheim Bilbao and Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Gehry (or
rather his computer technician Jim Glymph) famously adapted the CATIA
(Computer Aided Three-Dimensional Interactive Application) software
developed by the French aerospace company Dassault Syst e'mes (Gehry and
Friedman, 1999: 15^17), initially for a monumental ¢sh sculpture for the
Barcelona Olympics in 1992 and, most famously, for his Guggenheim
Bilbao. Fierro illustrates how CAD in architecture connects directly with
consumerism in her analysis of how a new system of glazing developed by
the engineers RFR made possible the Paris of the grands projets: ‘As a
patented system, RFR’s structural glazing became a commodity available for
purchase and installation in any type of space. It was immediately
appropriated by developer culture as a means of endowing commercial space with a
fashionable technological £ourish’ (Fierro, 2003: 217). Thus, iconic
architecture becomes easily, if sometimes expensively, available for globalizing
cities everywhere. Much contemporary architecture, like much of
contemporary life, is unthinkable in the absence of the electronic revolution ^ the
¢rst criterion of generic globalization.</p>
      <p>The postcolonial revolution has had profound e¡ects on architecture,
urbanism and identity all over the world. At one level, this continues the
long-standing arguments about cultural imperialism. King (2004) makes
the connections between postcolonialism and globalization directly,
demonstrating that, despite obvious disparities in power, these relations are rarely
in one direction. This is particularly true in the special, though not so
uncommon, circumstance of ‘Western’ architects building for governments
or other clients in what used to be called the Third World. An excellent
illustration of this is the case of the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, built for the state-owned oil company in this self-described
‘moderate’ Muslim country. In his account of the attempt to integrate Islamic
motifs into the £oorplan of the building to give it a local dimension, the
architect, Cesar Pelli, shows how the postcolonial is not simply a new form
of imperialism but something rather more subtle (Pelli et al., 1997). The
Islamic motif £oorplan and Malaysian design elements in no way inhibit
the operation of the shopping mall that occupies the ground £oor of the
building, one of the most prestigious transnational social spaces in Asia.</p>
      <p>Transnational social spaces are spaces, like globally branded shopping
malls, theme parks, waterfront developments and transportation centres,
that could literally be almost anywhere in the world. What makes them
transnational is that they are designed to represent simultaneously one of
the various global architectural styles recognized ^ through the mass
media as much as through direct experience ^ by quite di¡erent
communities of people from a multitude of geographical, ethnic and cultural origins,
and visual references that mark out speci¢c senses of belonging identi¢ed
with each of these communities without o¡ending the sensibilities of
members of other communities ^ the connection with the postcolonial revolution.
This is the sphere in which iconic architecture and the culture-ideology of
consumerism relate most directly, insofar as the culture-ideology of consumerism
provides the de¢ning set of practices and beliefs ^ in a word, shopping ^ that
aspires to transcend the very real di¡erences that exist between geographical,
ethnic and cultural communities, at ‘home’ and ‘abroad’.Thus, it is in shopping
malls of varying designs that we ¢nd typical transnational social spaces all
over the world (see Abaza, 2001). The ritualistic aspects of shopping and the
places where people shop have led to the common use of the evocative
expression ‘cathedrals of consumption’ in this context (see F|gure 2).</p>
      <p>Shopping malls are cathedrals of consumption ^ a glib phrase that I regret
the instant it slides o¡ my pen. The metaphor of consumerism as a religion,
in which commodities become the icons of worship and the rituals of
exchanging money for goods become a secular equivalent of holy
communion, is simply too glib to be helpful, and too attractive to those whose
intentions, whether they be moral or political, are to expose the evils and
limitations of bourgeois materialism. And yet the metaphor is both
attractive and common precisely because it does convey and construct a
knowledge of consumerism. (Fiske, 1991: 13)
Ritzer (1999: ch. 1) takes this further, and though he does not speak of
transnational social spaces, his theory of consumption as enchantment clearly has a
universal reach. Whatever the merits of the enchantment thesis, this approach
does draw welcome attention to the architecture of places, metaphorical or
literal cathedrals where consumption happens. An apt illustration of this process
is the way in which pre-global era iconic buildings ^ often traditionally
surrounded by sellers of relics etc. ^ have become increasingly commercialized
in recent years, usually in the interests of tourism and city-marketing. As
malls become more cathedral-like, cathedrals, notably St Paul’s in London,
have begun to charge admission and open souvenir shops.</p>
      <p>New forms of cosmopolitanism are more di⁄cult to pin down in this
context, but the most famous architects ^ dubbed ‘starchitects’ ^ of today
play an increasingly pivotal role in creating them. This can be seen in the
celebrity coverage of the leading architects in architectural and design
magazines and, increasingly, in the cultural and arts sections of mainstream
media (see Sklair, forthcoming). In some special cases, for example, the
debate over the redevelopment of the World Trade Center after 9/11, such
coverage spills over onto the front pages and moves up the media news
agendas (see ‘Iconic Media Wars’ in Jencks, 2005: 64^99). In Glasgow Charles
Rennie Mackintosh and in Barcelona Antoni Gaudi are now part of the
marketing of the cities. There are more architects working outside their places
of origin than ever before, and demand for ‘foreign’ architects ^ especially
from urban growth coalitions in globalizing cities (urban boosters) ^ has
never been greater. Among many clear and already well-researched examples
of this phenomenon two stand out: ¢rst, what has been termed the Bilbao
e¡ect, referring to the continuing in£uence of Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim
Bilbao (Del Cerro Santamaria, 2007: ch. 6; McNeill, 2000); and, second,
the case of the foreign architects, notably Herzog and de Meuron, Rem
Koolhaas and Paul Andreu, designing iconic structures in the build-up
to the Bei jing Olympics (Broudehoux, 2004: ch. 6; Ren, forthcoming).6
Figure 2 Cathedral of consumption: Bridgemarket on First Avenue
at 59th Street, Manhattan (2004)
Cosmopolitan iconic architects are now an essential element in the
marketing strategies of globalizing urban growth coalitions.</p>
      <p>Global capitalism, therefore, mobilizes the commercial potential of
generic globalization in the sphere of architecture as it does more or less
successfully in all other spheres. While global capitalism provides the structure,
the transnational capitalist class (TCC) provides the agents. The TCC can
be conceptualized in terms of the following four fractions: those who own
and/or control the major transnational corporations and their local a⁄liates
(corporate fraction); globalizing politicians and bureaucrats (state fraction);
globalizing professionals (technical fraction); and merchants and media
(consumerist fraction).7 The consumerist fraction is directly responsible
for the marketing of architecture in all its manifestations and, ideally,
turning architectural icons into special types of commodities. The end-point of
the culture-ideology of consumerism is to render everything into the
commodity form. In architecture, as in other quasi-cultural ¢elds, endowing
the commodity with iconicity is simply a special and added quality that
enhances the exchange (money) value of the icon and all that is associated
with it. Obviously, this process peaks in the realm of shopping.
Iconic Architecture and Shopping
When Goss reported in the early 1990s that shopping was the second most
important leisure time activity in the US after TV, which also promoted
shopping in any case, and proclaimed that ‘shopping has become the dominant
mode of contemporary public life’ (1993: 18), many were sceptical. Now, at the
end of the ¢rst decade of the new millennium, the sceptics are a declining
minority ^ whether from the point of view of those who live by the culture-ideology of
consumerism or those who condemn it as the greatest blight on our humanity.
The study of malls thus seems important to understand how this phenomenon
is organized ^ invoking ¢ndings from the consciousness industry,
environmental design, Madison Avenue and Disney, and the centrality of ‘Learning from
Las Vegas’ both literally and in terms of the highly in£uential treatise of Robert
Venturi and his colleagues (1977). The mall is an instrumental space, where
commercial success depends on nothing being left to chance, from escalator
design to entrances, temperature, lighting, music, mirrors, cleanliness and, of
course, the £oorplan: ‘a too direct and obvious route between the entrance and
exits must be avoided’ (Goss, 1993: 32). The ideal is to construct a narrative
which draws the shopper through maximum consumption opportunities.
(This idea is revisited below in the context of Klein’s analysis of ‘scripted
spaces’).There are, of course, some commercial constraints on mall architects
and developers, notably the imperative of maximizing revenues for every
available unit of retail space, but apart from this there are plenty of opportunities for
ingenious designers to build various forms of iconicity into malls at scales from
neighbourhood to regional, aspiring national (as in Mall of America) as well as
the globalizing.While the locations are local, the phenomenon is transnational,
connecting the built environment to capitalist consumerism.8 Similar trends
can be observed in theme parks, waterfront developments and transportation
infrastructure (airports, rail and bus stations) all over the world.</p>
      <p>Every city in the world now has its malls and, at least in a minimalist
sense, it can be argued that many if not most malls achieve a measure of local
iconicity just by being malls ^ they are known to all the locals (thus famous),
they have speci¢c symbolic-aesthetic qualities in terms of either crude
modernism and/or postmodernism and/or variations on vernacular themes.The most
famous malls in the world tend to be admired more for their scale and
monumentality, and for what they represent ^ often the regeneration of a
neighborhood or a whole city ^ than for their architectural qualities as such. However,
in recent years the connections between shopping, consumerism and iconic
architecture have been driven much more by boutiques than by malls.This is
best illustrated by the relationship between Prada and its architects of choice,
notably Rem Koolhaas, Herzog and de Meuron, and Kazua Se jima, all of
whom have designed deliberately iconic stores for Prada in globalizing cities.
Vlovine (2003), in an article on the new Prada store in Tokyo, designed by
Herzog and de Meuron (the architects of the Tate Modern in London), quotes
the CEO of the company: ‘Architecture is the same as advertising for
communicating the brand.’On the $40 million Prada store in Manhattan, Ockman writes:
The ingenious transformation of commercial into cultural space on which
Koolhaas has persuaded his client to bank here is fraught with risks . . .
Both fascinated and repelled by the world of commerce, he bestrides the
globe in his brown Prada coat like a post-modern Howard Roark. (Ockman,
2002: 78; see also Sari, 2004: 36^51)9</p>
      <p>While a leader, Prada is not alone. There are many other retailers who
see the advantages of such connections. In England, a long-established central
London store, Selfridges, had a new store designed for them in Birmingham
by architects Future Systems (see F|gure 3).This was instantly dubbed iconic ^
‘A New Icon for UK’s Second Largest City: The ‘‘Sexy’’ Silver Building’ ^
in the Taiwanese magazine, Dialogue: Architecture + Design + Culture
(Sari, 2004: 68^81).</p>
      <p>The architects were asked if their visuals could be used on the store
credit card (Speaks, 2002). Recognition of the outline of a building,
especially in a skyline, is one of the great signi¢ers of iconicity, Manhattan
being the most famous example. In the pages of the in£uential Harvard
Design Magazine, this phenomenon is termed architainment. ‘Theme
parks and art museums are increasingly joined by upscale retailers
[and top-end boutique hotels] as patrons of high-pro¢le architecture’
(Fernandez-Galiano, 2000: 37). Branches of the luxury goods chain LVMH
by the trendy French architect Christian de Portzamparc, Prada by Rem
Koolhaas, and the Royalton and Paramount hotels designed by the even
trendier Philippe Starck (all in Manhattan) are but the most sparkling
pinnacles of this global consumerist iceberg. While luxury boutique hotels

Birmingham, England (2007)
have attracted most attention in the glossy design magazines, there are also
many large luxury hotel developments that have caught the eye, like malls,
as much for their monumental scale as for their architectural quality. An
outstanding example is the Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai, designed by
Atlans &amp; Partners, a distinguished regional practice (also iconized in Sari,
2004). This hotel complex, with its distinctive Arab dhow shape, is only
the best-known of many self-proclaimed ‘iconic’ architectural features that
have turned Dubai into a new wonder of the (consumerist) world.10 Of the
major architect^developers of the global age, John Portman (e.g. his
Peachtree Center in Atlanta and Westin Bonaventure in Los Angeles;
see Jameson, 1991; Portman and Barnett, 1976) and John Jerde (e.g. his
Bellagio in Las Vegas, Mall of America in Minneapolis and waterside
projects in Fukuoka; see Jerde, 1999; Klein, 2004) have made the iconic
atrium integral to the culture-ideology of consumerism.</p>
      <p>For shopping malls, boutiques and hotel resorts the connection
between iconic architecture and consumerism is quite obvious, at least at
the local level, but it is not so obvious with respect to other types of
architectural icons, especially in the ¢eld of culture (performance spaces,
especially sports stadia and museums). The Sydney Opera House is a paradigm
case of how a performance space commissioned by public bodies and
designed deliberately to be what is here conceptualized as an architectural
icon (Messent, 1997; esp. chs 3^5; Murray, 2003) is transformed under the
conditions of capitalist globalization into a global icon of the culture-ideology
of consumerism. From its roots as a city icon for Sydney, promoted as a
national icon for Australia, to eventual canonization as a UNESCO World
Heritage listed building ^ one indicator of global iconicity ^ the Sydney
Opera House has become one of the best-known buildings in the world. It
is, arguably, the gold standard against which the attempt to manufacture
iconic architecture in the global arena is measured. The clients of the
Guggenheim Bilbao are widely reported to have cited it in these terms
( Jencks, 2005) and in her discussion of the project to build a new National
Theatre in Bei jing, Broudehoux (2004: 227) asserts:</p>
      <p>The theatre was to become an emblem of late twentieth-century modernity
and a deserving symbol of China which could attract worldwide recognition
and compete as a visual icon with structures such as the Sydney Opera
House or the Grande Arche in Paris.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the federal arts minister commented on the ongoing
process to upgrade the Opera House: ‘The Federal Government
acknowledges the icon status of the Sydney Opera House, not just as a building in
the hearts of all Australians but as a world-recognised symbol of Australia’
(Sydney Morning Herald, 2007).11A manifestation of this was the headline
image position of the Opera House in the multi-million dollar ‘Where the
bloody hell are you?’ international advertising campaign launched in
2006 for the Australian tourist industry (Sydney Morning Herald, 2006: 1).
The global dissemination of the image of the icon, already boosted by
exposure during the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, goes hand in hand with the
ever-increasing commercialization of the building itself over the last few
decades in the forms of reproduction of the image on more and more
memorabilia, and the enlargement of spending opportunities in and around the site.</p>
      <p>The Olympics in particular, and sporting venues in general, provide
many good examples of the links between iconic architecture and
consumerism. The architect explained that after the success of HOK’s Stadium
Australia for the Sydney Olympics he decided to focus exclusively on sports
and leisure architecture because this is the building type that most touches
the hearts and minds of the common man. ‘As symbols of a region or a
nation, as icons of popular culture, stadia are never viewed in isolation . . .
[they] are vigorously competing for praise and attention with their
counterparts elsewhere’ (in Sheard, 2001: xiv) and identi¢ed with popular
aspirations. These ‘New Cathedrals of Sport’ are ‘multi-experience venues fully
tuned into the digital age’ ^ circumlocutions signalling the culture-ideology
of consumerism. Sheard goes on to philosophize on sports architecture, a
philosophy grounded with a healthy dose of commercialism:
beyond its physical presence, the stadium also provides a tangible focus for
community consciousness and social bonding, a place representing urban
pride, a place in which one feels part of something important, a place to
share and en joy with one’s neighbours. It has also been shown that city
centre venues also help to generate revenue for surrounding businesses and
services as the secondary spend from these venues can be considerable.
(2001: xviii)</p>
      <p>Hence, the new consumerist phenomenon of ‘stadium tourism’. In
Munich, for example, the Olympic Stadium is the second most popular
tourist attraction in the city, while in Barcelona more tourists visit Nou
Camp (the home of Barcelona football club) than the Picasso museum. As
gate receipts for sports events decline relative to TV income, merchandising
becomes more important, as in airports all round the world, and this is
re£ected in the layout of both types of architecture. For stadia and airports,
‘spending time’ is literally two to four hours. The latest high-pro¢le project
of HOK Sports with Foster + Partners is Wembley Stadium in London,
whose original twin towers, known to football fans all over the world, have
been replaced by an already globally recognizable iconic arch, images of
which adorn myriad publicity materials, directional signs on all the highway
approaches to the stadium, and the cover of the semi-o⁄cial publication
Wembley Stadium: National Icon (Barclay and Powell, 2007).</p>
      <p>This two-way process whereby deliberately iconic architecture and
enhanced consumerism of sports stadia feed into one another is also evident
in the case of museums. Andy Warhol is reputed to have said ^ and if
he did, it was a remarkable prediction ^ that ‘All department stores
will become museums, and all museums will become department stores’
(as quoted, but without a source, in Jencks, 2005: 44^7).12 Many museums
have increased and upgraded their coverage of architecture and design at
the same time as virtually all major new museums around the world have
been proclaimed architectural icons by their patrons (at the local and/or
national and/or global levels) and their images have been mobilized in the
service of the culture-ideology of consumerism. The production and
marketing of architectural icons and architects as icons (starchitects) have been at
the centre of these developments (Sklair, forthcoming).</p>
      <p>The role of new museums for urban growth coalitions in globalizing
cities can hardly be over-stated. Lampugnani and Sachs (1999) show that
architecturally distinguished museums by world-famous architects are
to be found not only in the obviously ‘global cities’ but in many other less
obvious candidates for global credentials, for example in Nimes (Foster),
Hamburg (Ungers), Karlsruhe (Koolhaas), Monterrey (Legorreta),
Milwaukee (Calatrava), Cincinnati (Hadid). The ¢rst iconic museum of the
global era was probably Frank Lloyd Wright’s Guggenheim Museum in
New York, completed in 1959 a few months after the death of the architect,
and 40 years later Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim Bilbao has become just as
iconic. Of the reasons commonly given to explain why some museums
become iconic for the public three stand out, and all of them connect
directly with the culture-ideology of consumerism, i.e. they promote the
idea of museums as consumerist spaces. First, the two Guggenheims and
many other successful museums have unusual sculptural qualities: people
visit them to see the museums themselves, as much as and sometimes rather
more than the art inside. Second, as argued above, museums ^ like all cultural
institutions ^ have become much more commercialized in the global era.
Most new museums today have larger shops and a greater variety of art and
architecture-related merchandise and spaces for refreshment than was the
case 50 years ago (Zukin, 1995). A ubiquitous feature of the remodelling of
old museums is the addition of consumerist spaces (Harris, 1990).
‘Remarkably, the key performance indicator of retail sales per square foot is
higher in MoMA’s museum stores than in Walmart’ (Evans, 2003: 431). A
further illustration of this is the monumental advertising of extended opening
hours for the Prado in Madrid, ¢ghting o¡ competition from the more
modernist Reina So¢a and Thyssen museums, nearby (see F|gure 4).</p>
      <p>Similarly, consumerist refurbishment of the Victoria and Albert in
London led to the jibe, or maybe it was an advertising slogan, that it was ‘a
great caf e¤ with a museum attached’ ^ and this sentiment has been repeated
for other museums, for example the recently remodelled MoMA in
New York (Evans, 2003: 434). Third, museums often become endowed with
iconicity when they can be seen to successfully regenerate rundown areas,
when they seek to upgrade the shopping and entertainment potential of the
area. This is certainly true for the Guggenheim in Bilbao, and new
museums in many other cities. In London, the ‘Tate Modern e¡ect’ helps
to explain how a converted disused power station has transformed a grimy
area south of the Thames and, by connecting it via the new Millennium
Bridge with St Paul’s Cathedral on the north side of the river, has created a
new urban pole of attraction. In all of these cases the iconic museum
stands not in isolation but as part of an urban renewal and/or urban
upgrading plan. As Wu (2002: 198) argues:</p>
      <p>Since the eighties it has become ever more popular among developers whose

      <p>Globalizing Cities and Consumerist Space
Consumerist space can be de¢ned as space in which users are encouraged
and provided with opportunities to spend money, in contrast to
non-consumerist space, that does neither. While Hannigan’s idea of ‘fantasy city’
(1998) is something of an exaggeration, there is no doubt that his triad of
shopertainment, eatertainment and edutainment, added to the
architainment of Fernandez-Galiano (2000) noted above, is a key component of the
mix intended to turn cities that were once centres of productive labour into
sites devoted to the culture-ideology of consumerism. The phenomenon
reported in research from UCLA in 1995, cited by Hannigan, showing that
for the ¢rst time entertainment provided more jobs than aerospace in
California, can be replicated in more or less all globalizing cities all over
the world. Iconic architecture, at least at the local urban level, is the sine
qua non for this. This raises the issue of the relations between public and
private space and, more pointedly, the very survival of genuine public
space in our cities (Herzog, 2006). It must be said that this much-used
but monolithic distinction is not as simple as it sounds, because much
public space has been e¡ectively privatized and some private space has
been made public (Kayden, 2000, on New York; Minton, 2006, on
London). The crux of the matter, in the context of consumerism, is that
while logically it would appear that consumerist spaces need to be public to
facilitate spending, sociologically it is clear that much consumerist space
operates as restricted public space, that is, restricted to those with the
means to buy what is on sale. In his study of Melbourne, Dovey (1999:
187) puts this position quite starkly, arguing that in the thrill of the
skyscraper, public space su¡ers:</p>
      <p>As the corporate towers have replaced our public symbols on the skyline,
so the meaning and the life have been drained from public space. The
degradation of public space encourages its replacement by pseudopublic space
(public access but private control) as part of a slow expropriation of the city.
And in his highly in£uential chapter on ‘Fortress L.A.’, Mike Davis
expounds a characteristic radical history of the struggle over public space,
arguing that the traditional complaints by local liberal intellectuals about
‘anti-pedestrian bias . . . fascist obliteration of street frontage’ miss the
‘explicit repressive intention, which has its roots in Los Angeles’ ancient
history of class and race warfare . . . the fortress e¡ect emerges not as an
inadvertent failure of design, but as a deliberate socio-spatial strategy’ (Davis,
1992: 229). This is evident all the way from people-unfriendly benches and
mega-structures, to the works of Frank Gehry, Disney’s ‘imagineer’ of
urban boosterism. The logical conclusion to this process is the ‘panopticon
mall . . . [surrounded by] belligerent lawns . . . and creating the carceral
city’ (Davis, 1992: 229, ch.4 passim). The dilemma for globalizing urban
growth coalitions in globalizing cities is how to reconcile the maximum
number of shoppers with the fear of undesirables. In many cities the
appeal of the mall is precisely the promise of some protection from urban
crime. Such promise can be built into the design of buildings. For example,
it is di⁄cult to enter the exclusive Daslu department store in Sa‹ o Paulo,
Brazil, on foot ^ the obvious entrances are the parking garages (where
valet parking is about one third of the weekly minimum wage) and the
helipad on the roof (Sa‹ o Paulo, one of the ‘poorest’ cities in the world, is said
to have the highest proportion of private helicopter ownership per capita
of any major city). Restrictions can also be designed into the spaces, for
example not providing comfortable seating, thus discouraging
undesirable elements from lingering. Whatever the contradictions, whatever the
restrictions, there is no doubt that cities all over the world are becoming
more consumerist.</p>
      <p>The clear trend to increasing commercialization of transportation hubs
(especially airports), museums, art galleries, indeed cultural centres of all
types, schools and universities, even some places of worship ^ not to
mention the more obvious examples of the massive rise in the numbers and
scope of malls, theme parks, entertainment spaces and so on (Ritzer, 1999)
^ suggests that a major spatial e¡ect of capitalist globalization is to squeeze
out non-consumerist space and replace it with consumerist space anywhere
that people are likely to gather or pass through. The use of buyer-generated
advertising (wearing and bearing designer labels on clothing and bags,
drink and food containers) on the streets of cities, towns, even villages all
over the world is one highly visible indicator of the colonization of public
space, by the purveyors of the culture-ideology of consumerism. Klein
(2004) elaborates the useful idea of ‘scripted spaces’ from its origins in
architectural illusions in the 16th century, to the present day, labelled the
‘electronic baroque’ of the cinema, amusement parks and all the other
spheres of consumerist space of what has been referred to here as capitalist
globalization. ‘By decoding scripted space, we learn how power was brokered
between the classes in the form of special e¡ects . . . gentle repression
posing as free will’ (2004: 11). Contemporary transnational scripted spaces
can be seen as instruments of class control in terms of the hegemony that
the transnational capitalist class wields through the culture-ideology of
consumerism. This phenomenon reaches its apogee in Las Vegas, a m e¤lange of
globally iconic architecture devoted to the culture-ideology of consumerism
to an almost absurd degree.</p>
      <p>That’s the way Vegas has to work. It plays on instant recognizability. A lot of
people haven’t been to New York, but almost everyone knows its iconic
image [as represented in New York, New York in Las Vegas]. It is more
important that New York looks like the familiar map of the city than the
city itself. (Bailey, quoted in Klein, 2004: 347)</p>
      <p>While there are cases of new iconic buildings creating consumerist
spaces that sit in isolation in marginal areas of cities, or even in the
countryside, it is in global (or better, globalizing) cities that most iconic
architecture is to be found. Sari (2004) identi¢es nine ‘New City Icons’ ^ Taipei
101; The Forum, Barcelona; Burj Al Arab Hotel, Dubai; Selfridges,
Birmingham; Guggenheim Bilbao; Jewish Museum, Berlin; Esplanade,
Singapore; The World Trade Center site, New York; and the Olympic
Stadium in Athens ^ mostly built by architects with global reputations, all
major urban presences and all, with the possible exception of the Jewish
Museum, ¢tting my description of consumerist spaces.</p>
      <p>The unveiling of major works of architecture in emerging cities has
generated enormous publicity for cities such as Dubai, Bilbao and Bei jing.
Aside from the socio-economic impact of such high-pro¢le buildings on the
cities themselves, such iconic architecture puts these cities on the fast track
to join the rankings of well recognized city brands such as New York,
London, Paris, etc. (Sari, 2004: 23)
The vast majority of those active in urban growth coalitions in globalizing
cities believe that the Bilbao e¡ect could work for them, even if they can
a¡ord neither Frank Gehry nor the Guggenheim franchise. Examples can
be cited from cities in all ¢ve continents. In Melbourne:</p>
      <p>A cluster of new civic icons are built or proposed; all marked by a dynamic
aesthetic signifying the state slogan ‘on the move’ . . . The Manhattan
skyline, Westminster, the Ei¡el Tower and the Sydney Opera House set the
standards of urban iconography. Like corporations without logos, cities
without icons are not in the market. (Dovey, 1999: 158^9)13
In Buenos Aires: ‘Transnational corporate elites, international ¢nanciers,
tourists, and the global ‘‘jet-set’’ (los elegantes) create the demand for
advanced infrastructure [read iconic architecture] in Buenos Aires as
elsewhere’ (Keeling, 1996: 205). Keeling provides a timely reminder that the
relationship between iconic architecture and consumerism produces losers
as well as winners. The upper middle class and the elite occupy Barrio
Norte and the northern suburbs, where bankers are linked to global
¢nancial centres, industrialists to foreign franchises and distributorships, and
agriculturalists to export markets. In the rest of the city, the ‘people’ carve
out their living: many fear globalization and the destruction of what makes
Buenos Aires (and thus Argentina) special, though this is often a
Europeanized version of the national identity. The globalizing urban growth
coalition in Salerno, a small rather dilapidated port south of Naples,
recruited experts from the group that had recently revitalized Barcelona to
draw up a ‘programmatic document’ to reinvent Salerno. Zaha Hadid was
employed to design a new ferry terminal (dubbed ‘iconic’) and David
Chipper¢eld to regenerate the historic centre, among many other projects.
According to Burdett, a leading architectural entrepreneur, these projects
have transformed Salerno from an industrial backwater to a city of culture
and tourism. As in Barcelona, a charismatic mayor, pragmatic architects
and commercial interests used iconic architecture to boost the city and a
‘signi¢cant indicator of the success of the operation is that property values in
the city centre have increased sevenfold’ (Burdett, 2000: 100).</p>
      <p>However, it is in Asia that the most spectacular architectural results of
the e¡orts of globalizing urban growth coalitions have occurred. Marshall
explains:
these projects provide two very important global advantages to their host
locations. First they provide a particular type of urban environment where
the work of globalization gets done and second they provide a speci¢c kind
of global image that can be marketed in the global market place. These
projects represent a new way of thinking about the role of planning in the city,
which more than ever is concerned with marketing and the provision of
competitive infrastructure. (2003: 4)
Current developments in Singapore and Bei jing are just two among many.
In Singapore, plans to rebuild the downtown, including iconic projects by
foreign architects, are well under way along with government aspirations to
turn Singapore into a global city for the arts (Chang, 2000; Marshall,
2003: ch. 9). In 2006, an ambitious scheme was announced to build a new
bridge, whose double helix steel structure design will be a ‘world ¢rst’, as
part of a $300 million Urban Redevelopment Authority scheme for the
downtown Marina Bay area. This will provide a walking route linking the
iconic Esplanade cultural complex with a proposed tourist resort and a
Singapore Flyer ferris wheel, copying the success of the Millennium Wheel
in London. Justifying the cost of the project, the National Development
Minister told Parliament that many cities are now ‘building new attractions
and actively marketing themselves . . . No idea is too far-fetched or too
bold’ (Business Times, 2006). Visa, an Esplanade corporate partner,
leveraged the popular image of the building as a durian (a local fruit) in an
advertising campaign, illustrating once again the commercial value of
iconic architecture (see F|gure 5).</p>
      <p>Figure 5 Visa via architecture in Singapore: creating consumerist
space from the durian (2006)</p>
      <p>In Bei jing, Business Improvement Districts were introduced in the
1990s:
the provision of modern infrastructure, high quality shopping facilities, and
the creation of up-to-date business environments . . . generally devised by
downtown business owners with the support of municipal
authorities . . . organized around a set of functions oriented to business people,
commercial tenants, and foreign tourists . . . these simulated downtowns rely on
a spectacular imagery designed to connote sumptuousness and luxury . . .
[demonstrating] the direct in£uence of world capitalism and global
consumerism. (Broudehoux, 2004: 94^5)
What Broudehoux calls the malling of Wangfu jing, the ‘Fifth Avenue of
Bei jing’ and once home of the world’s largest McDonald’s, followed rapidly.
A new Central Business Districts policy permitted the displacement of
McDonald’s (albeit to a site nearby) by the massive Oriental Plaza scheme,
and many others, mostly joint ventures between Hong Kong and Bei jing
developers, with the active participation of the government at city and
national level. ‘The goal was to turn Wangfu jing into an elaborate and
highly e⁄cient machine devoted to a single activity: consumption’
(Broudehoux, 2004: 108).14</p>
      <p>Africa presents a special problem in this context. As the editors of a
comprehensive collection on global cities (Brenner and Keil, 2006: 189)
comment: ‘it appears as if an entire continent has been sidestepped by
contemporary forms of globalization’. However, despite its general position at the
bottom of the global socio-economic hierarchy, similar trends of globalizing
through malling can be observed in the major cities of Africa. South
Africa has many malls, some of them, in mall-speak, of ‘world-class
standard’. In the last few years, the Mlimani City mall in Dar es Salam in
Tanzania, the Lagos Palms mall in Nigeria, and the Accra mall in Ghana
were all marketed as the ¢rst world-class malls in their respective
countries.15
Conclusion
In a work that deserves to be much better known, Bentmann and Muller
(1992, ¢rst published in German in 1970) argued that the rise of the villa
as a building type associated with the name of Andrea Palladio in
16th-century Venice can best be analysed as a form of hegemonic architecture, that
is, architecture that serves class interests. In this article I have tried to
show that most iconic architecture of the global era is also best analysed as
a form of hegemonic architecture, serving the interests of the transnational
capitalist class through the creation of consumerist space or, more
accurately, through the attempt to turn more or less all public spaces into
consumerist space. Just as one can appreciate the aesthetic qualities of the best
Palladian villas while deploring the socio-economic system they promoted
ideologically, one can appreciate the Sydney Opera House or the
Guggenheim Bilbao while deploring the consumerist interests they serve.
Fiske raises a fundamental point, even if in an ironic manner:
The aesthetics of the Manhattan skyline are an aesthetics of capitalism: they
are as ideological as those of the renaissance. The awesomeness of Sears
Tower [in Chicago] is as attractive as that of Chartres Cathedral ^ if one is
to be oppressed one might as well be oppressed magni¢cently; one can
thus participate in one’s own oppression with a hegemonic pride. (1991: 214)
The message in a piece of neon art in a boutique hotel on Rodeo Drive, Los
Angeles ^ ‘visual space has essentially no owner’ ^ expands this sentiment
in the populist mocking democratic rhetoric so vital for the success of the
culture-ideology of consumerism (see F|gure 6).</p>
      <p>Perhaps luxury hotels are not the most sensible sites to engage the
critique of iconic architecture in the service of capitalist consumerism.
Goss (1993) explored the challenging idea that malls should become a
third, public, space after home and work/school. Malls, then, could become
places not only to buy and sell but places with other functions, for example
providing for the educational, cultural, health and child care needs of the
community. Some malls do o¡er some of these facilities in relatively safe
Figure 6 Populist script for a luxury consumerist space: neon
installation from the lobby of the Luxe Hotel, Rodeo Drive, Los
Angeles. Artist: Vincent Wolf (2004)
environments, but most are understandably reluctant to provide anything
for non-shoppers and other types of deviants. Staeheli and Mitchell (2006)
have revisited these issues more recently in terms of the useful distinction
between community and public. In their study of the Carousel Center Mall
and plans for its enormous Disneyesque Destiny, USA complex in
Syracuse, New York, they remind us that malls, in North America at least,
have been sites of struggle over free speech, public access and social services
for decades. However, they argue, malls generally cater for speci¢c
communities, principally of consumers, and their design and regulations are often
biased in terms of class, age, ethnicity and politics. Parallel to the argument
made above that a major spatial e¡ect of capitalist globalization is to squeeze
out non-consumerist space and replace it with consumerist space, radical
critics of malls argue that they squeeze out publics, replacing them with
consumer communities. One of the hegemonic e¡ects of the architecture of
malls, which frequently become endowed with lower-level local iconicity, is
to create a disposition to see these buildings ^ usually characterized by
glass and shiny metal to encourage happy and colourful thoughts of
transparency, openness and light ^ as integral to the pleasures of consumption.
In this process, the costs of the culture-ideology of consumerism, in terms
of debt, addiction, stress, ecological damage and class polarization, are
conveniently hidden.</p>
      <p>It need not always be so. The inspiration that iconic architecture has
provided down the ages often coexisted, albeit uncomfortably, with
unpalatable political and economic systems. But, for change to happen, an
alternative form of non-capitalist globalization is necessary. Under such conditions
a truly inspiring iconic architecture, including existing architectural icons,
may enhance genuinely public spaces in which the culture-ideology of
consumerism fades away and is replaced by a built environment in which the
full array of human talents can be given free rein.</p>
