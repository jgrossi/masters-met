      <abstract>
        <p>Architecture has for many years been of interest to criminology in terms of its role in social control and crime prevention. This article focuses on architecture as reassurance and the specific example of the police station-what is an under-researched topic. Supporting evidence is presented from a study of police stations in three English police forces. The study's aims were modest and exploratory, to draw on theoretical and empirical evidence to consider whether police stations are a worthwhile area of criminological/architectural study, and to investigate the possibility that police stations could contribute to public reassurance. Using the language of semiotics, the article argues that meanings attached to police stations can contribute to reassurance by affecting people's emotive 'readings' of security and safety; yet, to do this, there has to be a rethink for many existing stations in terms of what these buildings communicate. The article adopts an interpretivist view of meaning acknowledging that buildings can mean different things to different people. It is suggested that numerous police stations can be read as intimidating fortresses; many others are secret places; while others are potentially public buildings where the public are welcomed. Implications for a policy of reassurance are discussed in light of the current cuts to police budgets. An agenda for further systematic research is suggested.</p>

      <p>that ‘Police stations are a visible form of reassurance for the public’. In their current
form, this is somewhat optimistic, as not all police stations can be classed as reassuring.
As a way of illustration, the following is taken from an interview on BBC’s The Culture
Show (1 August 2009)  by Denise Mina with the author David Peace. The discussion
was about a setting used for his Red Risdeinrgies of books on the Yorkshire Ripper: the
Millgarth Police Station in Leeds:
Supporting evidence is drawn from a qualitative investigation of police stations in three
English police forces. These were chosen to represent a range of urban and-rural set
tings—the Metropolitan Police, Leicestershire Police and West Mercia Police. As noted,

      <p>For contemporary architecture, how a building is read can be as important as what
it does—for instance, with talk of apartment blocks, hotels, shopping malls and stadia
being iconic, even before they are buJielntc(ks 2005; Sklair 200)6.4 Key proponents of
such representational or ‘iconic’ architecture include Frank Gehry, Daniel Libeskind,

      <p>4Whether the architect or developer can attribute ‘iconic’ status is a moot point, as such a label is only meaningful if it is
earned through interaction with the public.</p>

      <p>The Police Station: Relationships between Building and User
According to the West Mercia Police Estates Manager who was interviewed, their estate
includes ‘headquarters, BCU [Basic Command Unit]; each BCU will have a number
of section stations . . . . And they will then have, yeah, what we’ve broadly described
as Neighbourhood Policing Posts’. Leicestershire Police has a similar structure, with,
according to an Estates Manager interviewed at their headquarters:
about the company. It is more open, more accessible.’ The question is whether this is
possible for a police station.</p>
      <p>According to Home Officgeuidance on Design Quality for Police Buildings(2005: 8),
good police buildings should ‘be a pleasure to use, visit and look at’ and ‘meet public
needs’. In order to achieve this, police buildings must:</p>
      <p>9Those interviewed often spoke of the need to be ‘DDA-compliant’—by having the building fulfil the criteria of the Disability
and Discrimination Act (1995 and 2005) and the Equality Act 2010.
We totally comprehend why communities are so attached to these old buildings, and in a lot of cases,
you know, you have some sympathy with that, of course. But the bottom line has to be that London
has got to be policed in the best possible way, and these older buildings constrain us in doing that,
and so, you know, there comes a point at which you have to say, ‘well, I’m afraid, nostalgi-a, sentimen
tality, really haven’t got a place in this process’.</p>

more unusual and, in times of conflict, securitization provides reassurance for some.
Under more peaceful conditions, this would seem less likely; yet, for many Western
urban centres, terrorism threats have meant that security has become a de-fining dis
course (e.g. Coaffee 200; 0Sorkin 2008; Graham 2010).</p>
      <p>On a more prosaic level, defence can be integral to police stations in orde-r to coun
ter everyday threats. For instance, according to an interviewee from the Metropolitan
Police’s Property Services, the entrance can be designed with security in mind:

      <p>Police Station as Secret
I mean, I went to an old lady’s house a few days ago. She goes to the hairdresser’s next door, and
I said, ‘well actually, next door to where you have your hair done is the police station.’ And although,
I mean, you would think it’s fairly obvious. I suppose that some people have busy lives and, one thing
and another, it’s, you know, how well known is the actual station?

The blue lamp may not be too significant; however, one small design issue that /r
g
could be important is the use of vertical blinds that block the view of the- office inttaUe
rior (clearly shown in Figure 2 for both Warndon and Castle Donington—the photosinv
taken while the stations were open). This at first seems a trivial issue; yet, to return irseto
the criteria for police buildings laid down by the Home Office (2005: 8), the blinds add
e
signal an office space that is the opposite to being ‘accessible, friendly and welcomingeF
to the public’. Furthermore, as Heverin noDtyecsk(hoff 200)9, good public buildings red
a
ought to be characterized by ‘transparency and porosity’. The simple closing of theld
blinds means this is not likely to be how the public ‘read’ the buildings. It is a common eM
problem (see Millie 201).0 isan

There is a dilemma in designing a police station: on the one hand, a station has to be a en
1
hard place, it has to have security and containment, and yet, on the other hand, ther e,2
2
is a softer focus, that it has to be somewhere where the public will want to visit and w105ill
want to report crimes or seek advice, they will want to come in. Furthermore, a police
station needs to be located so that it is accessible to the public. Many ne-w-build sta
tions have been build in out-of-town locations to improve public access by car and to
provide greater parking for police vehicles. One such example is the West Mercia Police
Station at Leominster, opened in 2007 (see Figure 3). The building is ideally located
for vehicular access on an out-of-town industrial park. It is also well signposted. Yet, my
first impression of the new station was its isolation. Not only is architecture important
for creating meaning, but also the building’s spatial context, in this case its location in
a quiet industrial park. By moving away from the town centre, the station also lost the
possibility of being a reassuring presence in the heart of the town.</p>

      <p>For the small market town of Evesham, West Mercia Police took quite a different
approach. Instead of having a dedicated police station, the police have gone into
partnership with the County, District and Town Councils and Job Centre Plus, in
providing a one-stop-shop for the town—the Evesham Community Contact Centre
(see Figure 4). This is a refurbished former magistrates’ court and police station. The
‘back stage’ policing functions are housed in a new building located in the back yard.
However, the ‘front stage’ functions are carried out by counter staff who also deal

The Centre advertises regular opening hours and staffing costs are split between thisde

where, according to the Centre Manager, ‘We have access to their [police] systems asedF

well, so we tend to flick between our own District/County systems and West Mercialra
systems’. If someone wants or needs to speak to a police officer, one can be called from ed
the offices located in the back yard. inM</p>
      <p>As for the design of the Centre, the only indication that it deals with police mattesaGrs
is the traditional blue lamp hung from the outside wall. While exterior signage coulread
be improved, Evesham is an example of creative reinvention of an existing building. iso
Once inside, my impression of the front-counter space was that it was more akin to Jun
contemporary banking practice, more welcoming and softer than a standard police en

I think a lot of people used to find, when they went into the old reception . . . it was just t-he old build
ing, the feeling, you felt almost as if you’d done something wrong as soon as you stepped through the
door, you know?</p>
      <p>The feeling of the new front-counter space is quite different. For instance, there is free
internet access, the space is fully carpeted and access is DDA-compliant (see Figure 4).
This softer approach is also applied to the use of language. For instance, inst-ead of hav
ing ‘interview rooms’, these are labelled ‘meeting rooms’—a simple change that may
make people feel more at ease. Furthermore, the counters only have partial protective
glazing. According to the Manager interviewed, ‘we’ve deliberately gone for no glass;</p>
