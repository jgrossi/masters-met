<bodyText confidence="0.9859048">
In 1993, the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU) was founded by a group of
architects dedicated to “creat[ing] buildings, neighborhoods, and regions that provide a
high quality of life for all residents, while protecting the natural environment” (CNU [13]).
Through the redesign of regions, neighborhoods, and buildings, new urbanists promise
no less than the end of urban sprawl, the recreation of communities, and improvements
in the quality of life (NU [32]). New urbanism has been hailed as the most significant
movement in urban planning and architecture in this century (Fulton [19] and CNU [13]).

Though the movement has drawn criticism from much of the architectural academy, the
ideas behind CNU’s Charter have been gradually integrated into curricula at top planning
and architecture schools. In brief, the principles of new urbanism include high density,
mixed use neighborhoods; convenient public transit, bicycles paths and pedestrian-friendly
street networks; strategically placed open spaces; and architecture designed to foster social
interaction (NU [32]).
While the movement has elicited considerable discussion and debate among urban
planners, urban sociologists, urban geographers, and architects for over a decade, new
urbanism has received little formal analysis. The reasons are twofold. First, new urbanism
is primarily about urban design, which is difficult to quantify and thus poorly suited
for applying formal analytical tools. Second, new urbanism, like its close relative, smart
growth, generally favors the use of government plans and regulations to address an illdefined problem. Thus the movement is unlikely to draw the attention of those who favor
formal analysis.
In this paper we attempt a formal analysis of the virtues of new urbanism. Using
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) we first develop quantitative measures of urban
form; we then incorporate those measures in a hedonic price analysis. In essence, our
research strategy involves the disaggregation of new urbanism into its component parts
and an examination of the implicit prices those parts yield in the market place. We do not
argue that ours is the best approach to assess the contributions of new urbanist designs to
social welfare. Such an examination would require an analysis of social benefits that accrue
to nonresidents of new urbanist communities. We do argue, however, that our approach
advances knowledge about this question both in the measurement of new urbanist features
(or urban form) and in the identification of those features for which homeowners are willing
to pay.
In the analysis that follows, we consider six sets of characteristics that affect the value
of single-family homes: physical housing attributes of the homes, public service levels,
location, amenities and disamenities, socioeconomic characteristics, and new urbanist
design features in the neighborhood. By isolating the effects on price of these variables,
we can estimate the contributions to single-family home values by features of urban form.
We find that our measures of urban form capture meaningful differences in the character of
urban neighborhoods that could well have direct impacts on the utility of urban residents.
Further, we find that such differences are capitalized into residential property values. The
results imply that some but not all of the design features of new urbanism provide benefits
for which urban residents are willing to pay.

2.1. Previous studies on urban form and property values
Ours is not the first study to examine the impacts of urban form or architectural
character on property values. Cao and Cory [12], for example, showed that increasing
industrial, commercial, multi-family and public land uses tend to increase surrounding
home values. They thus concluded that an optimal mix of land use activities should be

sought in locating economic activities into neighborhoods. Guttery [22] examined the sale
prices of 1672 houses located in the Greater Dallas-Fort Worth-Denton metroplex and
found negative impacts from having rear-entry alleyways. Asabere [5] provided empirical
evidence from Halifax, Nova Scotia, which showed that location on a cul-de-sac yields a
29 percent price premium over houses located on a grid street pattern. Benson et al. [9],
Asabere and Huffman [7], and Grudnitski and Do [21] estimated the value of having
scenic views of open space and from locating close to a golf course. Not surprising, they
found that views and neighboring golf course increase property values. Finally, many
have also examined the effects of proximity to transit on property values. Bowes and
Ihlanfeldt [10] incorporated both the direct and the indirect effects of transit stations on
the attractiveness of nearby neighborhoods. They found that stations located away from
downtown have positive impacts on property values. They have also found that there are
negative externalities from location near stations in low-income neighborhoods or close to
downtown.
Other studies have measured the influence of architecture on property value. Asabere
et al. [6] estimated the effect of residential architectural styles on housing prices in
Newburyport, Massachusetts. They found premiums of 14 to 21 percent for four “older
architectural styles,” Colonial, Victorian, Federal, and Garrison, relative to Ranch style.
Moorhouse and Smith [29] explored the effects of a major 19th century American urban
architectural form, the row house. They found that specific architectural features are
more highly valued when they differentiate one row house from its immediate neighbors.
Vandell and Lane [40] estimated the impact of “good architectural design” on the value of
commercial buildings in Boston. They found a strong influence of design on rents and
a weak relationship between vacancies and design quality. Hough and Kratz [24] also
estimated the effect of “good architecture” on commercial rents in Chicago. They found
that tenants are willing to pay a premium to be in new architecturally significant office
buildings, but saw no benefits associated with old office buildings that express recognized
aesthetic excellence.
The studies above notwithstanding, “new urbanism” per se has received little attention
by economists. Recent market research shows that there is a demand for denser, more
walkable residential environments in the United States as a whole, and the growing
demand is a result of changing demographics, changing tastes, and the closing of the
suburban frontier (CNU [14], and Myers and Gearin [30]). Eppli and Tu [17], and Tu
and Eppli [38] are published studies that have examined the premiums captured by new
urbanist developments. They compared the prices of single-family homes in new urbanist
and suburban neighborhoods and found consumers willing to pay a premium for houses
in a new urbanist neighborhood. They did not, however, attempt to isolate which design
elements of a new urbanist neighborhood produced the price premium. The work by
Eppli and Tu presumes that there are only two kinds of neighborhoods: new urbanist and
traditional suburban. In fact there are many different types of neighborhoods with many
different design features, and consumers might have multifaceted housing preferences
(AL [2]). As suggested by Myers and Gearin [30], “Neither traditional neighborhood
design nor conventional suburban development may be the housing consumer’s ideal.
Rather, the ideal home style may be something else and may fall somewhere on the
housing spectrum between there two design alternatives. Similarly, individual household

preferences for a single ideal housing type may in fact include a spectrum of types, united
by key design criteria.”
All together, considerable research suggests that certain elements of urban architectural
style can be capitalized into property values. To date, however, there have been no studies
that have focused on the features of new urbanism to determine if they, in isolation or
combined, affect property values. We attempt to do so here.
2.2. Portland and new urbanism
Portland is Oregon’s largest metropolitan area and has an international reputation as
a leader in battle against urban sprawl.1 In 1991, Metro, Portland’s regional government,
began work on the 2040 Plan. Following the principles of new urbanism, the goals of the
plan include the transformation of the metropolitan area into a multi-nucleated urban form,
the development of a multi-modal transportation system, and the designation of mixed
use regional and town centers (Metro [27], Katz [25], and Calthorpe [11]). The Plan was
approved in 1997 along with its implementation vehicle, the Urban Growth Functional
Plan, which specified binding targets and performance measures for each of the subordinate
cities and counties. Under Metro’s Charter, cities and counties are required to change their
comprehensive plans and subdivision regulations to assure that local plans comply with
the Functional Plan. Armed with this charter, a State mandate to manage Portland’s urban

growth boundary, and a close association with Tri-Met, the regional transit district, Metro
has substantial capacity to implement its new urbanist plan (Metro [28]).
Our study focuses on Washington County, which contains the western portion of the
metropolitan area. As the most rapidly growing of the three counties within Metro’s
jurisdiction, the study area contains the cities of Beaverton, Hillsboro, Tigard, Sherwood,
Tualatin, King City, Cornelius, Forest Grove, and Durham (see Fig. 1).

3.1. Data
Our data come from three primary sources:
(1) The tax assessment files from Washington County;
(2) Regional Land Information System (RLIS) from Portland, Metro; and
(3) Census data from the US Census Bureau.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.964353823529412">
Prior to estimation, invalid transactions and multiple sales were omitted to ensure that
sales reflect market clearing prices,2 and to ensure independent observations. The cleaned
dataset contains 48,070 real estate sales transactions in our study area for the period
January 1990 through December 2000. The average sale price for the eleven-year period is
$177,461, ranging from $50,000 to $916,300.
3.2. Measures of urban form
To begin our analysis, we define several measures of urban form that capture
new urbanist neighborhood characteristics. We first divide the study area into 186
neighborhoods based on census blockgroup boundaries. What constitutes a neighborhood
remains a matter of dispute. Lacking clear theoretical guidance, we explored three datadriven alternatives: census tracts, block groups, and sub-block groups. To choose among
these we computed several measures of urban form for Washington County’s 60 census
tracts, 186 block groups, and 237 sub-block groups (where sub-block groups are formed by
further partitioning block groups by major arterials). Then for each neighborhood (census
tract, block group, and sub-block group), we assigned the age of the neighborhood by the
median “year built” attribute of all single-family units it contained. We then explored, both
visually and statistically, changes in our measures of urban form over time. We found that
neighborhoods defined at the census tract level reveal less about changes in urban form over

the ratio of sale price to assessed value. Transactions that have a sale price that is 60 percent greater than the
assessed value or that is less than 60 percent of the assessed value are deleted from the data set. In addition,
properties with lots greater than two acres, or age older than 80 years are excluded to maintain a homogenous
pool of transactions. Furthermore, we removed the transactions if their assessed value of the land is less than
$1.00 per square foot or the assessed value of the improvements is less than $25.00 per square foot.

time due to aggregation. Neighborhoods measured at the sub-block group level, however,
reveal little more information than those measured at the block group level. Thus we chose
to use block groups as neighborhoods and divided the study area into 186 neighborhoods
for the remaining analysis. We do not argue that census blocks are the best aerial unit for
measuring urban form. We only claim that it is a convenient unit that illustrates the effects
we seek to capture.3
For each block-group “neighborhood” we then computed five sets of urban form
measures.4 Definitions of each variable are provided in Table 1.
3.2.1. Street design and circulation systems
According to critics of sprawl, contemporary suburban developments contain too many
winding streets and cul-de-sacs, blocks that are too big, and road networks that lack
connectivity. According to this point of view, better connectivity leads to more walking and
biking, fewer vehicle miles traveled, higher air quality, and greater sense of community
among residents (Benfield et al. [8]). Our measures of connectivity involve the number
of street nodes and segments, total miles of streets in the neighborhood, the number and
lengths of blocks, the proximity to cul-de-sacs, the lengths of cul-de-sacs, and the distance
between points of access into the neighborhood.5
3.2.2. Density
According to critics of sprawl, contemporary urban development is dominated by
single-family housing on large lots. To such critics, low-density development increases
automobile dependence, consumes excessive farmland, and raises the cost of public
infrastructure (APA [4]). We offer two measures of density: single-family residential (SFR)
dwelling unit density and population density.
3.2.3. Land use mix
According to critics of sprawl, contemporary urban developments are homogeneous
and lack a mix of land uses. To such critics greater mixing of uses facilitates walking and
biking, lowers vehicle miles traveled, improves air quality, and enhances urban aesthetics
(APA [4]). We offer two indices that measure land use diversity within a neighborhood.
Both are based on the concept of entropy—a measure of variation, dispersion or diversity
(Turner et al. [39]). The first measure includes single-family residential use and captures
the overall mixture of land uses. The second measure excludes single-family use and
captures the mixture of land uses in the non-single-family residential sector.

3.2.4. Accessibility
According to critics of sprawl, contemporary urban development is characterized by too
much separation between uses and thus travel distances that are too long (APA [4]). Here

Information System.
5 Street segments are defined by the part of the street between two street nodes. Street nodes are defined as
street intersections, T-sections and street dead ends. For more on connectivity, see Allen [1] and Southworth [37].

we offer three measures of accessibility: distance to commercial uses, distance to a bus
stop, and distance to a public park. Each is measured as the median distance from every
single-family parcel centroid in the neighborhood to the centroid of the nearest commercial
use, bus stop, or public park.
3.2.5. Transportation mode choice
A fundamental element of new urbanism is design that enables transportation mode
choice (Katz [25]). Here we focus on access to Portland’s light rail system. To explore
the effect of accessibility to light rail stations, we proceed by disaggregating the effects of
proximity to the stations into two time periods and by station location. That is, we identified
properties that were located near stations before and after the line went into operation in
downtown Hillsboro, in downtown Beaverton, and in between Hillsboro and Beaverton.
3.2.6. Pedestrian walkability
According to critics of sprawl, contemporary development patterns create great
distances between destinations and thus discourage walking. Pedestrian access encourages
residents to walk, lowers vehicle miles traveled, and improves human health (Frank and
Englke [18]). According to conventional wisdom, pedestrians in the United States are
willing to walk no longer than one-quarter mile (Duany and Plater-Zyberk [16]). Thus
we measure pedestrian walkability as the percentage of single-family homes (again using
lot centroids) that are within one-quarter mile network distance of commercial uses and
bus stops.

To control for the influence on price other than urban form we include five additional
sets of variables. Definitions of each variable are provided in Table 2.
3.3.1. Physical housing attributes
The physical characteristics of a house—such as the number or rooms, quality of
construction, and presence of fireplace, garage, etc.—are widely known to affect its value
(Grether and Mieszkowski [20]). Our data sources do not have complete information on
such attributes. To capture differences in physical attributes we include three variables: lot
size, square feet of floor space, and age of the house.
3.3.2. Public service levels
The value of public services is also widely known to affect housing values (Grether and
Mieszkowski [20]). To capture these effects we include four variables: access to municipal
services (measured as location within an incorporated municipality), the mean SAT score
and student/teacher ratio of the pertinent school district; and the adjusted property tax rate.

4.2. Regression results and implications6
The results of our analysis, including the t-statistics and coefficients of each of the
significant variables, are provided in Table 4.7 The R 2 indicates that we were able to
explain 84 percent of the variation in single-family home prices. Most of the coefficients
have expected signs.

4.2.1. Control variables
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986336545454546">
Property physical housing attributes. As expected, LOTSIZE and FLOORSPACE are
positively related to house price. The expected negative sign of AGE reveals that an older
home is worth less than a newer home, and the positive sign of AGESQUARE indicates that
the relationship between house value and house age is not linear.
Public service levels. Public services are capitalized into property values. As expected,
INCITY is positively related to house price, reflecting the value of services provided by
cities. The expected negative sign of TAXRT reveals that property taxes are capitalized
in property values. The positive sign of SAT and negative sign of STU/TEA indicate
that, as expected, home buyers prefer school districts with higher SAT scores and lower
student/teacher ratios.
Location. Location matters. Negative signs of the variables HILLCBD and PORTCBD,
indicate that housing prices fall with distance from the Portland and Hillsboro CBDs. Since
the CBDs of Portland and Hillsboro are major employment centers, this was expected.
The sign of the variable BEAVCBD, however, is positive. Though not expected, this likely
reflects the character of downtown Beaverton as more of an automobile-oriented retail
center than an employment center.
Amenity and disamenities. Amenities and disamenities affect housing prices as expected.
The positive sign of GOLF is consistent with earlier studies. The positive coefficient
on the binary variable MOUTNVW indicates that a view of the mountains increases
property value. The sign of MINRDDIS has the expected negative sign, indicating
that home buyers pay a premium for the houses with better accessibility to minor
roads.
6 We have also performed the exercise of incorporating spatial effects into our hedonic price structure
explicitly. From a subset of our dataset, the results indicated the presence of spatial error dependence. In other
words, the error term at each location is correlated with values for the error term at other locations. This might be
due to two of following reasons. First, measurement errors are likely to exist and to spill over across the spatial
units since some data are collected and constructed at an aggregate scale. Second, some of the omitted variables,
such as number of rooms, exterior material of the house and other house physical characteristics, are correlated
and this might be another cause for the presence of spatial error dependence. In the presence of spatial error
dependence and spatial heteroskedasticity, OLS estimates are still unbiased (Anselin [3]). Therefore, we present
the results from OLS analysis in the paper.
7 Eleven variables, HILLSC, BEAVSC, TTSC, FGSC, ONWATER, PCTWHITE, MEDINC, Y91, BUSDIS,
HILLAO, BEAVAO, are dropped out from the model.

The binary variables for exposure to traffic characteristics all exhibit the expected
relationships. The negative signs of ONMAJRD and ONLRT indicate that home buyers
pay less for the houses that are within 150 feet of a major road, or 500 feet of the light rail
line for possible noise nuisance effects.
Socioeconomic characteristics. Socioeconomic variables PCTWHITE and MEDINC are
not significant, perhaps due to the lack of variation of race and income in our study area.
The dummy variables that capture the year of sale (with sales in 1990 as the reference
variable) indicate that single-family home prices have been increasing since 1992.
4.2.2. Measures of urban form
Street design and circulation systems. The positive sign of INTCONN indicates that
home buyers pay a premium for an internally connective neighborhood. This is consistent
with the positive sign of STMILE, indicating that people prefer more streets being provided
within a neighborhood. The positive sign of BLOCKS indicates that home buyers prefer to
be located in a neighborhood designed with more blocks per housing unit. This result is
consistent with the negative sign of BLOCKSIZE, which indicates that home buyers pay
a premium for a house located in a neighborhood with smaller blocks. The positive sign
of CULDESAC indicates that home buyers pay more to be located by cul-de-sacs. The
negative sign of LENGTHCDS, however, indicates that people prefer shorter dead-end
streets. The positive sign of EXTCONN indicates that home buyers prefer to be located
in a neighborhood that is less connected to the outside.
Density. The negative signs of both SFRDNSTY and POPDNSTY are consistent with
the previous market surveys which reveal that people prefer neighborhoods with low
population density and low dwelling-unit density.
Land use mix. The negative sign of LUMIX indicates that consumers prefer single-family
residential as the dominant use in the neighborhood. The positive sign of NRMIX further
shows that the other land uses such as multi-family residential, industrial, public, and
commercial uses are preferred to be distributed evenly in the neighborhoods.
Accessibility. The positive sign of COMDIS is unexpected. The plausible explanation might be the nuisance effects brought by general commercial uses exceed the
amenity effects of being closer to commercial uses. PARKDIS has the expected negative sign, indicating that home buyers pay a premium for the houses located closer to a
park.
Transportation mode choice. The effects of proximity to light rail stations on housing
price meet expectations. Properties sold at a higher price after the line was operated in
all three areas: downtown Hillsboro, downtown Beaverton and those between Hillsboro
and Beaverton. Before the line was operational, proximity to the stations had no effect
on property values except for those between Hillsboro and Beaverton. The negative effect
of proximity to stations between Hillsboro and Beaverton before the line was operated
can be explained as follows. Before the light rail stations were constructed, this area

was occupied mainly by vacant green spaces, and underdeveloped rural enclaves without
established single-family neighborhoods. As planned, these areas were targeted for transitoriented redevelopment and increased in value as a result. These findings are consistent
with previous research (Knaap et al. [26]).
Pedestrian walkability. For variables measuring pedestrian walkability to commercial
uses and bus stops, the results are mixed. The positive sign of PEDCOM indicates that
consumers prefer to have more pedestrian accessibility to commercial uses, while the
negative sign of PEDBUS indicates that home buyers do not prefer to be too close to bus
stops.
Additional 11 cross-sectional regressions (results are not presented in this paper) were
run to examine possible variations in the effects of urban form features on housing prices
over time. Similar results to those reported above have been found.
4.3. Evaluating the premium from new urbanist features
To evaluate the premium that home buyers pay for homes in new urbanist neighborhoods
we compute the predicted value of a standardized house in two distinctly different
neighborhoods in the study area (Fig. 2). The first is a hypothetical neighborhood
characterized by the mean values of all the urban form measures in Washington County.
The second is the Orenco Station neighborhood. This neighborhood is located next to an
Intel plant and a light rail line, and has gained a great deal of notoriety as an exemplar
Fig. 2. Forrest Glen (upper) and Orenco Station neighborhood (lower). (The urban form measures of the Forrest
Glen neighborhood approximate the median values of all neighborhoods in the study area.)

of a successful new urbanist development (NAH [31]). The values of the urban form
measures for the hypothetical and Orenco Station neighborhood are highlighted in bold in
Table 5. The data in Table 5 reveal that the hypothetical and Orenco Station neighborhoods
differ significantly in most measures of urban form. Orenco Station has smaller lots, better
internal street connectivity, more and smaller blocks, more streets but shorter cul-de-sacs,
higher population and single-family dwelling unit densities, more mixing of land uses,
better access to parks and commercial areas, more transit mode choices, better pedestrian
walkability to commercial stores and bus stops, but lower external connectivity than the
typical neighborhood. This comparison suggests that our measures of urban form appear

to capture meaningful differences between a typical suburban neighborhood and a highly
touted new urbanist neighborhood.8
We then determine the estimated sale price based on the set of explanatory attributes.
Using the estimated coefficients from the regression model, we convert the unit of measure
to dollars using the following equation:
sale_price = exp βˆ0 + βˆi xi .
(2)
We then compute changes in sale price resulted from one-unit change in one of the
independent variables while holding all other predictors constant. For example, ratio of
the new price to the original price, when x1 is changed to (x1 + 1), can be computed by
exp(βˆ0 + βˆ1 (x1 + 1) + βˆ2 x2 + · · ·)/ exp(βˆ0 + βˆ1 x1 + βˆ2 x2 + · · ·) = exp βˆ1 . This expression
for each independent variable corresponds to the values shown in the second column of
Table 5. The value of premium (or discount) of sale price for a house with an original
price of $150,000, from changing x1 to (x1 + 1) while holding other attributes constant,
can then be computed by (exp βˆ1 − 1) ∗ 150,000. This value for each independent variable

is shown in the third column.9 Using this procedure, we evaluate the premium that home
buyers pay for a house in a new urbanist neighborhood. As discussed above, the fourth
and fifth columns of Table 5 provide the attributes’ values of our two hypothetical singlefamily homes: one in a typical suburban neighborhood and the other in a new urbanist
neighborhood. To calculate the sale prices for our two examples, the values of each of
the attributes are inserted into Eq. (2), and the values of the coefficients are culled from
Table 4. The overall prices for these two examples ($132,731 and $156,986) and the
difference between the two ($24,255) are shown in the last row of Table 5. Following
the above approach, the change in the value of a typical suburban house ($132,731), that
resulted from a change in one attribute from suburban (x1_S ) to new urbanist (x1_NU ), can
be computed by [exp β1 (x1_NU − x1_S ) − 1] ∗ 132, 731. This value for each independent
variable is shown in the last column of Table 5. Our calculations show that a house in a new
urbanist neighborhood, even though it has a smaller lot than one in a typical neighborhood
(3500 square feet vs. 8675 square feet), sells for $156,986—a $24,255 premium over one in
a neighborhood with more conventional suburban attributes.10 The last column of Table 5
further indicates that much of the premium comes from new urbanist features such as more
internally connective street networks, more blocks, more street miles, better pedestrian
access to commercial uses, and proximity to operating light rail stations. The comparison
reveals that, holding other attributes constant, properties located in a neighborhood with
new urbanist features command an estimated 15.5 percent premium.11

5. Conclusions

<bodyText confidence="0.984748">
In this study, we develop several measures of urban form and use them to characterize
various neighborhoods in Washington County, Oregon. We find that the measures capture
meaningful differences in the design character of urban neighborhoods. Our measures
reveal, for example, that new urbanist neighborhoods indeed differ from traditional
neighborhoods in ways that can be measured and used for analysis.12 Further we find
that such differences are capitalized into residential property values. Specifically, we
find that residents are willing to pay premiums for houses in neighborhoods with more
9 First two columns of Table 5 offer additional knowledge of determining implicit value of each independent
variable. For example, for variable FLOORSPACE, β was estimated to be 0.00000126. This number indicates
that people prefer to pay exp 0.00000126 = 1.000306 = 100.0306% of the original house price if the floor space
is increased by 1 square foot; if the original house price is $150,000, consumers pay $48 more.
10 $24,255 is the difference between the overall values of the two houses. It is not calculated by adding up all
the marginal effects in the last column, which would be wrong due to nonlinearity of the exponential.
11 Critics have suggested that the premium resulting from new urbanism development might indeed reflect
higher production costs of construction and highly perceived risks of investment in new urbanism communities
(Rybczynski [35], Gyourko and Rybczynski [23]). To address this issue, analysis can be expanded to a two-stage
estimation using the methodologies provided by Rosen [34]. If we can obtain the production functions for new
urbanist construction, we would be able to estimate the underlying supply and demand functions of new urbanism
development. We leave this for further research.
12 In other papers, for example, we have used these measures to examine changes in urban form over time
(Song and Knaap [36]) and to estimate the effects of urban form on transportation mode choice (Rajamani et al.
[33]).

connective street networks; more streets, shorter dead-end streets; more and smaller blocks;
better pedestrian accessibility to commercial uses; more evenly distributed mixed land
uses in the neighborhood; and proximity to operating light rail stations. We also find
residents are willing to pay less for houses in neighborhoods that are dense, contain more
commercial, multifamily, and public uses (relative to single-family uses), and contain
major transportation arterials.
When combining these features in composite sketches of new urbanist and traditional
neighborhoods, we find that homes in a new urbanist neighborhood command an aggregate
price premium. What is more, we find that this premium more than compensates for
the severe price discount for the small size of new urbanists lots. Much of the premium
comes from improvements in internal connectivity that stem from smaller blocks, and
shorter streets. Some of the premium also stems from lesser external connectivity, or
greater transport isolation. Some of the premium also comes from pedestrian accessibility
to commercial uses—even though those uses are not valued in the neighborhood. It is
dangerous, of course, to generalize from the attributes of a single new urbanist development
as other developments that could be described as new urbanist could well differ in character
a great deal from Orenco. But the Orenco example supports previous research that new
urbanist neighborhoods do provide a price premium.
More importantly, our results show that the price premium, or discount, of any particular
neighborhood depends on the particular design characteristics it has to offer. In short,
design matters. Further, though the price of a single-family home is difficult to predict,
the statistical relationships among design characteristics and 48,000 sales observations are
robust and compelling. Based on market signals, the results suggest that the virtues of
new urbanist neighborhoods include enhanced internal connectivity, improved pedestrian
access to commercial uses, better transit access, and less external connectivity. The
detractions of new urbanist neighborhoods include, higher densities, greater mixture of
land uses, and smaller lots.
