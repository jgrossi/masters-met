modern urbanism

Despite the fact that sporting spaces reflect key shifts in thinking about
town planning, sports architecture is still an underexplored area in the
historiography of urban design. The architects, engineers and designers
attempting to regenerate and rejuvenate cities after World War II were
aware of the popular interest in competitive sports. Stadia and landscape
design were intended to help erase the negative urban images of
nationalism and totalitarianism. By starting a dialogue with the past,
town planners questioned the grandeur and monumentalism prevalent
in architecture since the late nineteenth century. They sought to rediscover
and redefine the modern.
One of the key moments in the post-war concepts of Olympic urbanism
was therefore a new understanding of modernity in landscape and urban
design. Under the conditions of the Cold War, however, architecture had
a special political and ideological impact.1 On the one hand, parks and
stadia were seen as icons of newborn societies, signifying a break with the
recent past and undesirable national traditions. The sports architecture
often dominated the urban landscape, changing the look of the city. On
the other hand, they were supposed to symbolize the superiority of the
culture which created them. Thus, urban and landscape design had a social
impact within the boundaries of the state in which they appeared but also
functioned as spaces of international communication. It is crucial to reveal
the complex backgrounds of how the stadia and sports complexes were
written into the topographies of major cities.2 Furthermore, we should
examine within a global context the architectural means by which planners
sought to represent effective images of a modern ‘democratic’ or ‘socialist’

Every society produces its own space and uses it in its own way.
The Marxist sociologist Henri Lefebvre criticized Soviet urban planners,
arguing that they failed to produce a ‘socialist space’, just reproducing
the modernist model of urban design: ‘Change life! Change Society! These
precepts mean nothing without the production of an appropriate space.
A lesson to be learned from the Soviet constructivists of 1920–30, and
from their failure, is that new social relationships call for a new space,
and vice versa.’4 When exploring the changes in urban landscapes after
World War II, we should therefore pay attention to national and regional
differences. Nevertheless, fashions and ideas were being communicated all
over the world faster than ever before. Thinking of landscapes as mirrors of
the Zeitgeist compels historians of architecture and urban design to clarify
the extent to which regional adaptations were based on international trends
or local customs.5
¨
Alexandra Kohring’s
article deals with a turning point in Soviet
architecture, i.e. the replacement of the monumental style of the
Stalin era by the so-called ‘socialist democratic’ style of the 1950s.
¨
Kohring
analyses the interrelationship between aesthetic considerations,
programmatic claims, political ambitions and ideological framework
using the example of the building of the Luzhniki sports complex in
Moscow. Her story of how the paradigm of urban transformation was
fundamentally changed under the conditions of late Stalinism, the death
of the dictator in 1953 and the Khrushchev ‘thaw’, covers the development
of the prototype of a young ‘sporting city’ combining elements of
natural landscape, garden architecture and standardized (‘industrialized’)
buildings (stadium, training grounds, facilities).
The article by Kay Schiller and Chris Young also examines a change
in post-war architectural concepts, but a decade later in the 1960s and in
connection with the forthcoming ‘mega-event’ of the Munich Games in
1972. The concept of a landscape in motion was suitable for the spectacle
of the Munich Games, as well as for everyday life after the Olympics, and
can be regarded as a reflection of a broader ‘discourse on democracy’.
But what seems to be a concept of an open and transparent, informal and
well-organized public park could also be a means of camouflaging the
architects’ past-political and ideological conflicts.
Christian Tagsold’s article examines modernity as a concept in constant
flux. He makes this evident by analysing the spatial model and
architectural design of the Tokyo Olympics in 1964. Starting from the
assumption that the Olympics were a symbol of modernity, Tagsold
discusses the peculiarities of his case. Japan, as a ‘reborn’ nation was
confronted by the lasting legacy of the ‘ultra-nationalist disaster’, the
ruling conservatism and the burden of the Tenno monarchy. The sports
spectacle served as a rite of passage into modernity. The Games bridged the

psychological gap between Hiroshima and the Olympics of 1964, becoming
a powerful reflection of the ‘new’ Japan and its fundamentally transformed
capital.
All three articles are concerned with special cases of modernist sports
architecture and landscape design at different stages of the Cold War. In
their consideration of the political character of major urban projects, the
authors show that spatial practices, rhetorical inscriptions and symbolic
meanings played a fundamental role in reshaping post-war society,
ideological frameworks and everyday life.
However, what at first glance seems to be similar or even the same –
sports as a catalyst of modernizing processes – had a different impact on
the various societies and acted in different ways and directions. Under the
conditions of post-war reconstruction, Cold War policy and superpower
relations, sport became a crucial field of cultural transfer and a dynamic
force of (inter)nationalism; as part of the reciprocal exchange of modes
and styles, it was a competition in architecture and counter-architecture,
a building and design race. Thus, the question is whether the sports
terminology served merely as a means of communication or as a key
code to get through the outer layers into a deeper understanding. If
modernity is actually a comparative framework,6 was sports architecture
a driving force of internationalism? A modern design could also be used as
‘ideological hairdressing’ or as the newspeak of modernity, a lingua franca
of (inter)nationalism, a translation from inferiority into superiority, i.e. for
the styling and shaping of societies in transition.
The three articles rest on the assumption that by virtue of their
provisional character parks, landscapes and gardens belong to sports
micro-history. This means that the authors are looking at very specific
instances of design (or the lack thereof) at particular moments in time.
They are seeking to find out the values and ideas which a particular
architect, designer or engineer, a state, party or local official, or a pressure
group, institution or individual sought to impress upon the landscape
and the planned building ensemble. They describe and illustrate the
individual layout of each sports park but give only limited information
about its uses and interpretations. Consequently, we now know more about
intentions and motivations than about changing perceptions and practices.
What about ‘euphoric’ visitors, young sportsmen and sportswomen, what
about emotions and atmosphere, what about the feeling of ‘harmony’
and ‘beauty’ in parks and stadia? The ways in which the consumers
interacted inside the park and stadium, and whether they were indeed
playing the game according to architects’ and designers’ ideas, also need
further examination. The planned sports festivals and the Olympic Games

could change into a carnival of the people, and subcultures could evolve
in the spaces of official culture.
A subject of further comparative investigation might be the biographies
of the fascinating architects, engineers and scientists Kenzo Tange (1913–
2005), Aleksandr Vlasov (1900–62), Otl Aicher (1922–91) and Guenther
Grzimek (1915–96). We should learn more about their professional ethos
and their Weltanschauung in more detail. Did they act as individualists or
as executors of a collective will? The careers of these architects seem to
be good examples of the continuity of modernist ambitions to redefine
technocratic dreams as well as of the ambiguous meanings of modernity
and modern sports.
More comparative work on the history of sports architecture, urban
planning and landscape design is needed. The three articles cover different
yet intertwining periods from the 1920s to the 1960s. It could be useful
to think in terms of the interdependence of successive or synchronic
socio-cultural and political crises and an increased interest in new
concepts of space and architectural solutions among different social forces.
Playgrounds, the stadium or whole ensembles of sports arenas, facilities
and landscapes served as places of social transformation dissolving the
boundaries between the actors and the spectators, social classes and ethnic
groups. However, the unification of them into a collective body was by no
means the end of the story. As the articles show, modern sports architecture
and concepts of space generate complex collective identities as well as
individualistic modes of behaviour. Modern sports could function in a
cohesive as well as in a disintegrating way.
The decision to obtain the status of a sports superpower or to host the
Olympic Games obviously had a deep impact on the history of the Cold
War as well as on the individual countries. By studying the history of
sports architecture, landscape design and Olympic urbanism we gain new
and original insights into the transformation of post-war societies.
