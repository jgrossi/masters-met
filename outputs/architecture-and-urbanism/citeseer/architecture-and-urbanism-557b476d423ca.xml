			<abstract>
				<p>This article makes part of a series of conceptual papers to continue the discussion about how architecture and urbanism interact with climate, in tropical regions. Students engaged in normal courses of architecture in tropical regions, particularly in South America, develop their knowledge based on concepts generated in the developed countries—usually related to cold environments. Consequently, these students acquire wrong ideas about urban design of open spaces. Integrating urbanism and climate in tropical countries is still very incipient as an approach and many lecturers reject it, since they prefer to continue with a more formal one, dictated by most of the dominant countries. The herein paper underlines several different concepts and perspectives that separate the two conceptions, leading to a reflection about the subject.</p>

The main changes that urban design should go through are unnoticed in the work of a designer—since his/her theoretical concepts about shape, esthetics, and landscaping have been elaborated without considering local climate and, consequently, without considering the needs of the users, either. As European open spaces need protection against cold winds as well as to take advantage of solar radiation and of low sky luminance, the different climatic conditions in the tropics should be considered for still very incipient (see for example Ref [9]).

In case the vehicles’ circulation is very intense during all the day, the wind will follow the traffic flow up to the third floor level. But, two factors dissuade the use of these air currents: the intense noise and the air mass pollution [20]. Therefore, dwelling apartments should be located over the third floor. The orientation of streets and urban ways must take into account the local solar trajectories and the principal frequencies of winds. It is strongly unadvisable to design East-West straight streets, because they cause visual discomfort in the early morning and in late afternoon and extreme thermal discomfort near noon.3 5.

The width of the open space, the kind of soil covering, vegetation, and type and shape of the closing surfaces determine the air movement [22]. In terms of spaces where people traverse with great intensity, it is fundamental to have control over the incident solar energy, which besides promoting thermal comfort will help to prevent skin cancer. It is possible to take actions to deal with direct and diffuse radiation (obstructing it with different kinds of a coverage) and/or the reflected radiation (obstructing it by confinement or by modifying adjacent spaces) in order to reduce their incidence over pedestrians.

The direct sprinkling of water on people’s skin raises the comfort sensation. However, this is only true for those persons whose skin have been moistened with droplets; for others, whose skin has not been moistened, the discomfort sensation becomes worse because of the higher air relative humidity. This situation makes it difficult to evaporate transpiration—the most significant way to lower the skin temperature in the tropics. Shadow and fountains may have a fundamental importance in the dry tropics [23], or in regions with long periods of dryness. In relation to the latter, there are many microclimates with these characteristics in the Brazilian central plateau and in the northeast regions. In these cases, the adoption of an urban design that changes the features with the season’s changes is recommended.

The security measures for the users of these open spaces will be the same in the tropics, but the effects that control the thermal comfort must be the opposite: the wind must be directed to people instead of protecting people from it, to improve the comfort sensation. The induced air movement, if correctly used, could carry an additional comfort lowering the temperature of surrounding surfaces in the adjacent spaces.
