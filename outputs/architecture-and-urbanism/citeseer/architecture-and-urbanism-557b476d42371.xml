			<abstract>
				<p>In this paper, we attempt a formal analysis of the virtues of new urbanism, a movement hailed as the most significant movement in urban planning and architecture in this century. We proceed using the tools of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to develop quantitative measures of urban form. We then incorporate those measures in a hedonic price analysis. We find that our measures of urban form capture meaningful differences in the characters of urban neighborhoods that could well have direct impacts on the utility of urban residents. Further, we find that such differences are capitalized into residential property values. The results imply that some but not all of the design features of new urbanism provide benefits for which urban residents are willing to pay.</p>

The work by Eppli and Tu presumes that there are only two kinds of neighborhoods: new urbanist and traditional suburban. In fact there are many different types of neighborhoods with many different design features, and consumers might have multifaceted housing preferences (AL [2]). As suggested by Myers and Gearin [30], “Neither traditional neighborhood design nor conventional suburban development may be the housing consumer’s ideal. Rather, the ideal home style may be something else and may fall somewhere on the housing spectrum between there two design alternatives. Similarly, individual household Y. Song, G.-J.

First, measurement errors are likely to exist and to spill over across the spatial units since some data are collected and constructed at an aggregate scale. Second, some of the omitted variables, such as number of rooms, exterior material of the house and other house physical characteristics, are correlated and this might be another cause for the presence of spatial error dependence. In the presence of spatial error dependence and spatial heteroskedasticity, OLS estimates are still unbiased (Anselin [3]).

Street design and circulation systems According to critics of sprawl, contemporary suburban developments contain too many winding streets and cul-de-sacs, blocks that are too big, and road networks that lack connectivity. According to this point of view, better connectivity leads to more walking and biking, fewer vehicle miles traveled, higher air quality, and greater sense of community among residents (Benfield et al. [8]). Our measures of connectivity involve the number of street nodes and segments, total miles of streets in the neighborhood, the number and lengths of blocks, the proximity to cul-de-sacs, the lengths of cul-de-sacs, and the distance between points of access into the neighborhood.5 3.2.2. Density According to critics of sprawl, contemporary urban development is dominated by single-family housing on large lots. To such critics, low-density development increases automobile dependence, consumes excessive farmland, and raises the cost of public infrastructure (APA [4]). We offer two measures of de</context>

Portland and new urbanism Portland is Oregon’s largest metropolitan area and has an international reputation as a leader in battle against urban sprawl.1 In 1991, Metro, Portland’s regional government, began work on the 2040 Plan. Following the principles of new urbanism, the goals of the plan include the transformation of the metropolitan area into a multi-nucleated urban form, the development of a multi-modal transportation system, and the designation of mixed use regional and town centers (Metro [27], Katz [25], and Calthorpe [11]). The Plan was approved in 1997 along with its implementation vehicle, the Urban Growth Functional Plan, which specified binding targets and performance measures for each of the subordinate cities and counties. Under Metro’s Charter, cities and counties are required to change their comprehensive plans and subdivision regulations to assure that local plans comply with the Functional Plan. Armed with this charter, a State mandate to manage Portland’s urban Fig. 1. Portland metropolitan area and study area.1 For more discussion on Metro, see Song and Knaap [36]. 222 Y. Song, G.-J.

Introduction In 1993, the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU) was founded by a group of architects dedicated to “creat[ing] buildings, neighborhoods, and regions that provide a high quality of life for all residents, while protecting the natural environment” (CNU [13]). Through the redesign of regions, neighborhoods, and buildings, new urbanists promise no less than the end of urban sprawl, the recreation of communities, and improvements in the quality of life (NU [32]). New urbanism has been hailed as the most significant movement in urban planning and architecture in this century (Fulton [19] and CNU [13]). * Corresponding author.

They found that tenants are willing to pay a premium to be in new architecturally significant office buildings, but saw no benefits associated with old office buildings that express recognized aesthetic excellence. The studies above notwithstanding, “new urbanism” per se has received little attention by economists. Recent market research shows that there is a demand for denser, more walkable residential environments in the United States as a whole, and the growing demand is a result of changing demographics, changing tastes, and the closing of the suburban frontier (CNU [14], and Myers and Gearin [30]). Eppli and Tu [17], and Tu and Eppli [38] are published studies that have examined the premiums captured by new urbanist developments.

Introduction In 1993, the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU) was founded by a group of architects dedicated to “creat[ing] buildings, neighborhoods, and regions that provide a high quality of life for all residents, while protecting the natural environment” (CNU [13]). Through the redesign of regions, neighborhoods, and buildings, new urbanists promise no less than the end of urban sprawl, the recreation of communities, and improvements in the quality of life (NU [32]). New urbanism has been hailed as the most significant movement in urban planning and architecture in this century (Fulton [19] and CNU [13]). * Corresponding author.

It is not calculated by adding up all the marginal effects in the last column, which would be wrong due to nonlinearity of the exponential. 11 Critics have suggested that the premium resulting from new urbanism development might indeed reflect higher production costs of construction and highly perceived risks of investment in new urbanism communities (Rybczynski [35], Gyourko and Rybczynski [23]). To address this issue, analysis can be expanded to a two-stage estimation using the methodologies provided by Rosen [34]. If we can obtain the production functions for new urbanist construction, we would be able to estimate the underlying supply and demand functions of new urbanism development. We leave this for further research. 12 In other papers, for example, we have used these measures to examine changes in urban form over time (Song and Knaap [36]) and to estimate the effects of urban form on transportation mode choice (Rajamani et al.

Keywords: New urbanism; Housing price; Urban form; Quantitative measures 1. Introduction In 1993, the Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU) was founded by a group of architects dedicated to “creat[ing] buildings, neighborhoods, and regions that provide a high quality of life for all residents, while protecting the natural environment” (CNU [13]). Through the redesign of regions, neighborhoods, and buildings, new urbanists promise no less than the end of urban sprawl, the recreation of communities, and improvements in the quality of life (NU [32]). New urbanism has been hailed as the most significant movement in urban planning and architecture in this century (Fulton [19] and CNU [13]). * Corresponding author.

Recent market research shows that there is a demand for denser, more walkable residential environments in the United States as a whole, and the growing demand is a result of changing demographics, changing tastes, and the closing of the suburban frontier (CNU [14], and Myers and Gearin [30]). Eppli and Tu [17], and Tu and Eppli [38] are published studies that have examined the premiums captured by new urbanist developments. They compared the prices of single-family homes in new urbanist and suburban neighborhoods and found consumers willing to pay a premium for houses in a new urbanist neighborhood. They did not, however, attempt to isolate which design elements of a new urbanist neighborhood produced the price premium.

To such critics greater mixing of uses facilitates walking and biking, lowers vehicle miles traveled, improves air quality, and enhances urban aesthetics (APA [4]).
