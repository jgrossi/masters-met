				<p>This article explores the theoretical and substantive connections between iconicity and consumerism in the field of contemporary iconic architecture within the framework of a critical theory of globalization. Iconicity in architecture is defined in terms of fame and special symbolic/aesthetic significance as applied to buildings, spaces and in some cases architects themselves. Iconic architecture is conceptualized as a hegemonic project of the transnational capitalist class. In the global era, I argue, iconic architecture strives to turn more or less all public space into consumerist space, not only in the obvious case of shopping malls but more generally in all cultural spaces, notably museums and sports complexes. The inspiration that iconic architecture has provided historically generally coexisted with repressive political and economic systems, and for change to happen an alternative form of non-capitalist globalization is necessary. Under such conditions truly inspiring iconic architecture, including existing architectural icons, may create genuinely democratic public spaces in which the culture-ideology of consumerism fades away. In this way, a built environment in which the full array of human talents can flourish may begin to emerge. Key words consumerism j globalization j iconic architecture j shopping j transnational capitalist class T HIS ARTICLE sets out to explore the theoretical and substantive connections between iconicity and consumerism in the ¢eld of contemporary architecture. It does this within the framework of a theory of globalization. For the sake of clarity in understanding what is to follow , each of these concepts ^ iconicity, consumerism, globalization ^ requires at the very least a brief working de¢nition.</p>

For stadia and airports, ‘spending time’ is literally two to four hours. The latest high-pro¢le project of HOK Sports with Foster +Partners is Wembley Stadium in London, whose original twin towers, known to football fans all over the world, have been replaced by an already globally recognizable iconic arch, images of which adorn myriad publicity materials, directional signs on all the highway approaches to the stadium, and the cover of the semi-o⁄cial publication Wembley Stadium: National Icon (Barclay and Powell, 2007). This two-way process whereby deliberately iconic architecture and enhanced consumerism of sports stadia feed into one another is also evident in the case of museums.

In this article I have tried to show that most iconic architecture of the global era is also best analysed as a form of hegemonic architecture, serving the interests of the transnational capitalist class through the creation of consumerist space or, more accurately, through the attempt to turn more or less all public spaces into cons</context>

Among many clear and already well-researched examples of this phenomenon two stand out: ¢rst, what has been termed the Bilbao e¡ect, referring to the continuing in£uence of Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim Bilbao (Del Cerro Santamaria, 2007: ch. 6; McNeill, 2000); and, second, the case of the foreign architects, notably Herzog and de Meuron, Rem Koolhaas and Paul Andreu, designing iconic structures in the build-up to the Beijing Olympics (Broudehoux, 2004: ch. 6; Ren, forthcoming).6 140 Theory, Culture &amp; Society 27(5) at UNIV FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS on June 12, 2015tcs.sagepub.comDownloaded from Cosmopolitan iconic architects are now an essential element in the marketing strategies of globalizing urban growth coalitions.

From its roots as a city icon for Sydney, promoted as a national icon for Australia, to eventual canonization as a UNESCO World Heritage listed building ^ one indicator of global iconicity ^ the Sydney Opera House has become one of the best-known buildings in the world. It is, arguably, the gold standard against which the attempt to manufacture iconic architecture in the global arena is measured. The clients of the Guggenheim Bilbao are widely reported to have cited it in these terms ( Jencks, 2005) and in her discussion of the project to build a new National Theatre in Bei jing, Broudehoux (2004: 227) asserts: The theatre was to become an emblem of late twentieth-century modernity and a deserving symbol of China which could attract worldwide recognition and compete as a visual icon with structures such as the Sydney Opera House or the Grande Arche in Paris. A spokesperson for the federal arts minister commented on the ongoing process to upgrade the Opera House: ‘The Federal Government acknowledges the icon status of the Sydney Opera House, not just as a building in the hearts of all Australians but as a world-recognised symbol of Australia’ (Sydney Morning Herald, 2007).11A manifesta</context>

According to Burdett, a leading architectural entrepreneur, these projects have transformed Salerno from an industrial backwater to a city of culture and tourism. As in Barcelona, a charismatic mayor, pragmatic architects and commercial interests used iconic architecture to boost the city and a ‘signi¢cant indicator of the success of the operation is that property values in the city centre have increased sevenfold’ (Burdett, 2000: 100). However, it is in Asia that the most spectacular architectural results of the e¡orts of globalizing urban growth coalitions have occurred.

While Hannigan’s idea of ‘fantasy city’ (1998) is something of an exaggeration, there is no doubt that his triad of shopertainment, eatertainment and edutainment, added to the architainment of Fernandez-Galiano (2000) noted above, is a key component of the mix intended to turn cities that were once centres of productive labour into sites devoted to the culture-ideology of consumerism.

The use of computers to help design and build extraordinary architecture started with what may be called the ¢rst architectural icon of the global era ^ the Sydney Opera House ^ whose tortuous building process lasted from 1957 to 1973, surviving the resignation of the architect, Jorn Utzon, in 1966.

And in his highly in£uential chapter on ‘Fortress L.A.’, Mike Davis expounds a characteristic radical history of the struggle over public space, arguing that the traditional complaints by local liberal intellectuals about ‘anti-pedestrian bias . . . fascist obliteration of street frontage’ miss the ‘explicit repressive intention, which has its roots in Los Angeles’ ancient history of class and race warfare . . . the fortress e¡ect emerges not as an inadvertent failure of design, but as a deliberate socio-spatial strategy’ (Davis, 1992: 229). This is evident all the way from people-unfriendly benches and mega-structures, to the works of Frank Gehry, Disney’s ‘imagineer’ of urban boosterism. The logical conclusion to this process is the ‘panopticon mall . . . [surrounded by] belligerent lawns . . . and creating the carceral city’ (Davis, 1992: 229, ch.4 passim). The dilemma for globalizing urban growth coalitions in globalizing cities is how to reconcile the maximum number of shoppers with the fear of undesirables.

It must be said that this much-used but monolithic distinction is not as simple as it sounds, because much public space has been e¡ectively privatized and some private space has been made public (Kayden, 2000, on New York; Minton, 2006, on London). The crux of the matter, in the context of consumerism, is that while logically it would appear that consumerist spaces need to be public to facilitate spending, sociologically it is clear that much consumerist space operates as restricted public space, that is, restricted to those with the means to buy what is on sale. In his study of Melbourne, Dovey (1999: 187) puts this position quite starkly, arguing that in the thrill of the skyscraper, public space su¡ers: As the corporate towers have replaced our public symbols on the skyline, so the meaning and the life have been drained from public space.The degradation of public space encourages its replacement by pseudopublic space (public access but private control) as part of a slow expropriation of the city. And in his highly in£uential chapter on ‘Fortress L.A.’, Mike Davis expounds a characteristic radical history of the struggle over public space, arguing that the traditional complaints by local</context>

The Manhattan skyline, Westminster, the Ei¡el Tower and the Sydney Opera House set the standards of urban iconography. Like corporations without logos, cities without icons are not in the market.

Recognition of the outline of a building, especially in a skyline, is one of the great signi¢ers of iconicity, Manhattan being the most famous example. In the pages of the in£uential Harvard Design Magazine, this phenomenon is termed architainment. ‘Theme parks and art museums are increasingly joined by upscale retailers [and top-end boutique hotels] as patrons of high-pro¢le architecture’ (Fernandez-Galiano, 2000: 37). Branches of the luxury goods chain LVMH by the trendy French architect Christian de Portzamparc, Prada by Rem Koolhaas, and the Royalton and Paramount hotels designed by the even trendier Philippe Starck (all in Manhattan) are but the most sparkling pinnacles of this global consumerist iceberg.

Globalizing Cities and Consumerist Space Consumerist space can be de¢ned as space in which users are encouraged and provided with opportunities to spend money, in contrast to non-consumerist space, that does neither. While Hannigan’s idea of ‘fantasy city’ (1998) is something of an exaggeration, there is no doubt that his triad of shopertainment, eatertainment and edutainment, added to the architainment of Fernandez-Galiano (2000) noted above, is a key component of the mix intended to turn cities that were once centres of productive labour into sites devoted to the culture-ideology of consumerism.

The ideal is to construct a narrative which draws the shopper through maximum consumption opportunities. (This idea is revisited below in the context of Klein’s analysis of ‘scripted spaces’).There are, of course, some commercial constraints on mall architects and developers, notably the imperative of maximizing revenues for every available unitof retail space, but apart fromthis there areplentyofopportunities for ingeniousdesigners tobuildvarious forms of iconicity intomalls at scales from neighbourhood to regional, aspiring national (as in Mall of America) as well as the globalizing.W</context>

Perhaps luxury hotels are not the most sensible sites to engage the critique of iconic architecture in the service of capitalist consumerism. Goss (1993) explored the challenging idea that malls should become a third, public, space after home and work/school. Malls, then, could become places not only to buy and sell but places with other functions, for example providing for the educational, cultural, health and child care needs of the community.

Although she uses di¡erent terms, Juliet Schor (see Holt, 2005) expresses very well the view of consumerism assumed here.While I share her emphasis on producerism, I would explain it as a direct consequence of how the major transnational corporations operate. My argument in what follows assumes that capitalist globalization and the culture-ideology of consumerism are unsustainable in the long run, due to the crises of class polarization and ecological stress (see Sklair, 2002: 48^57 and passim). 2.

An outstanding example is the Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai, designed by Atlans &amp; Partners, a distinguished regional practice (also iconized in Sari, 2004). This hotel complex, with its distinctive Arab dhow shape, is only the best-known of many self-proclaimed ‘iconic’ architectural features that have turned Dubai into a new wonder of the (consumerist) world.10 Of the major architect^developers of the global age, John Portman (e.g. his Peachtree Center in Atlanta and Westin Bonaventure in Los Angeles; see Jameson, 1991; Portman and Barnett, 1976) and John Jerde (e.g. his Bellagio in Las Vegas, Mall of America in Minneapolis and waterside projects in Fukuoka; see Jerde, 1999; Klein, 2004) have made the iconic atrium integral to the culture-ideology of consumerism. For shopping malls, boutiques and hotel resorts the connection between iconic architecture and consumerism is quite obvious, at least at the local level, but it is not so obvious with respect to other types of architectural icons, especially in the ¢eld of culture (performance spaces, especially sports stadia and museums).

In some special cases, for example, the debate over the redevelopment of the World Trade Center after 9/11, such coverage spills over onto the front pages and moves up the media news agendas (see ‘Iconic Media Wars’ in Jencks, 2005: 64^99). In Glasgow Charles Rennie Mackintosh and in Barcelona Antoni Gaudi are now part of the marketing of the cities. There are more architects working outside their places of origin than ever before, and demand for ‘foreign’ architects ^ especially from urban growth coalitions in globalizing cities (urban boosters) ^ has never been greater. Among many clear and already well-researched examples of this phenomenon two stand out: ¢rst, what has been termed the Bilbao e¡ect, referring to the continuing in£uence of Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim Bilbao (Del Cerro Santamaria, 2007: ch. 6; McNeill, 20</context>

The clients of the Guggenheim Bilbao are widely reported to have cited it in these terms ( Jencks, 2005) and in her discussion of the project to build a new National Theatre in Bei jing, Broudehoux (2004: 227) asserts: The theatre was to become an emblem of late twentieth-century modernity and a deserving symbol of China which could attract worldwide recognition and compete as a visual icon with structures such as the Sydney Opera House or the Grande Arche in Paris.

Iconic architecture, at least at the local urban level, is the sine qua non for this. This raises the issue of the relations between public and private space and, more pointedly, the very survival of genuine public space in our cities (Herzog, 2006). It must be said that this much-used but monolithic distinction is not as simple as it sounds, because much public space has been e¡ectively privatized and some private space has been made public (Kayden, 2000, on New York; Minton, 2006, on London). The crux of the matter, in the context of consumerism, is that while logically it would appear that consumerist spaces need to be public to facilitate spending, sociologically it is clear that much consumerist space operates as restricted public space, that is, restricted to those with the means to buy what is on sale.

Thus, iconic architecture becomes easily, if sometimes expensively, available for globalizing cities everywhere. Much contemporary architecture, like much of contemporary life, is unthinkable in the absence of the electronic revolution ^ the ¢rst criterion of generic globalization. The postcolonial revolution has had profound e¡ects on architecture, urbanism and identity all over the world. At one level, this continues the long-standing arguments about cultural imperialism. King (2004) makes the connections between postcolonialism and globalization directly, demonstrating that, despite obvious disparities in power, these relations are rarely in one direction. This is particularly true in the special, though not so uncommon, circumstance of ‘Western’ architects building for governments or other clients in what used to be called the Third World.

The use of buyer-generated advertising (wearing and bearing designer labels on clothing and bags, drink and food containers) on the streets of cities, towns, even villages all over the world is one highly visible indicator of the colonization of public space, by the purveyors of the culture-ideology of consumerism. Klein (2004) elaborates the useful idea of ‘scripted spaces’ from its origins in architectural illusions in the 16th century, to the present day, labelled the ‘electronic baroque’ of the cinema, amusement parks and all the other spheres of consumerist space of what has been referred to here as capitalist globalization. ‘By decoding scripted space, we learn how power was brokered between the classes in the form of special e¡ects . . . gentle repression posing as free will’ (2004: 11).

The Opera House could not have been built without computers.

Many celebrated living architects readily accept that they could not have made their most famous designs without the help of CAD.

For shopping malls, boutiques and hotel resorts the connection between iconic architecture and consumerism is quite obvious, at least at the local level, but it is not so obvious with respect to other types of architectural icons, especially in the ¢eld of culture (performance spaces, especially sports stadia and museums).

And yet the metaphor is both attractive and common precisely because it does convey and construct a knowledge of consumerism. (Fiske, 1991: 13) Ritzer (1999: ch.1) takes this further, and though he does not speakof transnational social spaces, his theory of consumption as enchantment clearly has a universal reach.Whatever themerits of the enchantment thesis, this approach does draw welcome attention to the architecture of places, metaphorical or literal cathedrals where consumption happens. An apt illustration of this process is the way in which pre-global era iconic buildings ^ often traditionally surrounded by sellers of relics etc. ^ have become increasingly commercialized in recent years, usually in the interests of tourism and city-marketing</context>

The clear trend to increasing commercialization of transportation hubs (especially airports), museums, art galleries, indeed cultural centres of all types, schools and universities, even some places of worship ^ not to mention the more obvious examples of the massive rise in the numbers and scope of malls, theme parks, entertainment spaces and so on (Ritzer, 1999) ^ suggests that a major spatial e¡ect of capitalist globalization is to squeeze out non-consumerist space and replace it with consumerist space anywhere that people are likely to gather or pass through. The use of buyer-generated advertising (wearing and bearing designer labels on clothing and bags, drink and food containers) on the streets of cities, towns, even villages all over the world is one highly visible indicator of the colonization of public space, by the purveyors of the culture-ideology of consumerism.

(Bailey, quoted in Klein, 2004: 347) While there are cases of new iconic buildings creating consumerist spaces that sit in isolation in marginal areas of cities, or even in the countryside, it is in global (or better, globalizing) cities that most iconic architecture is to be found.

The architect explained that after the success of HOK’s Stadium Australia for the Sydney Olympics he decided to focus exclusively on sports and leisure architecture because this is the building type that most touches the hearts and minds of the common man. ‘As symbols of a region or a nation, as icons of popular culture, stadia are never viewed in isolation . . . [they] are vigorously competing for praise and attention with their counterparts elsewhere’ (in Sheard, 2001: xiv) and identi¢ed with popular aspirations. These ‘New Cathedrals of Sport’ are ‘multi-experience venues fully tuned into the digital age’ ^ circumlocutions signalling the culture-ideology of consumerism. Sheard goes on to philosophize on sports architecture, a philosophy grounded with a healthy dose of commercialism: beyond its physical presence, the stadium also provides a tangible focus for community consciousness and social bonding, a place representing urban pride, a place in which one feels part of something important, a place to share and enjoy with one’s neighbours.

As capitalism globalizes, and the culture-ideology of consumerism begins to take hold, iconic architecture starts to be used in more deliberate ways to transform the built environment, particularly in globalizing cities.

As capitalism globalizes, and the culture-ideology of consumerism begins to take hold, iconic architecture starts to be used in more deliberate ways to transform the built environment, particularly in globalizing cities. With the emergence and development of computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), qualitatively new patterns of production in architecture and engineering are rapidly disseminated.Tombesi (2001), for example, shows how technological innovations, particularly in the realm of computer software and increasing availability of hardware, have promoted a new international division of labour between architectural o⁄ces in the First World and in the ThirdWorld, and Chung et al. (2001) vividly illustrate how this works in China. The use of computers to help design and build extraordinary architecture started with what may be called the ¢rst architectural icon of the global era ^ the Sydney Opera House ^ whose tortuous building process lasted from 1957 to 1973, surviving the resignation of the </context>

However, in recent years the connections between shopping, consumerism and iconic architecture have been driven much more by boutiques than by malls.This is best illustrated by the relationship between Prada and its architects of choice, notably Rem Koolhaas, Herzog and de Meuron, and Kazua Se jima, all of whom have designed deliberately iconic stores for Prada in globalizing cities. Vlovine (2003), in an article on the new Prada store in Tokyo, designed by Herzog and de Meuron (the architects of the Tate Modern in London), quotes theCEOofthe company: ‘Architecture is the same as advertising forcommunicating thebrand.’Onthe$40millionPradastoreinManhattan,Ockmanwrites: The ingenious transformation of commercial into cultural space on which Koolhaas has persuaded his client to bank here is fraught with risks . . .

For a chilling expose¤ of the conditions under which those who build such buildings labour in Dubai (and elsewhere), see Human RightsWatch (2006). 11. This repeats almost word for word the citation when Jorn Utzon won the Pritzker Prize in 2003. 12. In a letter dated 10 April 1954 to Harry Guggenheim (nephew of Solomon, the original benefactor of the museum, who died in 1949) about the new director of the Guggenheim, Frank LloydWright presciently observed: ‘Sweeney wants to run a museum-business’ (Wright, 1986: 201). 13. This whole chapter (Dovey, 1999: ch. 11) is very instructive, particularly the Leunig anti-icon cartoon reproduced in Figure 11.7 (1999: 169). 14. Referring to another massive mall in the area, Broudehoux (2004: 113) observes: While Sun Dong An’s interior design conforms to the sleek signature style of international shopping malls, the exterior architecture of the building is a super¢cial attempt to integrate the building into the local urban landscape by cloaking it under a familiar guise.

First, the two Guggenheims and many other successful museums have unusual sculptural qualities: people visit them to see the museums themselves, as much as and sometimes rather more than the art inside. Second, as argued above, museums ^ like all cultural institutions ^ have become much more commercialized in the global era. Most new museums today have larger shops and a greater variety of art and architecture-related merchandise and spaces for refreshment than was the case 50 years ago (Zukin, 1995). A ubiquitous feature of the remodelling of old museums is the addition of consumerist spaces (Harris, 1990). ‘Remarkably, the key performance indicator of retail sales per square foot is higher in MoMA’s museum stores than inWalmart’ (Evans, 2003: 431). A further illustration of this is the monumental advertising of extended opening hours for the Prado in Madrid, ¢ghting o¡ competition from the more modernist Reina So¢a and Thyssen museums, nearby (see F|gure 4). Similarly, consumerist refurbishment of the Victoria and Albert in London led to the jibe, or maybe it was an advertising slogan, </context>
