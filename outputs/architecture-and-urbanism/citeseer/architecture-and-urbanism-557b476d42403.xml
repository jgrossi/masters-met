			<abstract>
				<p>Architecture has for many years been of interest to criminology in terms of its role in social control and crime prevention. This article focuses on architecture as reassurance and the specific example of the police station—what is an under-researched topic. Supporting evidence is presented from a study of police stations in three English police forces. The study's aims were modest and exploratory, to draw on theoretical and empirical evidence to consider whether police stations are a worthwhile area of criminological/architectural study, and to investigate the possibility that police stations could contribute to public reassurance. Using the language of semiotics, the article argues that meanings attached to police stations can contribute to reassurance by affecting people's emotive 'readings' of security and safety; yet, to do this, there has to be a rethink for many existing stations in terms of what these buildings communicate. The article adopts an interpretivist view of meaning acknowledging that buildings can mean different things to different people. It is suggested that numerous police stations can be read as intimidating fortresses; many others are secret places; while others are potentially public buildings where the public are welcomed. Implications for a policy of reassurance are discussed in light of the current cuts to police budgets. An agenda for further systematic research is suggested.</p>

Background: Police Stations and a Search for Meaning Architecture has been an important consideration for criminology, most notably as an element of social control (e.g. Foucault 1977; Cohen 1985; Armstrong and McAra 2006), or as aid for crime prevention (e.g. Jeffery 1971; Newman 1972; Hopper and Droge 2005).

The academic literature has considered the functioning of police stations—albeit rarely—with important contributions being Holdaway’s (1980; 1983) participant observations and Waddington’s (1999) research into police canteen sub-culture.

As noted, buildings can mean different things to different people and so an interpretivist view of semiotics is adopted, that reading architecture is subjective. While (most) architecture communicates function, how this function is read can vary. Furthermore, other meanings are read informed by individual experience and expectation. For some, emotional responses to buildings are viewed in terms of topophilia or ‘love of place’ (Bachelard 1969; Tuan 1974). For others (e.g. Thrift 2004; Kraftl and Adey 2008), it makes sense to focus on affect; POLICE STATIONS, ARCHITECTURE AND PUBLIC REASSURANCE 1095 at U niversidade Federal de M inas G erais on June 12, 2015 http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/ D ow nloaded from as Thrift (2004: 57) has put, it: ‘Cities may be seen as rolling maelstroms of affect.

Leicestershire Police has a similar structure, with, according to an Estates Manager interviewed at their headquarters: You’ve got your headquarters . . . your BCU, your Basic Command Unit . . . and then below that you have your local policing unit, so your LPUs, and then we would have the smaller sort of beat offices, the sort of more Neighbourhood Policing Offices. With this variety in mind, what is a police station? Buildings can be conceptualized as a series of spaces and an understanding of space is clearly important to architectural theory (e.g. Bachelard 1969; Hillier and Hanson 1984; Lefebvre 1991). For instance, buildings are divided into spaces that have different access, functions or normative rules and expectations. Buildings also sit within wider spaces with which they interact, affecting emotional responses and semiotic meaning attributed to them. Drawing on Goffman’s (1969) dramaturgical perspective, Holdaway (1980) described the police station as a divide between ‘front stage’ and ‘back stage’ spaces. The back stage consists of all non-public functions such as offices, custody suite, canteen, locker rooms, meeting/ interview rooms and so </context>

Stations are also built for varying purposes ranging from shop-front offices through to divisional headquarters. It is debatable whether all these buildings communicate the same meaning. In Britain, the recent political context for police stations has been the emergence of PFI, the New Labour Government’s endorsement of design quality through the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE),8 the introduction of a design review process and the general promotion of ‘better public buildings’ (DCMS 2000; CABE 2006). Good design was seen to be ‘about providing buildings and spaces that are fit for purpose, built to last and lift your spirits’ (CABE 2006: 4), and both CABE and the Home Office provided project ‘enablers’ to help public bodies achieve this. Yet, despite greater emphasis on design quality, having a new-build police station was no guarantee of architectural quality. For instance, according to a member of the Home Office Design Policy Team: It’s true to say that some forces, I think, don’t give enough thought to getting the right architects.

The author David Peace asked ‘have you ever seen a police station that wasn’t intimidating?’ Yet, there are stations that appear welcoming and, at a time of budget cuts, a policy of police station closure might be short-sighted. By taking seriously meanings attached to stations, and by learning from good practice, it would be possible to facilitate a shift in how policing is understood and acted out within communities. For CABE (2006: 4), a prerequisite for good public buildings is that they can ‘lift your spirits’. This has to be possible for police stations, which could then emerge as symbols of reassurance in the community. This is surely preferable to stations as symbols of control and intimidation. What is now needed is research that considers the views of police station architects. More importantly, the next stage would be to consult the views of the public on police stations as fortress, secret or as public buildings, and whether stations can be reassuring and ‘lift your spirits’.

On a more prosaic level, defence can be integral to police stations in order to counter everyday threats. For instance, according to an interviewee from the Metropolitan Police’s Property Services, the entrance can be designed with security in mind: . . . in London, the traditional police station was built with steps up to the front door and it was designed for three bodies to stand next to each other to stop the drunken hordes on a Friday night going up the stairs.

So it’s really trying to establish how you balance those two conflicting issues together, isn’t it? There is a clear need for security for those working at the police station; yet, security does not have to compromise reassurance. Spaces outside the police station have also got security considerations. For instance, according to a representative of Metropolitan Police Resource Management, ‘ideally, we like a certain amount of stand-off around a building, obviously, because you need that to ensure the security of the site’. Since Irish terrorist attacks on London in the 1990s (Coaffee 2000), and the more recent al-Qaeda-linked bombings of July 2005, the capital has witnessed increased securitization (Coaffee et al. 2009), especially surrounding selected high-profile targets—including ‘high-profile’ police stations and other police buildings (such as New Scotland Yard). A further example of ‘police station as fortress’ is provided by Loughborough Police Station in Leicestershire. The station is at the end of a long, straight cul-desac on the periphery of the town centre—a building of nondescript modernist construction best described as a box with a large radio mast on top (see Fi</context>

Much emphasis has been on prison as exemplar of controlling or disciplining architecture, but other institutions are similarly there to control and this is expressed in their architecture; as Foucault (1977: 228) famously put it: ‘Is it surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, barracks, hospitals, which all resemble prisons?’ Maybe some police stations can be added to this list. Drawing on Foucault (1977), Bentham’s (1791) panoptic prison is sometimes seen as an ultimate expression of social control and has been used by some as a metaphor for CCTV surveillance (see Coleman and McCahill 2011) and for wider aspects of security and surveillance (Davis 1990).

Drawing on Foucault (1977), Bentham’s (1791) panoptic prison is sometimes seen as an ultimate expression of social control and has been used by some as a metaphor for CCTV surveillance (see Coleman and McCahill 2011) and for wider aspects of security and surveillance (Davis 1990). Transferring this to the police station, the result is the station as secure fortress designed to provide the police with maximum security and surveillance of the community. In the UK, this model was most dramatically realized with the bunkering and securitization of Northern Ireland’s police stations during the ‘troubles’. The public face of the stations was high-security walls and watch towers—what Olley (2007) has called ‘the castles of Ulster’.11 It was an aesthetic of security, confrontation and dominance rather than being ‘accessible, friendly and welcoming’—or, to use Ellin’s (1997) w</context>

An example is in banking, where historically the building has communicated an aesthetic of ‘solidity, wealth and respectability’ (Doyle 2004: 84), often through use of neoclassical styles. Similarly, a well-designed retail shop front blurs boundaries between shop and street and is characterized by ‘transparency and porosity’ so as to entice the passing shopper and make them feel welcomed and at ease. A simple example is given by Doyle (2004: 84) of a shop that repositioned its entrance from the side to the front of the building: ‘After the renovations, the store proudly welcomed its customers through large double doors positioned centrally to the front of the shop.

The blue lamp may not be too significant; however, one small design issue that could be important is the use of vertical blinds that block the view of the office interior (clearly shown in Figure 2 for both Warndon and Castle Donington—the photos taken while the stations were open). This at first seems a trivial issue; yet, to return to the criteria for police buildings laid down by the Home Office (2005: 8), the blinds signal an office space that is the opposite to being ‘accessible, friendly and welcoming to the public’. Furthermore, as Heverin notes (Dyckhoff 2009), good public buildings ought to be characterized by ‘transparency and porosity’. The simple closing of the blinds means this is not likely to be how the public ‘read’ the buildings. It is a common problem (see Millie 2010). Police Station as Public Building There is a dilemma in designing a police station: on the one hand, a station has to be a hard place, it has to have security and containment, and yet, on the other hand, there is a softer focus, that it has to be somewhere where the public will want to visit and will want to report crimes or seek advice, they will want to come in.

Evidence is presented that, for quite a few police stations, architecture and design seem to conspire to make the public a low priority rather than a central requirement; and, in some cases, the buildings appear to be designed to repel the public rather than to reassure. Yet others are more promising and are buildings where the public might be more welcome. Background: Police Stations and a Search for Meaning Architecture has been an important consideration for criminology, most notably as an element of social control (e.g. Foucault 1977; Cohen 1985; Armstrong and McAra 2006), or as aid for crime prevention (e.g. Jeffery 1971; Newman 1972; Hopper and Droge 2005).

(Markus 1993: 30) Examples of architecture as power can include certain religious buildings, factories and schools that express power through building material, choice of architectural style, ornamentation or their size. Victorian municipal buildings, courthouses, prisons and principle railway stations were similarly designed with power in mind. Power was expressed through not only architecture, but also building use and location which dominated local—and sometimes national or even global—physical and psychic landscapes (Foucault 1977; Markus 1993). Power is important for police stations and, as shall be discussed, they can be very intimidating places. For the design of police stations, some power is clearly held by the architect, but more so by those doing the commissioning in outlining various requirements that have to be adhered to (this may or may not be influenced by public consultation).3 To quote Gottdiener: The production of buildings always involves an articulation between the instrumentality of power and/or profit taking and aesthetic design practises that express the sign function of the producers.

These aspects are considered in turn, before conclusions are drawn on the prospects for truly public and reassuring police stations. Police Station as Fortress As noted, criminology has long been interested in social control aspects of architecture. Much emphasis has been on prison as exemplar of controlling or disciplining architecture, but other institutions are similarly there to control and this is expressed in their architecture; as Foucault (1977: 228) famously put it: ‘Is it surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, barracks, hospitals, which all resemble prisons?’ Maybe some police stations can be added to this list.

Under more peaceful conditions, this would seem less likely; yet, for many Western urban centres, terrorism threats have meant that security has become a defining discourse (e.g. Coaffee 2000; Sorkin 2008; Graham 2010). On a more prosaic level, defence can be integral to police stations in order to counter everyday threats. For instance, according to an interviewee from the Metropolitan Police’s Property Services, the entrance can be designed with security in mind: . . . in London, the traditional police station was built with steps up to the front door and it was designed for three bodies to stand next to each other to stop the drunken hordes on a Friday night going up the stairs.

Furthermore, is a police station characterized by ‘transparency and porosity’ possible? The academic literature has considered the functioning of police stations—albeit rarely—with important contributions being Holdaway’s (1980; 1983) participant observations and Waddington’s (1999) research into police canteen sub-culture. Furthermore, McLaughlin (2008) has considered police station closure in the context of performance management. There have been a few policy reports on the police estate (Audit Commission 1999; Home Office 2005) and a small study by the Institute for Public Policy Research (Rogers and Houston 2004).

There have been a few policy reports on the police estate (Audit Commission 1999; Home Office 2005) and a small study by the Institute for Public Policy Research (Rogers and Houston 2004). There has been no independent academic research on the importance—or otherwise—of police station architecture and design. This article is a small step in addressing this omission. The focus is on emotive communication and responses to police stations. According to Bahn (1974), police–public reassurance is all about feelings, defining reassurance as ‘the feeling of security and safety that a citizen experiences when he sees a police officer or patrol car nearby’ (Bahn 1974: 340). More recently, Innes and c</context>

According to Home Office guidance on Design Quality for Police Buildings (2005: 8), good police buildings should ‘be a pleasure to use, visit and look at’ and ‘meet public needs’. In order to achieve this, police buildings must: • be accessible, friendly and welcoming to the public, including the disabled,9 balancing openness and security taking account of the threat level • help the public feel protected and that the police are part of their community [and] • help the police to feel proud of their service. (Home Office 2005: 8) Within this list, how the public and the police ‘feel’ is clearly important. Yet, there are seemingly conflicting meanings attributed to police buildings which need to be ‘friendly and welcoming’, but also signifying ‘security’, protection at the same time as being ‘part of their community’. What’s more, the buildings need to be something of which the police feel proud. Further requirements are for ‘having the right site’ and for being ‘operationally efficient’. It is an ambitious list. For the police station to be a reassuring presence in the community, the criteria of being ‘accessible,</context>

The blue lamp may not be too significant; however, one small design issue that could be important is the use of vertical blinds that block the view of the office interior (clearly shown in Figure 2 for both Warndon and Castle Donington—the photos taken while the stations were open). This at first seems a trivial issue; yet, to return to the criteria for police buildings laid down by the Home Office (2005: 8), the blinds signal an office space that is the opposite to being ‘accessible, friendly and welcoming to the public’. Furthermore, as Heverin notes (Dyckhoff 2009), good public buildings ought to be characterized by ‘transparency and porosity’. The simple closing of the blinds means this is not likely to be how the public ‘read’ the buildings. It is a common problem (see Millie 2010).

Keywords: architecture, police stations, reassurance, semiotics Introduction Over the past decade, there have been calls for British policing to be a more reassuring presence in the community (Innes 2007; Millie and Herrington 2005; Millie 2010). ‘Reassurance policing’ was born as an approach to encourage positive encounters between police and public and to foster greater police ‘visibility, accessibility and familiarity’ (Povey 2001: 17). One way the police could achieve this was to respond positively to populist calls for ‘more bobbies on the beat’ and, by 2008, dedicated Neighbourhood Policing Teams were allocated across the whole of England and Wales (HMIC 2008).

According to Bahn (1974), police–public reassurance is all about feelings, defining reassurance as ‘the feeling of security and safety that a citizen experiences when he sees a police officer or patrol car nearby’ (Bahn 1974: 340). More recently, Innes and colleagues have focused on semiotic communication—on what crimes and disorders signal to communities, and whether police officers provide reassurance by acting as signals of control. According to Innes (2007: 135), the police have ‘an important role to play not just in making people safe but in making them feel safer also’. Reassurance is thus associated people’s subjective feelings of order and security/fear of crime. Public confidence in the police is assumed to improve if these feelings are addressed through increased visibility, accessibility and familiarity (Millie and Herrington 2005).

But there is a—maybe still vague— suspicion that representation is back. (Hirsch 2006: 19) For contemporary architecture, how a building is read can be as important as what it does—for instance, with talk of apartment blocks, hotels, shopping malls and stadia being iconic, even before they are built (Jencks 2005; Sklair 2006).4 Key proponents of such representational or ‘iconic’ architecture include Frank Gehry, Daniel Libeskind, 3Theoretically, power is held by the electorate and the elected government in dictating the type of policing the country has and the finances available to deliver that policing. 4Whether the architect or developer can attribute ‘iconic’ status is a moot point, as such a label is only meaningful if it is earned through interaction with the public.

With this variety in mind, what is a police station? Buildings can be conceptualized as a series of spaces and an understanding of space is clearly important to architectural theory (e.g. Bachelard 1969; Hillier and Hanson 1984; Lefebvre 1991). For instance, buildings are divided into spaces that have different access, functions or normative rules and expectations. Buildings also sit within wider spaces with which they interact, affecting emotional responses and semiotic meaning attributed to them. Drawing on Goffman’s (1969) dramaturgical perspective, Holdaway (1980) described the police station as a divide between ‘front stage’ and ‘back stage’ spaces. The back stage consists of all non-public functions such as offices, custody suite, canteen, locker rooms, meeting/ interview rooms and so on (not all stations will have all these </context>

It is quite possible that some police stations have an anaesthetic quality. Thus, how we read architecture is subjective and we can have different interpretations. Yet, these interpretations are influenced by a number of factors, not least the power dynamics of architecture, building use and the position of reader as powerful or powerless, as Markus (1993) has put it: A building’s form, function and space each has meanings in the field of social relations, each is capable of signifying who we are, to ourselves, in society and in the cosmic scheme of things. And each speaks of both power and bond relations. (Markus 1993: 30) Examples of architecture as power can include certain religious buildings, factories and schools that express power through building material, choice of architectural style, ornamentation or their size.

For the Metropolitan Police, the emphasis was on replacing the old with new facilities that are seen to fit contemporary models of policing (MPS and MPA 2007; 2010), such as with improved parking facilities and at locations away from town centres with easier access to faster roads—the old town centre stations being replaced by smaller neighbourhood bases. The older buildings can be highly valuable real estate; yet, the closure of town centre stations that are familiar landmarks to the public is controversial. According to McLaughlin (2008: 266), at fault is an emphasis on police performance management which has ‘systematically disassembled the “structures of feeling” and traditions associated with the Dixonian policing model [and] this includes the asset stripping of multi-functional “blue lamp” police stations’. 9Those interviewed often spoke of the need to be ‘DDA-compliant’—by having the building fulfil the criteria of the Disability and Discrimination Act (1995 and 2005) and the Equality Act 2010.

Implications for a policy of reassurance are discussed in light of the current cuts to police budgets. An agenda for further systematic research is suggested. Keywords: architecture, police stations, reassurance, semiotics Introduction Over the past decade, there have been calls for British policing to be a more reassuring presence in the community (Innes 2007; Millie and Herrington 2005; Millie 2010). ‘Reassurance policing’ was born as an approach to encourage positive encounters between police and public and to foster greater police ‘visibility, accessibility and familiarity’ (Povey 2001: 17). One way the police could achieve this was to respond positively to populist calls for ‘more bobbies on the beat’ and, by 2008, dedicated Neighbourhood Policing Teams were allocated across the whole of England and Wales (HMIC 2008). However, by 2010, the political and fiscal climate had changed, with demands for budgetary cuts and reductions in police numbers (HMIC 2011; Millie and Bul</context>
<context citStr="Millie and Herrington 2005" endWordPosition="1115" position="7204" startWordPosition="1112">40). More recently, Innes and colleagues have focused on semiotic communication—on what crimes and disorders signal to communities, and whether police officers provide reassurance by acting as signals of control. According to Innes (2007: 135), the police have ‘an important role to play not just in making people safe but in making them feel safer also’. Reassurance is thus associated people’s subjective feelings of order and security/fear of crime. Public confidence in the police is assumed to improve if these feelings are addressed through increased visibility, accessibility and familiarity (Millie and Herrington 2005).

It is acknowledged that improvements to police stations will only be one aspect of a policy of reassurance. If reassurance is to mean more than image management, then perhaps it ought to be integral to all policing activity, from call handling and media and internet presence through to the policing of marginal groups and public order. As an officer working on a strategy trial of ‘reassurance policing’ put it, it ought to be a golden thread running through all policing (Millie and Herrington 2005: 54). Reassurance is clearly not a priority when certain populations are disproportionately policed, or when there is police corruption. Fundamental changes in such policing styles and attitudes may have a bigger impact on reassurance. However, a refocus on police stations as a reassuring presence in the community can only help with such a policy—and is an area of policy and academic enquiry that has been largely overlooked. In this article, examples of fortress-like police stations have been given with the result that the police can be ‘read’ as an intimidating presence in the community, rat</context>

Yet others are more promising and are buildings where the public might be more welcome. Background: Police Stations and a Search for Meaning Architecture has been an important consideration for criminology, most notably as an element of social control (e.g. Foucault 1977; Cohen 1985; Armstrong and McAra 2006), or as aid for crime prevention (e.g. Jeffery 1971; Newman 1972; Hopper and Droge 2005). Both aspects are relevant here; however, this article develops the idea of architecture as reassurance. Key to this are emotional responses and meanings attached to police stations. Semiotics is a useful way to try to understand sign-values of buildings. It is a (post)structuralist idea which Eco (1979: 7) defined as ‘concerned with everything that can be taken as a sign’. As noted, buildings can mean different things to different people and so an interpretivist view of semiotics is adopted, that reading architecture is subjective.

In the police station context, perception can be influenced by how a building is experienced or how its occupants are viewed. If the police are viewed as repressive, then the police station may be viewed as repressive, no matter what architectural style. Police (mis)conduct will also have a bearing on how the police are ‘read’. From recent British history, the cases of Stephen Lawrence (Foster et al. 2005) and Ian Tomlinson (Greer and McLaughlin 2012), and the alleged police corruption that has emerged from the Leveson inquiry into press standards (Nicoll 2011), may all have an influence on individuals’ images of the police, perhaps more so than any official attempts at ‘reassurance’. The article is structured as follows. After describing the methodology, meanings attached to architecture are examined with particular focus on the police station. Relationships between buildings and users are considered and how buildings are divided into different spaces, with particular reference to Holdaway’s (1980) notion of ‘front stage’ and ‘back stage’ spaces within the police station.

Transferring this to the police station, the result is the station as secure fortress designed to provide the police with maximum security and surveillance of the community. In the UK, this model was most dramatically realized with the bunkering and securitization of Northern Ireland’s police stations during the ‘troubles’. The public face of the stations was high-security walls and watch towers—what Olley (2007) has called ‘the castles of Ulster’.11 It was an aesthetic of security, confrontation and dominance rather than being ‘accessible, friendly and welcoming’—or, to use Ellin’s (1997) words, an architecture of fear. And, for places outside the gaze of the watch towers, CCTV, checkpoints and military patrols filled many of the gaps in what Azaryahu (2000) has described for the Israeli context as an all-encompassing securityscape.

The academic literature has considered the functioning of police stations—albeit rarely—with important contributions being Holdaway’s (1980; 1983) participant observations and Waddington’s (1999) research into police canteen sub-culture. Furthermore, McLaughlin (2008) has considered police station closure in the context of performance management. There have been a few policy reports on the police estate (Audit Commission 1999; Home Office 2005) and a small study by the Institute for Public Policy Research (Rogers and Houston 2004). There has been no independent academic research on the importance—or otherwise—of police station architecture and design. This article is a small step in addressing this omission. The focus is on emotive communication and responses to police stations. According to Bahn (1974), police–public reassurance is all about feelings, defining reassurance as ‘the feeling of security and safety that a citizen experiences when he sees a police officer or patrol car nearby’ (Bahn 1974: 340).

The police estate does not enjoy—nor necessarily need—such high-profile architects; yet, what a police station means is still an important consideration and, with some encouragement, police stations might more easily represent ‘reassurance’. According to an interviewee from the Metropolitan Police’s Public Services Construction, ‘if we raise the profile of buildings, we could raise our presence in the community and raise public reassurance’. Rogers and Houston (2004) took the view that the traditional station was already a signal of reassurance: ‘The familiar town centre police station was designed to make the police force both visible and legible. It was an effective symbol of security and order’ (Rogers and Houston 2004: 4). Yet, in Britain, the police estate comprises a ragtag collection of architectural styles, for example, including: • Victorian gothic revival (e.g. Blyth, Northumbria Police, 1896); • art deco (e.g. Bishopsgate, City of London, 1939); • post-war modernism (e.g. Paddington Green, Metropolitan Police, 1971); • post-modern5 (e.g. Bolton</context>

I am a great believer in flair, and I feel that we’ve lost flair at the moment’. This Station Manager makes an important point: that the solution does not have to be disposal or demolition—that, with the right designers/architects on board, existing structures can be reinvented. That said, some stations would require a lot of reinvention. For instance, according to a public respondent in the IPPR study (Rogers and Houston 2004: 2), ‘I think they’ve designed it [the police station] on purpose to be as impersonal as possible. It’s not a friendly place’. Another respondent commented about visiting a station: ‘I feel like I was being punished as well.’ For police stations to contribute to public reassurance, such sentiments ought to be taken seriously. 13Although their locations might still be less than ideal.

You can go out there and get an architect by whatever means, you know, perhaps you know somebody, Yellow Pages, or whatever. But part of the role of the enabler is to ensure that there is a robust process towards engaging the right architect. 5Postmodern architecture is generally associated with eclecticism, pastiche and parody (see Rose 1991). The Bolton police station, and other stations built for Greater Manchester Police under PFI (including Salford, Horwich, Ashton-under-Lyme and Heywood), are of similar style and have in common a circular glass-block stairwell with the police blue lamp perched on top. The comical positioning of the blue lamp seems a postmodern statement referencing the blue lamp that sat atop historic police boxes.

But there is a—maybe still vague— suspicion that representation is back. (Hirsch 2006: 19) For contemporary architecture, how a building is read can be as important as what it does—for instance, with talk of apartment blocks, hotels, shopping malls and stadia being iconic, even before they are built (Jencks 2005; Sklair 2006).4 Key proponents of such representational or ‘iconic’ architecture include Frank Gehry, Daniel Libeskind, 3Theoretically, power is held by the electorate and the elected government in dictating the type of policing the country has and the finances available to deliver that policing. 4Whether the architect or developer can attribute ‘iconic’ status is a moot point, as such a label is only meaningful if it is earned through interaction with the public.

It is quite possible that some police stations have an anaesthetic quality. Thus, how we read architecture is subjective and we can have different interpretations. Yet, these interpretations are influenced by a number of factors, not least the power dynamics of architecture, building use and the position of reader as powerful or powerless, as Markus (1993) has put it: A building’s form, function and space each has meanings in the field of social relations, each is capable of signifying who we are, to ourselves, in society and in the cosmic scheme of things. And each speaks of both power and bond relations.
