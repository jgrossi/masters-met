				<p>Privately built satellite cities are becoming an increasingly common urban development concept in peri-urban areas of Southeast Asian cities. While these projects are beginning to receive academic attention, the majority of studies have a limited capacity to explain why and how they are produced. Most satellite cities built in the past five years have some degree of foreign influence from other East Asian countries in terms of invested capital, planning concepts or urban design and architecture. The majority of this influence originates from within the East Asian region. This paper argues that an investigation which incorporates both the relational and the territorial can increase an understanding of the production of satellite cities. This argument is illustrated with empirical research on two satellite city projects in Phnom Penh, Cambodia: one by a Korean developer and another by Indonesian conglomerate Ciputra.</p>

In terms specifically of real estate and urban development capital, South Korea heads the rankings. Real estate and construction accounted for 71 per cent of the total South Korean investment during 2010 (KOTRA, 2010). Concurrently, wealthy Cambodians began to bring back money stored in overseas bank accounts (Cambodia Daily, 2005). Land is seen as one of the very few secure places in which to invest money in a country where suspicion of the banking system remains and where speculation has been widespread. Figure 1.

Satellite Cities in South-east Asia The satellite cities that have been developed in the peri-urban areas of South-east Asian cities since the 1990s differ on a number of counts from the new towns constructed in the post-war period. Post-war new towns were largely developed by the state and favoured no particular social class or income group as residents (Chen et al., 2009). The new town concept, stemming originally from the ideas of Ebenezer Howard on garden cities, became widespread in East and South-east Asia in the cities of British colonial territories such as Singapore, Malaysia and pre-1997 Hong Kong. Garden cities and new towns also became a feature of cities outside Britain’s direct sphere of influence such as Tokyo, Seoul and Taipei, as well as those influenced by Soviet planning initiatives, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin (Phillips and Yeh, 1987). In the city-states of Singapore and Hong Kong, the planning of new towns was a response to populat</context>

Satellite city developments are commonly seen as reinforcing spatial segregation as they shift the wealthy into scattered residential developments. Developers rather than local governments perform urban management tasks while the local state acts as a body for expediting the development of satellite city projects (Zhu, 2010). In the past 10 years, the development of private satellite cities in the peri-urban areas of South-east Asia has become increasingly common as governments increasingly view the urban periphery as the most appropriate arena for privatised urban growth (Leaf, 2002). Douglass and Huang (2007) have examined a number of examples of this phenomenon that have been recently completed or are still under construction. Phu My Hung (‘Saigon South’) in Ho Chi Minh City is financed by Taiwanese developers and will cover 33 square km of land and house one million people (see also Waibel, 2006). Na Be New Town is being built by a Korean developer and is modelled on successful satellite cities already constructed in Korea.

The opaqueness of the planning process helps the interests of wellconnected developers, a situation that is similar to satellite city developments in Indonesia (Firman, 2000). There are a number of challenges to effective urban planning in Phnom Penh in addition to the rather top–down nature of project approvals alluded to in the previous paragraph. In particular, the legal framework for urban planning has not kept up with the influx of capital in urban development and the large size of new projects. The most relevant piece of urban planning legislation, Sub-decree No. 86 on construction permits, was designed for individual buildings rather than developments of the size of an urban district.

The development of satellite cities is set in the context of Cambodia’s political economy and changing position in global capital networks. During the 1990s, political instability linked to the remaining Khmer Rouge factions and the 1997 fighting between the Cambodian People’s Party and FUNCINPEC,3 meant that there were only small investments in urban development. There was little pressure on land and prices thus remained mostly very low. Yet between 2004 and 2007, the price of land in central Phnom Penh increased exponentially from around US$250 to US$2000 per square metre (GTZ, 2009). This increase was due to a combination of interrelated factors. The elections of 2003 gave way to a period of relative political stability (Albritton, 2004). Talk of political stability gave the cue to foreign investors that now was the time to put money into Cambodia, where there was the potential for higher returns than could be had in more developed countries. This was augmented by the fact that tighter regulations in financial centres such as Singapore resulted in capital flowing to places with looser legal environments such as Cambodia, where the government was receptive to foreign dire</context>

This is part of a broader movement towards considering the ‘worlding’ processes of Asian cities and the ways in which they are becoming models that are subsequently replicated throughout the region (Roy and Ong, 2011). It is important, however, not to relocate the problem of Western-centric essentialism by creating a new Eastern version, as Hogan et al. (2012) have observed. Nor should it be suggested that the East Asian region is a bounded unit. The processes of regionalisation and globalisation are interlinked and overlapping (Ching, 2000) and, in practical terms, activities in other parts of the world have considerable ramifications for Asia.

Land prices in peri-urban areas peaked in 2006–08 at approximately $200–250 per square metre, while in 2011 the price had fallen to around half that level (Phnom Penh Post, 2011), still a big increase from a decade earlier when land values were just a few dollars per square metre. The drivers of peri-urbanisation in Phnom Penh are clearly similar to those in other major cities in the South-east Asian region: land at lower prices and unclear and weak spatial planning policies (Hudalah et al., 2007; Webster, 2002).

Indeed, Lee Myung Bak, president of South Korea at the time of writing, had previously held an appointment as an economic advisor to Cambodia’s prime minister. The political and economic situation in Korea is a major determinant of Korean influence in Cambodia. In the period after the Korean War, inward investment and domestic growth were promoted over FDI. Nevertheless, as Korea developed rapidly, local opportunities began to be exhausted and wage increases reduced the competitiveness of Korean products compared with lower cost countries (Jae, 2007). Combined with state efforts to encourage internationalisation, this increased the number of Korean businesses, particularly the chaebol (large conglomerates with close political ties), expanding overseas (Wad, 2002). While Korean companies dominate the field of foreign investment in urban development in Cambodia, they are not the only players. As mentioned earlier, Grand Phnom Penh International City is being developed by the Indonesian company Ciputra. The project in Cambodia is modelled on similar cities already built in the developer’s country of origin. All of Ciputra’s satellite city pr</context>

Between 1990 and 2011, 30 000 families (accounting for about 150 000 people) in Phnom Penh were displaced (STT, 2011), two-thirds of them since 2000. As the former paddy fields around Phnom Penh have been sold for development, the government has expanded the boundary of the municipality to encompass districts of Kandal province in an attempt to improve urban planning (Phnom Penh Post, 2010a). Land prices in peri-urban areas peaked in 2006–08 at approximately $200–250 per square metre, while in 2011 the price had fallen to around half that level (Phnom Penh Post, 2011), still a big increase from a decade earlier when land values were just a few dollars per square metre. The drivers of peri-urbanisation in Phnom Penh are clearly similar to those in other major cities in the South-east Asian region: land at lower prices and unclear and weak spatial planning policies (Hudalah et al., 2007; Webster, 2002).

This was augmented by the fact that tighter regulations in financial centres such as Singapore resulted in capital flowing to places with looser legal environments such as Cambodia, where the government was receptive to foreign direct investment (FDI). According to the most recent data, China is the largest source of FDI in Cambodia, with investments worth US$893 million in 2009, while Korea was the largest foreign investor in Cambodia in 2006 and 2008, with figures of US$1.009 billion and US$1.237 billion respectively (KOTRA, 2010). In terms specifically of real estate and urban development capital, South Korea heads the rankings. Real estate and construction accounted for 71 per cent of the total South Korean investment during 2010 (KOTRA, 2010). Concurrently, wealthy Cambodians began to bring back money stored in overseas bank accounts (Cambodia Daily, 2005).

Parallel to these investment flows has been the formation of significant Korean business networks, with at least 550 Korean companies operating in Cambodia (KOTRA, 2010). Korean capital has been brought in through Korean banks; construction machinery and materials have been imported from Korea with generous import tax exemptions; and Korean construction companies, architects, engineers, surveyors and property lawyers are working in partnership with developers. All this has resulted in a significant migration of Korean professionals to Cambodia; estimates range from 4000 to 7000 (Phnom Penh Post, 2008).

More than a decade ago, Kris Olds suggested that it would be useful for analysts of the UMP [urban mega project] development process in both consumption-orientated and production- orientated projects to work with new urban theories which focus on economic and cultural interconnections, flows, linkages, and interdependencies (Olds, 1995, p. 1736). Shatkin (2011, p. 79) initiates this line of analysis in the context of satellite cities by stating that they are perhaps the ‘‘purest form of inter-referenced urbanism’’ as they symbolise the complete adoption of urban planning and design principles ‘‘based on an interpretation of how a global urbanism should look and function’’. While the satellite cities in Indonesia were built by domestic companies, the more recently developed projects in other South-east Asian countries are mainly funded by intra-Asian foreign direct investment.

The new town concept, stemming originally from the ideas of Ebenezer Howard on garden cities, became widespread in East and South-east Asia in the cities of British colonial territories such as Singapore, Malaysia and pre-1997 Hong Kong. Garden cities and new towns also became a feature of cities outside Britain’s direct sphere of influence such as Tokyo, Seoul and Taipei, as well as those influenced by Soviet planning initiatives, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin (Phillips and Yeh, 1987). In the city-states of Singapore and Hong Kong, the planning of new towns was a response to population pressure because of rapid industrialisation. These new towns— for example, Ang Mo Kio in Singapore and Sha Tin in Hong Kong—were mainly designed to provide public housing (Pun, 1987; Wang, 1987), only later beginning to have social services, amenities and employment opportunities. New towns were built to provide new housing, but also as tools for the decentralisation of urban growth in a region characterised by primate cities, much as new towns were developed in the south-east of Britain in </context>

Similar developments are located on the desert periphery of Cairo, financed by UAE-based companies and modelled on comparable projects in Dubai (Singerman and Amar, 2006). The process of ‘Dubaisation’ has infused urban development practices throughout the Middle East and Africa, in Khartoum, Sudan and Nouakchott, Mauritania (Choplin and Franck, 2010). Foreign companies are not behind the construction of all satellite cities and, furthermore, smaller developments often represent more significant drivers of change. Labbe and Boudreau (2011), in their research on Hanoi, caution against overemphasising the imposition of ‘spectacular’ foreign urban development models, arguing that such an emphasis is inappropriate because foreign capital is behind only a small minority of satellite city projects.

Because Phnom Penh is smaller than most other South-east Asian capitals (it has a population of less than two million), satellite cities form an even more significant feature of its urban landscape. It is apparent that satellite cities are becoming a common phenomenon throughout the region. As already shown, what started in Jakarta has spread throughout the Asian region from Hanoi and Phnom Penh to Kolkata. This paper, in agreement with Shatkin (2011), first, seeks to argue that urban networks are central to their development. Such networks may consist of capital investment, the movement of particular architectural, urban design or governance styles, or the reification of the imagined qualities of certain ‘paradigmatic’ cities.

In the city-states of Singapore and Hong Kong, the planning of new towns was a response to population pressure because of rapid industrialisation. These new towns— for example, Ang Mo Kio in Singapore and Sha Tin in Hong Kong—were mainly designed to provide public housing (Pun, 1987; Wang, 1987), only later beginning to have social services, amenities and employment opportunities. New towns were built to provide new housing, but also as tools for the decentralisation of urban growth in a region characterised by primate cities, much as new towns were developed in the south-east of Britain in the post-war period to ease housing congestion in London.

Ciputra’s regional expansion emanates from its position as one of the leading property developers in Indonesia. Its strong position is primarily due to the company’s ability to obtain large areas of cheap rural land, along with the rights to convert that land into urban usage. Large developers with privileged access to finance and close political connections were able to do this (Leisch, 2002; Rimmer and Dick, 2009).

The mobility of capital, concepts and expertise has been and remains central to the process of diffusion of these urban projects throughout South-east Asia. By examining the networks through which satellite cities are produced, this paper exposes the diverse connections between cities. It also continues the project of avoiding positioning cities in the North Atlantic world, at the leading edge of urban theory and practice (Robinson, 2002). There is currently in the literature a growing clamour for caution in applying Western-centric urban theories to cities in other contexts. Receptive to the call from Jennifer Robinson (2002, 2006), a number of urban scholars have appreciated the importance of considering all cities as ‘ordinary’ in order to post-colonialise the discipline of urban studies, thus contributing to ‘‘develop[ing] a more cosmopolitan account of city-ness’’ (Robinson, 2002, p. 532).

As this paper highlights, Phnom Penh is but the latest location for a trend that permeated the larger cities of Indonesia in the 1980s and 1990s and that has since moved into Cambodia, Vietnam and elsewhere. The growing popularity of the satellite city concept is in part due to the increasing entrepreneurialism of urban governance, in which a greater premium is placed on attracting private-sector investment (Shatkin, 2011). Related to this are the relatively weak planning laws in some South-east Asian cities which make it possible for such large urban development projects to materialise. The trend also reflects the demand from the growing middle classes for housing and better infrastructure, and from businesses for modern office space in less congested areas. While the proliferation of private-sector satellite city development is beginning to attract scholarly attention (for example, Chen et al., 2009; Douglass and Huang, 2007; Shatkin, 2011), there has until now been a lack of emphasis on the role of intraregi</context>

In this sense, there is need for a revision of Dick and Rimmer’s (1998) argument that in the age of globalisation there is a convergence in urban form between South-east Asian cities and those in the West. On the simplest level, satellite city urban form borrows heavily from the style of American gated communities. In the case of the Lippo Group, it has been said that this is because the head of the company, James Riady, spent time in California whilst studying for a graduate business degree (Silver, 2008). However, a deeper examination of the production of East Asian satellite cities requires a more thorough look beyond urban form towards the networks through which they are produced.

In the period after the Korean War, inward investment and domestic growth were promoted over FDI. Nevertheless, as Korea developed rapidly, local opportunities began to be exhausted and wage increases reduced the competitiveness of Korean products compared with lower cost countries (Jae, 2007). Combined with state efforts to encourage internationalisation, this increased the number of Korean businesses, particularly the chaebol (large conglomerates with close political ties), expanding overseas (Wad, 2002). While Korean companies dominate the field of foreign investment in urban development in Cambodia, they are not the only players. As mentioned earlier, Grand Phnom Penh International City is being developed by the Indonesian company Ciputra. The project in Cambodia is modelled on similar cities already built in the developer’s country of origin. All of Ciputra’s satellite city projects share broadly similar architectural styles and urban forms, regardless of their location, particularly the imposing entrance archway and a residential architecture reminiscent of historical European styles.

In the past 10 years, the development of private satellite cities in the peri-urban areas of South-east Asia has become increasingly common as governments increasingly view the urban periphery as the most appropriate arena for privatised urban growth (Leaf, 2002). Douglass and Huang (2007) have examined a number of examples of this phenomenon that have been recently completed or are still under construction. Phu My Hung (‘Saigon South’) in Ho Chi Minh City is financed by Taiwanese developers and will cover 33 square km of land and house one million people (see also Waibel, 2006). Na Be New Town is being built by a Korean developer and is modelled on successful satellite cities already constructed in Korea. The largest of the satellite city projects surrounding Ho Chi Minh City, called the North West Metropolitan Area, is currently in the early stages of construction. A Malaysian company is undertaking this project, which will cost an estimated US$3 billion and will be some 18 kilometres long and 5 kilometres wide. It is a similar picture in Hanoi, where the Indonesian developer Ciputra is building a satellite city under the name Ciputra International City, and a Kore</context>

Garden cities and new towns also became a feature of cities outside Britain’s direct sphere of influence such as Tokyo, Seoul and Taipei, as well as those influenced by Soviet planning initiatives, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin (Phillips and Yeh, 1987). In the city-states of Singapore and Hong Kong, the planning of new towns was a response to population pressure because of rapid industrialisation. These new towns— for example, Ang Mo Kio in Singapore and Sha Tin in Hong Kong—were mainly designed to provide public housing (Pun, 1987; Wang, 1987), only later beginning to have social services, amenities and employment opportunities. New towns were built to provide new housing, but also as tools for the decentralisation of urban growth in a region characterised by primate cities, much as new towns were developed in the south-east of Britain in the post-war period to ease housing congestion in London. The satellite cities that form the focus of this paper are different from their garden city and new town antecedents because they are developed by private companies on a for-profit basis. This kind of development originated in the 1970s and</context>

Robinson’s ideas have been amplified by a number of urbanists who have suggested that research should approach the varied ‘worlding’ process of cities (Roy, 2009), and that work on cities in the global South should not simply ‘add on’ case studies to existing Western theory (McFarlane, 2008). Similar debates have been initiated within the field of economic geography (Pollard et al., 2009). These arguments have been driven forwards by relational comparative theorising that moves beyond ‘‘static theorisations of place, space and scale’’ (Ward, 2010, p. 473), viewing the city as ‘‘open and constituted in and through relations that stretch across space and are territorialised in place’’ (Ward, 2010, p. 481). While the relational is important, it must be balanced by an understanding of place-specificities, such as how local urban actors manage the impacts of and interact with these global/regional flows (McCann and Ward, 2010). Researchers have begun to consider the ways in which cities in non-Western contexts are interlinked. Such research includes Bunnell and Das’ (2010) work on urban policy transfer between Kuala Lumpur and Hyderabad, w</context>

Land prices in peri-urban areas peaked in 2006–08 at approximately $200–250 per square metre, while in 2011 the price had fallen to around half that level (Phnom Penh Post, 2011), still a big increase from a decade earlier when land values were just a few dollars per square metre. The drivers of peri-urbanisation in Phnom Penh are clearly similar to those in other major cities in the South-east Asian region: land at lower prices and unclear and weak spatial planning policies (Hudalah et al., 2007; Webster, 2002). The Production of Satellite Cities in Phnom Penh Camko City Camko City is a $2 billion project, planned to cover 120 hectares when, and if, all phases are constructed as originally intended. The concept originated from a visit by several Korean businesspeople to Cambodia in the mid 2000s. They felt that there was no suitable office space for global businesses. At the time, most companies were located in converted villas or small office buildings, and they were often subject to electricity cuts and monsoon season flooding. Opinion was mobilised behind the construction of a modern office distr</context>

The first private-sector satellite city in the Jakarta urban agglomeration was Pondok Indah. Initiated in 1975, this 720-hectare middle- and upper-class housing development was built on former rubber plantation land. It was established by Ciputra in collaboration with Lim Sioe Liong (also referred 2876 TOM PERCIVAL AND PAULWALEY at UNIV FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS on June 19, 2015usj.sagepub.comDownloaded from to by his Indonesian name, Sudono Salim) (Winarso, 1999). Lim, once the wealthiest businessperson in Indonesia, was founder of the Salim Group, one of the three most prominent Indonesian ethnic-Chinese development companies, the other two being Ciputra Group and the Lippo Group. The Lippo Group developed satellite cities such as Lippo Karawaci and Lippo Cikarang, two examples of the 20 or so satellite cities over 500 hectares already constructed or approved as of 1997 (Firman, 2004). The mega projects of the Lippo Group appear to be modelled on the design principles of the garden city movement and the later stateplanned new towns. At the same time,</context>

The Lippo Group has two main goals according to one of the company’s senior executives: to make profits from real estate development and to design selfcontained cities which can be a model to be emulated both in Jakarta and the wider region (Benton, 2000). Satellite city developments are commonly seen as reinforcing spatial segregation as they shift the wealthy into scattered residential developments. Developers rather than local governments perform urban management tasks while the local state acts as a body for expediting the development of satellite city projects (Zhu, 2010). In the past 10 years, the development of private satellite cities in the peri-urban areas of South-east Asia has become increasingly common as governments increasingly view the urban periphery as the most appropriate arena for privatised urban growth (Leaf, 2002).
