			<abstract>
				<p>This article analyzes articulations among urban enclaves, finance capital, and glass architecture by exploring MGM's corporate investments in the Las Vegas CityCenter development and the Chinese enclave of Macau. CityCenter is an unsuccessful $9 billion master-planned urban community financed by MGM and Dubai World. Macau is a former Portuguese colony and Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China which has, since its return to the PRC in 1999, replaced Las Vegas as the world's most lucrative site of casino gaming revenue. Taken together, CityCenter and Macau are illustrative of the political economy and cultural logics of financialization. Foreign investment from Las Vegas entrepreneurs has vitrified Macau, transforming it into a phantasmagoria of glass resorts. Macau in turn plays a crucial functional role in capitalism's recomposition in East Asia, similar to the autochthon-ous role of the Italian city-states of Venice and Genoa in the historical origins of capitalism. In order to 'read' the cities of Las Vegas and Macau, I explore intertextual legibilities among fictitious capital that relies on glass fiber-optic technology to enable grand architectural projects; expressionist fictional representations of glass architecture and its utopian transformative potential; and glass buildings that themselves dissimulate in a manner not unlike fiction.</p>

Alchemical phantasms of crystallization animate the deistic convictions of central bank economists who deregulate financial flows and securities traders who colonize fiber-optic networks to engineer the economy of dematerialized capital. These glass constructions reproduce both the technological function and aesthetic form of financialization. Influenced by Scheerbart and in the wake of the techno-human brutality of the Second World War, Benjamin (1999) opined that the glass Simpson 365 at UNIV FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS on June 12, 2015tcs.sagepub.comDownloaded from and steel of the International Style had the value of being traceless: ‘they have created rooms where it is hard to leave traces’ (p. 734). Benjamin thought that those who lived through the war would benefit from this detachment from the past, that glass architecture would constitute a generational tabula rasa. ‘Objects made of glass have no “aura”’, he said. ‘Glass is an enemy of secrets. It is also an enemy of possession’ (p. 734).7 But today, in a typically Benjaminian dialectic</context>

MGM Mirage flirted with bankruptcy and in 2009 Dubai World sued their partner for mismanagement of the project’s construction, though it eventually dropped the suit and the Sultan of Dubai attended the opening celebration (Benston, 2009). By the time the initial phase of CityCenter was ready to open to the public, Las Vegas suffered the worst housing market in the nation.5 Dubai World no doubt came to regret its role in the project. By the date of the December 2009 opening of the first phase of CityCenter, Dubai’s economy was in freefall as the Emirate had announced just a month before the inability to meet repayment obligations on nearly $25 billion of loans (Sharif and Hall, 2011).

The Vdara Hotel, designed by Uruguayan ‘starchitect’ Rafael Vinoly, is part of Las Vegas’ dazzling new CityCenter complex. CityCenter is a remarkably ambitious $8.7 billion development, jointly financed by Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts International and Dubai World, the investment company of the emirate (Berzon, 2010; see Figure 1). Construction of the five-year project was completed in 2011. Conceived as a selfcontained residential, gambling, and shopping enclave on the Strip, complete with iconic buildings designed by celebrity architects, ‘pocket parks’ and notable public artworks, CityCenter is reportedly the most expensive privately-funded construction project ever built in the USA, and perhaps one of the most audacious attempts in world history to conceive and construct an encapsulated urban neighborhood.

The development’s subsequent underperformance is illustrative of both the political economy and cultural logics of financialization. ‘Financialization must be understood as a profoundly spatial phenomenon, holding out as it does the promise of a financial, spatial-temporal fix for the crisis tendencies of capitalism’ (French et al., 2011: 814). Both the urban enclave of CityCenter and glass architecture of the Vdara Hotel may be understood as spatial expressions of financialization. While Manuel Castells (2000: 434) claims that the 21st-century mega-city 344 Theory, Culture &amp; Society 30(7/8) at UNIV FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS on June 12, 2015tcs.sagepub.comDownloaded from is the ‘new spatial form’ of the global financial economy and information society, I suggest that the enclosed enclave in its many guises, from special economic zones to gated communities, is the locus of capital containment for our age (Easterling, 2005, 2007; Jameson, 1990). Indeed, these claims are not incompatible. For Castells, the defining feature of the mega-city is its discontinuous and disjunctive social geography, the ‘dist</context>

Fiber-optic cables facilitate financialization as instantaneous capital movements rely on transcontinental telecommunications networks, what Stephen Graham (1999) has called ‘global grids of glass’. These cables conjoin glass and light to circulate the digitized information of the network society that appears on our computer screens and mobile devices, forming the ‘space of flows’ (Castells, 2000), the architecture of contemporary social life that is as ubiquitous as it is invisible. Fiber optics are not only a key component of flexible forms 346 Theory, Culture &amp; Society 30(7/8) at UNIV FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS on June 12, 2015tcs.sagepub.comDownloaded from of accumulation but enable flexible specialization, flexible time, ‘Toyotist’ supply chain management, locational strategies of production, and essentially all other factors of the post-Fordist economy.

This contemporary incarnation of alchemy displaces Scheerbart’s and Taut’s belief in crystal power to the 21st century: both faiths rely on the enabling function of glass. Political commitment to deregulation of financial markets in the 1980s similarly converged with new technical innovations in glass – in this case fiber-optic information technologies – and emerging utopian assumptions about the planetary connectivity of telecommunications (Castells, 2000; Taylor, 2004). With the rapid expansion of the Simpson 351 at UNIV FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS on June 12, 2015tcs.sagepub.comDownloaded from financial economy, exponential salary increases for finance executives lured young mathematicians and physicists away from once-coveted cold-war corporate research jobs in the military-industrial complex and to the finance industry where they now engineer increasingly complex trading algorithms and derivative instruments that colonize fiber-optic networks to monetize the future; the end result is the ‘financialization of everything’ (Harvey, 2007: 33).

It is the speed of the transaction, sometimes automatically preprogrammed in the computer to make quasi-instantaneous decisions, that generates the gain – or the loss’, contends Castells (2000: 466). Furthermore, a significant and growing number of financial transactions are based on making value out of the capture of future time in present transactions, as in the futures, options, and other derivative capital markets. Together these new financial products dramatically increase the mass of nominal capital vis-a-vis bank deposits and assets, so that everybody bets on and with future money anticipated in computer projections.

Its global significance cannot be underestimated’ (MGM Mirage, 2009). The decision to build iconic glass towers rather than themed simulations more typical of the resorts on the Strip was not motivated merely by evolving architectural tastes. It was, rather, an attempt to fashion what Castells calls a ‘node’ for accumulation. According to Castells (2000), ‘the nodes of the space of flows include residential and leisure-oriented spaces which, along with the location of headquarters and their ancillary services, tend to cluster dominant functions in carefully segregated spaces, with easy access to cosmopolitan complexes of arts, culture, and entertainment’ (2000: 446–7). MGMMirage CEO JimMurren, who conceived of the original plan, described the project as ‘a very ambitious masterplanned community’ (quoted in Freiss, 2009) ostensibly constructed for the elites of the information society. ‘They’ve heard of Rafael Vinoly and Cesar Pelli and Norman</context>

According to Deng’s strategy, both Shenzhen and the Zhuhai SEZ, respectively located adjacent to the colonies of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as a string of other SEZs along the south China coast, would function collectively as laboratories of production where the PRC would allow Western companies to establish enterprises in order to study techniques of capitalist production, manufacturing, management, and private property (Chuihua et al., 2001). This process eventually formed what is for Castells (2000: 436) the prototypical network society mega-city, the ‘Hong Kong-ShenzhenCanton-Pearl River Delta-Macau-Zhuhai metropolitan regional system’. Deng’s experiment has succeeded beyond anyone’s expectations, and we will see that Macau plays a crucial role in enabling the circulation of capital through this system. Today rural China is urbanizing on a vast scale. China is pursuing urbanism itself as an accumulation strategy (Wu, 2009) and using macroeconomic policy to encourage domestic consumption, resulting in a wholesale transformation of not only the landscape but of the Chinese subject.

Indeed, these claims are not incompatible. For Castells, the defining feature of the mega-city is its discontinuous and disjunctive social geography, the ‘distinctive feature of being globally connected and locally disconnected’ (2000: p. 436); I argue that the enclave is such a ‘locally disconnected’ site. The enclave is a scalar surrogate for both the nation-state that organized and regulated the Fordist economy and the modernist city that was the locus of industrial production and collective consumption.

Taken together, CityCenter and Macau are revealing of the state of the city, as well as the importance of the city to the state – indeed, of the city-state – in the current composition of global capitalism. The enclave may be understood as a commodified and derivative urban form. Much like a derivative financial instrument, the enclave’s value is derived from a potent speculative package of assets, indices, and underliers, to form what Keller Easterling (2005: 1) calls a ‘spatial product’ or ‘real estate cocktail’. Like a mortgage-backed security, the disposition of this mixture can be volatile. When the speculation is wrong, as was the case with CityCenter, the scale of lost revenues may be so significant that it has reverberations for the global economy: the entire edifice may eventually implode under the weight of failed financial expectations. However, when the wager pays off like it has in the quasistate of Macau – with its unique regime of legal exceptionalism and strategic management of cross-border flows of people and capital – the result </context>

Glassmaking was one of the oldest industries in France as well, though until the 17th century French glass production was generally of a common variety that could not compare with the work of the Venetian artisans. In 1687, however, French glassmaker Bernard Perrot developed an innovative technique of plate glass production that involved casting the glass rather than blowing it, and Paris ultimately became the site of the most pervasive developments in glass architecture (Scoville, 1941, 1942; Fierro, 2003: 9; Richards, 2008). Notwithstanding the lethal luminosity of Las Vegas, Paris was the original ‘city of light’, center of not only philosophical enlightenment but of fashion, art, and culture; urban planning, banking, and finance; cafes, department stores, and arcades. Glass was crucial to this constellation. Constructed in the early 19th century, the arcades were a triumph of iron and glass architecture, arching over passages between buildings to create interior consumer spaces that were precursors to the department store, shopping mall, and hotel atrium (see Missac, 1995).1 When Walter Ben</context>

Benjamin’s revolutionary critique was driven by his retrospective attention to the detritus of the previous era. Benjamin’s insights about the mythology of capitalism emanated from his discovery of its pre-history in the iron and glass Parisian arcades a generation after their demise. But today, fiber-optic technology has produced a new temporality that has eradicated that historical distance. The ‘truth’ of fiber-optic-enabled financialization resides directly in the surfaces of the new glass architecture of the Global Style (Foster, 2011), despite the fact that it seems so naked, bare, and transparent.4 As capital switches from the primary circuit of industrial manufacturing to the secondary circuit of real estate investment, glass architecture mediates the dialectical relation between illiquid spatial fixity on one hand, and financial liquidity on the other. This form of transparent crystalline real estate investment in commodified urban enclaves emerges from the very process of ‘converting opaque and illiquid assets into liquid and transparent securities’ (Gotham, 2009: 357).

Built on billions of dollars of debt, CityCenter is not only an effort to erect a planned urban community; it also inadvertently embodies the deflationary direction of the derivative-driven global economy, where capital is fixed in space to create self-contained islands of accumulation, and dematerialized financialization finds its physical form in glass architecture. Next to the Vdara Hotel in CityCenter sits the Norman Fosterdesigned Harmon Hotel. Foster is the epitome of the starchitect and his buildings define the contemporary Global Style (Foster, 2011). He is responsible for notable glass designs the world over, ranging from futuristic airports in Hong Kong and Beijing, Zayad National Museum in the United Arab Emirates, the UAE Pavilion at the Shanghai Expo, and even another City Center in Washington, DC. But the Harmon Hotel has not fared so well and its failures belie the empty promise of fictitious capital today. Originally designed to have 49 floors, structural problems in the foundation led to the decision in 2009 to eliminate nearly half of the building, rendering a completed edifice of only 26 storeys.

The property’s soft opening in 2009 coincided with the global economic crisis, and no doubt the immense amount of debt incurred in construction of the glass towers of CityCenter contributed in some small way to the crunch. The development’s subsequent underperformance is illustrative of both the political economy and cultural logics of financialization. ‘Financialization must be understood as a profoundly spatial phenomenon, holding out as it does the promise of a financial, spatial-temporal fix for the crisis tendencies of capitalism’ (French et al., 2011: 814).

In short, the immaterial economy of post-Fordism seeks a spatial fix in the enclave, while the dematerialized capital of fiber optics enabled financialization finds its form in glass architecture. French et al. (2011) ‘argue that work on financialization has been insufficiently attentive to: the role of space and place; the geography of money and finance; and earlier work in the Marxist and international political-economy tradition that effectively focused on the problem of financialization before the neologism was coined and mobilized.’ I will bring these very factors – social space, financial geography, political economy – together to explore the form and function of glass architecture in Las Vegas and Macau.

Indeed, these claims are not incompatible. For Castells, the defining feature of the mega-city is its discontinuous and disjunctive social geography, the ‘distinctive feature of being globally connected and locally disconnected’ (2000: p. 436); I argue that the enclave is such a ‘locally disconnected’ site. The enclave is a scalar surrogate for both the nation-state that organized and regulated the Fordist economy and the modernist city that was the locus of industrial production and collective consumption. Both the perils and the promise of the contemporary city emanate from such locales. C</context>

Glass Architecture as Material Component and Aesthetic Feature of Financialization Finance capital seeks reproduction in enclaves – Special Administrative Regions, corporate cities, quasi-states, and various other zones of encapsulated urbanity or juridical exception – yet financialization takes its tangible form in glass architecture like the Vdara Hotel. The Vdara Hotel’s facade is not merely application of an architectural aesthetic technique but can be understood as a ‘formal overtone’ (Jameson, 1998: 44) of the finance capitalism used to construct the hotel and the larger project. While the relationship among glass and financialization may not be immediately apparent, I will argue that glass is as important to contemporary post-Fordist capitalism as was the railroad or copper wire to earlier stages. Fiber-optic cables facilitate financialization as instantaneous capital movements rely on transcontinental telecommunications networks, what Stephen Graham (1999) has called ‘global grids of glass’. These cables conjoin glass and light to circulate the digitized information of the network soc</context>

If Scheerbart saw the transition from brick to glass materials as indicative of moral progress, Jameson investigates the underlying economic logic. Searching for the series of mediations ‘which leads from finance capital through land speculation to aesthetics and cultural production itself’, Jameson finds in the ‘enclosed skin volumes’ of post-modern glass architecture a ‘formal overtone’ of finance capitalism. From this perspective, the glass skin of a building like the Vdara Hotel ‘dematerializes without signifying in any way spirituality’ (Jameson, 1998: 44) in the same manner in which the finance economy creates an abstracted and dematerialized form of capital. This contemporary glass architecture is homologous with both the fiberoptic materials that enable financialization as well as the frictionless form of its discursive representation. In the case of the Vdara Hotel, the errant ray of light refracted off the building’s surface into a ‘death ray’ mimics the play of glass and light in a fiber-optic cable. It is architecture appropriate for a post-Fordist economic regime. For Marx, fictitious capital was simply credit, capital that was ass</context>

This hermetic feature of financialization enhanced by incessant neoliberal evangelization has made the global financial system today appear like ‘nothing as much as a vast casino’ (Strange, 1986: 1). Therefore, if the political economy of 19th-century industrial production required the solid foundations of brick construction that Scheerbart thought created closed cultures, and the modular glass-curtain corporate architecture of IBM and Bell Laboratories communicated flexibility and integration for the cybernetic capitalism of the cold war (Martin, 2003), then the ‘materialist sublimation’ (Jameson, 1998: 44) of the financial economy is best rendered in curving glass walls like those of the Vdara Hotel. It is architecture appropriate for an era in which accumulation seems to have been decoupled from production and financial profits are derived from the opaque perambulations of finance itself. But more than that, it is architecture that is directly produced by financialization and which makes the built environment in its own image: fragile, brittle ‘global grids of glass’.

The Derivative Cityscape and the Implosion of Value This returns us, then, to CityCenter, the enclave neighborhood development on the Las Vegas Strip. ‘Utopian space is an imaginary enclave within real social space’, suggests Jameson (2005: 15). For Jameson, in a move that echoes Benjamin’s analysis of the Parisian arcades, the enclave is ‘something like a foreign body within the social’ that may potentially ‘offer a space in which new wish images of the social can be elaborated and experimented on’ (p. 16).8 Perhaps CityCenter, not to mention the city-state of Macau, operates in this manner, a dialectial image counterposing the utopian dreams of the collective against the neoliberal delusions of fictitious and hyperreal capital.

Glassmaking was one of the oldest industries in France as well, though until the 17th century French glass production was generally of a common variety that could not compare with the work of the Venetian artisans. In 1687, however, French glassmaker Bernard Perrot developed an innovative technique of plate glass production that involved casting the glass rather than blowing it, and Paris ultimately became the site of the most pervasive developments in glass architecture (Scoville, 1941, 1942; Fierro, 2003: 9; Richards, 2008).

Expressionism and Weimar Germany In the imagination of fin de siecle German expressionist writer Paul Scheerbart as well as his intellectual contemporaries who formed the Crystal Chain, glass had a didactic transformative potential. Scheerbart was fascinated by glass architecture, writing a book on the subject as well as a number of playful utopian stories in which it featured (Scheerbart, 1972, 2001, 2010). Scheerbart saw in glass construction and ornamentation a key to architectural change that he thought would enable wholesale cultural evolution. From Scheerbart’s perspective the largely brick building materials of industrial capitalism led to necessarily ‘closed rooms’ that reflected closed minds and closed relationships (Bletter, 1975, 1981); growth would only be possible to the extent that glass construction opened environments to the elements. ‘Glass opens up a new age’, he suggested prophetically, while ‘Brick building does only harm.’ Thus, the advantage of glass architectu</context>

So the veranda continues to grow; in the end it emancipates itself from the main building, and may become the main building itself. To promote this evolution of the veranda will be the chief task of every glass architect.

We will see later how this belief in divine vitrification resonates with the devout discourses deploying deregulatory practices and fiber-optic technology to enable financialization.

Or: ‘it is clearly advisable to build glass houses only in the temperate zones’ (p. 42). When designing the Vdara Hotel, Rafael Vinoly probably should have paid heed to Scheerbart’s admonition: ‘An occasional mirrorwall close to a pool is worth considering. But not too many’ (p. 42). Viewed from a more opaque angle, however, and in the context of Scheerbart’s interest in the alchemical properties of crystal (Bletter, 1981) and his experiments with perpetual motion (Scheerbart, 2011), Glass Architecture is no design primer.

By the date of the December 2009 opening of the first phase of CityCenter, Dubai’s economy was in freefall as the Emirate had announced just a month before the inability to meet repayment obligations on nearly $25 billion of loans (Sharif and Hall, 2011). The sultan who had masterminded the territory’s equity purchase of half of the CityCenter venture amassed a staggering $40 billion debt for Dubai World. Within a year he was removed from his post as chairman of the company, proving prescient his own 1997 prediction about CityCenter: ‘Its global significance cannot be underestimated.’ A host of development projects in Dubai either sit partially completed or never got past the drawing board as economic woes have severely tempered the aspirations of Dubai’s sovereign to create his own Ville-Lumiere, complete with rows of glittering glass towers</context>

The enclave subsumes the functions heretofore managed by the state which often capitalizes off enclaves in the sort of tribute system that has existed in East Asia for several millennia. Such sites are central to capitalist expansion in the region today. Specifically, to use Castell’s (2000: 443) terminology, Macau is both a ‘hub’ and a ‘node’ in the mega-city region. As an interstitial tourist city, paradoxically both inside and outside the PRC, and visited by 28 million people in 2012, it is a communication hub.

This hermetic feature of financialization enhanced by incessant neoliberal evangelization has made the global financial system today appear like ‘nothing as much as a vast casino’ (Strange, 1986: 1). Therefore, if the political economy of 19th-century industrial production required the solid foundations of brick construction that Scheerbart thought created closed cultures, and the modular glass-curtain corporate architecture of IBM and Bell Laboratories communicated flexibility and integration for the cybernetic capitalism of the cold war (Martin, 2003), then the ‘materialist sublimation’ (Jameson, 1998: 44) of the financial economy is best rendered in curving glass walls like those of the Vdara Hotel.

Deng’s experiment has succeeded beyond anyone’s expectations, and we will see that Macau plays a crucial role in enabling the circulation of capital through this system. Today rural China is urbanizing on a vast scale. China is pursuing urbanism itself as an accumulation strategy (Wu, 2009) and using macroeconomic policy to encourage domestic consumption, resulting in a wholesale transformation of not only the landscape but of the Chinese subject. This transformation is evidenced by the sight of eager Chinese tourists queuing outside of Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and Chanel shops in Macau and Hong Kong. The future of Chinese consumption will depend on these members of the emerging middle class who increasingly visit Macau on tourist visas enabled by new central government policies.
