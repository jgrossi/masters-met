			<abstract>
				<p>The Fukushima catastrophe has led to important practical and conceptual shifts in contemporary Japanese architecture which in turn has led to a re-evaluation of the influential 1960s Japanese modern architecture movement, Metabolism. The Metabolists had the ambition to create a new Japanese society through techno-utopian city planning. The new generation of Japanese architects, after the Fukushima event, no longer seek evolutionally social change; rather, the disaster has made them reconsider what architecture is and what architects can do for people who had everything snatched from them by technology (nuclear power station) and nature (earthquake and tsunami). Drawing on the architectural projects of Tange Kenzo and Metabolists in the 1960s and Ito Toyo's 'Home-for-All project' in 2011, the paper explores this major paradigm shift in Japanese architectural theory and practices.</p>

The demystification of scientific rationality gave rise to risk consciousness. In his book Risk Society, Beck claims that civilization brought about threats which we find when we see ourselves ‘exposed to radiation’ (e.g. the Fukushima nuclear power station incident), or ingesting ‘toxic levels’ (e.g. Minamata disease), and in the anxieties of a ‘nuclear holocaust’ (e.g. the Hiroshima atomic bomb) (Beck, 1992: 72). His account fits surprisingly well both the historical and current Japanese social contexts.18 An invisible world becomes rendered visible, a dangerous world which closely resonates with a dystopian vision of the future, and we can only perceive the world we live in largely through the critical risk consciousness of a dystopian culture. In Japanese history, people had repeatedly encountered major disasters and calamities. When the Kanto great earthquake occurred in 1923, Tange was 10 years old (and his mentor, Kunio Maekawa, was 18 years old – he also faced the bombing of Tokyo in 1945 </context>

Everything must be viewed with a double gaze, and only be correctly understood and judged through this doubling. The world of the visible must be investigated, relativized and evaluated with respect to a second reality, only existent in thought and yet concealed in the world. The standards for evaluation lie only in the second, not in the visible world’ (Beck, 1992: 72). 19. Kurokawa developed the concept of impermanence, derived from Shintoism and also Buddhism. He believed that the concept of impermanence could be used to apply the idea that the city and architecture are continuously changing and growing. For him, ‘everything we see is impermanent. Whole cities can vanish in a day of warfare. It’s this idea that the Japanese believe in, not the outward form. It’s the philosophy’ (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 385). 20.

Over 60 years after the emergence of Metabolism, there is a continuous strain of this idea in the present debate about the contemporary city plan. With the growing attention given computational information programmes, especially digital tracking systems, a new type of urban planning concerned with the sustainability of the city has become a key issue for contemporary society. ‘All urban actors, at whatever scale – from the pedestrian to the megacity itself – respond to embedded regularities they help to materialize and normalize, in cognitive, affective and rhythmic ways’ (Crandall, 2010: 71). 23. This could resonate with Archigram’s ‘Living City’ which sought to not only liberate people in the city by celebrating technological innovation but also empower the inhabitants to create their own way of life. Archigram focused more on the inhabitants as individuals who were incalculable living entities, and acknowledged that the individuals were significant active entities who could contribute to creating a ‘Living City’, which appreciated the immediacy and feeling for urban life. ‘The future would not be the architect’s total design, but a collaboration between architect and inhab</context>

What the Metabolists envisaged was the hope of a future city which embodied the idea of democracy, egalitarianism, classlessness and the freedom of the individual. 13. The capacity for units of individual living spaces ranged from 2000 in Kurokawa’s ‘Agricultural City’ to 500,000 in Kikutake’s ‘Ocean City’ (Lin, 2010: 74). 14. Recent concerns about the issues of democracy and freedom in contemporary urban life have been exacerbated in the debates about the implementation of advanced computer informational systems, such as the use of ‘citizen sensors’ (Gabrys, 2014), to improve resource efficiencies, sustainable environments and secure everyday practices. Ubiquitous computing systems potentially make it possible for citizens to input their level of energy consumption in various everyday activities to the central database. On the one hand, citizen participation in urban sustainability schemas can create the chance for greater public intervention in the governance of cities. Yet on the other hand it can also open the door to greater surveillance, so as to further by stealth governance of citizens’ urban life. In this respect, it raises the question of how </context>

The generic city, on the other hand, is ‘the city without history’ (Koolhaas et al., 1995: 1250). This was Koolhaas’s response to a paradox in contemporary urbanism. ‘The commitment to the historical concentric form of the [European] city leads to the search to both preserve the authentic city of the historical inner cities and the drive to constantly modernize them to make sure they also keep their role as centres of 214 Theory, Culture &amp; Society 31(7/8) at UNIV FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS on June 19, 2015tcs.sagepub.comDownloaded from society’ (Hajer, 1999: 140). For him, ‘Not proximity but connectivity, not history but adaptations are the key variables’ (p. 141). The generic city as a global contemporary city no longer evokes homogeneous identity but can be multiple. The Metabolists’ urbanism sought to create Japaneseness through historical memories. In terms of the ambition of creating a national image and the image of a future Japan, the mega-city plan was the most important productive avenue explored by the Metabolist movement. However, they overemphasized the city ‘megastructure’ as entailing a new paradigm of urbanism. Tange’s ‘Tokyo City</context>

An influential member, Peter Cook, devised a plug-in principle which combined many elements of megastructure: ‘the principle of collectivity, of interchangeable units and the incorporation of rapid transport links’ (Sadler, 2005: 14). The Plug-In City was designed for the accelerating flux of city life; what Cook would call the ‘come-go’ of Plug-In City was opposed to the orthodox urban planning with its characteristics of clean, zoned, and hierarchical separation. ‘Pl</context>

For him, ‘the spiral design of the towers was explicitly opposed to the Cartesian model of a priori master-mass plan which . . . could not account for the natural curvilinear evolution of environments’ (Parisi, 2009: 348). 8. The original ideas of megastructure can be traced back to the city project for Paris, Henry-Jules Borie’s Aerodomes (1865), which integrated multi-level urban buildings that include transportation infrastructure, and Arturo Soria y Mata’s project (1882) for a continuous linear industrial city intended to span between Cadiz and St Petersburg (Holden, 2009: 7). 9. Team X sought a different theoretical framework from the previous generation. They were also critical about the functionalist’s urban plan and CIAM’s bureaucratic administration. 10. Through their lectures and publications, the members of Team X created and diffused their ideas of structuralism (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema) and brutalism (Alison and Peter Smithson). 11.

They were designed with different lifespans: the main shafts would last 60 years, while the capsules would be up for replacement in 25 years. Isozaki’s ‘City in the Air’ (1961) proposed a ‘forest-like’ city plan which applied the ‘joint core system’. Each ‘tree-like’ mega scale ‘vertical core provides the path for public transport with “branches” (lateral paths of movement) emanating from this core which in turn sustain “leaves” (the housing units), which intertwine and link-up to generate a network in the air’ (Isozaki, 2001: 74). The multiplication of treelike structures produces finally a ‘forest’. Tange’s ‘Plan for Tokyo 1960’ was designed for the rapidly increasing industrial and urban sprawl, to provide a new urban proposal for the city’s future. In this plan, the most striking idea was to fill up Tokyo Bay to create artificial land which was intended to cross the bay with a mega-scale linear expansion of interlocking communication routes. This was based on the idea of the linear city with a tree-like structure. 220 Theory, Culture &amp; Society 31(7/8) at UNIV FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS on June 19, 2015tcs.sagepub</context>

In the not too distant future the impact of a second technological revolution will change the basic nature of overall society. (cited in Jencks, 1973: 71) Hence, the Metabolists’ megastructures can be found to have some commonalities with their counterparts in the West: the fundamental premise is the strong belief that 20th-century advanced technology could open up the new paradigm of utopian human life. Some of the main characteristics include: 1. megastructures consist of a ‘core’ (main framework), ‘jointed-together’ units, capsules or cells and constructed collective units; 2. individual units, capsules or cells can be ‘plugged-in’ or ‘clipped-on’ to the core framework and ‘plugged-out’ from the core framework; 3. the core framework has</context>

The profound tragedies they experienced would reflect their perception of the future world. They could not believe in an eternal stable society. For them, a future world could be characterized more by the precognition of catastrophe than expectations of utopia. Yet the need for utopia can always be found in the middle of dystopian times as utopia offers ‘compensatory escapism’ (Levitas, 1982: 53) or the moratorium of the future status quo. If the Metabolists were fatalistic they would need a utopia, because establishing continuity from the (catastrophic) present to the hopeful future was so challenging. The more catastrophic the society in which you live, the more you need a utopian fantasy. Hence, it can be said that the Metabolists’ techno-utopianism emerged amidst the dystopian vision prominent in Japanese society in the 1960s.

Here we can see there is an inescapable paradox between their idealistic philosophical conception and their aim to practically design the city (see Lin, 2010: 95). On the one hand, the Metabolists pursued the goal of egalitarian and democratic living environments for as many people as possible. They believed that the mass production and systematic quality control of materials by development architectural technology could make it possible to create innovative living spaces. On the other hand, the central control system for the megastructure ultimately requires centralization and planned control, in line with the Metabolists’ main ambition to be ‘social architects’ and social engineers.

They also thought that the increasing mobility and restless metabolic change of the modern city led to weaker ties between people and a particular place or land (see Lin, 2010: 91ff.). In opposition to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Broadacre City, which was based on the idea that the ‘citizen of the United States would be given a minimum of one acre of land per person’, the Metabolists believed that freedom from the land led to greater freedom and mobility for the people. Thus, they proclaimed that the land should be owned and organized by a public institution, not by individuals. The total city system should also be controlled and governed by a central administration.

They all have the same contradiction, and thus the Metabolists’ contradiction can be seen in continuity with classical utopianism. In some ways, it was part of the Metabolists’ mission to believe in the transformation of society. Although utopias are hard to realize, they can still provide a sense of optimistic future imaginary. This was a similar principle to that of their western counterparts, such as Le Corbusier and Lloyd Wright, who sought to create a new order for the world at large (Lin, 2010: 94). Le Corbusier’s famous slogan ‘Architecture or Revolution’ and Wright’s belief that architecture had ‘an independent role in shaping social life’ suggested that they believed that they were able to ‘correct society on the drawing board’ (Schapiro cited in Scott, 2007: 28). The Metabolists also had similar social ideals and believed that they were able to design the ‘total’ planning of the city in order to create a new society and therefore they would be able to become the dominant social agent and powerful creator of the new Japan. 210 Theory, Culture &amp; Society 31(7/8) at UNIV FEDERAL DE</context>

The new generation of Japanese architects has re-discovered architectural aesthetics in the space inhabited by living organic entities – individuals – as the major actors. If urban life is constituted and constructed by unexpected, unanticipated and incalculable possibilities and risks and thus is always changing and never stable, the individuals in urban life have to negotiate and interchange with their surroundings and need to continuously be recreating and managing ‘the horizon of what we consider to be life’ (see AbdouMaliq, 2011: 355).

In the aftermath of the Second World War, leading western architects came to Japan more frequently: Walter Gropius in 1953 to work on the post-war housing crises; Le Corbusier in 1955 to work for the National Museum of Western Arts and Konrad Wachsmann in 1956 to give a series of seminars at the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Lin, 2010: 16). Konrad Wachsmann and Walter Gropius were well-known as the inventors of the Package House (General Panel System) in the 1940s. Wachsmann’s innovative idea of prefab housing was the ‘wedge connector’, which is a cast-steel mechanism built into the wood frames of the modular three-foot-four-inch plywood panels.

However, his main social responsibility to be a social architect did not go beyond the role of an agent of the government until he announced the ‘Plan for Tokyo 1960’. The plan first appeared on Japan’s national television network NHK as a special TV programme, and its ideas were not published in any architectural journal but instead in the popular news journal Shukan Asahi [Asahi Weekly]. As a result of this, the plan received instant public attention. This gesture suggested that his plan was not commissioned by the government and therefore it was his own proposal of a future Tokyo (Lin, 2010: 144–6). The plan was eventually taken up by the Japanese Minister of Transportation as a potential national project. Although the plan was never realized, at this point Tange become an autonomous social reformer or social engineer, not just an agent. 16.

AbdouMaliq also emphasizes the uncertainty of urbanism, which is always in process and progress. He remarks: ‘The exigencies of dwelling require a constant process of converting what is accessible into the tools of new possibilities and attention’, adding that ‘The distance between reiteration and change is always uncertain, and long histories of repetition need not constitute likely guarantees’ (2013: 2</context>

In his book Towards an Organic Architecture (1950), Bruno Zevi argues that the structure of organic architecture is ‘like an organism that grows in accord with the laws of its own individual existence, with its own specific order, in harmony with its own functions and with its environment’ (cited in Neder, 2008: 132). This architectural concept was followed by Walter Curt Behrendt, who was identified by Frank Lloyd Wright as the founder of organic architecture. Behrendt also used plants as a metaphor to describe his buildings (Neder, 2008: 122–33). Like their western counterparts who developed the idea of the organism as the key concept to describe the nature of urban evolution, members of the Metabolists also believed that with modern technology and design, modern architecture could change society and people’s everyday lives.

The Metabolists were strongly inspired by Tange’s architectural practices, theoretical articulation of city planning and professional identity as a social architect. Clearly, the Metabolists were influenced not only by the global modern architectural movements but also by dramatic technological advances and the progress of science. Therefore their concepts were inspired by genetics, biology, space technology, computer science, communication technology and modern art in the 20th century. The term Metabolism referred to a biological world of metamorphosis and transformation (Pernice, 2007: 358–9). The city was seen as a living organism, growing in symbiosis with its own functions and environments. This suggests an appreciation of themutability of nature and the recognition that the practice of building should be attuned to such natural processes.20 The Metabolists believed that the city is a process and changeable, thus it is formless and ‘non-plan’ (Hughes and Sadler, 2000). However, architects paradoxically need to make a plan for the city. Although they embraced people’s autonomy and freedom in the future society, their major concept, megastructure, was accompanied by the i</context>

An influential member, Peter Cook, devised a plug-in principle which combined many elements of megastructure: ‘the principle of collectivity, of interchangeable units and the incorporation of rapid transport links’ (Sadler, 2005: 14). The Plug-In City was designed for the accelerating flux of city life; what Cook would call the ‘come-go’ of Plug-In City was opposed to the orthodox urban planning with its characteristics of clean, zoned, and hierarchical separation. ‘Plug-In planning promoted architecture as an event that could only be realized by the active involvement of its inhabitants’ (Sadler, 2005: 16; emphasis in original).

This could resonate with Archigram’s ‘Living City’ which sought to not only liberate people in the city by celebrating technological innovation but also empower the inhabitants to create their own way of life. Archigram focused more on the inhabitants as individuals who were incalculable living entities, and acknowledged that the individuals were significant active entities who could contribute to creating a ‘Living City’, which appreciated the immediacy and feeling for urban life. ‘The future would not be the architect’s total design, but a collaboration between architect and inhabitants’ (Sadler, 2005: 65).

Tange’s ‘Tokyo City Plan 1960’, for instance, was the project which attempted to create ‘a total system of the city’ for populations of ten million or more. His perception of the mega scale of the city was inspired by modern architects in the West.
