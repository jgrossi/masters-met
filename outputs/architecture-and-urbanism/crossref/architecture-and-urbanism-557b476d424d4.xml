the relationship between fiction and architecture. (Stuart, 2011) The September 2010
headline sounded more like science fiction than a news report: 'Pool-side death ray
singes Las Vegas hotel guest' (CNN, 2011). 'It felt like I had a chemical burn',
reported the victim, a vacationing Chicago attorney who was subjected to intense heat
as he reclined poolside at his luxury hotel. 'I couldn't imagine why my head was
burning. Within 30 seconds, the back of my legs were burning. My first thought was,
Jesus, they destroyed the ozone layer!' ( Daily Mail, 2010). Despite apocalyptic
overtones, the ray was not a product of the ravages of climate change but a direct
outcome of a different nexus of nature, culture, and economics: Mojave Desert
sunlight refracted off the sleek, curved, glass surface of the new Vdara
Hotel-Condominium on the Strip. Due to a design flaw the glass wall of the hotel
inadvertently directs the sun above the urban oasis onto the pool area in a
condensed, magnified, and potent beam of light, increasing the poolside temperature
by 20 degrees at the height of the midday sun. The beam melts plastic drinking cups
and scorches guests, moving slowly across the deck expanse as the earth rotates to
complete the effect that the hotel management dismisses as a 'solar convergence
phenomenon'. The Vdara Hotel, designed by Uruguayan 'starchitect' Rafael Vinoly, is
part of Las Vegas' dazzling new CityCenter complex. CityCenter is a remarkably
ambitious $8.7 billion development, jointly financed by Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts
International and Dubai World, the investment company of the emirate (Berzon, 2010;
see Figure 1). Construction of the five-year project was completed in 2011. Conceived
as a selfcontained residential, gambling, and shopping enclave on the Strip, complete
with iconic buildings designed by celebrity architects, 'pocket parks' and notable
public artworks, CityCenter is reportedly the most expensive privately-funded
construction project ever built in the USA, and perhaps one of the most audacious
attempts in world history to conceive and construct an encapsulated urban
neighborhood. It is also arguably a resounding failure. The property's soft opening
in 2009 coincided with the global economic crisis, and no doubt the immense amount of
debt incurred in construction of the glass towers of CityCenter contributed in some
small way to the crunch. The development's subsequent underperformance is
illustrative of both the political economy and cultural logics of financialization.
'Financialization must be understood as a profoundly spatial phenomenon, holding out
as it does the promise of a financial, spatial-temporal fix for the crisis tendencies
of capitalism' (French et al., 2011: 814). Both the urban enclave of CityCenter and
glass architecture of the Vdara Hotel may be understood as spatial expressions of
financialization. While Manuel Castells (2000: 434) claims that the 21st-century

global financial economy and information society, I suggest that the enclosed enclave
in its many guises, from special economic zones to gated communities, is the locus of
capital containment for our age (Easterling, 2005, 2007; Jameson, 1990). Indeed,
these claims are not incompatible. For Castells, the defining feature of the
mega-city is its discontinuous and disjunctive social geography, the distinctive
feature of being globally connected and locally disconnected ' ' (2000: p. 436); I
argue that the enclave is such a 'locally disconnected' site. The enclave is a scalar
surrogate for both the nation-state that organized and regulated the Fordist economy
and the modernist city that was the locus of industrial production and collective
consumption. Both the perils and the promise of the contemporary city emanate from
such locales. CityCenter's lackluster performance is indicative of Las Vegas'
downturn in the wake of the global financial crisis, but also of the current
vivication of the gaming industry in the Chinese enclave of Macau and the
recomposition of capitalism itself in East Asia. As a Special Administrative Region
(SAR) of the PRC located within the Pearl River Delta mega-city, Macau is a 'globally
connected and locally disconnected' locale whose phantasmagoric glass cityscape is
now the world's most lucrative site of casino gaming revenue. In this article I
analyze MGM's glass projects in Las Vegas and Macau in order to explore the formal
relations among financialization, enclave urbanism, and glass architecture, and the
importance of each to the contemporary economy of derivative speculation that itself
increasingly resembles a global casino. Taken together, CityCenter and Macau are
revealing of the state of the city, as well as the importance of the city to the
state - indeed, of the city-state - in the current composition of global capitalism.
The enclave may be understood as a commodified and derivative urban form. Much like a
derivative financial instrument, the enclave's value is derived from a potent
speculative package of assets, indices, and underliers, to form what Keller
Easterling (2005: 1) calls a 'spatial product' or 'real estate cocktail'. Like a
mortgage-backed security, the disposition of this mixture can be volatile. When the
speculation is wrong, as was the case with CityCenter, the scale of lost revenues may
be so significant that it has reverberations for the global economy: the entire
edifice may eventually implode under the weight of failed financial expectations.
However, when the wager pays off like it has in the quasistate of Macau - with its
unique regime of legal exceptionalism and strategic management of cross-border flows
of people and capital - the result is an occult explosion of liquid profits. Glass
Architecture as Material Component and Aesthetic Feature of Financialization Finance
capital seeks reproduction in enclaves - Special Administrative Regions, corporate
cities, quasi-states, and various other zones of encapsulated urbanity or juridical
exception - yet financialization takes its tangible form in glass architecture like
the Vdara Hotel. The Vdara Hotel's fac&#xB8;ade is not merely application of an
architectural aesthetic technique but can be understood as a 'formal overtone'
(Jameson, 1998: 44) of the finance capitalism used to construct the hotel and the
larger project. While the relationship among glass and financialization may not be
immediately apparent, I will argue that glass is as important to contemporary
post-Fordist capitalism as was the railroad or copper wire to earlier stages.
Fiber-optic cables facilitate financialization as instantaneous capital movements
rely on transcontinental telecommunications networks, what Stephen Graham (1999) has
called 'global grids of glass'. These cables conjoin glass and light to circulate the
digitized information of the network society that appears on our computer screens and
mobile devices, forming the 'space of flows' (Castells, 2000), the architecture of
contemporary social life that is as ubiquitous as it is invisible. Fiber optics are
not only a key component of flexible forms of accumulation but enable flexible
specialization, flexible time, 'Toyotist' supply chain management, locational
strategies of production, and essentially all other factors of the post-Fordist
economy. As I will discuss later, the glass curtain wall shares homologies with the
terminal screen, and the reflective surfaces of post-industrial cities appear
increasingly like mediated space (McQuire, 2008). The networked economy is an economy
of glass. However, glass is not only an integral material component of fiberoptic
communications, it also embodies the sleek, seductive aesthetic of financialization.
In their analysis of contemporary corporate advertising, Landscapes of Capital
Goldman and Papson (2011) analyze the discursive that are conjured in these mediated
representations of the financial economy. They find 'the representational equivalent
of hyperreal capital' (p. 51) in images and evocations of speed, flexibility, and
technological integration in the advertisements produced by companies like Wachovia,
Enron, Cisco, and Merrill Lynch, which are (or were) key players in the financial
economy. In these discursive evocations and mediations of capital, economic life
enabled by digital telecommunications and deregulation appears smooth, frictionless,
and transparent, much like the surface of the glass curtain wall of the Vdara Hotel.
'The dream of Capital is a friction-free network in which information and commodities
flow at unlimited rates' (Goldman and Papson, 2011: 20). Understood in this way,
glass architecture - particularly in relation to the 'beams of light' that in
corporate advertisements become 'the most common signifier of the flow of ideas' (p.
33) - embodies both functional and representational features of financialization. In
short, the immaterial economy of post-Fordism seeks a spatial fix in the enclave,
while the dematerialized capital of fiber optics enabled financialization finds its
form in glass architecture. French et al. (2011) 'argue that work on financialization
has been insufficiently attentive to: the role of space and place; the geography of
money and finance; and earlier work in the Marxist and international
political-economy tradition that effectively focused on the problem of
financialization before the neologism was coined and mobilized.' I will bring these
very factors - social space, financial geography, political economy - together to
explore the form and function of glass architecture in Las Vegas and Macau. I will
first trace the importance of glass to historical formations of capitalism and the
critical and utopian responses it has provoked from Walter Benjamin, Paul Scheerbart,
and Fredric Jameson. Then I will analyze the 'fictitious capital' of financialization
and its materialization in the glass resorts of Las Vegas and Macau. I hope to
address both the functional and representational dimensions of glass architecture. In
order to 'read' the contemporary cities of Las Vegas and Macau, I seek intertextual
legibilities among fictitious capital that enables grand architectural projects in
city centers around the world; expressionist fictional representations of glass
architecture and its utopian transformative potential; and actual glass buildings
that themselves dissimulate in a manner not unlike fiction. I proceed through a
series of inter-referential vignettes and parables, ranging from cultural history to
political economy to literary criticism to architectural theory to journalistic
reportage that, taken together, I hope will illuminate the complex articulations
among urban enclaves, glass buildings, and fictitious capital. 'It is difficult', I
agree, 'to exaggerate the relationship between fiction and architecture.' Glass,
Glass Architecture, Capital, Capitalism The new glass resorts of Las Vegas and Macau
have a vitreous lineage. The modern glass industry was established principally in the
city-state of Venice in the 13th to 16th centuries; the industry developed alongside
the historical development of capitalism, and glass itself became a key component of
accumulation. The specific role or function of glass has varied in different stages
of capitalist development, serving as a commodity itself in Italy to producer of the
commodity fetish in France; and from utopian crystalline technology in the
expressionist pre-war dreams of Weimar Germany, to the depoliticized architectural
form of the International Style. Venice and Paris Glass was an early commodity that
Venice produced for trade. Fine glassware was an element of European civility and
refinement during the Renaissance, one material manner in which people could display
new types of distinction enabled by the new wealth generated by capitalism (McCray,
1998). Glassmaking was one of the oldest industries in France as well, though until
the 17th century French glass production was generally of a common variety that could
not compare with the work of the Venetian artisans. In 1687, however, French
glassmaker Bernard Perrot developed an innovative technique of plate glass production
that involved casting the glass rather than blowing it, and Paris ultimately became
the site of the most pervasive developments in glass architecture (Scoville, 1941,
1942; Fierro, 2003: 9; Richards, 2008). Notwithstanding the lethal luminosity of Las
Vegas, Paris was the original 'city of light', center of not only philosophical
enlightenment but of fashion, art, and culture; urban planning, banking, and finance;
cafes, department stores, and arcades. Glass was crucial to this constellation.
Constructed in the early 19th century, the arcades were a triumph of iron and glass
architecture, arching over passages between buildings to create interior consumer
spaces that were precursors to the department 1 store, shopping mall, and hotel
atrium (see Missac, 1995). When Walter Benjamin visited the arcades in the 1920s,
they appeared to him like the ur-form or natural history of capitalist modernity, a
repository of the utopian dreams of a previous epoch. Expressionism and Weimar
Germany In the imagination of fin de siecle`German expressionist writer Paul
Scheerbart as well as his intellectual contemporaries who formed the Crystal Chain,
glass had a didactic transformative potential. Scheerbart was fascinated by glass
architecture, writing a book on the subject as well as a number of playful utopian
stories in which it featured (Scheerbart, 1972, 2001, 2010). Scheerbart saw in glass
construction and ornamentation a key to architectural change that he thought would
enable wholesale cultural evolution. From Scheerbart's perspective the largely brick
building materials of industrial capitalism led to necessarily 'closed rooms' that
reflected closed minds and closed relationships (Bletter, 1975, 1981); growth would
only be possible to the extent that glass construction opened environments to the
elements. 'Glass opens up a new age', he suggested prophetically, while 'Brick
building does only harm.' Thus, the advantage of glass architecture over brick was
not simply technical or economic, but moral. Scheerbart's best known work is probably
Glass Architecture. It is easy to misread this peculiar book, comprised of 111
aphorisms, transparently as a kind of 'how to' guide of practical and technical
recommendations to integrate glass features into homes, botanical gardens, and public
spaces. 'As air is one of the worst conductors of heat', he writes, 'the double glass
wall is an essential condition for all glass architecture' (Scheerbart, 1972: 42).
Or: 'it is clearly advisable to build glass houses only in the temperate zones' (p.
42). When designing the Vdara Hotel, Rafael Vinoly probably should have paid heed to
Scheerbart's admonition: 'An occasional mirrorwall close to a pool is worth
considering. But not too many' (p. 42). Viewed from a more opaque angle, however, and
in the context of Scheerbart's interest in the alchemical properties of crystal
(Bletter, 1981) Glass and his experiments with perpetual motion (Scheerbart, 2011),
Architecture is no design primer. It is nothing less than a fantastical account of an
errant glass addition to a veranda that spontaneously crystallizes and expands across
the garden and beyond, eventually growing into a glass cityscape that ultimately
covers the entire earth's surface. Whoever has provided his veranda with
colour-ornamented glass on three sides will soon want to have more glass
architecture. One thing leads to another, and to stop the process is unthinkable. So
the veranda continues to grow; in the end it emancipates itself from the main
building, and may become the main building itself. To promote this evolution of the
veranda will be the chief task of every glass architect. (Scheerbart, 1972: 44) Once
unleashed, Scheerbart implies, crystallization inhabits its own form of perpetual
motion and takes a material and sensible shape in architecture and cityscapes. We
will see later how this belief in divine vitrification resonates with the devout
discourses deploying deregulatory practices and fiber-optic technology to enable
financialization. Scheerbart and fellow visionaries like his architect friend Bruno
Taut imagined this alchemical potential of glass architecture and its crystalline
properties; they conceived of glass structures that would transform people who passed
through them in the same manner that crystal transforms light. 'Coloured
glass/destroys hatred', penned Scheerbart, words that were etched on Taut's Glass
Pavilion, a structure built for display at Werkbund the Cologne Exhibition of 1914.
The multi-colored glass structure and kaleidoscopic interior lights of the
pineapple-shaped pavilion were designed to create an immersive crystalline effect
that would serve to uplift the spirit and moral countenance of visitors. The
Transparent Rationalism of the International Style While Taut's glass house did not
survive the exhibition, his forays into glass design influenced his contemporaries.
In the early 20th century, refined glass and steel materials became key components of
the architectural movement known as the International Style whose proponents eschewed
ornamental facades to emphasize the 'honest expression of structure' and the truthful
display of the function of materials in the construction of buildings. Glass served
to highlight ideals of transparency and verity of architectural design, and such
buildings came to define the cities of industrial capitalism. Glass architecture of
the International Style was not simply a container for 20th-century capitalist
enterprise, it played a functional role in technological and financial innovation.
Reinhold Martin (2003) demonstrates that with the technological and economic changes
of the post-war military-industrial complex, a modular and flexible corporate
architecture emerged in the United States that enabled the subjection of a new type
of technocratic organization man steeped in the dual guises of profit-driven
innovation and corporate 'human relations'. Martin's account of this 'organizational
complex' reads like a dystopian application of the transformative possibilities that
fascinated Scheerbart and 2 Taut. Architects like Eero Saarinen and the firm of
Skidmore, Owens &amp; Merrill covered the corporate offices of such companies as IBM,
General Motors, and Bell Telephone - the latter whose labs were the site of important
developments in glass fiber-optic technology - with increasingly thin glass curtain
walls creating an 'affect [that] approached the glare of the photographic plate or of
the television screen' (Martin, 3 2003: 10). The aim was not simply pre-fabricated
modular flexibility but crafting an organizational identity befitting a mass consumer
culture. The glass surfaces of the buildings reproduced and replicated the more
generalized social experience of media distraction. According to Martin, watchedin
passing rather than looked 'like network television - its historical contemporary -
the architecture of the curtain wall is a medium to be at like an artwork' (p. 6).
Glass as a 'Formal Overtone' of Finance Capital To understand their relation to
capital, the glass resorts of CityCenter and Macau must be situated within the
preceding historical context, but their function becomes evident only when examined
from a contemporary vantage point. The Vdara Hotel death ray enabled by the glass
fac&#xB8;ade calls to mind Jameson's (1998) evocative comments about the architecture
of late capitalism, structures which are characterized by the immateriality of the
glass curtain wall. If Scheerbart saw the transition from brick to glass materials as
indicative of moral progress, Jameson investigates the underlying economic logic.
Searching for the series of mediations 'which leads from finance capital through land
speculation to aesthetics and cultural production itself', Jameson finds in the
'enclosed skin volumes' of post-modern glass architecture a 'formal overtone' of
finance capitalism. From this perspective, the glass skin of a building like the
Vdara Hotel 'dematerializes without signifying in any way spirituality' (Jameson,
1998: 44) in the same manner in which the finance economy creates an abstracted and
dematerialized form of capital. This contemporary glass architecture is homologous
with both the fiberoptic materials that enable financialization as well as the
frictionless form of its discursive representation. In the case of the Vdara Hotel,
the errant ray of light refracted off the building's surface into a 'death ray'
mimics the play of glass and light in a fiber-optic cable. It is architecture
appropriate for a post-Fordist economic regime. For Marx, fictitious capital was
simply credit, capital that was assumed to come from the earnings of future
production. Today, fictitious capital presumes profits will accrue withoutproduction
(see Comaroff and Comaroff, 2000), and may be derived simply by commodifying the
credit risk itself in endless aleatory cycles. This is the utopian fantasy of
fiber-optic enabled financial capital - 'that it can surmount its own crisis
tendencies and overcome its own limits by generating value through its own pure
circulation' (Goldman and Papson, 2011: 21). This contemporary incarnation of alchemy
displaces Scheerbart's and Taut's belief in crystal power to the 21st century: both
faiths rely on the enabling function of glass. Political commitment to deregulation
of financial markets in the 1980s similarly converged with new technical innovations
in glass - in this case fiber-optic information technologies - and emerging utopian
assumptions about the planetary connectivity of telecommunications (Castells, 2000;
Taylor, 2004). With the rapid expansion of the financial economy, exponential salary
increases for finance executives lured young mathematicians and physicists away from
once-coveted cold-war corporate research jobs in the military-industrial complex and
to the finance industry where they now engineer increasingly complex trading
algorithms and derivative instruments that colonize fiber-optic networks to monetize
the future; the end result is the 'financialization of everything' (Harvey, 2007:
33). This hermetic feature of financialization enhanced by incessant neoliberal
evangelization has made the global financial system today appear like 'nothing as
much as a vast casino' (Strange, 1986: 1). Therefore, if the political economy of
19th-century industrial production required the solid foundations of brick
construction that Scheerbart thought created closed cultures, and the modular
glass-curtain corporate architecture of IBM and Bell Laboratories communicated
flexibility and integration for the cybernetic capitalism of the cold war (Martin,
2003), then the 'materialist sublimation' (Jameson, 1998: 44) of the financial
economy is best rendered in curving glass walls like those of the Vdara Hotel. It is
architecture appropriate for an era in which accumulation seems to have been
decoupled from production and financial profits are derived from the opaque
perambulations of finance itself. But more than produced that, it is architecture
that is directly by financialization and which makes the built environment in its own
image: fragile, brittle 'global grids of glass'. The mediation of contemporary glass
architecture I am proposing is distinct from Jameson's famous description of the
Bonaventure Hotel, where 'the glass skin achieves a peculiar and placeless
disassociation of Bonventura the from its neighborhood' (1998: 82) and the interior
constitutes a delirious and depthless hyperspace which locates the subject
experientially in an otherwise ungraspable global economic system. Rather, in a
manner homologous with the commodified urban enclave, I am proposing new glass
architecture as an intimation of derivative and securitized property. One thing that
distinguishes the contemporary phase of finance capital from earlier phases is its
reliance on the securitization of mortgages and other forms of real estate, 'a
profound institutional transformation in which the real estate sector has come to
resemble an economic sector composed of finance markets and instruments rather than a
sector defined by producer markets' (Gotham, 2009: 357). According to Kevin Fox
Gotham (2009), the desire to overcome the time lag between constructing the built
environment and realizing accumulation from subsequent production or rent, and to
quickly convert capital fixed in the built environment into profit, has led to this
wave of real estate securitization that aims to transform 'opaque and illiquid assets
into liquid and transparent securities': adjustable rate mortgages, mortgage-backed
securities, real estate investment trusts, and so on (Gotham, 2009: 357). This
breathless impatience for immediate returns from what was formerly treated as a
long-term investment in real estate is enabled by the time-space compression that
results from fiber-optic technologies and the space of flows. 'Time is critical to
the profit-making of the whole system. It is the speed of the transaction, sometimes
automatically preprogrammed in the computer to make quasi-instantaneous decisions,
that generates the gain - or the loss', contends Castells (2000: 466). Furthermore, a
significant and growing number of financial transactions are based on making value
out of the capture of future time in present transactions, as in the futures,
options, and other derivative capital markets. Together these new financial products
dramat` ically increase the mass of nominal capital vis-a-vis bank deposits and
assets, so that everybody bets on and with future money anticipated in computer
projections. (2000: 466) Perhaps this cybernetic compression of time and space
similarly decreases the historical distance of the critical gaze in a manner that
might orient our perspective toward glass architecture today. This immediacy and
contemporaneity distinguishes our age from earlier phases of capitalism. Benjamin's
revolutionary critique was driven by his retrospective attenprevious tion to the
detritus of the era. Benjamin's insights about the mythology of capitalism emanated
from his discovery of its pre-history in the iron and glass Parisian arcades a
generation after their demise. But today, fiber-optic technology has produced a new
temporality that has eradicated that historical distance. The 'truth' of
fiber-optic-enabled financialization resides directly in the surfaces of the new
glass architecture of the Global Style (Foster, 2011), despite the fact that it seems
so 4 naked, bare, and transparent. As capital switches from the primary circuit of
industrial manufacturing to the secondary circuit of real estate investment, glass
architecture mediates the dialectical relation between illiquid spatial fixity on one
hand, and financial liquidity on the other. This form of transparent crystalline real
estate investment in commodified urban enclaves emerges from the very process of
'converting opaque and illiquid assets into liquid and transparent securities'
(Gotham, 2009: 357). The Violence of Finance Capital If the design of the Vdara Hotel
may be understood as a formal representation of an economy dominated by the logic of
financialization which dematerializes capital itself and transforms the built
environment into a precarious security, then the manner in which the Vdara Hotel's
glass fac&#xB8;ade fashions sunlight into a lethal ray is an apt metaphor for the
very real 'violence of financial capitalism'. For Christian Marazzi (2010), this
violence results from the post-Fordist 'attempt, in certain ways "parasitic" and
"desperate," to recuperate on the financial markets that which capital could no
longer get in the real economy' (p. 27); this recuperation has 'devastating effects
on employment, wages, and retirement', writes Marazzi. That is, not only on the bare,
unprotected skin of prostrate vacationing attorneys lounging beneath the desert sun,
but 'on the bare life of entire populations' (p. 10). Glass architecture plays a
formal role in this process. Crystallization of both communication networks and glass
architecture across global cityscapes mirrors the spread of the derivative fictitious
capital of neoliberal financialization. Once unleashed by deregulation in the 1980s
global economy steered by Paul Volker, Ronald Reagan, and Margaret Thatcher,
financialization has crept beyond insurance actuarial tables into retirement pension
funds, junk bonds, currency trading algorithms, securitized mortgages, credit default
swaps, collateralized debt obligations, and all manner of derivative instruments and
opportunistic rent-seeking regulatory efforts to gamble against the future 'on the
bare life of entire populations'. 'One thing leads to another', as Scheerbart says,
'and to stop the process is unthinkable.' Las Vegas, Dubai, and the CityCenter The
profits accumulated from the bare life of consumer-citizens, the glass curtain walls
that feature in iconic architecture of the Global Style, the violence of
dematerialized forms of capital produced by a post-Fordist economic regime - these
subjects and spaces converge in the CityCenter of Las Vegas today. CityCenter
occupies 67 acres of land on the Las Vegas Strip and comprises 18 million square feet
of indoor space. Aside from the Vdara Hotel, the complex has another
hotel-condominium, Mandarin Oriental, as well as two 400-room boutique hotels, Aria
and Harmon, and a dual-towered condominium construction called the Veer Towers. At
the base of the buildings sits Crystals (a name that would have delighted Sheerbart),
a 500,000 square-foot luxury shopping mall designed by Daniel Libeskind, the renowned
architect behind the Jewish Museum in Berlin and the post-9/11 World Trade Center
reconstruction. The gleaming towers of CityCenter were designed by a who's who of
celebrity architects and architectural firms, including not only Vinoly but Norman
Foster, Cesar Pelli, Helmut Jahn, Kohn Pederson Fox, and Gensler, which oversaw the
master plan. CityCenter features $40 million of public artworks by Robert
Rauschenberg, Claus Oldenberg, Frank Stella and Henry Moore, and pieces commissioned
especially for the site by Jenny Holzer, Nancy Rubins, and Maya Lin (Friess, 2009).
When Dubai World announced its $2.96 billion purchase of 50 percent of the CityCenter
project equity in 2007, the Chairman of the company, His Excellency Sultan Ahmed Bin
Sulayem, called it 'one of the most exciting private sector developments in modern
history. CityCenter is the most ambitious real estate project ever undertaken in Las
Vegas', he claimed, 'and rivals any similar project around the world. Its global
significance cannot be underestimated' (MGM Mirage, 2009). The decision to build
iconic glass towers rather than themed simulations more typical of the resorts on the
Strip was not motivated merely by evolving architectural tastes. It was, rather, an
attempt to fashion what Castells calls a 'node' for accumulation. According to
Castells (2000), 'the nodes of the space of flows include residential and
leisure-oriented spaces which, along with the location of headquarters and their
ancillary services, tend to cluster dominant functions in carefully segregated
spaces, with easy access to cosmopolitan complexes of arts, culture, and
entertainment' (2000: 446-7). MGM Mirage CEO Jim Murren, who conceived of the
original plan, described the project as 'a very ambitious masterplanned community'
(quoted in Freiss, 2009) ostensibly constructed for the elites of the information
society. 'They've heard of Rafael Vinoly and Cesar Pelli and Norman Foster and Daniel
Libeskind, and they've stayed at the Mandarin', he said. 'They are the
multibillionaires, the centimillionaires, some of the wealthiest people in the world,
people who are doing business in Abu Dhabi, Cairo, Mumbai' (Freiss, 2009). The
CityCenter project was plagued by problems long before the death ray. The complex was
conceived at the height of Las Vegas visitor arrivals and a booming economy and real
estate sector in the city, but over the five year construction process the original
$5 billion project ballooned to nearly $9 billion while the severe world economic
downturn led to falling rates of tourism and consumption that was particularly
detrimental to Las Vegas resort revenues. MGM Mirage flirted with bankruptcy and in
2009 Dubai World sued their partner for mismanagement of the project's construction,
though it eventually dropped the suit and the Sultan of Dubai attended the opening
celebration (Benston, 2009). By the time the initial phase of CityCenter was ready to
open to the public, 5 Dubai Las Vegas suffered the worst housing market in the
nation. World no doubt came to regret its role in the project. By the date of the
December 2009 opening of the first phase of CityCenter, Dubai's economy was in
freefall as the Emirate had announced just a month before the inability to meet
repayment obligations on nearly $25 billion of loans (Sharif and Hall, 2011). The
sultan who had masterminded the territory's equity purchase of half of the CityCenter
venture amassed a staggering $40 billion debt for Dubai World. Within a year he was
removed from his post as chairman of the company, proving prescient his own 1997
prediction about CityCenter: 'Its global significance cannot be underestimated.' A
host of development projects in Dubai either sit partially completed or never got
past the drawing board as economic woes have severely tempered the aspirations of
Dubai's sovereign to create his own Ville-Lumiere,complete with rows of glittering
glass towers along Sheik Zayad Road and around the Dubai Marina, and brought many of
the Emirate's ambitious projects to a standstill. If it is correct that finance is a
spatial phenomenon, then 'In order to understand processes of financialization and
their complex geographies . . . it is vital to follow the networks of contemporary
financialized capitalism wherever they may lead' (French et al., 2011: 809). We will
see in this case that these networks lead from CityCenter to not only the city-states
of Dubai and Macau, but ultimately to sovereign states as far afield as Pyongyang,
Beijing, Reykjavik, and Washington, DC. The Reincarnation of Las Vegas in Macau and
Capitalism in East Asia Crucial to the neoliberal experiment launched in the West by
Reagan and Thatcher was Deng Xiaopeng's transformation of China's socialist economy
(see Harvey, 2007). In 1978 Deng took the first steps in his project to establish a
market economy with his Southern Tour to the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) of Shenzhen.
According to Deng's strategy, both Shenzhen and the Zhuhai SEZ, respectively located
adjacent to the colonies of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as a string of other SEZs
along the south China coast, would function collectively as laboratories of
production where the PRC would allow Western companies to establish enterprises in
order to study techniques of capitalist production, manufacturing, management, and
private property (Chuihua et al., 2001). This process eventually formed what is for
Castells (2000: 436) the prototypical network society mega-city, the 'Hong
Kong-ShenzhenCanton-Pearl River Delta-Macau-Zhuhai metropolitan regional system'.
Deng's experiment has succeeded beyond anyone's expectations, and we will see that
Macau plays a crucial role in enabling the circulation of capital through this
system. Today rural China is urbanizing on a vast scale. China is pursuing urbanism
itself as an accumulation strategy (Wu, 2009) and using macroeconomic policy to
encourage domestic consumption, resulting in a wholesale transformation of not only
the landscape but of the Chinese subject. This transformation is evidenced by the
sight of eager Chinese tourists queuing outside of Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and Chanel
shops in Macau and Hong Kong. The future of Chinese consumption will depend on these
members of the emerging middle class who increasingly visit Macau on tourist visas
enabled by new central government policies. Capitalism's ongoing recomposition in the
market-socialist regime of the PRC involves merging the post-Fordist and
post-socialist economies in interstitial sites like Macau and the SEZs and
transforming those overaccumulated Chinese workers into consumers; perhaps they will,
in turn, help address the over-accumulations of capital in the West. Scheerbart and
Benjamin might have pointed to the transformative potential of glass architecture in
such a project. If the SEZs were laboratories of production, the city-state of Macau
SAR could be understood as a laboratory of post-socialist consumption, a site where
the central government of the PRC tests policies to stimulate tourism while Chinese
subjects hone habits conducive to consumerism (Simpson, 2009, 2011). The enclave
subsumes the functions heretofore managed by the state which often capitalizes off
enclaves in the sort of tribute system that has existed in East Asia for several
millennia. Such sites are central to capitalist expansion in the region today.
Specifically, to use Castell's (2000: 443) terminology, Macau is both a 'hub' and a
'node' in the mega-city region. As an interstitial tourist city, paradoxically both
inside and outside the PRC, and visited by 28 million people in 2012, hub it is a
communication . As the only site of legal casino gambling in the PRC, as well as a
destination for select Chinese nationals from relatively affluent cities and
provinces to whom the central government grants special travel visas to visit the
SARs, Macau's juridical exceptionalism node makes it a strategic for the circulation
of capital and the pedagogy of capitalist enterprise. Macau's potent 'spatial
cocktail' includes investment in the built environment from transnational actors;
porous borders combined with an interstitial identity; graduated management of
mainland Chinese tourist arrivals; and a peculiar gaming regulatory regime that was
forged during Portugal's weak colonial administration. Macau's Transformation into a
Glass City-State The first and last European colony in Asia, Macau was returned by
Portugal to the PRC in 1999 after nearly half a millennium of Portuguese rule.
Gambling has been legal in Macau since 1847, and the modern casino industry dates
back 70 years, during which time it has operated as a monopoly concession granted by
the local Portuguese administration in exchange for a percentage of the profits. Hong
Kong billionaire Stanley Ho controlled that monopoly from 1962 to 2002. When the PRC
regained control of Macau, the government dissolved the monopoly and liberalized
Macau's gaming industry, ultimately allowing six companies to operate as
concessionaires. Through this process MGM Resorts International, as well as Las Vegas
entrepreneurs Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson, entered the Macau casino market. Over
the past decade the post-colonial cityscape of Macau, characterized by a combination
of quaint pastel-colored Portuguese churches and municipal buildings built in the
17th to 19th centuries, has been transformed into a postmodern phantasmagoria.
Scheerbart's prediction of the inevitable expansion of glass architecture across the
globe seems prescient, and indeed financialization has crystallized the territory.
Today Macau's cityscape sparkles with all manner of glass and crystalline amusements
which might serve as 'formal overtones' of fictitious capital. The dome-shaped base
of Ho's flagship Grand Lisboa Casino, which opened in 2007, is comprised of the
world's largest integrated LED screen, featuring colorful displays of animated
roulette wheels and rolling dice (see Figure 2). The mediated screen surface of the
building that resembles Taut's glass pavilion conjoins glass architecture,
crystalline ornamentation, fiber optics, and images of gambling in a perfect mimetic
representation of financialization. Displayed in the lobby of the casino is the
world's largest cushion diamond, the 218 carat Star of Stanley Ho, bought by its
namesake for $100 million. Macau's Sands Casino, built by rival Adelson and covered
in golden glass, features the world's largest crystal chandelier. Wynn's eponymous
resort as well as his Encore property are covered in a tasteful brown glass curtain
wall, and the MGM Macau, Grand Waldo, Star World, Altira, Galaxy, and City of Dreams
properties have remade Macau into a glass state. Even strange glass sculptures have
begun to appear around the city (see Figures 3 &amp; 4). This glass architecture
stands alongside themed resorts like Adelson's $2.4 billion Venetian Macau; the
largest building in Asia, the simulated Venice is a self-contained enclave within the
enclave of Macau. Themed environments and glass architecture function in a
pedagogical project to transform the socialist proletariat of the People's Republic
into capitalist consumers. Three parables about MGM's glass resorts and fictitious
capital in the casino economy of Macau will demonstrate the articulations of each
with global finance. Capital Fictions in Macau MGM's Role in Iceland's Financial
Economy If MGM made a serious misstep with CityCenter, the company's decision to seek
a concession in Macau has proved enormously successful. The MGM property in Macau is
jointly-owned by MGM Grand and Pansy Ho Chiu-king, one of Stanley Ho's 17 children
(by four wives). The company obtained its Macau gaming license by purchasing a
sub-concession of Stanley Ho's own license for $200 million, and subsequently opened
the MGM Grand Macau, an undulating 35-storey building featuring a tri-colored glass
fac&#xB8;ade. The hotel and casino are connected to One Central Macau, a residential
and retail property developed by Stanley Ho's company Shun Tak, for which Pansy Ho is
managing director. The property includes three apartment buildings, a Mandarin
Oriental Hotel, and a luxury shopping mall. The towers were designed by Kohn Pederson
Fox, the architectural firm that 6 designed the Mandarin Oriental property at
CityCenter. MGM's One Central Macau became a footnote to the global financial crisis
in October 2006 when Iceland's financial services and insurance company
Sjova-Almennar Tryggingar HF purchased one entire tower in the as-yet-not-completed
project from Shun Tak for $101 million. The Nordic company was a global trendsetter

economy would be in tatters; deregulated less than a decade earlier, its three banks
faced a massive collective collapse which was to prove in real terms the worst
national banking disaster in global history, and the country teetered on the edge of
bankruptcy. For their part, the people of Iceland felt the full violence of financial
capitalism as the value of the krona was in free fall, inflation soared, and the
economy plunged into a deep recession. The assets of Iceland's pension funds fell by
up to 25 percent, and individual retirements were plundered to service the debt. The

a scale so massive it was described by a Florida Supreme Court Justice as 'the
largest seizure of private property ever attempted by banks and government entities'
(quoted in Harvey, 2012: 54). Ironically, during the financial crisis the spoils of
drug trafficking was the only source of liquidity accessible to some banks, and they
did not shy away from these ill-gotten gains (Saviano, 2012). Wachovia admitted its
role in laundering Mexican drug war profits, while HSBC handled transactions by not
only drug traffickers but Al Qaeda affiliates and Iranian financiers trying to avoid
US sanctions; the eventual fines on the two banks totaled more than one billion
dollars. The abuses were systemic and systematic. 'ABN Amro, Barclays, Credit Suisse,
Lloyds and ING have reached expensive settlements with regulators after admitting to
executing the transactions of clients in disreputable countries like Cuba, Iran,
Libya, Myanmar and Sudan' (Saviano, 2012: 20). Macau is no exception. In order to
hold a casino license in a jurisdiction in the United States operators must be clear
of criminal connections in any jurisdiction in which they operate, and the Macau
business practices of both Adelson and Wynn are currently under investigation by
authorities in the United States. In May 2009 the New Jersey Division of Gaming
Enforcement released the results of an investigative report that claimed that Stanley
Ho had ties to Chinese criminal concerns. Since Ho is a business associate of his
daughter Pansy, herself in partnership with MGM, this allegation threatened the
gaming license of MGM's Borgata Casino in Atlantic City. Given Atlantic City's poor
economy and the pecuniary potential of Macau, MGM made a relatively simple decision
to divest its stake in New Jersey and throw the company's full weight behind the
China venture, regardless of the concerns raised about the business practices of the
Ho family. When MGM Macau went public on the Hong Kong stock market in May 2011 and
Pansy Ho sold a portion of her 50 percent share of the partnership with MGM, the
return on her original $5 million investment was $1.5 billion. The deal made her the
youngest billionaire in Hong Kong, as well as the city's wealthiest woman (Gough,
2011; see Figure 5). New Jersey's allegations about Ho's underworld ties were not
news to industry insiders. In fact, Ho has long-term business interests with Chinese
triads in operating the VIP gambling concerns in his Macau casinos. The triads act
essentially as institutional loan sharks, fronting gambling money to high-stakes
players from mainland China who cannot otherwise easily move cash across the
tightly-regulated borders of the PRC (Siu, 2007). Wealthy individuals from China who
want to risk millions of dollars in Macau's casinos need access to cash loans in the
territory on the agreement that they will repay gambling losses to the granter of the
loan once they return to the mainland. However, this is complicated by the fact that
gambling debts are not legally enforceable on the mainland; therefore anyone who
makes loans in Macau must be confident of their ability to coerce re-payment through
extra-judicial means. Chinese triads have thus played an instrumental role in Macau
casinos since at least the 1980s, and an innovative vernacular 'rolling chips'
operation funds huge gambling stakes in Macau's casinos (Leong, 2002). In 2006
Macau's casino revenues were the largest in the world, and by 2010 Macau gaming
revenues were quadruple the combined casino revenues of the entire state of Nevada.
Seventy percent of that revenue came from high-stakes baccarat. The local government
tax of nearly 40 percent on gaming revenue generated $15 billion for government
coffers in 2012, making the administration complicit in the system based on collusion
between an oligarchy of state-sanctioned concessionaires and organized crime. Cash
handouts to residents in Macau's wealth-sharing scheme inaugurated in 2008 take on
the appearance of hush money, making the local population complicit. In 2013 each

is difficult to escape regular reminders that these profits are derived off the bare
life of populations. A [Hong Kong] man took a HK$10,700 government grant meant for
the burial of his maternal grandmother and gambled it away in Macau, leaving the
woman's body to languish in a morgue for a year until police and the Social Welfare
Department buried her. (Man, 2010) Fictitious Capital from the DPRK Ho has alleged
ties not only to independent Chinese criminal brotherhoods, but also to North Korea,
which the United States claims is a state-run crime syndicate. Ho has operated a
casino in a hotel in Pyongyang since 1995 (Lintner, 2007). The older half-brother of
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un resides in Macau and often gambles in the city's
casinos. But it is the relationship between the DPRK and another Macau concern that
provides an additional nuance to the movements of fictitious capital. In September
2005 the US State Department used the Patriot Act to designate Macau's family-owned
Banco Delta Asia as a 'primary money laundering concern', with allegations that the
bank was facilitating North Korea's criminal actions. The US Treasury Department
intoned: 'Banco Delta Asia has been a willing pawn for the North Korean government to
engage in corrupt financial activities through Macau, a region that needs significant
improvement in its money laundering controls' (Gaylord, 2008: 297). The move prompted
a run on the bank that resulted in panicked depositors withdrawing $133 million
before the Macau Monetary Authority put the bank in receivership. The accusations
against North Korea involved allegations of drug trafficking and circulating
counterfeit US cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, and currency. The counterfeit currency in
question is $100 'supernotes', the holy grail of faux money which can only be
manufactured with presses and paper identical to those used by the US Mint. For this
reason, there is skepticism about North Korea's ability to manufacture supernotes.
Many participants in a 2006 Interpol conference dedicated to the supernotes concluded
that the US government itself must be the source of the counterfeit notes; suspicion
lingers that the CIA prints the currency in a facility near Washington, DC in order
to fund covert operations outside the oversight of Congress (Gaylord, 2008: 295). The
disturbing possibility that Macau's glass casino resorts could be laundering
counterfeit dollars printed by the CIA and fronted by the Chinese mafia to
post-socialist gamblers from the PRC, all the while running afoul of the State
Department's own prosecution of the Patriot Act, provides a new chapter to Marx's
story of fictitious capital. 'As capital investment sometimes ceases to have a
necessarily immediate relationship with material production', write Goldman and
Papson (2011), 'it becomes an end in itself, chasing its tail through the circuitry
of financial instruments where the referent is no longer necessarily the world of
infrastructure, labor, production, or commodities, but rather a bond, or a security,
or a securitized debt package' (p. 52). Or in this case, the referent is simply money
itself. In the ruse of the counterfeit, even hard currency becomes another type of
derivative, its value derived from the money form which it emulates. This game of
three-card Monte is reminiscent of Enron's 'special purpose vehicles', the shell
companies it created to purchase assets from itself so the revenue could appear on
the company's books while the debt remained hidden (Goldman and Papson, financial
fable's 2011: 57). Enron's ultimate fortunes may foreshadow this fraudulent
denouement. Global Grids of Glass I have tried to take seriously the claim that
financialization is a spatial phenomenon and analyzed how finance capital is fixed
for purposes of accumulation in contemporary enclave spaces which feature glass
architecture. Indeed, as I have noted, technologies of glass production were crucial
to the historical development of capitalism, from the goblets of the city-state of
Venice, to the arcades and display windows of 19thcentury Paris and Weimar Germany
(Lungstrum, 1999), to the sleek surfaces of the North American corporate buildings
that served the post-war cybernetic economy. Glass material has merged with
technological innovations to create mediated cityscapes. The networked space of flows
on which financialization depends today is enabled by the coupling of glass and light
in fiber-optic technology which circulates fictitious and hyperreal forms of capital
in what increasingly appears to be a global casino. I have suggested that glass
architecture in enclave gaming developments in Las Vegas and Macau is a product of
the financial economy which creates these structures in its own image: smooth,
transparent, frictionless, fragile, and fictitious. To comprehend the relationship of
glass architecture to fictitious capital and consumer subjection we must explore not
only the technical features of the buildings themselves but imaginative accounts of
the transformative qualities of glass. Alchemical phantasms of crystallization
animate the deistic convictions of central bank economists who deregulate financial
flows and securities traders who colonize fiber-optic networks to engineer the
economy of dematerialized capital. These glass constructions reproduce both the
technological function and aesthetic form of financialization. Influenced by
Scheerbart and in the wake of the techno-human brutality of the Second World War,
Benjamin (1999) opined that the glass and steel of the International Style had the
value of being traceless: 'they have created rooms where it is hard to leave traces'
(p. 734). Benjamin thought that those who lived through the war would benefit from
this detachment from the past, that glass architecture would constitute a tabula rasa
generational . 'Objects made of glass have no "aura"', he said. 'Glass is an enemy of
secrets. It is also an enemy of possession' 7 (p. 734). But today, in a typically
Benjaminian dialectical reversal, both fiber-optics technology itself and
fiber-optics-enabled financialization have ironically transformed glass into a
material which accumulates both possessions and secrecy, converting illiquid
architectural assets into liquid capital. Glass reproduces capitalism's endemic
violence in the very guise of traceless transparency and the utopian immediacy of
universal communications. The Derivative Cityscape and the Implosion of Value This
returns us, then, to CityCenter, the enclave neighborhood development on the Las
Vegas Strip. 'Utopian space is an imaginary enclave within real social space',
suggests Jameson (2005: 15). For Jameson, in a move that echoes Benjamin's analysis
of the Parisian arcades, the enclave is 'something like a foreign body within the
social' that may potentially 'offer a space in which new wish images of the social
can be elaborated 8 and experimented on' (p. 16). Perhaps CityCenter, not to mention
the city-state of Macau, operates in this manner, a dialectial image counterposing
the utopian dreams of the collective against the neoliberal delusions of fictitious
and hyperreal capital. Built on billions of dollars of debt, CityCenter is not only
an effort to erect a planned urban community; it also inadvertently embodies the
deflationary direction of the derivative-driven global economy, where capital is
fixed in space to create self-contained islands of accumulation, and dematerialized
financialization finds its physical form in glass architecture. Next to the Vdara
Hotel in CityCenter sits the Norman Fosterdesigned Harmon Hotel. Foster is the
epitome of the starchitect and his buildings define the contemporary Global Style
(Foster, 2011). He is responsible for notable glass designs the world over, ranging
from futuristic airports in Hong Kong and Beijing, Zayad National Museum in the
United Arab Emirates, the UAE Pavilion at the Shanghai Expo, and even another City
Center in Washington, DC. But the Harmon Hotel has not fared so well and its failures
belie the empty promise of fictitious capital today. Originally designed to have 49
floors, structural problems in the foundation led to the decision in 2009 to
eliminate nearly half of the building, rendering a completed edifice of only 26
storeys. However, subsequent problems halted the project prior to completion, and it
now sits empty on the Strip. The completed external structure of the building stands
intact but the interior has not been finished and it 9 remains unoccupied. Subsequent
evaluation led an engineering firm to declare the Harmon unsafe due to its inability
to withstand an earthquake, which assessors charged would collapse the tower in what
would be yet another perfect storm of nature, culture, and economics (Garcia, 2011).
Citing the danger posed by the Harmon tower, MGM Mirage is seeking to implode the
building, and is currently engaged in a lawsuit with the construction company; that
company claims that the building can be repaired and alleges that MGM Mirage is
proffering a fiction in order to cut its financial losses (Glass, 2011; Green, 2011).
The glass fac&#xB8;ade of the Harmon Hotel today exists only as the world's most
expensive billboard, publicizing the Elvis Review show playing next door- and thus
constituting an unhappy convergence of the dual guises of hyperreal capital:
advertising and glass architecture. By combining an enticing lambent surface with an
empty structure, the Harmon Hotel vitrifies the very fetish quality - not of the
Fordist commodity which so fascinated Benjamin, but of the commodified and derivative
risk that underpins the post-Fordist financial economy. Effectively a subprime asset
located in a volatile spatial derivative, the Harmon Hotel building stands patiently
waiting to be imploded, eventually no doubt contributing one more spectacle to the
nighttime reveries of the city's tourists, and one more means of extracting some form
of value from the violence of finance capital, the destruction of the city and of the
dreams that reside there. 'With the upheaval of the market economy', lamented
Benjamin (1968: 88), in words even more poignant in an era of finance capital today
that takes its form in glass structures, 'we begin to recognize the monuments of the
bourgeoisie as ruins even before they have crumbled'.<component x="45.35" y="574.13"

enabled not only by technical innovations in glass and iron materials but by changes
in the economy that coalesced around the textile trade and luxury goods market
(Benjamin, 1968: 77). 2. To demonstrate homologies with the 'military-industrial
complex', Martin (2003) refers to the 'organizational complex', McQuire (2008) to the
'media-architecture complex', Foster (2011) to the 'art-architecture complex' and
Taylor (2004) to the 'finance-entertainment complex'. 3. Martin (2003) demonstrates
the role this architecture played in an epistemic replacement of a Foucaultian
disciplinary society with a Deleuzian network 'society of control'. 4. 'The enclosure
of architecture into an historical abstraction is the formal frontier of the space of
flows' (Castells, 2000: 448). Castells provides interesting examples of what he calls
the 'architecture of nudity' that characterizes contemporary transportation
environments (a Spanish airport and train station). 5. The condominiums in CityCenter
were originally expected to earn revenue of $2.7 billion, but by the end of 2010
sales stood at only $372 million. Glass Architecture 6. In words that would be at
home in Scheerbart's , the Kohn Pederson Fox website claims the Mandarin Oriental
'hotel tower is clad in rippled reflective glass, which is designed to scatter and
reflect light in a kaleidoscopic fashion . . . . Its illuminated, double-wall
fac&#xB8;ade forms a backdrop for luxury flagship stores, each with a jewel-like
presence on the promenade.' 7. Benjamin's faith in the politically progressive value
of transparency was replicated in Hannes Meyer's comments about the construction of
the United Nations building in New York (see McQuire, 2008: 163-4) and in Grand
Projets Franc&#xB8;ois Mitterand's in France (Fierro, 2003). The temptation to equate
glass with verity is difficult to resist. 8. While Benjamin discussed Scheerbart's
utopian science fiction (Benjamin, 1968: 78; 1999; 2003), Scheerbart's work seems to
have escaped the attention of Jameson (2005). 9. Leaving the building unfinished
saved MGM Mirage about $800 million, but the $279 million the company had already
invested in the Harmon structure could only be written off as a loss (Illia, 2010).

the relationship between fiction and architecture. (Stuart, 2011) The September 2010
headline sounded more like science fiction than a news report: 'Pool-side death ray
singes Las Vegas hotel guest' (CNN, 2011). 'It felt like I had a chemical burn',
reported the victim, a vacationing Chicago attorney who was subjected to intense heat
as he reclined poolside at his luxury hotel. 'I couldn't imagine why my head was
burning. Within 30 seconds, the back of my legs were burning. My first thought was,
Jesus, they destroyed the ozone layer!' ( Daily Mail, 2010). Despite apocalyptic
overtones, the ray was not a product of the ravages of climate change but a direct
outcome of a different nexus of nature, culture, and economics: Mojave Desert
sunlight refracted off the sleek, curved, glass surface of the new Vdara
Hotel-Condominium on the Strip. Due to a design flaw the glass wall of the hotel
inadvertently directs the sun above the urban oasis onto the pool area in a
condensed, magnified, and potent beam of light, increasing the poolside temperature
by 20 degrees at the height of the midday sun. The beam melts plastic drinking cups
and scorches guests, moving slowly across the deck expanse as the earth rotates to
complete the effect that the hotel management dismisses as a 'solar convergence
phenomenon'. The Vdara Hotel, designed by Uruguayan 'starchitect' Rafael Vinoly, is
part of Las Vegas' dazzling new CityCenter complex. CityCenter is a remarkably
ambitious $8.7 billion development, jointly financed by Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts
International and Dubai World, the investment company of the emirate (Berzon, 2010;
see Figure 1). Construction of the five-year project was completed in 2011. Conceived
as a selfcontained residential, gambling, and shopping enclave on the Strip, complete
with iconic buildings designed by celebrity architects, 'pocket parks' and notable
public artworks, CityCenter is reportedly the most expensive privately-funded
construction project ever built in the USA, and perhaps one of the most audacious
attempts in world history to conceive and construct an encapsulated urban
neighborhood. It is also arguably a resounding failure. The property's soft opening
in 2009 coincided with the global economic crisis, and no doubt the immense amount of
debt incurred in construction of the glass towers of CityCenter contributed in some
small way to the crunch. The development's subsequent underperformance is
illustrative of both the political economy and cultural logics of financialization.
'Financialization must be understood as a profoundly spatial phenomenon, holding out
as it does the promise of a financial, spatial-temporal fix for the crisis tendencies
of capitalism' (French et al., 2011: 814). Both the urban enclave of CityCenter and
glass architecture of the Vdara Hotel may be understood as spatial expressions of
financialization. While Manuel Castells (2000: 434) claims that the 21st-century

global financial economy and information society, I suggest that the enclosed enclave
in its many guises, from special economic zones to gated communities, is the locus of
capital containment for our age (Easterling, 2005, 2007; Jameson, 1990). Indeed,
these claims are not incompatible. For Castells, the defining feature of the
mega-city is its discontinuous and disjunctive social geography, the distinctive
feature of being globally connected and locally disconnected ' ' (2000: p. 436); I
argue that the enclave is such a 'locally disconnected' site. The enclave is a scalar
surrogate for both the nation-state that organized and regulated the Fordist economy
and the modernist city that was the locus of industrial production and collective
consumption. Both the perils and the promise of the contemporary city emanate from
such locales. CityCenter's lackluster performance is indicative of Las Vegas'
downturn in the wake of the global financial crisis, but also of the current
vivication of the gaming industry in the Chinese enclave of Macau and the
recomposition of capitalism itself in East Asia. As a Special Administrative Region
(SAR) of the PRC located within the Pearl River Delta mega-city, Macau is a 'globally
connected and locally disconnected' locale whose phantasmagoric glass cityscape is
now the world's most lucrative site of casino gaming revenue. In this article I
analyze MGM's glass projects in Las Vegas and Macau in order to explore the formal
relations among financialization, enclave urbanism, and glass architecture, and the
importance of each to the contemporary economy of derivative speculation that itself
increasingly resembles a global casino. Taken together, CityCenter and Macau are
revealing of the state of the city, as well as the importance of the city to the
state - indeed, of the city-state - in the current composition of global capitalism.
The enclave may be understood as a commodified and derivative urban form. Much like a
derivative financial instrument, the enclave's value is derived from a potent
speculative package of assets, indices, and underliers, to form what Keller
Easterling (2005: 1) calls a 'spatial product' or 'real estate cocktail'. Like a
mortgage-backed security, the disposition of this mixture can be volatile. When the
speculation is wrong, as was the case with CityCenter, the scale of lost revenues may
be so significant that it has reverberations for the global economy: the entire
edifice may eventually implode under the weight of failed financial expectations.
However, when the wager pays off like it has in the quasistate of Macau - with its
unique regime of legal exceptionalism and strategic management of cross-border flows
of people and capital - the result is an occult explosion of liquid profits. Glass
Architecture as Material Component and Aesthetic Feature of Financialization Finance
capital seeks reproduction in enclaves - Special Administrative Regions, corporate
cities, quasi-states, and various other zones of encapsulated urbanity or juridical
exception - yet financialization takes its tangible form in glass architecture like
the Vdara Hotel. The Vdara Hotel's fac&#xB8;ade is not merely application of an
architectural aesthetic technique but can be understood as a 'formal overtone'
(Jameson, 1998: 44) of the finance capitalism used to construct the hotel and the
larger project. While the relationship among glass and financialization may not be
immediately apparent, I will argue that glass is as important to contemporary
post-Fordist capitalism as was the railroad or copper wire to earlier stages.
Fiber-optic cables facilitate financialization as instantaneous capital movements
rely on transcontinental telecommunications networks, what Stephen Graham (1999) has
called 'global grids of glass'. These cables conjoin glass and light to circulate the
digitized information of the network society that appears on our computer screens and
mobile devices, forming the 'space of flows' (Castells, 2000), the architecture of
contemporary social life that is as ubiquitous as it is invisible. Fiber optics are
not only a key component of flexible forms of accumulation but enable flexible
specialization, flexible time, 'Toyotist' supply chain management, locational
strategies of production, and essentially all other factors of the post-Fordist
economy. As I will discuss later, the glass curtain wall shares homologies with the
terminal screen, and the reflective surfaces of post-industrial cities appear
increasingly like mediated space (McQuire, 2008). The networked economy is an economy
of glass. However, glass is not only an integral material component of fiberoptic
communications, it also embodies the sleek, seductive aesthetic of financialization.
In their analysis of contemporary corporate advertising, Landscapes of Capital
Goldman and Papson (2011) analyze the discursive that are conjured in these mediated
representations of the financial economy. They find 'the representational equivalent
of hyperreal capital' (p. 51) in images and evocations of speed, flexibility, and
technological integration in the advertisements produced by companies like Wachovia,
Enron, Cisco, and Merrill Lynch, which are (or were) key players in the financial
economy. In these discursive evocations and mediations of capital, economic life
enabled by digital telecommunications and deregulation appears smooth, frictionless,
and transparent, much like the surface of the glass curtain wall of the Vdara Hotel.
'The dream of Capital is a friction-free network in which information and commodities
flow at unlimited rates' (Goldman and Papson, 2011: 20). Understood in this way,
glass architecture - particularly in relation to the 'beams of light' that in
corporate advertisements become 'the most common signifier of the flow of ideas' (p.
33) - embodies both functional and representational features of financialization. In
short, the immaterial economy of post-Fordism seeks a spatial fix in the enclave,
while the dematerialized capital of fiber optics enabled financialization finds its
form in glass architecture. French et al. (2011) 'argue that work on financialization
has been insufficiently attentive to: the role of space and place; the geography of
money and finance; and earlier work in the Marxist and international
political-economy tradition that effectively focused on the problem of
financialization before the neologism was coined and mobilized.' I will bring these
very factors - social space, financial geography, political economy - together to
explore the form and function of glass architecture in Las Vegas and Macau. I will
first trace the importance of glass to historical formations of capitalism and the
critical and utopian responses it has provoked from Walter Benjamin, Paul Scheerbart,
and Fredric Jameson. Then I will analyze the 'fictitious capital' of financialization
and its materialization in the glass resorts of Las Vegas and Macau. I hope to
address both the functional and representational dimensions of glass architecture. In
order to 'read' the contemporary cities of Las Vegas and Macau, I seek intertextual
legibilities among fictitious capital that enables grand architectural projects in
city centers around the world; expressionist fictional representations of glass
architecture and its utopian transformative potential; and actual glass buildings
that themselves dissimulate in a manner not unlike fiction. I proceed through a
series of inter-referential vignettes and parables, ranging from cultural history to
political economy to literary criticism to architectural theory to journalistic
reportage that, taken together, I hope will illuminate the complex articulations
among urban enclaves, glass buildings, and fictitious capital. 'It is difficult', I
agree, 'to exaggerate the relationship between fiction and architecture.' Glass,
Glass Architecture, Capital, Capitalism The new glass resorts of Las Vegas and Macau
have a vitreous lineage. The modern glass industry was established principally in the
city-state of Venice in the 13th to 16th centuries; the industry developed alongside
the historical development of capitalism, and glass itself became a key component of
accumulation. The specific role or function of glass has varied in different stages
of capitalist development, serving as a commodity itself in Italy to producer of the
commodity fetish in France; and from utopian crystalline technology in the
expressionist pre-war dreams of Weimar Germany, to the depoliticized architectural
form of the International Style. Venice and Paris Glass was an early commodity that
Venice produced for trade. Fine glassware was an element of European civility and
refinement during the Renaissance, one material manner in which people could display
new types of distinction enabled by the new wealth generated by capitalism (McCray,
1998). Glassmaking was one of the oldest industries in France as well, though until
the 17th century French glass production was generally of a common variety that could
not compare with the work of the Venetian artisans. In 1687, however, French
glassmaker Bernard Perrot developed an innovative technique of plate glass production
that involved casting the glass rather than blowing it, and Paris ultimately became
the site of the most pervasive developments in glass architecture (Scoville, 1941,
1942; Fierro, 2003: 9; Richards, 2008). Notwithstanding the lethal luminosity of Las
Vegas, Paris was the original 'city of light', center of not only philosophical
enlightenment but of fashion, art, and culture; urban planning, banking, and finance;
cafes, department stores, and arcades. Glass was crucial to this constellation.
Constructed in the early 19th century, the arcades were a triumph of iron and glass
architecture, arching over passages between buildings to create interior consumer
spaces that were precursors to the department 1 store, shopping mall, and hotel
atrium (see Missac, 1995). When Walter Benjamin visited the arcades in the 1920s,
they appeared to him like the ur-form or natural history of capitalist modernity, a
repository of the utopian dreams of a previous epoch. Expressionism and Weimar
Germany In the imagination of fin de siecle`German expressionist writer Paul
Scheerbart as well as his intellectual contemporaries who formed the Crystal Chain,
glass had a didactic transformative potential. Scheerbart was fascinated by glass
architecture, writing a book on the subject as well as a number of playful utopian
stories in which it featured (Scheerbart, 1972, 2001, 2010). Scheerbart saw in glass
construction and ornamentation a key to architectural change that he thought would
enable wholesale cultural evolution. From Scheerbart's perspective the largely brick
building materials of industrial capitalism led to necessarily 'closed rooms' that
reflected closed minds and closed relationships (Bletter, 1975, 1981); growth would
only be possible to the extent that glass construction opened environments to the
elements. 'Glass opens up a new age', he suggested prophetically, while 'Brick
building does only harm.' Thus, the advantage of glass architecture over brick was
not simply technical or economic, but moral. Scheerbart's best known work is probably
Glass Architecture. It is easy to misread this peculiar book, comprised of 111
aphorisms, transparently as a kind of 'how to' guide of practical and technical
recommendations to integrate glass features into homes, botanical gardens, and public
spaces. 'As air is one of the worst conductors of heat', he writes, 'the double glass
wall is an essential condition for all glass architecture' (Scheerbart, 1972: 42).
Or: 'it is clearly advisable to build glass houses only in the temperate zones' (p.
42). When designing the Vdara Hotel, Rafael Vinoly probably should have paid heed to
Scheerbart's admonition: 'An occasional mirrorwall close to a pool is worth
considering. But not too many' (p. 42). Viewed from a more opaque angle, however, and
in the context of Scheerbart's interest in the alchemical properties of crystal
(Bletter, 1981) Glass and his experiments with perpetual motion (Scheerbart, 2011),
Architecture is no design primer. It is nothing less than a fantastical account of an
errant glass addition to a veranda that spontaneously crystallizes and expands across
the garden and beyond, eventually growing into a glass cityscape that ultimately
covers the entire earth's surface. Whoever has provided his veranda with
colour-ornamented glass on three sides will soon want to have more glass
architecture. One thing leads to another, and to stop the process is unthinkable. So
the veranda continues to grow; in the end it emancipates itself from the main
building, and may become the main building itself. To promote this evolution of the
veranda will be the chief task of every glass architect. (Scheerbart, 1972: 44) Once
unleashed, Scheerbart implies, crystallization inhabits its own form of perpetual
motion and takes a material and sensible shape in architecture and cityscapes. We
will see later how this belief in divine vitrification resonates with the devout
discourses deploying deregulatory practices and fiber-optic technology to enable
financialization. Scheerbart and fellow visionaries like his architect friend Bruno
Taut imagined this alchemical potential of glass architecture and its crystalline
properties; they conceived of glass structures that would transform people who passed
through them in the same manner that crystal transforms light. 'Coloured
glass/destroys hatred', penned Scheerbart, words that were etched on Taut's Glass
Pavilion, a structure built for display at Werkbund the Cologne Exhibition of 1914.
The multi-colored glass structure and kaleidoscopic interior lights of the
pineapple-shaped pavilion were designed to create an immersive crystalline effect
that would serve to uplift the spirit and moral countenance of visitors. The
Transparent Rationalism of the International Style While Taut's glass house did not
survive the exhibition, his forays into glass design influenced his contemporaries.
In the early 20th century, refined glass and steel materials became key components of
the architectural movement known as the International Style whose proponents eschewed
ornamental facades to emphasize the 'honest expression of structure' and the truthful
display of the function of materials in the construction of buildings. Glass served
to highlight ideals of transparency and verity of architectural design, and such
buildings came to define the cities of industrial capitalism. Glass architecture of
the International Style was not simply a container for 20th-century capitalist
enterprise, it played a functional role in technological and financial innovation.
Reinhold Martin (2003) demonstrates that with the technological and economic changes
of the post-war military-industrial complex, a modular and flexible corporate
architecture emerged in the United States that enabled the subjection of a new type
of technocratic organization man steeped in the dual guises of profit-driven
innovation and corporate 'human relations'. Martin's account of this 'organizational
complex' reads like a dystopian application of the transformative possibilities that
fascinated Scheerbart and 2 Taut. Architects like Eero Saarinen and the firm of
Skidmore, Owens &amp; Merrill covered the corporate offices of such companies as IBM,
General Motors, and Bell Telephone - the latter whose labs were the site of important
developments in glass fiber-optic technology - with increasingly thin glass curtain
walls creating an 'affect [that] approached the glare of the photographic plate or of
the television screen' (Martin, 3 2003: 10). The aim was not simply pre-fabricated
modular flexibility but crafting an organizational identity befitting a mass consumer
culture. The glass surfaces of the buildings reproduced and replicated the more
generalized social experience of media distraction. According to Martin, watchedin
passing rather than looked 'like network television - its historical contemporary -
the architecture of the curtain wall is a medium to be at like an artwork' (p. 6).
Glass as a 'Formal Overtone' of Finance Capital To understand their relation to
capital, the glass resorts of CityCenter and Macau must be situated within the
preceding historical context, but their function becomes evident only when examined
from a contemporary vantage point. The Vdara Hotel death ray enabled by the glass
fac&#xB8;ade calls to mind Jameson's (1998) evocative comments about the architecture
of late capitalism, structures which are characterized by the immateriality of the
glass curtain wall. If Scheerbart saw the transition from brick to glass materials as
indicative of moral progress, Jameson investigates the underlying economic logic.
Searching for the series of mediations 'which leads from finance capital through land
speculation to aesthetics and cultural production itself', Jameson finds in the
'enclosed skin volumes' of post-modern glass architecture a 'formal overtone' of
finance capitalism. From this perspective, the glass skin of a building like the
Vdara Hotel 'dematerializes without signifying in any way spirituality' (Jameson,
1998: 44) in the same manner in which the finance economy creates an abstracted and
dematerialized form of capital. This contemporary glass architecture is homologous
with both the fiberoptic materials that enable financialization as well as the
frictionless form of its discursive representation. In the case of the Vdara Hotel,
the errant ray of light refracted off the building's surface into a 'death ray'
mimics the play of glass and light in a fiber-optic cable. It is architecture
appropriate for a post-Fordist economic regime. For Marx, fictitious capital was
simply credit, capital that was assumed to come from the earnings of future
production. Today, fictitious capital presumes profits will accrue withoutproduction
(see Comaroff and Comaroff, 2000), and may be derived simply by commodifying the
credit risk itself in endless aleatory cycles. This is the utopian fantasy of
fiber-optic enabled financial capital - 'that it can surmount its own crisis
tendencies and overcome its own limits by generating value through its own pure
circulation' (Goldman and Papson, 2011: 21). This contemporary incarnation of alchemy
displaces Scheerbart's and Taut's belief in crystal power to the 21st century: both
faiths rely on the enabling function of glass. Political commitment to deregulation
of financial markets in the 1980s similarly converged with new technical innovations
in glass - in this case fiber-optic information technologies - and emerging utopian
assumptions about the planetary connectivity of telecommunications (Castells, 2000;
Taylor, 2004). With the rapid expansion of the financial economy, exponential salary
increases for finance executives lured young mathematicians and physicists away from
once-coveted cold-war corporate research jobs in the military-industrial complex and
to the finance industry where they now engineer increasingly complex trading
algorithms and derivative instruments that colonize fiber-optic networks to monetize
the future; the end result is the 'financialization of everything' (Harvey, 2007:
33). This hermetic feature of financialization enhanced by incessant neoliberal
evangelization has made the global financial system today appear like 'nothing as
much as a vast casino' (Strange, 1986: 1). Therefore, if the political economy of
19th-century industrial production required the solid foundations of brick
construction that Scheerbart thought created closed cultures, and the modular
glass-curtain corporate architecture of IBM and Bell Laboratories communicated
flexibility and integration for the cybernetic capitalism of the cold war (Martin,
2003), then the 'materialist sublimation' (Jameson, 1998: 44) of the financial
economy is best rendered in curving glass walls like those of the Vdara Hotel. It is
architecture appropriate for an era in which accumulation seems to have been
decoupled from production and financial profits are derived from the opaque
perambulations of finance itself. But more than produced that, it is architecture
that is directly by financialization and which makes the built environment in its own
image: fragile, brittle 'global grids of glass'. The mediation of contemporary glass
architecture I am proposing is distinct from Jameson's famous description of the
Bonaventure Hotel, where 'the glass skin achieves a peculiar and placeless
disassociation of Bonventura the from its neighborhood' (1998: 82) and the interior
constitutes a delirious and depthless hyperspace which locates the subject
experientially in an otherwise ungraspable global economic system. Rather, in a
manner homologous with the commodified urban enclave, I am proposing new glass
architecture as an intimation of derivative and securitized property. One thing that
distinguishes the contemporary phase of finance capital from earlier phases is its
reliance on the securitization of mortgages and other forms of real estate, 'a
profound institutional transformation in which the real estate sector has come to
resemble an economic sector composed of finance markets and instruments rather than a
sector defined by producer markets' (Gotham, 2009: 357). According to Kevin Fox
Gotham (2009), the desire to overcome the time lag between constructing the built
environment and realizing accumulation from subsequent production or rent, and to
quickly convert capital fixed in the built environment into profit, has led to this
wave of real estate securitization that aims to transform 'opaque and illiquid assets
into liquid and transparent securities': adjustable rate mortgages, mortgage-backed
securities, real estate investment trusts, and so on (Gotham, 2009: 357). This
breathless impatience for immediate returns from what was formerly treated as a
long-term investment in real estate is enabled by the time-space compression that
results from fiber-optic technologies and the space of flows. 'Time is critical to
the profit-making of the whole system. It is the speed of the transaction, sometimes
automatically preprogrammed in the computer to make quasi-instantaneous decisions,
that generates the gain - or the loss', contends Castells (2000: 466). Furthermore, a
significant and growing number of financial transactions are based on making value
out of the capture of future time in present transactions, as in the futures,
options, and other derivative capital markets. Together these new financial products
dramat` ically increase the mass of nominal capital vis-a-vis bank deposits and
assets, so that everybody bets on and with future money anticipated in computer
projections. (2000: 466) Perhaps this cybernetic compression of time and space
similarly decreases the historical distance of the critical gaze in a manner that
might orient our perspective toward glass architecture today. This immediacy and
contemporaneity distinguishes our age from earlier phases of capitalism. Benjamin's
revolutionary critique was driven by his retrospective attenprevious tion to the
detritus of the era. Benjamin's insights about the mythology of capitalism emanated
from his discovery of its pre-history in the iron and glass Parisian arcades a
generation after their demise. But today, fiber-optic technology has produced a new
temporality that has eradicated that historical distance. The 'truth' of
fiber-optic-enabled financialization resides directly in the surfaces of the new
glass architecture of the Global Style (Foster, 2011), despite the fact that it seems
so 4 naked, bare, and transparent. As capital switches from the primary circuit of
industrial manufacturing to the secondary circuit of real estate investment, glass
architecture mediates the dialectical relation between illiquid spatial fixity on one
hand, and financial liquidity on the other. This form of transparent crystalline real
estate investment in commodified urban enclaves emerges from the very process of
'converting opaque and illiquid assets into liquid and transparent securities'
(Gotham, 2009: 357). The Violence of Finance Capital If the design of the Vdara Hotel
may be understood as a formal representation of an economy dominated by the logic of
financialization which dematerializes capital itself and transforms the built
environment into a precarious security, then the manner in which the Vdara Hotel's
glass fac&#xB8;ade fashions sunlight into a lethal ray is an apt metaphor for the
very real 'violence of financial capitalism'. For Christian Marazzi (2010), this
violence results from the post-Fordist 'attempt, in certain ways "parasitic" and
"desperate," to recuperate on the financial markets that which capital could no
longer get in the real economy' (p. 27); this recuperation has 'devastating effects
on employment, wages, and retirement', writes Marazzi. That is, not only on the bare,
unprotected skin of prostrate vacationing attorneys lounging beneath the desert sun,
but 'on the bare life of entire populations' (p. 10). Glass architecture plays a
formal role in this process. Crystallization of both communication networks and glass
architecture across global cityscapes mirrors the spread of the derivative fictitious
capital of neoliberal financialization. Once unleashed by deregulation in the 1980s
global economy steered by Paul Volker, Ronald Reagan, and Margaret Thatcher,
financialization has crept beyond insurance actuarial tables into retirement pension
funds, junk bonds, currency trading algorithms, securitized mortgages, credit default
swaps, collateralized debt obligations, and all manner of derivative instruments and
opportunistic rent-seeking regulatory efforts to gamble against the future 'on the
bare life of entire populations'. 'One thing leads to another', as Scheerbart says,
'and to stop the process is unthinkable.' Las Vegas, Dubai, and the CityCenter The
profits accumulated from the bare life of consumer-citizens, the glass curtain walls
that feature in iconic architecture of the Global Style, the violence of
dematerialized forms of capital produced by a post-Fordist economic regime - these
subjects and spaces converge in the CityCenter of Las Vegas today. CityCenter
occupies 67 acres of land on the Las Vegas Strip and comprises 18 million square feet
of indoor space. Aside from the Vdara Hotel, the complex has another
hotel-condominium, Mandarin Oriental, as well as two 400-room boutique hotels, Aria
and Harmon, and a dual-towered condominium construction called the Veer Towers. At
the base of the buildings sits Crystals (a name that would have delighted Sheerbart),
a 500,000 square-foot luxury shopping mall designed by Daniel Libeskind, the renowned
architect behind the Jewish Museum in Berlin and the post-9/11 World Trade Center
reconstruction. The gleaming towers of CityCenter were designed by a who's who of
celebrity architects and architectural firms, including not only Vinoly but Norman
Foster, Cesar Pelli, Helmut Jahn, Kohn Pederson Fox, and Gensler, which oversaw the
master plan. CityCenter features $40 million of public artworks by Robert
Rauschenberg, Claus Oldenberg, Frank Stella and Henry Moore, and pieces commissioned
especially for the site by Jenny Holzer, Nancy Rubins, and Maya Lin (Friess, 2009).
When Dubai World announced its $2.96 billion purchase of 50 percent of the CityCenter
project equity in 2007, the Chairman of the company, His Excellency Sultan Ahmed Bin
Sulayem, called it 'one of the most exciting private sector developments in modern
history. CityCenter is the most ambitious real estate project ever undertaken in Las
Vegas', he claimed, 'and rivals any similar project around the world. Its global
significance cannot be underestimated' (MGM Mirage, 2009). The decision to build
iconic glass towers rather than themed simulations more typical of the resorts on the
Strip was not motivated merely by evolving architectural tastes. It was, rather, an
attempt to fashion what Castells calls a 'node' for accumulation. According to
Castells (2000), 'the nodes of the space of flows include residential and
leisure-oriented spaces which, along with the location of headquarters and their
ancillary services, tend to cluster dominant functions in carefully segregated
spaces, with easy access to cosmopolitan complexes of arts, culture, and
entertainment' (2000: 446-7). MGM Mirage CEO Jim Murren, who conceived of the
original plan, described the project as 'a very ambitious masterplanned community'
(quoted in Freiss, 2009) ostensibly constructed for the elites of the information
society. 'They've heard of Rafael Vinoly and Cesar Pelli and Norman Foster and Daniel
Libeskind, and they've stayed at the Mandarin', he said. 'They are the
multibillionaires, the centimillionaires, some of the wealthiest people in the world,
people who are doing business in Abu Dhabi, Cairo, Mumbai' (Freiss, 2009). The
CityCenter project was plagued by problems long before the death ray. The complex was
conceived at the height of Las Vegas visitor arrivals and a booming economy and real
estate sector in the city, but over the five year construction process the original
$5 billion project ballooned to nearly $9 billion while the severe world economic
downturn led to falling rates of tourism and consumption that was particularly
detrimental to Las Vegas resort revenues. MGM Mirage flirted with bankruptcy and in
2009 Dubai World sued their partner for mismanagement of the project's construction,
though it eventually dropped the suit and the Sultan of Dubai attended the opening
celebration (Benston, 2009). By the time the initial phase of CityCenter was ready to
open to the public, 5 Dubai Las Vegas suffered the worst housing market in the
nation. World no doubt came to regret its role in the project. By the date of the
December 2009 opening of the first phase of CityCenter, Dubai's economy was in
freefall as the Emirate had announced just a month before the inability to meet
repayment obligations on nearly $25 billion of loans (Sharif and Hall, 2011). The
sultan who had masterminded the territory's equity purchase of half of the CityCenter
venture amassed a staggering $40 billion debt for Dubai World. Within a year he was
removed from his post as chairman of the company, proving prescient his own 1997
prediction about CityCenter: 'Its global significance cannot be underestimated.' A
host of development projects in Dubai either sit partially completed or never got
past the drawing board as economic woes have severely tempered the aspirations of
Dubai's sovereign to create his own Ville-Lumiere,complete with rows of glittering
glass towers along Sheik Zayad Road and around the Dubai Marina, and brought many of
the Emirate's ambitious projects to a standstill. If it is correct that finance is a
spatial phenomenon, then 'In order to understand processes of financialization and
their complex geographies . . . it is vital to follow the networks of contemporary
financialized capitalism wherever they may lead' (French et al., 2011: 809). We will
see in this case that these networks lead from CityCenter to not only the city-states
of Dubai and Macau, but ultimately to sovereign states as far afield as Pyongyang,
Beijing, Reykjavik, and Washington, DC. The Reincarnation of Las Vegas in Macau and
Capitalism in East Asia Crucial to the neoliberal experiment launched in the West by
Reagan and Thatcher was Deng Xiaopeng's transformation of China's socialist economy
(see Harvey, 2007). In 1978 Deng took the first steps in his project to establish a
market economy with his Southern Tour to the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) of Shenzhen.
According to Deng's strategy, both Shenzhen and the Zhuhai SEZ, respectively located
adjacent to the colonies of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as a string of other SEZs
along the south China coast, would function collectively as laboratories of
production where the PRC would allow Western companies to establish enterprises in
order to study techniques of capitalist production, manufacturing, management, and
private property (Chuihua et al., 2001). This process eventually formed what is for
Castells (2000: 436) the prototypical network society mega-city, the 'Hong
Kong-ShenzhenCanton-Pearl River Delta-Macau-Zhuhai metropolitan regional system'.
Deng's experiment has succeeded beyond anyone's expectations, and we will see that
Macau plays a crucial role in enabling the circulation of capital through this
system. Today rural China is urbanizing on a vast scale. China is pursuing urbanism
itself as an accumulation strategy (Wu, 2009) and using macroeconomic policy to
encourage domestic consumption, resulting in a wholesale transformation of not only
the landscape but of the Chinese subject. This transformation is evidenced by the
sight of eager Chinese tourists queuing outside of Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and Chanel
shops in Macau and Hong Kong. The future of Chinese consumption will depend on these
members of the emerging middle class who increasingly visit Macau on tourist visas
enabled by new central government policies. Capitalism's ongoing recomposition in the
market-socialist regime of the PRC involves merging the post-Fordist and
post-socialist economies in interstitial sites like Macau and the SEZs and
transforming those overaccumulated Chinese workers into consumers; perhaps they will,
in turn, help address the over-accumulations of capital in the West. Scheerbart and
Benjamin might have pointed to the transformative potential of glass architecture in
such a project. If the SEZs were laboratories of production, the city-state of Macau
SAR could be understood as a laboratory of post-socialist consumption, a site where
the central government of the PRC tests policies to stimulate tourism while Chinese
subjects hone habits conducive to consumerism (Simpson, 2009, 2011). The enclave
subsumes the functions heretofore managed by the state which often capitalizes off
enclaves in the sort of tribute system that has existed in East Asia for several
millennia. Such sites are central to capitalist expansion in the region today.
Specifically, to use Castell's (2000: 443) terminology, Macau is both a 'hub' and a
'node' in the mega-city region. As an interstitial tourist city, paradoxically both
inside and outside the PRC, and visited by 28 million people in 2012, hub it is a
communication . As the only site of legal casino gambling in the PRC, as well as a
destination for select Chinese nationals from relatively affluent cities and
provinces to whom the central government grants special travel visas to visit the
SARs, Macau's juridical exceptionalism node makes it a strategic for the circulation
of capital and the pedagogy of capitalist enterprise. Macau's potent 'spatial
cocktail' includes investment in the built environment from transnational actors;
porous borders combined with an interstitial identity; graduated management of
mainland Chinese tourist arrivals; and a peculiar gaming regulatory regime that was
forged during Portugal's weak colonial administration. Macau's Transformation into a
Glass City-State The first and last European colony in Asia, Macau was returned by
Portugal to the PRC in 1999 after nearly half a millennium of Portuguese rule.
Gambling has been legal in Macau since 1847, and the modern casino industry dates
back 70 years, during which time it has operated as a monopoly concession granted by
the local Portuguese administration in exchange for a percentage of the profits. Hong
Kong billionaire Stanley Ho controlled that monopoly from 1962 to 2002. When the PRC
regained control of Macau, the government dissolved the monopoly and liberalized
Macau's gaming industry, ultimately allowing six companies to operate as
concessionaires. Through this process MGM Resorts International, as well as Las Vegas
entrepreneurs Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson, entered the Macau casino market. Over
the past decade the post-colonial cityscape of Macau, characterized by a combination
of quaint pastel-colored Portuguese churches and municipal buildings built in the
17th to 19th centuries, has been transformed into a postmodern phantasmagoria.
Scheerbart's prediction of the inevitable expansion of glass architecture across the
globe seems prescient, and indeed financialization has crystallized the territory.
Today Macau's cityscape sparkles with all manner of glass and crystalline amusements
which might serve as 'formal overtones' of fictitious capital. The dome-shaped base
of Ho's flagship Grand Lisboa Casino, which opened in 2007, is comprised of the
world's largest integrated LED screen, featuring colorful displays of animated
roulette wheels and rolling dice (see Figure 2). The mediated screen surface of the
building that resembles Taut's glass pavilion conjoins glass architecture,
crystalline ornamentation, fiber optics, and images of gambling in a perfect mimetic
representation of financialization. Displayed in the lobby of the casino is the
world's largest cushion diamond, the 218 carat Star of Stanley Ho, bought by its
namesake for $100 million. Macau's Sands Casino, built by rival Adelson and covered
in golden glass, features the world's largest crystal chandelier. Wynn's eponymous
resort as well as his Encore property are covered in a tasteful brown glass curtain
wall, and the MGM Macau, Grand Waldo, Star World, Altira, Galaxy, and City of Dreams
properties have remade Macau into a glass state. Even strange glass sculptures have
begun to appear around the city (see Figures 3 &amp; 4). This glass architecture
stands alongside themed resorts like Adelson's $2.4 billion Venetian Macau; the
largest building in Asia, the simulated Venice is a self-contained enclave within the
enclave of Macau. Themed environments and glass architecture function in a
pedagogical project to transform the socialist proletariat of the People's Republic
into capitalist consumers. Three parables about MGM's glass resorts and fictitious
capital in the casino economy of Macau will demonstrate the articulations of each
with global finance. Capital Fictions in Macau MGM's Role in Iceland's Financial
Economy If MGM made a serious misstep with CityCenter, the company's decision to seek
a concession in Macau has proved enormously successful. The MGM property in Macau is
jointly-owned by MGM Grand and Pansy Ho Chiu-king, one of Stanley Ho's 17 children
(by four wives). The company obtained its Macau gaming license by purchasing a
sub-concession of Stanley Ho's own license for $200 million, and subsequently opened
the MGM Grand Macau, an undulating 35-storey building featuring a tri-colored glass
fac&#xB8;ade. The hotel and casino are connected to One Central Macau, a residential
and retail property developed by Stanley Ho's company Shun Tak, for which Pansy Ho is
managing director. The property includes three apartment buildings, a Mandarin
Oriental Hotel, and a luxury shopping mall. The towers were designed by Kohn Pederson
Fox, the architectural firm that 6 designed the Mandarin Oriental property at
CityCenter. MGM's One Central Macau became a footnote to the global financial crisis
in October 2006 when Iceland's financial services and insurance company
Sjova-Almennar Tryggingar HF purchased one entire tower in the as-yet-not-completed
project from Shun Tak for $101 million. The Nordic company was a global trendsetter

the speculative bubble that preceded the crash in 2008. Within two years Iceland's
economy would be in tatters; deregulated less than a decade earlier, its three banks
faced a massive collective collapse which was to prove in real terms the worst
national banking disaster in global history, and the country teetered on the edge of
bankruptcy. For their part, the people of Iceland felt the full violence of financial
capitalism as the value of the krona was in free fall, inflation soared, and the
economy plunged into a deep recession. The assets of Iceland's pension funds fell by
up to 25 percent, and individual retirements were plundered to service the debt. The

a scale so massive it was described by a Florida Supreme Court Justice as 'the
largest seizure of private property ever attempted by banks and government entities'
(quoted in Harvey, 2012: 54). Ironically, during the financial crisis the spoils of
drug trafficking was the only source of liquidity accessible to some banks, and they
did not shy away from these ill-gotten gains (Saviano, 2012). Wachovia admitted its
role in laundering Mexican drug war profits, while HSBC handled transactions by not
only drug traffickers but Al Qaeda affiliates and Iranian financiers trying to avoid
US sanctions; the eventual fines on the two banks totaled more than one billion
dollars. The abuses were systemic and systematic. 'ABN Amro, Barclays, Credit Suisse,
Lloyds and ING have reached expensive settlements with regulators after admitting to
executing the transactions of clients in disreputable countries like Cuba, Iran,
Libya, Myanmar and Sudan' (Saviano, 2012: 20). Macau is no exception. In order to
hold a casino license in a jurisdiction in the United States operators must be clear
of criminal connections in any jurisdiction in which they operate, and the Macau
business practices of both Adelson and Wynn are currently under investigation by
authorities in the United States. In May 2009 the New Jersey Division of Gaming
Enforcement released the results of an investigative report that claimed that Stanley
Ho had ties to Chinese criminal concerns. Since Ho is a business associate of his
daughter Pansy, herself in partnership with MGM, this allegation threatened the
gaming license of MGM's Borgata Casino in Atlantic City. Given Atlantic City's poor
economy and the pecuniary potential of Macau, MGM made a relatively simple decision
to divest its stake in New Jersey and throw the company's full weight behind the
China venture, regardless of the concerns raised about the business practices of the
Ho family. When MGM Macau went public on the Hong Kong stock market in May 2011 and
Pansy Ho sold a portion of her 50 percent share of the partnership with MGM, the
return on her original $5 million investment was $1.5 billion. The deal made her the
youngest billionaire in Hong Kong, as well as the city's wealthiest woman (Gough,
2011; see Figure 5). New Jersey's allegations about Ho's underworld ties were not
news to industry insiders. In fact, Ho has long-term business interests with Chinese
triads in operating the VIP gambling concerns in his Macau casinos. The triads act
essentially as institutional loan sharks, fronting gambling money to high-stakes
players from mainland China who cannot otherwise easily move cash across the
tightly-regulated borders of the PRC (Siu, 2007). Wealthy individuals from China who
want to risk millions of dollars in Macau's casinos need access to cash loans in the
territory on the agreement that they will repay gambling losses to the granter of the
loan once they return to the mainland. However, this is complicated by the fact that
gambling debts are not legally enforceable on the mainland; therefore anyone who
makes loans in Macau must be confident of their ability to coerce re-payment through
extra-judicial means. Chinese triads have thus played an instrumental role in Macau
casinos since at least the 1980s, and an innovative vernacular 'rolling chips'
operation funds huge gambling stakes in Macau's casinos (Leong, 2002). In 2006
Macau's casino revenues were the largest in the world, and by 2010 Macau gaming
revenues were quadruple the combined casino revenues of the entire state of Nevada.
Seventy percent of that revenue came from high-stakes baccarat. The local government
tax of nearly 40 percent on gaming revenue generated $15 billion for government
coffers in 2012, making the administration complicit in the system based on collusion
between an oligarchy of state-sanctioned concessionaires and organized crime. Cash
handouts to residents in Macau's wealth-sharing scheme inaugurated in 2008 take on
the appearance of hush money, making the local population complicit. In 2013 each
resident received payments<component x="56.69" y="54.54" width="340.18"

is difficult to escape regular reminders that these profits are derived off the bare
life of populations. A [Hong Kong] man took a HK$10,700 government grant meant for
the burial of his maternal grandmother and gambled it away in Macau, leaving the
woman's body to languish in a morgue for a year until police and the Social Welfare
Department buried her. (Man, 2010) Fictitious Capital from the DPRK Ho has alleged
ties not only to independent Chinese criminal brotherhoods, but also to North Korea,
which the United States claims is a state-run crime syndicate. Ho has operated a
casino in a hotel in Pyongyang since 1995 (Lintner, 2007). The older half-brother of
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un resides in Macau and often gambles in the city's
casinos. But it is the relationship between the DPRK and another Macau concern that
provides an additional nuance to the movements of fictitious capital. In September
2005 the US State Department used the Patriot Act to designate Macau's family-owned
Banco Delta Asia as a 'primary money laundering concern', with allegations that the
bank was facilitating North Korea's criminal actions. The US Treasury Department
intoned: 'Banco Delta Asia has been a willing pawn for the North Korean government to
engage in corrupt financial activities through Macau, a region that needs significant
improvement in its money laundering controls' (Gaylord, 2008: 297). The move prompted
a run on the bank that resulted in panicked depositors withdrawing $133 million
before the Macau Monetary Authority put the bank in receivership. The accusations
against North Korea involved allegations of drug trafficking and circulating
counterfeit US cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, and currency. The counterfeit currency in
question is $100 'supernotes', the holy grail of faux money which can only be
manufactured with presses and paper identical to those used by the US Mint. For this
reason, there is skepticism about North Korea's ability to manufacture supernotes.
Many participants in a 2006 Interpol conference dedicated to the supernotes concluded
that the US government itself must be the source of the counterfeit notes; suspicion
lingers that the CIA prints the currency in a facility near Washington, DC in order
to fund covert operations outside the oversight of Congress (Gaylord, 2008: 295). The
disturbing possibility that Macau's glass casino resorts could be laundering
counterfeit dollars printed by the CIA and fronted by the Chinese mafia to
post-socialist gamblers from the PRC, all the while running afoul of the State
Department's own prosecution of the Patriot Act, provides a new chapter to Marx's
story of fictitious capital. 'As capital investment sometimes ceases to have a
necessarily immediate relationship with material production', write Goldman and
Papson (2011), 'it becomes an end in itself, chasing its tail through the circuitry
of financial instruments where the referent is no longer necessarily the world of
infrastructure, labor, production, or commodities, but rather a bond, or a security,
or a securitized debt package' (p. 52). Or in this case, the referent is simply money
itself. In the ruse of the counterfeit, even hard currency becomes another type of
derivative, its value derived from the money form which it emulates. This game of
three-card Monte is reminiscent of Enron's 'special purpose vehicles', the shell
companies it created to purchase assets from itself so the revenue could appear on
the company's books while the debt remained hidden (Goldman and Papson, financial
fable's 2011: 57). Enron's ultimate fortunes may foreshadow this fraudulent
denouement. Global Grids of Glass I have tried to take seriously the claim that
financialization is a spatial phenomenon and analyzed how finance capital is fixed
for purposes of accumulation in contemporary enclave spaces which feature glass
architecture. Indeed, as I have noted, technologies of glass production were crucial
to the historical development of capitalism, from the goblets of the city-state of
Venice, to the arcades and display windows of 19thcentury Paris and Weimar Germany
(Lungstrum, 1999), to the sleek surfaces of the North American corporate buildings
that served the post-war cybernetic economy. Glass material has merged with
technological innovations to create mediated cityscapes. The networked space of flows
on which financialization depends today is enabled by the coupling of glass and light
in fiber-optic technology which circulates fictitious and hyperreal forms of capital
in what increasingly appears to be a global casino. I have suggested that glass
architecture in enclave gaming developments in Las Vegas and Macau is a product of
the financial economy which creates these structures in its own image: smooth,
transparent, frictionless, fragile, and fictitious. To comprehend the relationship of
glass architecture to fictitious capital and consumer subjection we must explore not
only the technical features of the buildings themselves but imaginative accounts of
the transformative qualities of glass. Alchemical phantasms of crystallization
animate the deistic convictions of central bank economists who deregulate financial
flows and securities traders who colonize fiber-optic networks to engineer the
economy of dematerialized capital. These glass constructions reproduce both the
technological function and aesthetic form of financialization. Influenced by
Scheerbart and in the wake of the techno-human brutality of the Second World War,
Benjamin (1999) opined that the glass and steel of the International Style had the
value of being traceless: 'they have created rooms where it is hard to leave traces'
(p. 734). Benjamin thought that those who lived through the war would benefit from
this detachment from the past, that glass architecture would constitute a tabula rasa
generational . 'Objects made of glass have no "aura"', he said. 'Glass is an enemy of
secrets. It is also an enemy of possession' 7 (p. 734). But today, in a typically
Benjaminian dialectical reversal, both fiber-optics technology itself and
fiber-optics-enabled financialization have ironically transformed glass into a
material which accumulates both possessions and secrecy, converting illiquid
architectural assets into liquid capital. Glass reproduces capitalism's endemic
violence in the very guise of traceless transparency and the utopian immediacy of
universal communications. The Derivative Cityscape and the Implosion of Value This
returns us, then, to CityCenter, the enclave neighborhood development on the Las
Vegas Strip. 'Utopian space is an imaginary enclave within real social space',
suggests Jameson (2005: 15). For Jameson, in a move that echoes Benjamin's analysis
of the Parisian arcades, the enclave is 'something like a foreign body within the
social' that may potentially 'offer a space in which new wish images of the social
can be elaborated 8 and experimented on' (p. 16). Perhaps CityCenter, not to mention
the city-state of Macau, operates in this manner, a dialectial image counterposing
the utopian dreams of the collective against the neoliberal delusions of fictitious
and hyperreal capital. Built on billions of dollars of debt, CityCenter is not only
an effort to erect a planned urban community; it also inadvertently embodies the
deflationary direction of the derivative-driven global economy, where capital is
fixed in space to create self-contained islands of accumulation, and dematerialized
financialization finds its physical form in glass architecture. Next to the Vdara
Hotel in CityCenter sits the Norman Fosterdesigned Harmon Hotel. Foster is the
epitome of the starchitect and his buildings define the contemporary Global Style
(Foster, 2011). He is responsible for notable glass designs the world over, ranging
from futuristic airports in Hong Kong and Beijing, Zayad National Museum in the
United Arab Emirates, the UAE Pavilion at the Shanghai Expo, and even another City
Center in Washington, DC. But the Harmon Hotel has not fared so well and its failures
belie the empty promise of fictitious capital today. Originally designed to have 49
floors, structural problems in the foundation led to the decision in 2009 to
eliminate nearly half of the building, rendering a completed edifice of only 26
storeys. However, subsequent problems halted the project prior to completion, and it
now sits empty on the Strip. The completed external structure of the building stands
intact but the interior has not been finished and it 9 remains unoccupied. Subsequent
evaluation led an engineering firm to declare the Harmon unsafe due to its inability
to withstand an earthquake, which assessors charged would collapse the tower in what
would be yet another perfect storm of nature, culture, and economics (Garcia, 2011).
Citing the danger posed by the Harmon tower, MGM Mirage is seeking to implode the
building, and is currently engaged in a lawsuit with the construction company; that
company claims that the building can be repaired and alleges that MGM Mirage is
proffering a fiction in order to cut its financial losses (Glass, 2011; Green, 2011).
The glass fac&#xB8;ade of the Harmon Hotel today exists only as the world's most
expensive billboard, publicizing the Elvis Review show playing next door- and thus
constituting an unhappy convergence of the dual guises of hyperreal capital:
advertising and glass architecture. By combining an enticing lambent surface with an
empty structure, the Harmon Hotel vitrifies the very fetish quality - not of the
Fordist commodity which so fascinated Benjamin, but of the commodified and derivative
risk that underpins the post-Fordist financial economy. Effectively a subprime asset
located in a volatile spatial derivative, the Harmon Hotel building stands patiently
waiting to be imploded, eventually no doubt contributing one more spectacle to the
nighttime reveries of the city's tourists, and one more means of extracting some form
of value from the violence of finance capital, the destruction of the city and of the
dreams that reside there. 'With the upheaval of the market economy', lamented
Benjamin (1968: 88), in words even more poignant in an era of finance capital today
that takes its form in glass structures, 'we begin to recognize the monuments of the
bourgeoisie as ruins even before they have crumbled'.<component x="45.35" y="574.13"

draft of this article was written when the author was a Visiting Senior Research
Fellow at the Asia Research Institute (ARI), National University of Singapore. As
such, the paper benefitted significantly from the intellectual community at ARI and
particularly from conversations with Chua Beng Huat, Tim Bunnell, Michael Feener, and
Ola Soderstrom (although they might not realize it). The author is grateful to ARI
for this support, and to the editors at TCSfor helpful feedback. The paper was
presented to a plenary session of the 2012 Lisbon Summer School for the Study of
Culture.<component x="56.69" y="167.54" width="340.15" height="88.36" page="25"

enabled not only by technical innovations in glass and iron materials but by changes
in the economy that coalesced around the textile trade and luxury goods market
(Benjamin, 1968: 77). 2. To demonstrate homologies with the 'military-industrial
complex', Martin (2003) refers to the 'organizational complex', McQuire (2008) to the
'media-architecture complex', Foster (2011) to the 'art-architecture complex' and
Taylor (2004) to the 'finance-entertainment complex'. 3. Martin (2003) demonstrates
the role this architecture played in an epistemic replacement of a Foucaultian
disciplinary society with a Deleuzian network 'society of control'. 4. 'The enclosure
of architecture into an historical abstraction is the formal frontier of the space of
flows' (Castells, 2000: 448). Castells provides interesting examples of what he calls
the 'architecture of nudity' that characterizes contemporary transportation
environments (a Spanish airport and train station). 5. The condominiums in CityCenter
were originally expected to earn revenue of $2.7 billion, but by the end of 2010
sales stood at only $372 million. Glass Architecture 6. In words that would be at
home in Scheerbart's , the Kohn Pederson Fox website claims the Mandarin Oriental
'hotel tower is clad in rippled reflective glass, which is designed to scatter and
reflect light in a kaleidoscopic fashion . . . . Its illuminated, double-wall
fac&#xB8;ade forms a backdrop for luxury flagship stores, each with a jewel-like
presence on the promenade.' 7. Benjamin's faith in the politically progressive value
of transparency was replicated in Hannes Meyer's comments about the construction of
the United Nations building in New York (see McQuire, 2008: 163-4) and in Grand
Projets Franc&#xB8;ois Mitterand's in France (Fierro, 2003). The temptation to equate
glass with verity is difficult to resist. 8. While Benjamin discussed Scheerbart's
utopian science fiction (Benjamin, 1968: 78; 1999; 2003), Scheerbart's work seems to
have escaped the attention of Jameson (2005). 9. Leaving the building unfinished
saved MGM Mirage about $800 million, but the $279 million the company had already
invested in the Harmon structure could only be written off as a loss (Illia, 2010).
