Architecture, Finance Capital, and the Fictions of Macau's Enclave Urbanism</title>
  <reference order="1">The construction of the arcades was enabled not only by
technical innovations in glass and iron materials but by changes in the economy that
coalesced around the textile trade and luxury goods market (Benjamin, 1968:
77).</reference>
  <reference order="2">To demonstrate homologies with the 'military-industrial
complex', Martin (2003) refers to the 'organizational complex', McQuire (2008) to
the 'media-architecture complex', Foster (2011) to the 'art-architecture complex'
and Taylor (2004) to the 'finance-entertainment complex'.</reference>
  <reference order="3">Martin (2003) demonstrates the role this architecture played
in an epistemic replacement of a Foucaultian disciplinary society with a Deleuzian
network 'society of control'.</reference>
  <reference order="4">'The enclosure of architecture into an historical abstraction
is the formal frontier of the space of flows' (Castells, 2000: 448). Castells
provides interesting examples of what he calls the 'architecture of nudity' that
characterizes contemporary transportation environments (a Spanish airport and train
station).</reference>
  <reference order="5">The condominiums in CityCenter were originally expected to
earn revenue of $2.7 billion, but by the end of 2010 sales stood at only $372
million. Glass Architecture</reference>
  <reference order="6">In words that would be at home in Scheerbart's , the Kohn
Pederson Fox website claims the Mandarin Oriental 'hotel tower is clad in rippled
reflective glass, which is designed to scatter and reflect light in a kaleidoscopic
fashion . . . . Its illuminated, double-wall fac&#xB8;ade forms a backdrop for
luxury flagship stores, each with a jewel-like presence on the
promenade.'</reference>
  <reference order="7">Benjamin's faith in the politically progressive value of
transparency was replicated in Hannes Meyer's comments about the construction of the
United Nations building in New York (see McQuire, 2008: 163-4) and in Grand Projets
Franc&#xB8;ois Mitterand's in France (Fierro, 2003). The temptation to equate glass
with verity is difficult to resist.</reference>
  <reference order="8">While Benjamin discussed Scheerbart's utopian science fiction
(Benjamin, 1968: 78; 1999; 2003), Scheerbart's work seems to have escaped the
attention of Jameson (2005).</reference>
