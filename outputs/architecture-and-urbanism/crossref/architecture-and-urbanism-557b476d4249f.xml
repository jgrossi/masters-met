  <reference order="1">Although she uses di&#xA1;erent terms, Juliet Schor (see
Holt, 2005) expresses very well the view of consumerism assumed here. While I share
her emphasis on producerism, I would explain it as a direct consequence of how the
major transnational corporations operate. My argument in what follows assumes that
capitalist globalization and the culture-ideology of consumerism are unsustainable
in the long run, due to the crises of class polarization and ecological stress (see
Sklair, 2002: 48^57 and passim).</reference>

and its relationship to capitalist globalization and the culture-ideology of
consumerism, see Sklair (2001).</reference>
  <reference order="5">Architectural icons tend to be large, and being the tallest
building in the world at any one time normally guarantees at least temporary iconic
status. However, scale cannot be considered a de&#xA2;ning characteristic of
iconicity as buildings of modest size relative to their surroundings have achieved
iconic status, for example, Mies' Barcelona Pavilion, Wright's Guggenheim in
Manhattan and, more recently, Gehry's house in Santa Monica, Zumpthor's Thermal
Baths, Hadid's Vitra Fire Station and Herzog and de Meuron's Laban Dance Centre in
London.</reference>
  <reference order="6">With Bei jing 2008 in mind, according to a Chinese
o&#x2044;cial: The building [Koolhaas' CCTV headquarters] will be a landmark piece
of architecture recognized at home and abroad, re&#xA3;ecting the spirit of the . .
. times and a high level of cultural taste [it] will play a starring role on screens
around the world' (quoted in Irving, 2002) In the event, it was upstaged by the
National Olympic Stadium, labelled the Bird's Nest, an instant icon and another
global success for architects Herzog and de Meuron along with local partners, China
Architecture Design Institute.</reference>
  <reference order="7">For an elaboration of how these four fractions of the TCC
work in the context of iconic architecture, see Sklair (2005). Here the focus is on
the links between the four fractions in the interests of capitalist
consumerism.</reference>
  <reference order="8">In the course of an interview in the arts section of the
Financial Times, Koolhaas was reminded that critics consider that his Prada store in
New York 'had sacri&#xA2;ced architectural integrity on the altar of consumerism'.
Koolhaas is reported to have laughed at this and cited his public works in the USA
in rebuttal (see Irving, 2002).</reference>
  <reference order="10">For a chilling expose&#xA4; of the conditions under which
those who build such buildings labour in Dubai (and elsewhere), see Human Rights
Watch (2006).</reference>
  <reference order="11">This repeats almost word for word the citation when Jorn
Utzon won the Pritzker Prize in 2003.</reference>
  <reference order="12">In a letter dated 10 April 1954 to Harry Guggenheim (nephew
of Solomon, the original benefactor of the museum, who died in 1949) about the new
director of the Guggenheim, Frank Lloyd Wright presciently observed: 'Sweeney wants
to run a museum-business' (Wright, 1986: 201).</reference>
  <reference order="13">This whole chapter (Dovey, 1999: ch. 11) is very
instructive, particularly the Leunig anti-icon cartoon reproduced in Figure 11.7
(1999: 169).</reference>
  <reference order="14">Ref erring to another massive mall in the area, Broudehoux
(2004: 113) observes: While Sun Dong An's interior design conforms to the sleek
signature style of international shopping malls, the exterior architecture of the
building is a super&#xA2;cial attempt to integrate the building into the local urban
landscape by cloaking it under a familiar guise. This is an interesting comment on
the postcolonialism ^ architecture debate referred to above (see also Abaza,
2001).</reference>
