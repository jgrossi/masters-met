and substantive connections between iconicity and consumerism in the field of
contemporary iconic architecture within the framework of a critical theory of
globalization. Iconicity in architecture is defined in terms of fame and special
symbolic/aesthetic significance as applied to buildings, spaces and in some cases
architects themselves. Iconic architecture is conceptualized as a hegemonic project
of the transnational capitalist class. In the global era, I argue, iconic
architecture strives to turn more or less all public space into consumerist space,
not only in the obvious case of shopping malls but more generally in all cultural
spaces, notably museums and sports complexes. The inspiration that iconic
architecture has provided historically generally coexisted with repressive political
and economic systems, and for change to happen an alternative form of non-capitalist
globalization is necessary. Under such conditions truly inspiring iconic
architecture, including existing architectural icons, may create genuinely democratic
public spaces in which the culture-ideology of consumerism fades away. In this way, a
built environment in which the full array of human talents can flourish may begin to
emerge.<component x="89.12" y="245.25" width="299.22" height="194.52" page="1"

and/or objects that (1) are famous for those within the &#xA2;elds in question
(notably popular culture, fashion and sport) and often also for the public at large
and (2) have special symbolic/aesthetic signi&#xA2;cance attached to them. Icons are
famous not simply for being famous, as is the case for various forms of celebrity,
but famous for possessing speci&#xA2;c symbolic/aesthetic qualities, qualities that
are the subject of considerable debate within the specialist &#xA2;elds and,
increasingly, with the recent rise of the blogosphere, debate to which the general
public actively contributes. In a previous paper (Sklair, 2006) I distinguish between
two contrasting meanings of iconic in architecture, namely the stereotypical copy,
like the iconic Palladian villa or iconic mosque (Iconic I), and something unique as
in unique selling point (Iconic II). Both meanings are, confusingly, in use in
current debates ^ here it is the second meaning that is intended. Consumerism ^ or
more accurately, the culture-ideology of consumerism ^ refers to a set of beliefs and
values, integral but not exclusive to the system of capitalist globalization,
intended to make people believe that human worth is best ensured and happiness is
best achieved in terms of our consumption and possessions. This is relentlessly
reinforced by an infra1 structure of transnational cultural practices within
capitalist globalization. Globalization is conceptualized in terms of transnational
practices, practices that cross state borders but do not necessarily originate with
state agencies, actors or institutions. These practices are analytically
distinguished on three levels ^ economic, political and culture-ideology ^
constituting the sociological totality. At this point, the distinction between
generic globalization, capitalist globalization and alternative (non-capitalist)
globalizations can usefully be introduced. Generic globalization may be de&#xA2;ned
in terms of four criteria ^ the electronic revolution, postcolonialism, the creation
of 2 transnational social spaces, and new forms of cosmopolitanism. Generic
globalization is an abstract framework for analysis, it is not actually existing
globalization. In the concrete conditions of the world as it is today, a world
largely structured by global capitalism, the transnational practices of capitalist
globalization are typically characterized by major institutional forms. The
transnational corporation is the major locus of transnational economic practices; the
transnational capitalist class is the major locus of transnational political
practices; and the major locus of transnational culture-ideology practices is to be
found in the culture-ideology of consumerism. Not all culture is ideological, even in
capitalist societies. Culture-ideology indicates that consumerism in the capitalist
global system can only be fully understood as a culture-ideology practice where
cultural practices reinforce the ideology and the ideology reinforces the cultural
practices. The 'Books are just the beginning' marketing campaign of the Boston Public
Library is a telling example of the culture-ideology of consumerism ^ not even 3
libraries are exempt (see F|gure 1). My argument is that iconicity plays a central
role in promoting the culture-ideology of consumerism in the interests of those who
control capitalist<component x="53.86" y="55.04" width="323.22" height="548.05"

capitalist class, largely through their 4 ownership and/or control of transnational
corporations. While such connections have been made for the &#xA2;elds of popular
culture, fashion and sport, there has been very little systematic research on the
links between iconic architecture and capitalist consumerism. Architecture and
Globalization Iconic architecture is de&#xA2;ned as buildings and spaces that (1) are
famous for those in and around architecture and/or the public at large and (2) have
spe5 cial symbolic/aesthetic signi&#xA2;cance (see Sklair, 2006). The argument is
located within a diachronic thesis suggesting that in the pre-global era (roughly the
period before the 1960s) iconic architecture tended to be driven by the state and/or
religion (though there are, of course, many famous buildings before the 1960s that
were inspired by neither states nor religions), while in the era of capitalist
globalization the dominant force driving iconic architecture is the transnational
capitalist class. In cities this is organized in the form of globalizing urban growth
coalitions (Sklair, 2005). Iconic architecture and architects connect analytically
with generic globalization, in the &#xA2;rst instance, through the capacity that the
electronic revolution provides to design and build spectacular buildings with new
materials in ways that were not previously possible. As capitalism globalizes, and
the culture-ideology of consumerism begins to take hold, iconic architecture starts
to be used in more deliberate ways to transform the built environment, particularly
in globalizing cities. With the emergence and development of computer-aided design
(CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), qualitatively new patterns of
production in architecture and engineering are rapidly disseminated. Tombesi (2001),
for example, shows how technological innovations, particularly in the realm of
computer software and increasing availability of hardware, have promoted a new
international division of labour between architectural o&#x2044;ces in the First
World and in the Third World, and Chung et al. (2001) vividly illustrate how this
works in China. The use of computers to help design and build extraordinary
architecture started with what may be called the &#xA2;rst architectural icon of the
global era ^ the Sydney Opera House ^ whose tortuous building process lasted from
1957 to 1973, surviving the resignation of the architect, Jorn Utzon, in
1966.<component x="65.2" y="55.04" width="323.13" height="58.79" page="3"

Trust estimated that the work carried out even on these primitive computers would
have taken 1000 mathematicians more than 100 years to do (1997: 509, n.28). Many
celebrated living architects readily accept that they could not have made their most
famous designs without the help of CAD. Prominent examples are Norman Foster's
Reichstag Dome in Berlin, the Great Court in the British Museum and the Swiss Re
Building in London, and Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Bilbao and Disney Concert Hall in
Los Angeles. Gehry (or rather his computer technician Jim Glymph) famously adapted
the CATIA (Computer Aided Three-Dimensional Interactive Application) software
developed by the French aerospace company Dassault Syste'mes (Gehry and Friedman,
1999: 15^17), initially for a monumental &#xA2;sh sculpture for the Barcelona
Olympics in 1992 and, most famously, for his Guggenheim Bilbao. Fierro illustrates
how CAD in architecture connects directly with consumerism in her analysis of how a
new system of glazing developed by the engineers RFR made possible the Paris of the
grands projets: 'As a patented system, RFR's structural glazing became a commodity
available for purchase and installation in any type of space. It was immediately
appropriated by developer culture as a means of endowing commercial space with a
fashionable technological &#xA3;ourish' (Fierro, 2003: 217). Thus, iconic
architecture becomes easily, if sometimes expensively, available for globalizing
cities everywhere. Much contemporary architecture, like much of contemporary life, is
unthinkable in the absence of the electronic revolution ^ the &#xA2;rst criterion of
generic globalization. The postcolonial revolution has had profound e&#xA1;ects on
architecture, urbanism and identity all over the world. At one level, this continues
the long-standing arguments about cultural imperialism. King (2004) makes the
connections between postcolonialism and globalization directly, demonstrating that,
despite obvious disparities in power, these relations are rarely in one direction.
This is particularly true in the special, though not so uncommon, circumstance of
'Western' architects building for governments or other clients in what used to be
called the Third World. An excellent illustration of this is the case of the Petronas
Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, built for the state-owned oil company in this
self-described 'moderate' Muslim country. In his account of the attempt to integrate
Islamic motifs into the &#xA3;oorplan of the building to give it a local dimension,
the architect, Cesar Pelli, shows how the postcolonial is not simply a new form of
imperialism but something rather more subtle (Pelli et al., 1997). The Islamic motif
&#xA3;oorplan and Malaysian design elements in no way inhibit the operation of the
shopping mall that occupies the ground &#xA3;oor of the building, one of the most
prestigious transnational social spaces in Asia. Transnational social spaces are
spaces, like globally branded shopping malls, theme parks, waterfront developments
and transportation centres, that could literally be almost anywhere in the world.
What makes them transnational is that they are designed to represent simultaneously
one of the various global architectural styles recognized ^ through the mass media as
much as through direct experience ^ by quite di&#xA1;erent communities of people from
a multitude of geographical, ethnic and cultural origins, and visual references that
mark out speci&#xA2;c senses of belonging identi&#xA2;ed with each of these
communities without o&#xA1;ending the sensibilities of members of other communities ^
the connection with the postcolonial revolution. This is the sphere in which iconic
architecture and the culture-ideology of consumerism relate most directly, insofar as
the culture-ideology of consumerism provides the de&#xA2;ning set of practices and
beliefs ^ in a word, shopping ^ that aspires to transcend the very real
di&#xA1;erences that exist between geographical, ethnic and cultural communities, at
'home'and 'abroad'.Thus, it is in shopping malls of varying designs that we &#xA2;nd
typical transnational social spaces all over the world (see Abaza, 2001). The
ritualistic aspects of shopping and the places where people shop have led to the
common use of the evocative expression'cathedrals of consumption' in this context
(see F|gure 2).<component x="53.86" y="55.04" width="323.16" height="105.96" page="4"

a glib phrase that I regret the instant it slides o&#xA1; my pen. The metaphor of
consumerism as a religion, in which commodities become the icons of worship and the
rituals of exchanging money for goods become a secular equivalent of holy communion,
is simply too glib to be helpful, and too attractive to those whose intentions,
whether they be moral or political, are to expose the evils and limitations of
bourgeois materialism. And yet the metaphor is both attractive and common precisely
because it does convey and construct a knowledge of consumerism. (Fiske, 1991:
13)<component x="77.78" y="431.71" width="299.27" height="98.41" page="6"

lateness="0.24" reference_score="6.57">Ritzer (1999: ch.1) takes this further, and
though he does not speak of transnational social spaces, his theory of consumption as
enchantment clearly has a universal reach.Whatever the merits of the enchantment
thesis, this approach does draw welcome attention to the architecture of places,
metaphorical or literal cathedrals where consumption happens. An apt illustration of
this process is the way in which pre-global era iconic buildings ^ often
traditionally surrounded by sellers of relics etc. ^ have become increasingly
commercialized in recent years, usually in the interests of tourism and
city-marketing. As malls become more cathedral-like, cathedrals, notably St Paul's in
London, have begun to charge admission and open souvenir shops. New forms of
cosmopolitanism are more di&#x2044;cult to pin down in this context, but the most
famous architects ^ dubbed 'starchitects' ^ of today play an increasingly pivotal
role in creating them. This can be seen in the celebrity coverage of the leading
architects in architectural and design magazines and, increasingly, in the cultural
and arts sections of mainstream media (see Sklair, forthcoming). In some special
cases, for example, the debate over the redevelopment of the World Trade Center after
9/11, such coverage spills over onto the front pages and moves up the media news
agendas (see 'Iconic Media Wars' in Jencks, 2005: 64^99). In Glasgow Charles Rennie
Mackintosh and in Barcelona Antoni Gaudi are now part of the marketing of the cities.
There are more architects working outside their places of origin than ever before,
and demand for 'foreign' architects ^ especially from urban growth coalitions in
globalizing cities (urban boosters) ^ has never been greater. Among many clear and
already well-researched examples of this phenomenon two stand out: &#xA2;rst, what
has been termed the Bilbao e&#xA1;ect, referring to the continuing in&#xA3;uence of
Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Bilbao (Del Cerro Santamaria, 2007: ch. 6; McNeill, 2000);
and, second, the case of the foreign architects, notably Herzog and de Meuron, Rem
Koolhaas and Paul Andreu, designing iconic structures in the build-up 6 to the Bei
jing Olympics (Broudehoux, 2004: ch. 6; Ren, forthcoming).<component x="53.86"

essential element in the marketing strategies of globalizing urban growth coalitions.
Global capitalism, therefore, mobilizes the commercial potential of generic
globalization in the sphere of architecture as it does more or less successfully in
all other spheres. While global capitalism provides the structure, the transnational
capitalist class (TCC) provides the agents. The TCC can be conceptualized in terms of
the following four fractions: those who own and/or control the major transnational
corporations and their local a&#x2044;liates (corporate fraction); globalizing
politicians and bureaucrats (state fraction); globalizing professionals (technical
fraction); and merchants and media 7 The consumerist fraction is directly responsible
(consumerist fraction). for the marketing of architecture in all its manifestations
and, ideally, turning architectural icons into special types of commodities. The
end-point of the culture-ideology of consumerism is to render everything into the
commodity form. In architecture, as in other quasi-cultural &#xA2;elds, endowing the
commodity with iconicity is simply a special and added quality that enhances the
exchange (money) value of the icon and all that is associated with it. Obviously,
this process peaks in the realm of shopping. shopping in any case, and proclaimed
that 'shopping has become the dominant mode of contemporary public life' (1993: 18),
many were sceptical. Now, at the endof the &#xA2;rst decade of the newmillennium,the
sceptics are a declining minority ^ whether fromthe point of view of those who live
by the culture-ideology of consumerism or those who condemn it as the greatest blight
on our humanity. The study of malls thus seems important to understand how this
phenomenon is organized ^ invoking &#xA2;ndings fromthe consciousness industry,
environmental design, Madison Avenue and Disney, and the centrality of 'Learning from
Las Vegas' both literally and in terms of the highly in&#xA3;uential treatise of
Robert Venturi and his colleagues (1977). The mall is an instrumental space, where
commercial success depends on nothing being left to chance, from escalator design to
entrances, temperature, lighting, music, mirrors, cleanliness and, of course, the
&#xA3;oorplan: 'a too direct and obvious route between the entrance and exits must be
avoided' (Goss, 1993: 32). The ideal is to construct a narrative which draws the
shopper through maximum consumption opportunities. (This idea is revisited below in
the context of Klein's analysis of 'scripted spaces').There are, of course, some
commercial constraints on mall architects and developers, notably the imperative of
maximizing revenues for every available unit of retail space, but apart fromthis
there are plenty of opportunities for ingenious designers to build various forms of
iconicity into malls at scales from neighbourhood to regional, aspiring national (as
in Mall of America) as well as the globalizing.While the locations are local, the
phenomenon is transnational, 8 connecting the built environment to capitalist
consumerism. Similar trends can be observed in theme parks, waterfront developments
and transportation infrastructure (airports, rail and bus stations) all over the
world. Every city in the world now has its malls and, at least in a minimalist sense,
it can be argued that many if not most malls achieve a measure of local iconicity
just by being malls ^ they are known to all the locals (thus famous), they have
speci&#xA2;c symbolic-aesthetic qualities in terms of either crude modernism and/or
postmodernism and/or variations on vernacular themes.The most famous malls in the
world tend to be admired more for their scale and monumentality, and for what they
represent ^ often the regeneration of a neighborhood or a whole city ^ than for their
architectural qualities as such. However, in recent years the connections between
shopping, consumerism and iconic architecture have been driven much more by boutiques
than by malls. This is best illustrated by the relationship between Prada and its
architects of choice, notably Rem Koolhaas, Herzog and de Meuron, and Kazua Se jima,
all of whom have designed deliberately iconic stores for Prada in globalizing cities.
Vlovine (2003), in an article on the new Prada store in Tokyo, designed by Herzog and
de Meuron (the architects of the Tate Modern in London), quotes the CEO of the
company: 'Architecture is the same as advertising for communicating the brand.'Onthe

many other retailers who see the advantages of such connections. In England, a
long-established central London store, Selfridges, had a new store designed for them
in Birmingham by architects Future Systems (see F|gure 3).This was instantly dubbed
iconic ^ 'A New Icon for UK's Second Largest City: The ''Sexy'' Silver Building' ^ in
the Taiwanese magazine, Dialogue: Architecture + Design + Culture (Sari, 2004:
68^81). The architects were asked if their visuals could be used on the store credit
card (Speaks, 2002). Recognition of the outline of a building, especially in a
skyline, is one of the great signi&#xA2;ers of iconicity, Manhattan being the most
famous example. In the pages of the in&#xA3;uential Harvard Design Magazine, this
phenomenon is termed architainment. 'Theme parks and art museums are increasingly
joined by upscale retailers [and top-end boutique hotels] as patrons of
high-pro&#xA2;le architecture' (Fernandez-Galiano, 2000: 37). Branches of the luxury
goods chain LVMH by the trendy French architect Christian de Portzamparc, Prada by
Rem Koolhaas, and the Royalton and Paramount hotels designed by the even trendier
Philippe Starck (all in Manhattan) are but the most sparkling pinnacles of this
global consumerist iceberg. While luxury boutique hotels<component x="65.2"

design magazines, there are also many large luxury hotel developments that have
caught the eye, like malls, as much for their monumental scale as for their

designed by Atlans &amp; Partners, a distinguished regional practice (also iconized

Barnett, 1976) and John Jerde (e.g. his Bellagio in Las Vegas, Mall of America in
Minneapolis and waterside projects in Fukuoka; see Jerde, 1999; Klein, 2004) have
made the iconic atrium integral to the culture-ideology of consumerism. For shopping
malls, boutiques and hotel resorts the connection between iconic architecture and
consumerism is quite obvious, at least at the local level, but it is not so obvious
with respect to other types of architectural icons, especially in the &#xA2;eld of
culture (performance spaces, especially sports stadia and museums). The Sydney Opera
House is a paradigm case of how a performance space commissioned by public bodies and
designed deliberately to be what is here conceptualized as an architectural icon
(Messent, 1997; esp. chs 3^5; Murray, 2003) is transformed under the conditions of
capitalist globalization into a global icon of the culture-ideology of consumerism.
From its roots as a city icon for Sydney, promoted as a national icon for Australia,
to eventual canonization as a UNESCO World Heritage listed building ^ one indicator
of global iconicity ^ the Sydney Opera House has become one of the best-known
buildings in the world. It is, arguably, the gold standard against which the attempt
to manufacture iconic architecture in the global arena is measured. The clients of
the Guggenheim Bilbao are widely reported to have cited it in these terms ( Jencks,
2005) and in her discussion of the project to build a new National Theatre in Bei
jing, Broudehoux (2004: 227) asserts:<component x="53.86" y="220.13" width="323.16"

commented on the ongoing process to upgrade the Opera House: 'The Federal Government
acknowledges the icon status of the Sydney Opera House, not just as a building in the
hearts of all Australians but as a world-recognised symbol of Australia' 11 (Sydney
Morning Herald, 2007). A manifestation of this was the headline image position of the
Opera House in the multi-million dollar 'Where the bloody hell are you?'
international advertising campaign launched in 2006 for the Australian tourist
industry (Sydney Morning Herald, 2006: 1). The global dissemination of the image of
the icon, already boosted by exposure during the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, goes hand
in hand with the ever-increasing commercialization of the building itself over the
last few decades in the forms of reproduction of the image on more and more
memorabilia, and the enlargement of spending opportunities in and around the site.
The Olympics in particular, and sporting venues in general, provide many good
examples of the links between iconic architecture and consumerism. The architect
explained that after the success of HOK's Stadium Australia for the Sydney Olympics
he decided to focus exclusively on sports and leisure architecture because this is
the building type that most touches the hearts and minds of the common man. 'As
symbols of a region or a . . . nation, as icons of popular culture, stadia are never
viewed in isolation [they] are vigorously competing for praise and attention with
their counterparts elsewhere' (in Sheard, 2001: xiv) and identi&#xA2;ed with popular
aspirations. These 'New Cathedrals of Sport' are 'multi-experience venues fully tuned
into the digital age' ^ circumlocutions signalling the culture-ideology of
consumerism. Sheard goes on to philosophize on sports architecture, a philosophy
grounded with a healthy dose of commercialism:<component x="53.86" y="55.04"

'stadium tourism'. In Munich, for example, the Olympic Stadium is the second most
popular tourist attraction in the city, while in Barcelona more tourists visit Nou
Camp (the home of Barcelona football club) than the Picasso museum. As gate receipts
for sports events decline relative to TV income, merchandising becomes more
important, as in airports all round the world, and this is re&#xA3;ected in the
layout of both types of architecture. For stadia and airports, 'spending time' is
literally two to four hours. The latest high-pro&#xA2;le project of HOK Sports with
Foster + Partners is Wembley Stadium in London, whose original twin towers, known to
football fans all over the world, have been replaced by an already globally
recognizable iconic arch, images of which adorn myriad publicity materials,
directional signs on all the highway approaches to the stadium, and the cover of the
semi-o&#x2044;cial publication Wembley Stadium: National Icon (Barclay and Powell,
2007). This two-way process whereby deliberately iconic architecture and enhanced
consumerism of sports stadia feed into one another is also evident in the case of
museums. Andy Warhol is reputed to have said ^ and if he did, it was a remarkable
prediction ^ that 'All department stores will become museums, and all museums will
become department stores' 12 (as quoted, but without a source, in Jencks, 2005:
44^7). Many museums have increased and upgraded their coverage of architecture and
design at the same time as virtually all major new museums around the world have been
proclaimed architectural icons by their patrons (at the local and/or national and/or
global levels) and their images have been mobilized in the service of the
culture-ideology of consumerism.The production and marketing of architectural icons
and architects as icons (starchitects) have been at the centre of these developments
(Sklair, forthcoming). The role of new museums for urban growth coalitions in
globalizing cities can hardly be over-stated. Lampugnani and Sachs (1999) show that
architecturally distinguished museums by world-famous architects are to be found not
only in the obviously 'global cities' but in many other less obvious candidates for
global credentials, for example in Nimes (Foster), Hamburg (Ungers), Karlsruhe
(Koolhaas), Monterrey (Legorreta), Milwaukee (Calatrava), Cincinnati (Hadid). The
&#xA2;rst iconic museum of the global era was probably Frank Lloyd Wright's
Guggenheim Museum in New York, completed in 1959 a few months after the death of the
architect, and 40 years later Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Bilbao has become just as
iconic. Of the reasons commonly given to explain why some museums become iconic for
the public three stand out, and all of them connect directly with the
culture-ideology of consumerism, i.e. they promote the idea of museums as consumerist
spaces. First, the two Guggenheims and many other successful museums have unusual
sculptural qualities: people visit them to see the museums themselves, as much as and
sometimes rather more than the art inside. Second, as argued above, museums ^ like
all cultural institutions ^ have become much more commercialized in the global era.
Most new museums today have larger shops and a greater variety of art and
architecture-related merchandise and spaces for refreshment than was the case 50
years ago (Zukin, 1995). A ubiquitous feature of the remodelling of old museums is
the addition of consumerist spaces (Harris, 1990). 'Remarkably, the key performance
indicator of retail sales per square foot is higher in MoMA's museum stores than
inWalmart' (Evans, 2003: 431). A further illustration of this is the monumental
advertising of extended opening hours for the Prado in Madrid, &#xA2;ghting o&#xA1;
competition from the more modernist Reina So&#xA2;a and Thyssen museums, nearby (see
F|gure 4). Similarly, consumerist refurbishment of the Victoria and Albert in London
led to the jibe, or maybe it was an advertising slogan, that it was 'a great
cafe&#xA4; with a museum attached' ^ and this sentiment has been repeated for other
museums, for example the recently remodelled MoMA in New York (Evans, 2003: 434).
Third, museums often become endowed with iconicity when they can be seen to
successfully regenerate rundown areas, when they seek to upgrade the shopping and
entertainment potential of the area. This is certainly true for the Guggenheim in
Bilbao, and new museums in many other cities. In London, the 'Tate Modern e&#xA1;ect'
helps to explain how a converted disused power station has transformed a grimy area
south of the Thames and, by connecting it via the new Millennium<component x="65.2"

Consumerist space can be de&#xA2;ned as space in which users are encouraged and
provided with opportunities to spend money, in contrast to non-consumerist space,
that does neither. While Hannigan's idea of 'fantasy city' (1998) is something of an
exaggeration, there is no doubt that his triad of shopertainment, eatertainment and
edutainment, added to the architainment of Fernandez-Galiano (2000) noted above, is a
key component of the mix intended to turn cities that were once centres of productive
labour into sites devoted to the culture-ideology of consumerism. The phenomenon
reported in research from UCLA in 1995, cited by Hannigan, showing that for the
&#xA2;rst time entertainment provided more jobs than aerospace in California, can be
replicated in more or less all globalizing cities all over the world. Iconic
architecture, at least at the local urban level, is the sine qua non for this. This
raises the issue of the relations between public and private space and, more
pointedly, the very survival of genuine public space in our cities (Herzog, 2006). It
must be said that this much-used but monolithic distinction is not as simple as it
sounds, because much public space has been e&#xA1;ectively privatized and some
private space has been made public (Kayden, 2000, on New York; Minton, 2006, on
London). The crux of the matter, in the context of consumerism, is that while
logically it would appear that consumerist spaces need to be public to facilitate
spending, sociologically it is clear that much consumerist space operates as
restricted public space, that is, restricted to those with the means to buy what is
on sale. In his study of Melbourne, Dovey (1999: 187) puts this position quite
starkly, arguing that in the thrill of the skyscraper, public space

'Fortress L.A.', Mike Davis expounds a characteristic radical history of the struggle
over public space, arguing that the traditional complaints by local liberal
intellectuals about 'anti-pedestrian bias . . .fascist obliteration of street
frontage' miss the 'explicit repressive intention, which has its roots in Los
Angeles' ancient his. . . tory of class and race warfare the fortress e&#xA1;ect
emerges not as an inadvertent failure of design, but as a deliberate socio-spatial
strategy' (Davis, 1992: 229). This is evident all the way from people-unfriendly
benches and mega-structures, to the works of Frank Gehry, Disney's 'imagineer' of
urban boosterism. The logical conclusion to this process is the 'panopticon . . .
mall [surrounded by] belligerent lawns . . .and creating the carceral city' (Davis,
1992: 229, ch.4 passim). The dilemma for globalizing urban growth coalitions in
globalizing cities is how to reconcile the maximum number of shoppers with the fear
of undesirables. In many cities the appeal of the mall is precisely the promise of
some protection from urban crime. Such promise can be built into the design of
buildings. For example, it is di&#x2044;cult to enter the exclusive Daslu department
store in Sa&#x2039;o Paulo, Brazil, on foot ^ the obvious entrances are the parking
garages (where valet parking is about one third of the weekly minimum wage) and the
helipad on the roof (Sa&#x2039;o Paulo, one of the 'poorest' cities in the world, is
said to have the highest proportion of private helicopter ownership per capita of any
major city). Restrictions can also be designed into the spaces, for example not
providing comfortable seating, thus discouraging undesirable elements from lingering.
Whatever the contradictions, whatever the restrictions, there is no doubt that cities
all over the world are becoming more consumerist. The clear trend to increasing
commercialization of transportation hubs (especially airports), museums, art
galleries, indeed cultural centres of all types, schools and universities, even some
places of worship ^ not to mention the more obvious examples of the massive rise in
the numbers and scope of malls, theme parks, entertainment spaces and so on (Ritzer,
1999) ^ suggests that a major spatial e&#xA1;ect of capitalist globalization is to
squeeze out non-consumerist space and replace it with consumerist space anywhere that
people are likely to gather or pass through. The use of buyer-generated advertising
(wearing and bearing designer labels on clothing and bags, drink and food containers)
on the streets of cities, towns, even villages all over the world is one highly
visible indicator of the colonization of public space, by the purveyors of the
culture-ideology of consumerism. Klein (2004) elaborates the useful idea of 'scripted
spaces' from its origins in architectural illusions in the 16th century, to the
present day, labelled the 'electronic baroque' of the cinema, amusement parks and all
the other spheres of consumerist space of what has been referred to here as
capitalist globalization. 'By decoding scripted space, we learn how power was
brokered between the classes in the form of special e&#xA1;ects . . .gentle
repression posing as free will' (2004: 11). Contemporary transnational scripted
spaces can be seen as instruments of class control in terms of the hegemony that the
transnational capitalist class wields through the culture-ideology of consumerism.
This phenomenon reaches its apogee in Las Vegas, a me&#xA4;lange of globally iconic
architecture devoted to the culture-ideology of consumerism to an almost absurd

reminder that the relationship between iconic architecture and consumerism produces
losers as well as winners. The upper middle class and the elite occupy Barrio Norte

industrialists to foreign franchises and distributorships, and agriculturalists to
export markets. In the rest of the city, the 'people' carve out their living: many

dilapidated port south of Naples, recruited experts from the group that had recently
revitalized Barcelona to draw up a 'programmatic document' to reinvent Salerno. Zaha
Hadid was employed to design a new ferry terminal (dubbed 'iconic') and David
Chipper&#xA2;eld to regenerate the historic centre, among many other projects.
According to Burdett, a leading architectural entrepreneur, these projects have
transformed Salerno from an industrial backwater to a city of culture and tourism. As
in Barcelona, a charismatic mayor, pragmatic architects and commercial interests used
iconic architecture to boost the city and a 'signi&#xA2;cant indicator of the success
of the operation is that property values in the city centre have increased sevenfold'
(Burdett, 2000: 100). However, it is in Asia that the most spectacular architectural

Wangfujing, the 'Fifth Avenue of Bei jing' and once home of the world's largest
McDonald's, followed rapidly. A new Central Business Districts policy permitted the
displacement of McDonald's (albeit to a site nearby) by the massive Oriental Plaza
scheme, and many others, mostly joint ventures between Hong Kong and Bei jing
developers, with the active participation of the government at city and national
level. 'The goal was to turn Wangfujing into an elaborate and highly e&#x2044;cient
machine devoted to a single activity: consumption' 14 (Broudehoux, 2004: 108). Africa
presents a special problem in this context. As the editors of a comprehensive
collection on global cities (Brenner and Keil, 2006: 189) comment: 'it appears as if
an entire continent has been sidestepped by contemporary forms of globalization'.
However, despite its general position at the bottom of the global socio-economic
hierarchy, similar trends of globalizing through malling can be observed in the major
cities of Africa. South Africa has many malls, some of them, in mall-speak, of
'world-class standard'. In the last few years, the Mlimani City mall in Dar es Salam
in Tanzania, the Lagos Palms mall in Nigeria, and the Accra mall in Ghana were all
marketed as the &#xA2;rst world-class malls in their respective 15 countries.
Conclusion In a work that deserves to be much better known, Bentmann and Muller
(1992, &#xA2;rst published in German in 1970) argued that the rise of the villa as a
building type associated with the name of Andrea Palladio in 16th-century Venice can
best be analysed as a form of hegemonic architecture, that is, architecture that
serves class interests. In this article I have tried to show that most iconic
architecture of the global era is also best analysed as a form of hegemonic
architecture, serving the interests of the transnational capitalist class through the
creation of consumerist space or, more accurately, through the attempt to turn more
or less all public spaces into consumerist space. Just as one can appreciate the
aesthetic qualities of the best Palladian villas while deploring the socio-economic
system they promoted ideologically, one can appreciate the Sydney Opera House or the
Guggenheim Bilbao while deploring the consumerist interests they serve. Fiske raises
a fundamental point, even if in an ironic manner:<component x="53.86" y="226.25"

are not the most sensible sites to engage the critique of iconic architecture in the
service of capitalist consumerism. Goss (1993) explored the challenging idea that
malls should become a third, public, space after home and work/school. Malls, then,
could become places not only to buy and sell but places with other functions, for
example providing for the educational, cultural, health and child care needs of the

reluctant to provide anything for non-shoppers and other types of deviants. Staeheli
and Mitchell (2006) have revisited these issues more recently in terms of the useful
distinction between community and public. In their study of the Carousel Center Mall
and plans for its enormous Disneyesque Destiny, USA complex in Syracuse, New York,
they remind us that malls, in North America at least, have been sites of struggle
over free speech, public access and social services for decades. However, they argue,
malls generally cater for speci&#xA2;c communities, principally of consumers, and
their design and regulations are often biased in terms of class, age, ethnicity and
politics. Parallel to the argument made above that a major spatial e&#xA1;ect of
capitalist globalization is to squeeze out non-consumerist space and replace it with
consumerist space, radical critics of malls argue that they squeeze out publics,
replacing them with consumer communities. One of the hegemonic e&#xA1;ects of the
architecture of malls, which frequently become endowed with lower-level local
iconicity, is to create a disposition to see these buildings ^ usually characterized
by glass and shiny metal to encourage happy and colourful thoughts of transparency,
openness and light ^ as integral to the pleasures of consumption. In this process,
the costs of the culture-ideology of consumerism, in terms of debt, addiction,
stress, ecological damage and class polarization, are conveniently hidden. It need
not always be so. The inspiration that iconic architecture has provided down the ages
often coexisted, albeit uncomfortably, with unpalatable political and economic
systems. But, for change to happen, an alternative form of non-capitalist
globalization is necessary. Under such conditions a truly inspiring iconic
architecture, including existing architectural icons, may enhance genuinely public
spaces in which the culture-ideology of consumerism fades away and is replaced by a
built environment in which the full array of human talents can be given free
rein.<component x="53.86" y="253.79" width="323.16" height="349.3" page="20"

terms, Juliet Schor (see Holt, 2005) expresses very well the view of consumerism
assumed here. While I share her emphasis on producerism, I would explain it as a
direct consequence of how the major transnational corporations operate. My argument
in what follows assumes that capitalist globalization and the culture-ideology of
consumerism are unsustainable in the long run, due to the crises of class
polarization and ecological stress (see Sklair, 2002: 48^57 and passim). 2. For a
detailed discussion of these four criteria of generic globalization see Sklair
(2009). Postcolonialism is used here in its widest sense, not simply with reference
to colonial powers and their colonies (see, for example, the varied contributions to
Krishnaswamy and Hawley, 2008). 3. All images used in this article are my own (the
dates indicate when the picture was taken). 4. For a full exposition of the
transnational capitalist class and its relationship to capitalist globalization and
the culture-ideology of consumerism, see Sklair (2001). 5. Architectural icons tend
to be large, and being the tallest building in the world at any one time normally
guarantees at least temporary iconic status. However, scale cannot be considered a
de&#xA2;ning characteristic of iconicity as buildings of modest size relative to
their surroundings have achieved iconic status, for example, Mies' Barcelona
Pavilion, Wright's Guggenheim in Manhattan and, more recently, Gehry's house in Santa
Monica, Zumpthor's Thermal Baths, Hadid's Vitra Fire Station and Herzog and de
Meuron's Laban Dance Centre in London. 6. With Bei jing 2008 in mind, according to a
Chinese o&#x2044;cial: The building [Koolhaas' CCTV headquarters] will be a landmark
piece of architecture recognized at home and abroad, re&#xA3;ecting the spirit of the
. . . times and a high level of cultural taste [it] will play a starring role on
screens around the world' (quoted in Irving, 2002) In the event, it was upstaged by
the National Olympic Stadium, labelled the Bird's Nest, an instant icon and another
global success for architects Herzog and de Meuron along with local partners, China
Architecture Design Institute. 7. For an elaboration of how these four fractions of
the TCC work in the context of iconic architecture, see Sklair (2005). Here the focus
is on the links between the four fractions in the interests of capitalist
consumerism. 8. In the course of an interview in the arts section of the Financial
Times, Koolhaas was reminded that critics consider that his Prada store in New York
'had sacri&#xA2;ced architectural integrity on the altar of consumerism'. Koolhaas is
reported to have laughed at this and cited his public works in the USA in rebuttal
(see Irving, 2002). 9. The Roark reference is to the architect superhero of Ayn
Rand's novel The Fountainhead. The character was widely said to be based on Frank
Lloyd Wright. In my article on contemporary global starchitects (Sklair, forthcoming)
I argue that the four I chose (Foster, Gehry, Hadid, Koolhaas) all deliberately
espouse what I call the culture-ideology of consumerism in their work. 10. For a
chilling expose&#xA4; of the conditions under which those who build such buildings
labour in Dubai (and elsewhere), see Human Rights Watch (2006). 11. This repeats
almost word for word the citation when Jorn Utzon won the Pritzker Prize in 2003. 12.
In a letter dated 10 April 1954 to Harry Guggenheim (nephew of Solomon, the original
benefactor of the museum, who died in 1949) about the new director of the Guggenheim,
Frank Lloyd Wright presciently observed: 'Sweeney wants to run a museum-business'
(Wright, 1986: 201). 13. This whole chapter (Dovey, 1999: ch. 11) is very
instructive, particularly the Leunig anti-icon cartoon reproduced in Figure 11.7
(1999: 169). 14. Ref erring to another massive mall in the area, Broudehoux (2004:
113) observes: While Sun Dong An's interior design conforms to the sleek signature
style of international shopping malls, the exterior architecture of the building is a
super&#xA2;cial attempt to integrate the building into the local urban landscape by
cloaking it under a familiar guise. This is an interesting comment on the
postcolonialism ^ architecture debate referred to above (see also Abaza, 2001). 15.

and substantive connections between iconicity and consumerism in the field of
contemporary iconic architecture within the framework of a critical theory of
globalization. Iconicity in architecture is defined in terms of fame and special
symbolic/aesthetic significance as applied to buildings, spaces and in some cases
architects themselves. Iconic architecture is conceptualized as a hegemonic project
of the transnational capitalist class. In the global era, I argue, iconic
architecture strives to turn more or less all public space into consumerist space,
not only in the obvious case of shopping malls but more generally in all cultural
spaces, notably museums and sports complexes. The inspiration that iconic
architecture has provided historically generally coexisted with repressive political
and economic systems, and for change to happen an alternative form of non-capitalist
globalization is necessary. Under such conditions truly inspiring iconic
architecture, including existing architectural icons, may create genuinely democratic
public spaces in which the culture-ideology of consumerism fades away. In this way, a
built environment in which the full array of human talents can flourish may begin to
emerge.<component x="89.12" y="245.25" width="299.22" height="194.52" page="1"

and/or objects that (1) are famous for those within the &#xA2;elds in question
(notably popular culture, fashion and sport) and often also for the public at large
and (2) have special symbolic/aesthetic signi&#xA2;cance attached to them. Icons are
famous not simply for being famous, as is the case for various forms of celebrity,
but famous for possessing speci&#xA2;c symbolic/aesthetic qualities, qualities that
are the subject of considerable debate within the specialist &#xA2;elds and,
increasingly, with the recent rise of the blogosphere, debate to which the general
public actively contributes. In a previous paper (Sklair, 2006) I distinguish between
two contrasting meanings of iconic in architecture, namely the stereotypical copy,
like the iconic Palladian villa or iconic mosque (Iconic I), and something unique as
in unique selling point (Iconic II). Both meanings are, confusingly, in use in
current debates ^ here it is the second meaning that is intended. Consumerism ^ or
more accurately, the culture-ideology of consumerism ^ refers to a set of beliefs and
values, integral but not exclusive to the system of capitalist globalization,
intended to make people believe that human worth is best ensured and happiness is
best achieved in terms of our consumption and possessions. This is relentlessly
reinforced by an infra1 structure of transnational cultural practices within
capitalist globalization. Globalization is conceptualized in terms of transnational
practices, practices that cross state borders but do not necessarily originate with
state agencies, actors or institutions. These practices are analytically
distinguished on three levels ^ economic, political and culture-ideology ^
constituting the sociological totality. At this point, the distinction between
generic globalization, capitalist globalization and alternative (non-capitalist)
globalizations can usefully be introduced. Generic globalization may be de&#xA2;ned
in terms of four criteria ^ the electronic revolution, postcolonialism, the creation
of 2 transnational social spaces, and new forms of cosmopolitanism. Generic
globalization is an abstract framework for analysis, it is not actually existing
globalization. In the concrete conditions of the world as it is today, a world
largely structured by global capitalism, the transnational practices of capitalist
globalization are typically characterized by major institutional forms. The
transnational corporation is the major locus of transnational economic practices; the
transnational capitalist class is the major locus of transnational political
practices; and the major locus of transnational culture-ideology practices is to be
found in the culture-ideology of consumerism. Not all culture is ideological, even in
capitalist societies. Culture-ideology indicates that consumerism in the capitalist
global system can only be fully understood as a culture-ideology practice where
cultural practices reinforce the ideology and the ideology reinforces the cultural
practices. The 'Books are just the beginning' marketing campaign of the Boston Public
Library is a telling example of the culture-ideology of consumerism ^ not even 3
libraries are exempt (see F|gure 1). My argument is that iconicity plays a central
role in promoting the culture-ideology of consumerism in the interests of those who

capitalist class, largely through their 4 ownership and/or control of transnational
corporations. While such connections have been made for the &#xA2;elds of popular
culture, fashion and sport, there has been very little systematic research on the
links between iconic architecture and capitalist consumerism. Architecture and
Globalization Iconic architecture is de&#xA2;ned as buildings and spaces that (1) are
famous for those in and around architecture and/or the public at large and (2) have
spe5 cial symbolic/aesthetic signi&#xA2;cance (see Sklair, 2006). The argument is
located within a diachronic thesis suggesting that in the pre-global era (roughly the
period before the 1960s) iconic architecture tended to be driven by the state and/or
religion (though there are, of course, many famous buildings before the 1960s that
were inspired by neither states nor religions), while in the era of capitalist
globalization the dominant force driving iconic architecture is the transnational
capitalist class. In cities this is organized in the form of globalizing urban growth
coalitions (Sklair, 2005). Iconic architecture and architects connect analytically
with generic globalization, in the &#xA2;rst instance, through the capacity that the
electronic revolution provides to design and build spectacular buildings with new
materials in ways that were not previously possible. As capitalism globalizes, and
the culture-ideology of consumerism begins to take hold, iconic architecture starts
to be used in more deliberate ways to transform the built environment, particularly
in globalizing cities. With the emergence and development of computer-aided design
(CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), qualitatively new patterns of
production in architecture and engineering are rapidly disseminated. Tombesi (2001),
for example, shows how technological innovations, particularly in the realm of
computer software and increasing availability of hardware, have promoted a new
international division of labour between architectural o&#x2044;ces in the First
World and in the Third World, and Chung et al. (2001) vividly illustrate how this
works in China. The use of computers to help design and build extraordinary
architecture started with what may be called the &#xA2;rst architectural icon of the
global era ^ the Sydney Opera House ^ whose tortuous building process lasted from
1957 to 1973, surviving the resignation of the architect, Jorn Utzon, in
1966.<component x="65.2" y="55.04" width="323.13" height="58.79" page="3"

Trust estimated that the work carried out even on these primitive computers would
have taken 1000 mathematicians more than 100 years to do (1997: 509, n.28). Many
celebrated living architects readily accept that they could not have made their most
famous designs without the help of CAD. Prominent examples are Norman Foster's
Reichstag Dome in Berlin, the Great Court in the British Museum and the Swiss Re
Building in London, and Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Bilbao and Disney Concert Hall in
Los Angeles. Gehry (or rather his computer technician Jim Glymph) famously adapted
the CATIA (Computer Aided Three-Dimensional Interactive Application) software
developed by the French aerospace company Dassault Syste'mes (Gehry and Friedman,
1999: 15^17), initially for a monumental &#xA2;sh sculpture for the Barcelona
Olympics in 1992 and, most famously, for his Guggenheim Bilbao. Fierro illustrates
how CAD in architecture connects directly with consumerism in her analysis of how a
new system of glazing developed by the engineers RFR made possible the Paris of the
grands projets: 'As a patented system, RFR's structural glazing became a commodity
available for purchase and installation in any type of space. It was immediately
appropriated by developer culture as a means of endowing commercial space with a
fashionable technological &#xA3;ourish' (Fierro, 2003: 217). Thus, iconic
architecture becomes easily, if sometimes expensively, available for globalizing
cities everywhere. Much contemporary architecture, like much of contemporary life, is
unthinkable in the absence of the electronic revolution ^ the &#xA2;rst criterion of
generic globalization. The postcolonial revolution has had profound e&#xA1;ects on
architecture, urbanism and identity all over the world. At one level, this continues
the long-standing arguments about cultural imperialism. King (2004) makes the
connections between postcolonialism and globalization directly, demonstrating that,
despite obvious disparities in power, these relations are rarely in one direction.
This is particularly true in the special, though not so uncommon, circumstance of
'Western' architects building for governments or other clients in what used to be
called the Third World. An excellent illustration of this is the case of the Petronas
Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, built for the state-owned oil company in this
self-described 'moderate' Muslim country. In his account of the attempt to integrate
Islamic motifs into the &#xA3;oorplan of the building to give it a local dimension,
the architect, Cesar Pelli, shows how the postcolonial is not simply a new form of
imperialism but something rather more subtle (Pelli et al., 1997). The Islamic motif
&#xA3;oorplan and Malaysian design elements in no way inhibit the operation of the
shopping mall that occupies the ground &#xA3;oor of the building, one of the most
prestigious transnational social spaces in Asia. Transnational social spaces are
spaces, like globally branded shopping malls, theme parks, waterfront developments
and transportation centres, that could literally be almost anywhere in the world.
What makes them transnational is that they are designed to represent simultaneously
one of the various global architectural styles recognized ^ through the mass media as
much as through direct experience ^ by quite di&#xA1;erent communities of people from
a multitude of geographical, ethnic and cultural origins, and visual references that
mark out speci&#xA2;c senses of belonging identi&#xA2;ed with each of these
communities without o&#xA1;ending the sensibilities of members of other communities ^
the connection with the postcolonial revolution. This is the sphere in which iconic
architecture and the culture-ideology of consumerism relate most directly, insofar as
the culture-ideology of consumerism provides the de&#xA2;ning set of practices and
beliefs ^ in a word, shopping ^ that aspires to transcend the very real
di&#xA1;erences that exist between geographical, ethnic and cultural communities, at
'home'and 'abroad'.Thus, it is in shopping malls of varying designs that we &#xA2;nd
typical transnational social spaces all over the world (see Abaza, 2001). The
ritualistic aspects of shopping and the places where people shop have led to the
common use of the evocative expression'cathedrals of consumption' in this context
(see F|gure 2).<component x="53.86" y="55.04" width="323.16" height="105.96" page="4"

a glib phrase that I regret the instant it slides o&#xA1; my pen. The metaphor of
consumerism as a religion, in which commodities become the icons of worship and the
rituals of exchanging money for goods become a secular equivalent of holy communion,
is simply too glib to be helpful, and too attractive to those whose intentions,
whether they be moral or political, are to expose the evils and limitations of
bourgeois materialism. And yet the metaphor is both attractive and common precisely
because it does convey and construct a knowledge of consumerism. (Fiske, 1991:

though he does not speak of transnational social spaces, his theory of consumption as
enchantment clearly has a universal reach.Whatever the merits of the enchantment
thesis, this approach does draw welcome attention to the architecture of places,
metaphorical or literal cathedrals where consumption happens. An apt illustration of
this process is the way in which pre-global era iconic buildings ^ often
traditionally surrounded by sellers of relics etc. ^ have become increasingly
commercialized in recent years, usually in the interests of tourism and
city-marketing. As malls become more cathedral-like, cathedrals, notably St Paul's in
London, have begun to charge admission and open souvenir shops. New forms of
cosmopolitanism are more di&#x2044;cult to pin down in this context, but the most
famous architects ^ dubbed 'starchitects' ^ of today play an increasingly pivotal
role in creating them. This can be seen in the celebrity coverage of the leading
architects in architectural and design magazines and, increasingly, in the cultural
and arts sections of mainstream media (see Sklair, forthcoming). In some special
cases, for example, the debate over the redevelopment of the World Trade Center after
9/11, such coverage spills over onto the front pages and moves up the media news
agendas (see 'Iconic Media Wars' in Jencks, 2005: 64^99). In Glasgow Charles Rennie
Mackintosh and in Barcelona Antoni Gaudi are now part of the marketing of the cities.
There are more architects working outside their places of origin than ever before,
and demand for 'foreign' architects ^ especially from urban growth coalitions in
globalizing cities (urban boosters) ^ has never been greater. Among many clear and
already well-researched examples of this phenomenon two stand out: &#xA2;rst, what
has been termed the Bilbao e&#xA1;ect, referring to the continuing in&#xA3;uence of
Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Bilbao (Del Cerro Santamaria, 2007: ch. 6; McNeill, 2000);
and, second, the case of the foreign architects, notably Herzog and de Meuron, Rem
Koolhaas and Paul Andreu, designing iconic structures in the build-up 6 to the Bei
jing Olympics (Broudehoux, 2004: ch. 6; Ren, forthcoming).<component x="53.86"

Global capitalism, therefore, mobilizes the commercial potential of generic
globalization in the sphere of architecture as it does more or less successfully in
all other spheres. While global capitalism provides the structure, the transnational
capitalist class (TCC) provides the agents. The TCC can be conceptualized in terms of
the following four fractions: those who own and/or control the major transnational
corporations and their local a&#x2044;liates (corporate fraction); globalizing
politicians and bureaucrats (state fraction); globalizing professionals (technical
fraction); and merchants and media 7 The consumerist fraction is directly responsible
(consumerist fraction). for the marketing of architecture in all its manifestations
and, ideally, turning architectural icons into special types of commodities. The
end-point of the culture-ideology of consumerism is to render everything into the
commodity form. In architecture, as in other quasi-cultural &#xA2;elds, endowing the
commodity with iconicity is simply a special and added quality that enhances the
exchange (money) value of the icon and all that is associated with it. Obviously,
this process peaks in the realm of shopping. shopping in any case, and proclaimed
that 'shopping has become the dominant mode of contemporary public life' (1993: 18),
many were sceptical. Now, at the endof the &#xA2;rst decade of the newmillennium,the
sceptics are a declining minority ^ whether fromthe point of view of those who live
by the culture-ideology of consumerism or those who condemn it as the greatest blight
on our humanity. The study of malls thus seems important to understand how this
phenomenon is organized ^ invoking &#xA2;ndings fromthe consciousness industry,
environmental design, Madison Avenue and Disney, and the centrality of 'Learning from
Las Vegas' both literally and in terms of the highly in&#xA3;uential treatise of
Robert Venturi and his colleagues (1977). The mall is an instrumental space, where
commercial success depends on nothing being left to chance, from escalator design to
entrances, temperature, lighting, music, mirrors, cleanliness and, of course, the
&#xA3;oorplan: 'a too direct and obvious route between the entrance and exits must be
avoided' (Goss, 1993: 32). The ideal is to construct a narrative which draws the
shopper through maximum consumption opportunities. (This idea is revisited below in
the context of Klein's analysis of 'scripted spaces').There are, of course, some
commercial constraints on mall architects and developers, notably the imperative of
maximizing revenues for every available unit of retail space, but apart fromthis
there are plenty of opportunities for ingenious designers to build various forms of
iconicity into malls at scales from neighbourhood to regional, aspiring national (as
in Mall of America) as well as the globalizing.While the locations are local, the
phenomenon is transnational, 8 connecting the built environment to capitalist
consumerism. Similar trends can be observed in theme parks, waterfront developments
and transportation infrastructure (airports, rail and bus stations) all over the
world. Every city in the world now has its malls and, at least in a minimalist sense,
it can be argued that many if not most malls achieve a measure of local iconicity
just by being malls ^ they are known to all the locals (thus famous), they have
speci&#xA2;c symbolic-aesthetic qualities in terms of either crude modernism and/or
postmodernism and/or variations on vernacular themes.The most famous malls in the
world tend to be admired more for their scale and monumentality, and for what they
represent ^ often the regeneration of a neighborhood or a whole city ^ than for their
architectural qualities as such. However, in recent years the connections between
shopping, consumerism and iconic architecture have been driven much more by boutiques
than by malls. This is best illustrated by the relationship between Prada and its
architects of choice, notably Rem Koolhaas, Herzog and de Meuron, and Kazua Se jima,
all of whom have designed deliberately iconic stores for Prada in globalizing cities.
Vlovine (2003), in an article on the new Prada store in Tokyo, designed by Herzog and
de Meuron (the architects of the Tate Modern in London), quotes the CEO of the
company: 'Architecture is the same as advertising for communicating the brand.'Onthe

iconic ^ 'A New Icon for UK's Second Largest City: The ''Sexy'' Silver Building' ^ in
the Taiwanese magazine, Dialogue: Architecture + Design + Culture (Sari, 2004:
68^81). The architects were asked if their visuals could be used on the store credit
card (Speaks, 2002). Recognition of the outline of a building, especially in a
skyline, is one of the great signi&#xA2;ers of iconicity, Manhattan being the most
famous example. In the pages of the in&#xA3;uential Harvard Design Magazine, this
phenomenon is termed architainment. 'Theme parks and art museums are increasingly
joined by upscale retailers [and top-end boutique hotels] as patrons of
high-pro&#xA2;le architecture' (Fernandez-Galiano, 2000: 37). Branches of the luxury

design magazines, there are also many large luxury hotel developments that have
caught the eye, like malls, as much for their monumental scale as for their
architectural quality. An outstanding example is the Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai,
designed by Atlans &amp; Partners, a distinguished regional practice (also iconized
in Sari, 2004). This hotel complex, with its distinctive Arab dhow shape, is only the
best-known of many self-proclaimed 'iconic' architectural features that 10 have
turned Dubai into a new wonder of the (consumerist) world. Of the major
architect^developers of the global age, John Portman (e.g. his Peachtree Center in
Atlanta and Westin Bonaventure in Los Angeles; see Jameson, 1991; Portman and
Barnett, 1976) and John Jerde (e.g. his Bellagio in Las Vegas, Mall of America in
Minneapolis and waterside projects in Fukuoka; see Jerde, 1999; Klein, 2004) have
made the iconic atrium integral to the culture-ideology of consumerism. For shopping
malls, boutiques and hotel resorts the connection between iconic architecture and
consumerism is quite obvious, at least at the local level, but it is not so obvious
with respect to other types of architectural icons, especially in the &#xA2;eld of
culture (performance spaces, especially sports stadia and museums). The Sydney Opera
House is a paradigm case of how a performance space commissioned by public bodies and
designed deliberately to be what is here conceptualized as an architectural icon
(Messent, 1997; esp. chs 3^5; Murray, 2003) is transformed under the conditions of
capitalist globalization into a global icon of the culture-ideology of consumerism.
From its roots as a city icon for Sydney, promoted as a national icon for Australia,
to eventual canonization as a UNESCO World Heritage listed building ^ one indicator
of global iconicity ^ the Sydney Opera House has become one of the best-known
buildings in the world. It is, arguably, the gold standard against which the attempt
to manufacture iconic architecture in the global arena is measured. The clients of

acknowledges the icon status of the Sydney Opera House, not just as a building in the

Morning Herald, 2007). A manifestation of this was the headline image position of the
Opera House in the multi-million dollar 'Where the bloody hell are you?'
international advertising campaign launched in 2006 for the Australian tourist
industry (Sydney Morning Herald, 2006: 1). The global dissemination of the image of
the icon, already boosted by exposure during the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, goes hand
in hand with the ever-increasing commercialization of the building itself over the
last few decades in the forms of reproduction of the image on more and more
memorabilia, and the enlargement of spending opportunities in and around the site.
The Olympics in particular, and sporting venues in general, provide many good
examples of the links between iconic architecture and consumerism. The architect
explained that after the success of HOK's Stadium Australia for the Sydney Olympics
he decided to focus exclusively on sports and leisure architecture because this is
the building type that most touches the hearts and minds of the common man. 'As
symbols of a region or a . . . nation, as icons of popular culture, stadia are never
viewed in isolation [they] are vigorously competing for praise and attention with
their counterparts elsewhere' (in Sheard, 2001: xiv) and identi&#xA2;ed with popular
aspirations. These 'New Cathedrals of Sport' are 'multi-experience venues fully tuned
into the digital age' ^ circumlocutions signalling the culture-ideology of
consumerism. Sheard goes on to philosophize on sports architecture, a philosophy
grounded with a healthy dose of commercialism:<component x="53.86" y="55.04"

lateness="0.48" reference_score="7.82">Hence, the new consumerist phenomenon of
'stadium tourism'. In Munich, for example, the Olympic Stadium is the second most
popular tourist attraction in the city, while in Barcelona more tourists visit Nou
Camp (the home of Barcelona football club) than the Picasso museum. As gate receipts
for sports events decline relative to TV income, merchandising becomes more
important, as in airports all round the world, and this is re&#xA3;ected in the
layout of both types of architecture. For stadia and airports, 'spending time' is
literally two to four hours. The latest high-pro&#xA2;le project of HOK Sports with
Foster + Partners is Wembley Stadium in London, whose original twin towers, known to
football fans all over the world, have been replaced by an already globally
recognizable iconic arch, images of which adorn myriad publicity materials,
directional signs on all the highway approaches to the stadium, and the cover of the
semi-o&#x2044;cial publication Wembley Stadium: National Icon (Barclay and Powell,
2007). This two-way process whereby deliberately iconic architecture and enhanced
consumerism of sports stadia feed into one another is also evident in the case of
museums. Andy Warhol is reputed to have said ^ and if he did, it was a remarkable
prediction ^ that 'All department stores will become museums, and all museums will
become department stores' 12 (as quoted, but without a source, in Jencks, 2005:
44^7). Many museums have increased and upgraded their coverage of architecture and
design at the same time as virtually all major new museums around the world have been
proclaimed architectural icons by their patrons (at the local and/or national and/or
global levels) and their images have been mobilized in the service of the
culture-ideology of consumerism.The production and marketing of architectural icons
and architects as icons (starchitects) have been at the centre of these developments
(Sklair, forthcoming). The role of new museums for urban growth coalitions in
globalizing cities can hardly be over-stated. Lampugnani and Sachs (1999) show that
architecturally distinguished museums by world-famous architects are to be found not
only in the obviously 'global cities' but in many other less obvious candidates for
global credentials, for example in Nimes (Foster), Hamburg (Ungers), Karlsruhe
(Koolhaas), Monterrey (Legorreta), Milwaukee (Calatrava), Cincinnati (Hadid). The
&#xA2;rst iconic museum of the global era was probably Frank Lloyd Wright's
Guggenheim Museum in New York, completed in 1959 a few months after the death of the
architect, and 40 years later Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Bilbao has become just as
iconic. Of the reasons commonly given to explain why some museums become iconic for
the public three stand out, and all of them connect directly with the
culture-ideology of consumerism, i.e. they promote the idea of museums as consumerist
spaces. First, the two Guggenheims and many other successful museums have unusual
sculptural qualities: people visit them to see the museums themselves, as much as and
sometimes rather more than the art inside. Second, as argued above, museums ^ like
all cultural institutions ^ have become much more commercialized in the global era.
Most new museums today have larger shops and a greater variety of art and
architecture-related merchandise and spaces for refreshment than was the case 50
years ago (Zukin, 1995). A ubiquitous feature of the remodelling of old museums is
the addition of consumerist spaces (Harris, 1990). 'Remarkably, the key performance
indicator of retail sales per square foot is higher in MoMA's museum stores than
inWalmart' (Evans, 2003: 431). A further illustration of this is the monumental
advertising of extended opening hours for the Prado in Madrid, &#xA2;ghting o&#xA1;
competition from the more modernist Reina So&#xA2;a and Thyssen museums, nearby (see
F|gure 4). Similarly, consumerist refurbishment of the Victoria and Albert in London
led to the jibe, or maybe it was an advertising slogan, that it was 'a great
cafe&#xA4; with a museum attached' ^ and this sentiment has been repeated for other
museums, for example the recently remodelled MoMA in New York (Evans, 2003: 434).
Third, museums often become endowed with iconicity when they can be seen to
successfully regenerate rundown areas, when they seek to upgrade the shopping and
entertainment potential of the area. This is certainly true for the Guggenheim in
Bilbao, and new museums in many other cities. In London, the 'Tate Modern e&#xA1;ect'
helps to explain how a converted disused power station has transformed a grimy area
south of the Thames and, by connecting it via the new Millennium<component x="65.2"

Consumerist space can be de&#xA2;ned as space in which users are encouraged and
provided with opportunities to spend money, in contrast to non-consumerist space,
that does neither. While Hannigan's idea of 'fantasy city' (1998) is something of an
exaggeration, there is no doubt that his triad of shopertainment, eatertainment and
edutainment, added to the architainment of Fernandez-Galiano (2000) noted above, is a
key component of the mix intended to turn cities that were once centres of productive
labour into sites devoted to the culture-ideology of consumerism. The phenomenon
reported in research from UCLA in 1995, cited by Hannigan, showing that for the
&#xA2;rst time entertainment provided more jobs than aerospace in California, can be
replicated in more or less all globalizing cities all over the world. Iconic
architecture, at least at the local urban level, is the sine qua non for this. This
raises the issue of the relations between public and private space and, more
pointedly, the very survival of genuine public space in our cities (Herzog, 2006). It
must be said that this much-used but monolithic distinction is not as simple as it
sounds, because much public space has been e&#xA1;ectively privatized and some
private space has been made public (Kayden, 2000, on New York; Minton, 2006, on
London). The crux of the matter, in the context of consumerism, is that while
logically it would appear that consumerist spaces need to be public to facilitate
spending, sociologically it is clear that much consumerist space operates as
restricted public space, that is, restricted to those with the means to buy what is
on sale. In his study of Melbourne, Dovey (1999: 187) puts this position quite
starkly, arguing that in the thrill of the skyscraper, public space

'Fortress L.A.', Mike Davis expounds a characteristic radical history of the struggle
over public space, arguing that the traditional complaints by local liberal
intellectuals about 'anti-pedestrian bias . . .fascist obliteration of street
frontage' miss the 'explicit repressive intention, which has its roots in Los
Angeles' ancient his. . . tory of class and race warfare the fortress e&#xA1;ect
emerges not as an inadvertent failure of design, but as a deliberate socio-spatial
strategy' (Davis, 1992: 229). This is evident all the way from people-unfriendly
benches and mega-structures, to the works of Frank Gehry, Disney's 'imagineer' of
urban boosterism. The logical conclusion to this process is the 'panopticon . . .
mall [surrounded by] belligerent lawns . . .and creating the carceral city' (Davis,
1992: 229, ch.4 passim). The dilemma for globalizing urban growth coalitions in
globalizing cities is how to reconcile the maximum number of shoppers with the fear
of undesirables. In many cities the appeal of the mall is precisely the promise of
some protection from urban crime. Such promise can be built into the design of
buildings. For example, it is di&#x2044;cult to enter the exclusive Daslu department
store in Sa&#x2039;o Paulo, Brazil, on foot ^ the obvious entrances are the parking
garages (where valet parking is about one third of the weekly minimum wage) and the
helipad on the roof (Sa&#x2039;o Paulo, one of the 'poorest' cities in the world, is
said to have the highest proportion of private helicopter ownership per capita of any
major city). Restrictions can also be designed into the spaces, for example not
providing comfortable seating, thus discouraging undesirable elements from lingering.
Whatever the contradictions, whatever the restrictions, there is no doubt that cities
all over the world are becoming more consumerist. The clear trend to increasing
commercialization of transportation hubs (especially airports), museums, art
galleries, indeed cultural centres of all types, schools and universities, even some
places of worship ^ not to mention the more obvious examples of the massive rise in
the numbers and scope of malls, theme parks, entertainment spaces and so on (Ritzer,
1999) ^ suggests that a major spatial e&#xA1;ect of capitalist globalization is to
squeeze out non-consumerist space and replace it with consumerist space anywhere that
people are likely to gather or pass through. The use of buyer-generated advertising
(wearing and bearing designer labels on clothing and bags, drink and food containers)
on the streets of cities, towns, even villages all over the world is one highly
visible indicator of the colonization of public space, by the purveyors of the
culture-ideology of consumerism. Klein (2004) elaborates the useful idea of 'scripted
spaces' from its origins in architectural illusions in the 16th century, to the
present day, labelled the 'electronic baroque' of the cinema, amusement parks and all
the other spheres of consumerist space of what has been referred to here as
capitalist globalization. 'By decoding scripted space, we learn how power was
brokered between the classes in the form of special e&#xA1;ects . . .gentle
repression posing as free will' (2004: 11). Contemporary transnational scripted
spaces can be seen as instruments of class control in terms of the hegemony that the
transnational capitalist class wields through the culture-ideology of consumerism.
This phenomenon reaches its apogee in Las Vegas, a me&#xA4;lange of globally iconic

industrialists to foreign franchises and distributorships, and agriculturalists to

dilapidated port south of Naples, recruited experts from the group that had recently
revitalized Barcelona to draw up a 'programmatic document' to reinvent Salerno. Zaha
Hadid was employed to design a new ferry terminal (dubbed 'iconic') and David
Chipper&#xA2;eld to regenerate the historic centre, among many other projects.
According to Burdett, a leading architectural entrepreneur, these projects have
transformed Salerno from an industrial backwater to a city of culture and tourism. As
in Barcelona, a charismatic mayor, pragmatic architects and commercial interests used
iconic architecture to boost the city and a 'signi&#xA2;cant indicator of the success
of the operation is that property values in the city centre have increased sevenfold'
(Burdett, 2000: 100). However, it is in Asia that the most spectacular architectural

Wangfujing, the 'Fifth Avenue of Bei jing' and once home of the world's largest
McDonald's, followed rapidly. A new Central Business Districts policy permitted the
displacement of McDonald's (albeit to a site nearby) by the massive Oriental Plaza
scheme, and many others, mostly joint ventures between Hong Kong and Bei jing
developers, with the active participation of the government at city and national
level. 'The goal was to turn Wangfujing into an elaborate and highly e&#x2044;cient
machine devoted to a single activity: consumption' 14 (Broudehoux, 2004: 108). Africa
presents a special problem in this context. As the editors of a comprehensive
collection on global cities (Brenner and Keil, 2006: 189) comment: 'it appears as if
an entire continent has been sidestepped by contemporary forms of globalization'.
However, despite its general position at the bottom of the global socio-economic
hierarchy, similar trends of globalizing through malling can be observed in the major
cities of Africa. South Africa has many malls, some of them, in mall-speak, of
'world-class standard'. In the last few years, the Mlimani City mall in Dar es Salam
in Tanzania, the Lagos Palms mall in Nigeria, and the Accra mall in Ghana were all
marketed as the &#xA2;rst world-class malls in their respective 15 countries.
Conclusion In a work that deserves to be much better known, Bentmann and Muller
(1992, &#xA2;rst published in German in 1970) argued that the rise of the villa as a
building type associated with the name of Andrea Palladio in 16th-century Venice can
best be analysed as a form of hegemonic architecture, that is, architecture that
serves class interests. In this article I have tried to show that most iconic
architecture of the global era is also best analysed as a form of hegemonic
architecture, serving the interests of the transnational capitalist class through the
creation of consumerist space or, more accurately, through the attempt to turn more
or less all public spaces into consumerist space. Just as one can appreciate the
aesthetic qualities of the best Palladian villas while deploring the socio-economic
system they promoted ideologically, one can appreciate the Sydney Opera House or the
Guggenheim Bilbao while deploring the consumerist interests they serve. Fiske raises
a fundamental point, even if in an ironic manner:<component x="53.86" y="226.25"

success of the culture-ideology of consumerism (see F|gure 6). Perhaps luxury hotels
are not the most sensible sites to engage the critique of iconic architecture in the
service of capitalist consumerism. Goss (1993) explored the challenging idea that
malls should become a third, public, space after home and work/school. Malls, then,
could become places not only to buy and sell but places with other functions, for
example providing for the educational, cultural, health and child care needs of the
community. Some malls do o&#xA1;er some of these facilities in relatively

reluctant to provide anything for non-shoppers and other types of deviants. Staeheli
and Mitchell (2006) have revisited these issues more recently in terms of the useful
distinction between community and public. In their study of the Carousel Center Mall
and plans for its enormous Disneyesque Destiny, USA complex in Syracuse, New York,
they remind us that malls, in North America at least, have been sites of struggle
over free speech, public access and social services for decades. However, they argue,
malls generally cater for speci&#xA2;c communities, principally of consumers, and
their design and regulations are often biased in terms of class, age, ethnicity and
politics. Parallel to the argument made above that a major spatial e&#xA1;ect of
capitalist globalization is to squeeze out non-consumerist space and replace it with
consumerist space, radical critics of malls argue that they squeeze out publics,
replacing them with consumer communities. One of the hegemonic e&#xA1;ects of the
architecture of malls, which frequently become endowed with lower-level local
iconicity, is to create a disposition to see these buildings ^ usually characterized
by glass and shiny metal to encourage happy and colourful thoughts of transparency,
openness and light ^ as integral to the pleasures of consumption. In this process,
the costs of the culture-ideology of consumerism, in terms of debt, addiction,
stress, ecological damage and class polarization, are conveniently hidden. It need
not always be so. The inspiration that iconic architecture has provided down the ages
often coexisted, albeit uncomfortably, with unpalatable political and economic
systems. But, for change to happen, an alternative form of non-capitalist
globalization is necessary. Under such conditions a truly inspiring iconic
architecture, including existing architectural icons, may enhance genuinely public
spaces in which the culture-ideology of consumerism fades away and is replaced by a
built environment in which the full array of human talents can be given free
rein.<component x="53.86" y="253.79" width="323.16" height="349.3" page="20"

terms, Juliet Schor (see Holt, 2005) expresses very well the view of consumerism
assumed here. While I share her emphasis on producerism, I would explain it as a
direct consequence of how the major transnational corporations operate. My argument
in what follows assumes that capitalist globalization and the culture-ideology of
consumerism are unsustainable in the long run, due to the crises of class
polarization and ecological stress (see Sklair, 2002: 48^57 and passim). 2. For a
detailed discussion of these four criteria of generic globalization see Sklair
(2009). Postcolonialism is used here in its widest sense, not simply with reference
to colonial powers and their colonies (see, for example, the varied contributions to
Krishnaswamy and Hawley, 2008). 3. All images used in this article are my own (the
dates indicate when the picture was taken). 4. For a full exposition of the
transnational capitalist class and its relationship to capitalist globalization and
the culture-ideology of consumerism, see Sklair (2001). 5. Architectural icons tend
to be large, and being the tallest building in the world at any one time normally
guarantees at least temporary iconic status. However, scale cannot be considered a
de&#xA2;ning characteristic of iconicity as buildings of modest size relative to
their surroundings have achieved iconic status, for example, Mies' Barcelona
Pavilion, Wright's Guggenheim in Manhattan and, more recently, Gehry's house in Santa
Monica, Zumpthor's Thermal Baths, Hadid's Vitra Fire Station and Herzog and de
Meuron's Laban Dance Centre in London. 6. With Bei jing 2008 in mind, according to a
Chinese o&#x2044;cial: The building [Koolhaas' CCTV headquarters] will be a landmark
piece of architecture recognized at home and abroad, re&#xA3;ecting the spirit of the
. . . times and a high level of cultural taste [it] will play a starring role on
screens around the world' (quoted in Irving, 2002) In the event, it was upstaged by
the National Olympic Stadium, labelled the Bird's Nest, an instant icon and another
global success for architects Herzog and de Meuron along with local partners, China
Architecture Design Institute. 7. For an elaboration of how these four fractions of
the TCC work in the context of iconic architecture, see Sklair (2005). Here the focus
is on the links between the four fractions in the interests of capitalist
consumerism. 8. In the course of an interview in the arts section of the Financial
Times, Koolhaas was reminded that critics consider that his Prada store in New York
'had sacri&#xA2;ced architectural integrity on the altar of consumerism'. Koolhaas is
reported to have laughed at this and cited his public works in the USA in rebuttal
(see Irving, 2002). 9. The Roark reference is to the architect superhero of Ayn
Rand's novel The Fountainhead. The character was widely said to be based on Frank
Lloyd Wright. In my article on contemporary global starchitects (Sklair, forthcoming)
I argue that the four I chose (Foster, Gehry, Hadid, Koolhaas) all deliberately
espouse what I call the culture-ideology of consumerism in their work. 10. For a
chilling expose&#xA4; of the conditions under which those who build such buildings
labour in Dubai (and elsewhere), see Human Rights Watch (2006). 11. This repeats
almost word for word the citation when Jorn Utzon won the Pritzker Prize in 2003. 12.
In a letter dated 10 April 1954 to Harry Guggenheim (nephew of Solomon, the original
benefactor of the museum, who died in 1949) about the new director of the Guggenheim,
Frank Lloyd Wright presciently observed: 'Sweeney wants to run a museum-business'
(Wright, 1986: 201). 13. This whole chapter (Dovey, 1999: ch. 11) is very
instructive, particularly the Leunig anti-icon cartoon reproduced in Figure 11.7
(1999: 169). 14. Ref erring to another massive mall in the area, Broudehoux (2004:
113) observes: While Sun Dong An's interior design conforms to the sleek signature
style of international shopping malls, the exterior architecture of the building is a
super&#xA2;cial attempt to integrate the building into the local urban landscape by
cloaking it under a familiar guise. This is an interesting comment on the
postcolonialism ^ architecture debate referred to above (see also Abaza, 2001). 15.
