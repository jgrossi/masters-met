that they failed to produce a 'socialist space', just reproducing the modernist model
of urban design: 'Change life! Change Society! These precepts mean nothing without
the production of an appropriate space. A lesson to be learned from the Soviet
constructivists of 1920-30, and from their failure, is that new social relationships

differences. Nevertheless, fashions and ideas were being communicated all over the

Alexandra Kohring's article deals with a turning point in Soviet architecture, i.e.
the replacement of the monumental style of the Stalin era by the so-called 'socialist
democratic' style of the 1950s. &#xA8; Kohring analyses the interrelationship between
aesthetic considerations, programmatic claims, political ambitions and ideological
framework using the example of the building of the Luzhniki sports complex in Moscow.
Her story of how the paradigm of urban transformation was fundamentally changed under
the conditions of late Stalinism, the death of the dictator in 1953 and the
Khrushchev 'thaw', covers the development of the prototype of a young 'sporting city'
combining elements of natural landscape, garden architecture and standardized
('industrialized') buildings (stadium, training grounds, facilities). The article by
Kay Schiller and Chris Young also examines a change in post-war architectural
concepts, but a decade later in the 1960s and in connection with the forthcoming
'mega-event' of the Munich Games in 1972. The concept of a landscape in motion was
suitable for the spectacle of the Munich Games, as well as for everyday life after
the Olympics, and can be regarded as a reflection of a broader 'discourse on
democracy'. But what seems to be a concept of an open and transparent, informal and
well-organized public park could also be a means of camouflaging the architects'
past-political and ideological conflicts. Christian Tagsold's article examines
modernity as a concept in constant flux. He makes this evident by analysing the
spatial model and architectural design of the Tokyo Olympics in 1964. Starting from
the assumption that the Olympics were a symbol of modernity, Tagsold discusses the
peculiarities of his case. Japan, as a 'reborn' nation was confronted by the lasting
legacy of the 'ultra-nationalist disaster', the ruling conservatism and the burden of
the Tenno monarchy. The sports 4 5 spectacle served as a rite of passage into
modernity. The Games bridged the The Production of Space E. Relph, H. Lefebvre, The

powerful reflection of the 'new' Japan and its fundamentally transformed capital. All
three articles are concerned with special cases of modernist sports architecture and
landscape design at different stages of the Cold War. In their consideration of the
political character of major urban projects, the authors show that spatial practices,
rhetorical inscriptions and symbolic meanings played a fundamental role in reshaping
post-war society, ideological frameworks and everyday life. However, what at first
glance seems to be similar or even the same - sports as a catalyst of modernizing
processes - had a different impact on the various societies and acted in different
ways and directions. Under the conditions of post-war reconstruction, Cold War policy
and superpower relations, sport became a crucial field of cultural transfer and a
dynamic force of (inter)nationalism; as part of the reciprocal exchange of modes and
styles, it was a competition in architecture and counter-architecture, a building and
design race. Thus, the question is whether the sports terminology served merely as a
means of communication or as a key code to get through the outer layers into a deeper
understanding. If 6 was sports architecture modernity is actually a comparative
framework, a driving force of internationalism? A modern design could also be used as
'ideological hairdressing' or as the newspeak of modernity, a lingua franca of
(inter)nationalism, a translation from inferiority into superiority, i.e. for the
styling and shaping of societies in transition. The three articles rest on the
assumption that by virtue of their provisional character parks, landscapes and
gardens belong to sports micro-history. This means that the authors are looking at
very specific instances of design (or the lack thereof) at particular moments in
time. They are seeking to find out the values and ideas which a particular architect,
designer or engineer, a state, party or local official, or a pressure group,
institution or individual sought to impress upon the landscape and the planned
building ensemble. They describe and illustrate the individual layout of each sports
park but give only limited information about its uses and interpretations.
Consequently, we nowknowmore about intentions and motivations than about changing
perceptions and practices. What about 'euphoric' visitors, young sportsmen and
sportswomen, what about emotions and atmosphere, what about the feeling of 'harmony'
and 'beauty' in parks and stadia? The ways in which the consumers interacted inside
the park and stadium, and whether they were indeed playing the game according to
architects' and designers' ideas, also need further examination. The planned sports

terms of the interdependence of successive or synchronic socio-cultural and political
crises and an increased interest in new concepts of space and architectural solutions
among different social forces. Playgrounds, the stadium or whole ensembles of sports
arenas, facilities and landscapes served as places of social transformation
dissolving the boundaries between the actors and the spectators, social classes and
ethnic groups. However, the unification of them into a collective body was by no
means the end of the story. As the articles show, modern sports architecture and
concepts of space generate complex collective identities as well as individualistic
modes of behaviour. Modern sports could function in a cohesive as well as in a
disintegrating way. The decision to obtain the status of a sports superpower or to
host the Olympic Games obviously had a deep impact on the history of the Cold War as
well as on the individual countries. By studying the history of sports architecture,
