New Urbanism (CNU) was founded by a group of architects dedicated to "creat[ing]
buildings, neighborhoods, and regions that provide a high quality of life for all
residents, while protecting the natural environment" (CNU [13]). Through the redesign
of regions, neighborhoods, and buildings, new urbanists promise no less than the end
of urban sprawl, the recreation of communities, and improvements in the quality of
life (NU [32]). New urbanism has been hailed as the most signicfiant movement in
urban planning and architecture in this century (Fulton [19] and CNU [13]).<component

criticism from much of the architectural academy, the ideas behind CNUs' Charter have
been gradually integrated into curricula at top planning and architecture schools. In
brief, the principles of new urbanism include high density, mixed use neighborhoods;
convenient public transit, bicycles paths and pedestrian-friendly street networks;
strategically placed open spaces; and architecture designed to foster social
interaction (NU [32]). While the movement has elicited considerable discussion and
debate among urban planners, urban sociologists, urban geographers, and architects
for over a decade, new urbanism has received little formal analysis. The reasons are
twofold. First, new urbanism is primarily about urban design, which is difcfiult to
quantify and thus poorly suited for applying formal analytical tools. Second, new
urbanism, like its close relative, smart growth, generally favors the use of
government plans and regulations to address an illdenfied problem. Thus the movement
is unlikely to draw the attention of those who favor formal analysis. In this paper
we attempt a formal analysis of the virtues of new urbanism. Using Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) we rfist develop quantitative measures of urban form; we
then incorporate those measures in a hedonic price analysis. In essence, our research
strategy involves the disaggregation of new urbanism into its component parts and an
examination of the implicit prices those parts yield in the market place. We do not
argue that ours is the best approach to assess the contributions of new urbanist
designs to social welfare. Such an examination would require an analysis of social
benefits that accrue to nonresidents of new urbanist communities. We do argue,
however, that our approach advances knowledge about this question both in the
measurement of new urbanist features (or urban form) and in the identification of
those features for which homeowners are willing to pay. In the analysis that follows,
we consider six sets of characteristics that affect the value of single-family homes:
physical housing attributes of the homes, public service levels, location, amenities
and disamenities, socioeconomic characteristics, and new urbanist design features in
the neighborhood. By isolating the effects on price of these variables, we can
estimate the contributions to single-family home values by features of urban form. We
nfid that our measures of urban form capture meaningful differences in the character
of urban neighborhoods that could well have direct impacts on the utility of urban
residents. Further, we nfid that such differences are capitalized into residential
property values. The results imply that some but not all of the design features of
new urbanism provide benetfis for which urban residents are willing to pay.<component

examine the impacts of urban form or architectural character on property values. Cao
and Cory [12], for example, showed that increasing industrial, commercial,
multi-family and public land uses tend to increase surrounding home values. They thus
concluded that an optimal mix of land use activities should be sought in locating
economic activities into neighborhoods. Guttery [22] examined the sale prices of 1672
houses located in the Greater Dallas-Fort Worth-Denton metroplex and found negative
impacts from having rear-entry alleyways. Asabere [5] provided empirical evidence
from Halifax, Nova Scotia, which showed that location on a cul-de-sac yields a 29
percent price premium over houses located on a grid street pattern. Benson et al.
[9], Asabere and Huffman [7], and Grudnitski and Do [21] estimated the value of
having scenic views of open space and from locating close to a golf course. Not
surprising, they found that views and neighboring golf course increase property
values. Finally, many have also examined the effects of proximity to transit on
property values. Bowes and Ihlanfeldt [10] incorporated both the direct and the
indirect effects of transit stations on the attractiveness of nearby neighborhoods.
They found that stations located away from downtown have positive impacts on property
values. They have also found that there are negative externalities from location near
stations in low-income neighborhoods or close to downtown. Other studies have
measured the inuflence of architecture on property value. Asabere et al. [6]
estimated the effect of residential architectural styles on housing prices in
Newburyport, Massachusetts. They found premiums of 14 to 21 percent for four "older
architectural styles," Colonial, Victorian, Federal, and Garrison, relative to Ranch
style. Moorhouse and Smith [29] explored the effects of a major 19th century American
urban architectural form, the row house. They found that specicfi architectural
features are more highly valued when they differentiate one row house from its
immediate neighbors. Vandell and Lane [40] estimated the impact of "good
architectural design" on the value of commercial buildings in Boston. They found a
strong inuflence of design on rents and a weak relationship between vacancies and
design quality. Hough and Kratz [24] also estimated the effect of "good architecture"
on commercial rents in Chicago. They found that tenants are willing to pay a premium
to be in new architecturally signicfiant ofcfie buildings, but saw no benetfis
associated with old ofcfie buildings that express recognized aesthetic excellence.
The studies above notwithstanding, "new urbanism" per se has received little
attention by economists. Recent market research shows that there is a demand for
denser, more walkable residential environments in the United States as a whole, and
the growing demand is a result of changing demographics, changing tastes, and the
closing of the suburban frontier (CNU [14], and Myers and Gearin [30]). Eppli and Tu
[17], and Tu and Eppli [38] are published studies that have examined the premiums
captured by new urbanist developments. They compared the prices of single-family
homes in new urbanist and suburban neighborhoods and found consumers willing to pay a
premium for houses in a new urbanist neighborhood. They did not, however, attempt to
isolate which design elements of a new urbanist neighborhood produced the price
premium. The work by Eppli and Tu presumes that there are only two kinds of
neighborhoods: new urbanist and traditional suburban. In fact there are many
different types of neighborhoods with many different design features, and consumers
might have multifaceted housing preferences (AL [2]). As suggested by Myers and
Gearin [30], "Neither traditional neighborhood design nor conventional suburban
development may be the housing consumers' ideal. Rather, the ideal home style may be
something else and may fall somewhere on the housing spectrum between there two
design alternatives. Similarly, individual household preferences for a single ideal
housing type may in fact include a spectrum of types, united by key design criteria."
All together, considerable research suggests that certain elements of urban
architectural style can be capitalized into property values. To date, however, there
have been no studies that have focused on the features of new urbanism to determine
if they, in isolation or combined, affect property values. We attempt to do so

transformation of the metropolitan area into a multi-nucleated urban form, the
development of a multi-modal transportation system, and the designation of mixed use
regional and town centers (Metro [27], Katz [25], and Calthorpe [11]). The Plan was
approved in 1997 along with its implementation vehicle, the Urban Growth Functional

these we computed several measures of urban form for Washington Countys' 60 census
tracts, 186 block groups, and 237 sub-block groups (where sub-block groups are formed
by further partitioning block groups by major arterials). Then for each neighborhood

neighborhood by the median y"ear built" attribute of all single-family units it
contained. We then explored, both visually and statistically, changes in our measures

form Definitions of each variable are provided in Table 1. 3.2.1. Street design and
circulation systems According to critics of sprawl, contemporary suburban
developments contain too many winding streets and cul-de-sacs, blocks that are too
big, and road networks that lack connectivity. According to this point of view,
better connectivity leads to more walking and biking, fewer vehicle miles traveled,
higher air quality, and greater sense of community among residents (Benefild et al.
[8]). Our measures of connectivity involve the number of street nodes and segments,
total miles of streets in the neighborhood, the number and lengths of blocks, the
proximity to cul-de-sacs, the lengths of cul-de-sacs, and the distance 5 between
points of access into the neighborhood. 3.2.2. Density According to critics of
sprawl, contemporary urban development is dominated by single-family housing on large
lots. To such critics, low-density development increases automobile dependence,
consumes excessive farmland, and raises the cost of public infrastructure (APA [4]).
We offer two measures of density: single-family residential (SFR) dwelling unit
density and population density. 3.2.3. Land use mix According to critics of sprawl,
contemporary urban developments are homogeneous and lack a mix of land uses. To such
critics greater mixing of uses facilitates walking and biking, lowers vehicle miles
traveled, improves air quality, and enhances urban aesthetics (APA [4]). We offer two
indices that measure land use diversity within a neighborhood. Both are based on the
concept of entropya- measure of variation, dispersion or diversity (Turner et al.
[39]). The rfist measure includes single-family residential use and captures the
overall mixture of land uses. The second measure excludes single-family use and
captures the mixture of land uses in the non-single-family residential sector. 3.2.4.
Accessibility According to critics of sprawl, contemporary urban development is
characterized by too much separation between uses and thus travel distances that are
too long (APA [4]). Here<component x="118.32" y="588.0" width="359.16" height="92.73"

3.2.5. Transportation mode choice A fundamental element of new urbanism is design
that enables transportation mode choice (Katz [25]). Here we focus on access to
Portlands' light rail system. To explore the effect of accessibility to light rail
stations, we proceed by disaggregating the effects of proximity to the stations into
two time periods and by station location. That is, we identiefid properties that were
located near stations before and after the line went into operation in downtown
Hillsboro, in downtown Beaverton, and in between Hillsboro and Beaverton. 3.2.6.
Pedestrian walkability According to critics of sprawl, contemporary development
patterns create great distances between destinations and thus discourage walking.
Pedestrian access encourages residents to walk, lowers vehicle miles traveled, and
improves human health (Frank and Englke [18]). According to conventional wisdom,
pedestrians in the United States are willing to walk no longer than one-quarter mile
(Duany and Plater-Zyberk [16]). Thus we measure pedestrian walkability as the
percentage of single-family homes (again using lot centroids) that are within
one-quarter mile network distance of commercial uses and bus stops.<component

including the -statistics and coefficients of each of the 7 2 significant variables,
are provided in Table 4. TheR indicates that we were able to explain 84 percent of
the variation in single-family home prices. Most of the coefficients have expected
signs. 4.2.1. Control variables Property physical housing attributes. As expected,
LOTSIZE and FLOORSPACE are positively related to house price. The expected negative
sign of AGE reveals that an older home is worth less than a newer home, and the
positive sign of AGESQUARE indicates that the relationship between house value and
house age is not linear. Public service levels. Public services are capitalized into
property values. As expected, INCITY is positively related to house price, reeflcting
the value of services provided by cities. The expected negative sign of TAXRT reveals
that property taxes are capitalized in property values. The positive sign of SAT and
negative sign of STU/TEA indicate that, as expected, home buyers prefer school
districts with higher SAT scores and lower student/teacher ratios. Location. Location
matters. Negative signs of the variables HILLCBD and PORTCBD, indicate that housing
prices fall with distance from the Portland and Hillsboro CBDs. Since the CBDs of
Portland and Hillsboro are major employment centers, this was expected. The sign of
the variable BEAVCBD, however, is positive. Though not expected, this likely reflects
the character of downtown Beaverton as more of an automobile-oriented retail center
than an employment center. Amenity and disamenities. Amenities and disamenities
affect housing prices as expected. The positive sign of GOLF is consistent with
earlier studies. The positive coefcfiient on the binary variable MOUTNVW indicates
that a view of the mountains increases property value. The sign of MINRDDIS has the
expected negative sign, indicating that home buyers pay a premium for the houses with
better accessibility to minor roads.<component x="118.32" y="609.36" width="358.59"

exercise of incorporating spatial effects into our hedonic price structure
explicitly. From a subset of our dataset, the results indicated the presence of
spatial error dependence. In other words, the error term at each location is
correlated with values for the error term at other locations. This might be due to
two of following reasons. First, measurement errors are likely to exist and to spill
over across the spatial units since some data are collected and constructed at an
aggregate scale. Second, some of the omitted variables, such as number of rooms,
exterior material of the house and other house physical characteristics, are
correlated and this might be another cause for the presence of spatial error
dependence. In the presence of spatial error dependence and spatial
heteroskedasticity, OLS estimates are still unbiased (Anselin [3]). Therefore, we
present the results from OLS analysis in the paper. 7 Eleven variables, HILLSC,
BEAVSC, TTSC, FGSC, ONWATER, PCTWHITE, MEDINC, Y91, BUSDIS, HILLAO, BEAVAO, are

exposure to trafcfi characteristics all exhibit the expected relationships. The
negative signs of ONMAJRD and ONLRT indicate that home buyers pay less for the houses
that are within 150 feet of a major road, or 500 feet of the light rail line for
possible noise nuisance effects. Socioeconomic characteristics. Socioeconomic
variables PCTWHITE and MEDINC are not signicfiant, perhaps due to the lack of
variation of race and income in our study area. The dummy variables that capture the
year of sale (with sales in 1990 as the reference variable) indicate that
single-family home prices have been increasing since 1992. 4.2.2. Measures of urban
form Street design and circulation systems. The positive sign of INTCONN indicates
that home buyers pay a premium for an internally connective neighborhood. This is
consistent with the positive sign of STMILE, indicating that people prefer more
streets being provided within a neighborhood. The positive sign of BLOCKS indicates
that home buyers prefer to be located in a neighborhood designed with more blocks per
housing unit. This result is consistent with the negative sign of BLOCKSIZE, which
indicates that home buyers pay a premium for a house located in a neighborhood with
smaller blocks. The positive sign of CULDESAC indicates that home buyers pay more to
be located by cul-de-sacs. The negative sign of LENGTHCDS, however, indicates that
people prefer shorter dead-end streets. The positive sign of EXTCONN indicates that
home buyers prefer to be located in a neighborhood that is less connected to the
outside. Density. The negative signs of both SFRDNSTY and POPDNSTY are consistent
with the previous market surveys which reveal that people prefer neighborhoods with
low population density and low dwelling-unit density. Land use mix. The negative sign
of LUMIX indicates that consumers prefer single-family residential as the dominant
use in the neighborhood. The positive sign of NRMIX further shows that the other land
uses such as multi-family residential, industrial, public, and commercial uses are
preferred to be distributed evenly in the neighborhoods. Accessibility. The positive
sign of COMDIS is unexpected. The plausible explanation might be the nuisance effects
brought by general commercial uses exceed the amenity effects of being closer to
commercial uses. PARKDIS has the expected negative sign, indicating that home buyers
pay a premium for the houses located closer to a park. Transportation mode choice.
The effects of proximity to light rail stations on housing price meet expectations.
Properties sold at a higher price after the line was operated in all three areas:
downtown Hillsboro, downtown Beaverton and those between Hillsboro and Beaverton.
Before the line was operational, proximity to the stations had no effect on property
values except for those between Hillsboro and Beaverton. The negative effect of
proximity to stations between Hillsboro and Beaverton before the line was operated
can be explained as follows. Before the light rail stations were constructed, this
area was occupied mainly by vacant green spaces, and underdeveloped rural enclaves
without established single-family neighborhoods. As planned, these areas were
targeted for transitoriented redevelopment and increased in value as a result. These
nfidings are consistent with previous research (Knaap et al. [26]). Pedestrian
walkability. For variables measuring pedestrian walkability to commercial uses and
bus stops, the results are mixed. The positive sign of PEDCOM indicates that
consumers prefer to have more pedestrian accessibility to commercial uses, while the
negative sign of PEDBUS indicates that home buyers do not prefer to be too close to
bus stops. Additional 11 cross-sectional regressions (results are not presented in
this paper) were run to examine possible variations in the effects of urban form
features on housing prices over time. Similar results to those reported above have
been found.<component x="118.32" y="635.88" width="358.82" height="44.85" page="14"

Using this procedure, we evaluate the premium that home buyers pay for a house in a
new urbanist neighborhood. As discussed above, the fourth and ffith columns of Table
5 provide the attributes' values of our two hypothetical singlefamily homes: one in a
typical suburban neighborhood and the other in a new urbanist neighborhood. To
calculate the sale prices for our two examples, the values of each of the attributes
are inserted into Eq. (2), and the values of the coefcfiients are culled from Table
4. The overall prices for these two examples ($132,731 and $156,986) and the
difference between the two ($24,255) are shown in the last row of Table 5. Following
the above approach, the change in the value of a typical suburban house ($132,731),

adding up all the marginal effects in the last column, which would be wrong due to
nonlinearity of the exponential. 11 Critics have suggested that the premium resulting
from new urbanism development might indeed reflect higher production costs of
construction and highly perceived risks of investment in new urbanism communities
(Rybczynski [35], Gyourko and Rybczynski [23]). To address this issue, analysis can
be expanded to a two-stage estimation using the methodologies provided by Rosen [34].
If we can obtain the production functions for new urbanist construction, we would be
able to estimate the underlying supply and demand functions of new urbanism
development. We leave this for further research. 12 In other papers, for example, we
have used these measures to examine changes in urban form over time (Song and Knaap
[36]) and to estimate the effects of urban form on transportation mode choice
(Rajamani et al. [33]).<component x="118.32" y="146.23" width="358.62"

more streets, shorter dead-end streets; more and smaller blocks; better pedestrian
accessibility to commercial uses; more evenly distributed mixed land uses in the
neighborhood; and proximity to operating light rail stations. We also nfid residents
are willing to pay less for houses in neighborhoods that are dense, contain more
commercial, multifamily, and public uses (relative to single-family uses), and
contain major transportation arterials. When combining these features in composite
sketches of new urbanist and traditional neighborhoods, we nfid that homes in a new
urbanist neighborhood command an aggregate price premium. What is more, we nfid that
this premium more than compensates for the severe price discount for the small size
of new urbanists lots. Much of the premium comes from improvements in internal
connectivity that stem from smaller blocks, and shorter streets. Some of the premium
also stems from lesser external connectivity, or greater transport isolation. Some of
the premium also comes from pedestrian accessibility to commercial usese-ven though
those uses are not valued in the neighborhood. It is dangerous, of course, to
generalize from the attributes of a single new urbanist development as other
developments that could be described as new urbanist could well differ in character a
great deal from Orenco. But the Orenco example supports previous research that new
urbanist neighborhoods do provide a price premium. More importantly, our results show
that the price premium, or discount, of any particular neighborhood depends on the
particular design characteristics it has to offer. In short, design matters. Further,
though the price of a single-family home is difcfiult to predict, , the statistical
relationships among design characteristics and 48 000 sales observations are robust
and compelling. Based on market signals, the results suggest that the virtues of new
urbanist neighborhoods include enhanced internal connectivity, improved pedestrian
access to commercial uses, better transit access, and less external connectivity. The
detractions of new urbanist neighborhoods include, higher densities, greater mixture
of land uses, and smaller lots.<component x="118.32" y="363.47" width="359.01"

New Urbanism (CNU) was founded by a group of architects dedicated to "creat[ing]
buildings, neighborhoods, and regions that provide a high quality of life for all
residents, while protecting the natural environment" (CNU [13]). Through the redesign
of regions, neighborhoods, and buildings, new urbanists promise no less than the end
of urban sprawl, the recreation of communities, and improvements in the quality of
life (NU [32]). New urbanism has been hailed as the most signicfiant movement in
urban planning and architecture in this century (Fulton [19] and CNU [13]).<component

criticism from much of the architectural academy, the ideas behind CNUs' Charter have
been gradually integrated into curricula at top planning and architecture schools. In
brief, the principles of new urbanism include high density, mixed use neighborhoods;
convenient public transit, bicycles paths and pedestrian-friendly street networks;
strategically placed open spaces; and architecture designed to foster social
interaction (NU [32]). While the movement has elicited considerable discussion and
debate among urban planners, urban sociologists, urban geographers, and architects
for over a decade, new urbanism has received little formal analysis. The reasons are
twofold. First, new urbanism is primarily about urban design, which is difcfiult to
quantify and thus poorly suited for applying formal analytical tools. Second, new
urbanism, like its close relative, smart growth, generally favors the use of
government plans and regulations to address an illdenfied problem. Thus the movement
is unlikely to draw the attention of those who favor formal analysis. In this paper
we attempt a formal analysis of the virtues of new urbanism. Using Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) we rfist develop quantitative measures of urban form; we
then incorporate those measures in a hedonic price analysis. In essence, our research
strategy involves the disaggregation of new urbanism into its component parts and an
examination of the implicit prices those parts yield in the market place. We do not
argue that ours is the best approach to assess the contributions of new urbanist
designs to social welfare. Such an examination would require an analysis of social
benefits that accrue to nonresidents of new urbanist communities. We do argue,
however, that our approach advances knowledge about this question both in the
measurement of new urbanist features (or urban form) and in the identification of
those features for which homeowners are willing to pay. In the analysis that follows,
we consider six sets of characteristics that affect the value of single-family homes:
physical housing attributes of the homes, public service levels, location, amenities
and disamenities, socioeconomic characteristics, and new urbanist design features in
the neighborhood. By isolating the effects on price of these variables, we can
estimate the contributions to single-family home values by features of urban form. We
nfid that our measures of urban form capture meaningful differences in the character
of urban neighborhoods that could well have direct impacts on the utility of urban
residents. Further, we nfid that such differences are capitalized into residential
property values. The results imply that some but not all of the design features of
new urbanism provide benetfis for which urban residents are willing to pay.<component

examine the impacts of urban form or architectural character on property values. Cao
and Cory [12], for example, showed that increasing industrial, commercial,
multi-family and public land uses tend to increase surrounding home values. They thus
concluded that an optimal mix of land use activities should be sought in locating
economic activities into neighborhoods. Guttery [22] examined the sale prices of 1672
houses located in the Greater Dallas-Fort Worth-Denton metroplex and found negative
impacts from having rear-entry alleyways. Asabere [5] provided empirical evidence
from Halifax, Nova Scotia, which showed that location on a cul-de-sac yields a 29
percent price premium over houses located on a grid street pattern. Benson et al.
[9], Asabere and Huffman [7], and Grudnitski and Do [21] estimated the value of
having scenic views of open space and from locating close to a golf course. Not
surprising, they found that views and neighboring golf course increase property
values. Finally, many have also examined the effects of proximity to transit on
property values. Bowes and Ihlanfeldt [10] incorporated both the direct and the
indirect effects of transit stations on the attractiveness of nearby neighborhoods.
They found that stations located away from downtown have positive impacts on property
values. They have also found that there are negative externalities from location near
stations in low-income neighborhoods or close to downtown. Other studies have
measured the inuflence of architecture on property value. Asabere et al. [6]
estimated the effect of residential architectural styles on housing prices in
Newburyport, Massachusetts. They found premiums of 14 to 21 percent for four "older
architectural styles," Colonial, Victorian, Federal, and Garrison, relative to Ranch
style. Moorhouse and Smith [29] explored the effects of a major 19th century American
urban architectural form, the row house. They found that specicfi architectural
features are more highly valued when they differentiate one row house from its
immediate neighbors. Vandell and Lane [40] estimated the impact of "good
architectural design" on the value of commercial buildings in Boston. They found a
strong inuflence of design on rents and a weak relationship between vacancies and
design quality. Hough and Kratz [24] also estimated the effect of "good architecture"
on commercial rents in Chicago. They found that tenants are willing to pay a premium
to be in new architecturally signicfiant ofcfie buildings, but saw no benetfis
associated with old ofcfie buildings that express recognized aesthetic excellence.
The studies above notwithstanding, "new urbanism" per se has received little
attention by economists. Recent market research shows that there is a demand for
denser, more walkable residential environments in the United States as a whole, and
the growing demand is a result of changing demographics, changing tastes, and the
closing of the suburban frontier (CNU [14], and Myers and Gearin [30]). Eppli and Tu
[17], and Tu and Eppli [38] are published studies that have examined the premiums
captured by new urbanist developments. They compared the prices of single-family
homes in new urbanist and suburban neighborhoods and found consumers willing to pay a
premium for houses in a new urbanist neighborhood. They did not, however, attempt to
isolate which design elements of a new urbanist neighborhood produced the price
premium. The work by Eppli and Tu presumes that there are only two kinds of
neighborhoods: new urbanist and traditional suburban. In fact there are many
different types of neighborhoods with many different design features, and consumers
might have multifaceted housing preferences (AL [2]). As suggested by Myers and
Gearin [30], "Neither traditional neighborhood design nor conventional suburban
development may be the housing consumers' ideal. Rather, the ideal home style may be
something else and may fall somewhere on the housing spectrum between there two
design alternatives. Similarly, individual household preferences for a single ideal
housing type may in fact include a spectrum of types, united by key design criteria."
All together, considerable research suggests that certain elements of urban
architectural style can be capitalized into property values. To date, however, there
have been no studies that have focused on the features of new urbanism to determine
if they, in isolation or combined, affect property values. We attempt to do so

metropolitan area and has an international reputation as 1 a leader in battle against
urban sprawl. In 1991, Metro, Portlands' regional government, began work on the 2040
Plan. Following the principles of new urbanism, the goals of the plan include the
transformation of the metropolitan area into a multi-nucleated urban form, the
development of a multi-modal transportation system, and the designation of mixed use
regional and town centers (Metro [27], Katz [25], and Calthorpe [11]). The Plan was
approved in 1997 along with its implementation vehicle, the Urban Growth Functional
Plan, which speciefid binding targets and performance measures for each of the
subordinate cities and counties. Under Metros' Charter, cities and counties are
required to change their comprehensive plans and subdivision regulations to assure

alternatives: census tracts, block groups, and sub-block groups. To choose among
these we computed several measures of urban form for Washington Countys' 60 census
tracts, 186 block groups, and 237 sub-block groups (where sub-block groups are formed
by further partitioning block groups by major arterials). Then for each neighborhood
(census tract, block group, and sub-block group), we assigned the age of the
neighborhood by the median y"ear built" attribute of all single-family units it
contained. We then explored, both visually and statistically, changes in our measures
of urban form over time. We found that neighborhoods denfied at the census tract

measures. For each block-group "neighborhood" we then computed vfie sets of urban
form Definitions of each variable are provided in Table 1. 3.2.1. Street design and
circulation systems According to critics of sprawl, contemporary suburban
developments contain too many winding streets and cul-de-sacs, blocks that are too
big, and road networks that lack connectivity. According to this point of view,
better connectivity leads to more walking and biking, fewer vehicle miles traveled,
higher air quality, and greater sense of community among residents (Benefild et al.
[8]). Our measures of connectivity involve the number of street nodes and segments,
total miles of streets in the neighborhood, the number and lengths of blocks, the
proximity to cul-de-sacs, the lengths of cul-de-sacs, and the distance 5 between
points of access into the neighborhood. 3.2.2. Density According to critics of
sprawl, contemporary urban development is dominated by single-family housing on large
lots. To such critics, low-density development increases automobile dependence,
consumes excessive farmland, and raises the cost of public infrastructure (APA [4]).
We offer two measures of density: single-family residential (SFR) dwelling unit
density and population density. 3.2.3. Land use mix According to critics of sprawl,
contemporary urban developments are homogeneous and lack a mix of land uses. To such
critics greater mixing of uses facilitates walking and biking, lowers vehicle miles
traveled, improves air quality, and enhances urban aesthetics (APA [4]). We offer two
indices that measure land use diversity within a neighborhood. Both are based on the
concept of entropya- measure of variation, dispersion or diversity (Turner et al.
[39]). The rfist measure includes single-family residential use and captures the
overall mixture of land uses. The second measure excludes single-family use and
captures the mixture of land uses in the non-single-family residential sector. 3.2.4.
Accessibility According to critics of sprawl, contemporary urban development is
characterized by too much separation between uses and thus travel distances that are
too long (APA [4]). Here<component x="118.32" y="588.0" width="359.16" height="92.73"

3.2.5. Transportation mode choice A fundamental element of new urbanism is design
that enables transportation mode choice (Katz [25]). Here we focus on access to
Portlands' light rail system. To explore the effect of accessibility to light rail
stations, we proceed by disaggregating the effects of proximity to the stations into
two time periods and by station location. That is, we identiefid properties that were
located near stations before and after the line went into operation in downtown
Hillsboro, in downtown Beaverton, and in between Hillsboro and Beaverton. 3.2.6.
Pedestrian walkability According to critics of sprawl, contemporary development
patterns create great distances between destinations and thus discourage walking.
Pedestrian access encourages residents to walk, lowers vehicle miles traveled, and
improves human health (Frank and Englke [18]). According to conventional wisdom,
pedestrians in the United States are willing to walk no longer than one-quarter mile
(Duany and Plater-Zyberk [16]). Thus we measure pedestrian walkability as the
percentage of single-family homes (again using lot centroids) that are within
one-quarter mile network distance of commercial uses and bus stops.<component

expected negative sign, indicating that home buyers pay a premium for the houses with
better accessibility to minor roads.<component x="118.32" y="609.36" width="358.59"

exercise of incorporating spatial effects into our hedonic price structure
explicitly. From a subset of our dataset, the results indicated the presence of
spatial error dependence. In other words, the error term at each location is
correlated with values for the error term at other locations. This might be due to
two of following reasons. First, measurement errors are likely to exist and to spill
over across the spatial units since some data are collected and constructed at an
aggregate scale. Second, some of the omitted variables, such as number of rooms,
exterior material of the house and other house physical characteristics, are
correlated and this might be another cause for the presence of spatial error
dependence. In the presence of spatial error dependence and spatial
heteroskedasticity, OLS estimates are still unbiased (Anselin [3]). Therefore, we
present the results from OLS analysis in the paper. 7 Eleven variables, HILLSC,

negative signs of ONMAJRD and ONLRT indicate that home buyers pay less for the houses
that are within 150 feet of a major road, or 500 feet of the light rail line for
possible noise nuisance effects. Socioeconomic characteristics. Socioeconomic
variables PCTWHITE and MEDINC are not signicfiant, perhaps due to the lack of
variation of race and income in our study area. The dummy variables that capture the
year of sale (with sales in 1990 as the reference variable) indicate that
single-family home prices have been increasing since 1992. 4.2.2. Measures of urban
form Street design and circulation systems. The positive sign of INTCONN indicates
that home buyers pay a premium for an internally connective neighborhood. This is
consistent with the positive sign of STMILE, indicating that people prefer more
streets being provided within a neighborhood. The positive sign of BLOCKS indicates
that home buyers prefer to be located in a neighborhood designed with more blocks per
housing unit. This result is consistent with the negative sign of BLOCKSIZE, which
indicates that home buyers pay a premium for a house located in a neighborhood with
smaller blocks. The positive sign of CULDESAC indicates that home buyers pay more to
be located by cul-de-sacs. The negative sign of LENGTHCDS, however, indicates that
people prefer shorter dead-end streets. The positive sign of EXTCONN indicates that
home buyers prefer to be located in a neighborhood that is less connected to the
outside. Density. The negative signs of both SFRDNSTY and POPDNSTY are consistent
with the previous market surveys which reveal that people prefer neighborhoods with
low population density and low dwelling-unit density. Land use mix. The negative sign
of LUMIX indicates that consumers prefer single-family residential as the dominant
use in the neighborhood. The positive sign of NRMIX further shows that the other land
uses such as multi-family residential, industrial, public, and commercial uses are
preferred to be distributed evenly in the neighborhoods. Accessibility. The positive
sign of COMDIS is unexpected. The plausible explanation might be the nuisance effects
brought by general commercial uses exceed the amenity effects of being closer to
commercial uses. PARKDIS has the expected negative sign, indicating that home buyers
pay a premium for the houses located closer to a park. Transportation mode choice.
The effects of proximity to light rail stations on housing price meet expectations.
Properties sold at a higher price after the line was operated in all three areas:
downtown Hillsboro, downtown Beaverton and those between Hillsboro and Beaverton.
Before the line was operational, proximity to the stations had no effect on property
values except for those between Hillsboro and Beaverton. The negative effect of
proximity to stations between Hillsboro and Beaverton before the line was operated
can be explained as follows. Before the light rail stations were constructed, this
area was occupied mainly by vacant green spaces, and underdeveloped rural enclaves
without established single-family neighborhoods. As planned, these areas were
targeted for transitoriented redevelopment and increased in value as a result. These
nfidings are consistent with previous research (Knaap et al. [26]). Pedestrian
walkability. For variables measuring pedestrian walkability to commercial uses and
bus stops, the results are mixed. The positive sign of PEDCOM indicates that
consumers prefer to have more pedestrian accessibility to commercial uses, while the
negative sign of PEDBUS indicates that home buyers do not prefer to be too close to
bus stops. Additional 11 cross-sectional regressions (results are not presented in
this paper) were run to examine possible variations in the effects of urban form
features on housing prices over time. Similar results to those reported above have
been found.<component x="118.32" y="635.88" width="358.82" height="44.85" page="14"

Using this procedure, we evaluate the premium that home buyers pay for a house in a
new urbanist neighborhood. As discussed above, the fourth and ffith columns of Table
5 provide the attributes' values of our two hypothetical singlefamily homes: one in a
typical suburban neighborhood and the other in a new urbanist neighborhood. To
calculate the sale prices for our two examples, the values of each of the attributes
are inserted into Eq. (2), and the values of the coefcfiients are culled from Table
4. The overall prices for these two examples ($132,731 and $156,986) and the
difference between the two ($24,255) are shown in the last row of Table 5. Following
the above approach, the change in the value of a typical suburban house ($132,731),
that x x ) to new urbanist ( ), can resulted from a change in one attribute from
suburban ( 1_S 1_NU (x x ) , &#x3B2; 1 132 731. This value for each independent be
computed by exp 1 1 1 _NU _S &#x2212; &#x2212; ] &#x2217; [ variable is shown in the
last column of Table 5. Our calculations show that a house in a new urbanist
neighborhood, even though it has a smaller lot than one in a typical neighborhood
(3500 square feet vs. 8675 square feet), sells for $156,986a- $24,255 premium over
one in 10 The last column of Table 5 a neighborhood with more conventional suburban
attributes. further indicates that much of the premium comes from new urbanist
features such as more internally connective street networks, more blocks, more street
miles, better pedestrian access to commercial uses, and proximity to operating light
rail stations. The comparison 11 reveals that, holding other attributes constant,
properties located in a neighborhood with new urbanist features command an estimated
15.5 percent premium.<component x="118.32" y="445.92" width="359.19" height="236.78"

difference between the overall values of the two houses. It is not calculated by
adding up all the marginal effects in the last column, which would be wrong due to
nonlinearity of the exponential. 11 Critics have suggested that the premium resulting
from new urbanism development might indeed reflect higher production costs of
construction and highly perceived risks of investment in new urbanism communities
(Rybczynski [35], Gyourko and Rybczynski [23]). To address this issue, analysis can
be expanded to a two-stage estimation using the methodologies provided by Rosen [34].
If we can obtain the production functions for new urbanist construction, we would be
able to estimate the underlying supply and demand functions of new urbanism
development. We leave this for further research. 12 In other papers, for example, we
have used these measures to examine changes in urban form over time (Song and Knaap
[36]) and to estimate the effects of urban form on transportation mode choice
(Rajamani et al. [33]).<component x="118.32" y="146.23" width="358.62"

more streets, shorter dead-end streets; more and smaller blocks; better pedestrian
accessibility to commercial uses; more evenly distributed mixed land uses in the
neighborhood; and proximity to operating light rail stations. We also nfid residents
are willing to pay less for houses in neighborhoods that are dense, contain more
commercial, multifamily, and public uses (relative to single-family uses), and
contain major transportation arterials. When combining these features in composite
sketches of new urbanist and traditional neighborhoods, we nfid that homes in a new
urbanist neighborhood command an aggregate price premium. What is more, we nfid that
this premium more than compensates for the severe price discount for the small size
of new urbanists lots. Much of the premium comes from improvements in internal
connectivity that stem from smaller blocks, and shorter streets. Some of the premium
also stems from lesser external connectivity, or greater transport isolation. Some of
the premium also comes from pedestrian accessibility to commercial usese-ven though
those uses are not valued in the neighborhood. It is dangerous, of course, to
generalize from the attributes of a single new urbanist development as other
developments that could be described as new urbanist could well differ in character a
great deal from Orenco. But the Orenco example supports previous research that new
urbanist neighborhoods do provide a price premium. More importantly, our results show
that the price premium, or discount, of any particular neighborhood depends on the
particular design characteristics it has to offer. In short, design matters. Further,
though the price of a single-family home is difcfiult to predict, , the statistical
relationships among design characteristics and 48 000 sales observations are robust
and compelling. Based on market signals, the results suggest that the virtues of new
urbanist neighborhoods include enhanced internal connectivity, improved pedestrian
access to commercial uses, better transit access, and less external connectivity. The
detractions of new urbanist neighborhoods include, higher densities, greater mixture
of land uses, and smaller lots.<component x="118.32" y="363.47" width="359.01"
