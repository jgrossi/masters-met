40.5 meters at the highest point wiped away almost everything in the affected area.
The official casualty record on 10 March 2014 shows 15,884 deaths and 2 3 2633
missing plus over 400,000 houses and buildings destroyed. These series of incidents
caused extensive and severe damage to not only the infrastructures of the affected
area but also the Japanese people's psyche. Confronting the ruins has prompted the
Japanese to not only reconsider how to rebuild their lives, but also to work towards
an alternative understanding of the complex human-nature relationship. This
particular combination of natural and man-made disasters inevitably raises questions
about Japanese modernity and the faith in modernization in the post-war era. One of
Japan's leading architects, Toyo Ito, remarks: The reported scene of a fishing
village in Sanriku [northern coast of the Tohoku region facing the Pacific Ocean]
devoured in seconds by the tsunami struck me and made me wonder what Japan's 60
years of modernization since the war was all about. . . . I am amazed by the fragile
state of things despite all the economic and technological 'strength' Japan has been
so proud of. . . . Was our achievement of the past several decades a house of cards?
(Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 697) Japan is now faced with finding a different way of
living which problematizes many fundamental features of Japanese society. Yet this
was, nevertheless, not the first time this type of experience had occurred in
Japanese history. The massive destruction of Japanese cities in the Second World War
created a feeling of emptiness and despondency, at the same time as it produced a
great opportunity to transform architectural philosophy and practice. Given the need
to rebuild the devastated cities along with reinvigorating the economy, new urban
planning proposals were needed. As a defeated nation, Japan suffered from a crisis
of national identity and thus sought to re-construct its cities as well as to remake
the new image of Japan. The modern architectural movement Metabolism originated in
the 1960s and represented a new conceptualization of architecture and the city
landscape which embraced utopian futurism. Metabolism offered the opportunity to
re-construct the national image and to establish the social role of modern
architects in Japan. In doing so, the Metabolists followed the modern utopian
architectural assumptions in believing that architects could change society and
people's habits for the good: in effect, they saw their mission as 'social
architects'. Their architectural conception was based on the mega scale and the
total city plan. Rather than designing single, or sets of, large buildings, they
sought to design the whole city. The Metabolists' ambitious dream largely relied on
the concept of 'megastructure', engaging with futuristic, high-tech and utopian
architectural design and total city regulation systems. Here we can see there is an
inescapable paradox between their idealistic philosophical conception and their aim
to practically design the city (see Lin, 2010: 95). On the one hand, the Metabolists
pursued the goal of egalitarian and democratic living environments for as many
people as possible. They believed that the mass production and systematic quality
control of materials by development architectural technology could make it possible
to create innovative living spaces. On the other hand, the central control system
for the megastructure ultimately requires centralization and planned control, in
line with the Metabolists' main ambition to be 'social architects' and social
engineers. The Metabolists, then, believed that their new conceptualization of urban
design helped legitimate not only their identity as modern architects but also
established a more utopian image of a future Japan. In developing their theory, the
Metabolists sought to promote the idea that the city could be regarded as a
supra-individual organism which could generate its own autopoetic momentum/force.
The concept of metabolism is profoundly associated with ideas of natural processes
and organismic development. The architecture of the 20th century, 'the age of the
machine', was often characterized by Le Corbusier's declaration that the home was a
machine for living. For him, 'the futurist city of Antonio Sant'Elia was an
expression of the dynamism of the machine' (Kurokawa, 1994: 16). The machine seemed
to promise a dream-like future. In contrast to 'the age of the machine', the
Metabolists advocated 'the age of life'. As one of the renowned Metabolists, Kisho
Kurokawa, remarks: 'Machines do not grow, change or metabolise of their own accord.
"Metabolism" was indeed an excellent choice for a key word to announce the beginning
of "the age of life"' (Kurokawa, 1994: 24). withAlthough Rem Koolhaas's (1995)
architectural philosophy (city out history - the city that acknowledges its debt to
the past) and the Metabolists' (city withhistory) had very different senses of
history, there are some interesting common resonances with Koolhaas's notion of the
generic city with its emphasis on 'mutations' and 'autopoesis'. Project Japan, Rem
Koolhaas and Hans Ulrich Obrist's recent book, appeared in 2011. It consists of
interviews with the surviving members of Metabolism and people around them, along
with a good deal of archival information and brilliant images. The book provides 'a
vivid documentary of the last avant-garde movement and the last moment that
architecture was a public rather than a private affair' (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011:
cover comment). Metabolism can be looked back on as the nostalgic glory-days of
Japanese architects. The Metabolists sought to establish a higher and more
influential social status for architects who could reinvent the concept of modern
architecture. Recent architectural thought has become more in tune with the business
climate and follows the principle of free-market capitalism or, in other words,
neoliberalism. Architects today can no longer expect to be the powerful engine of
modernization. They can no longer plan to transform the nation via public
architectural power in conjunction with a strategic government alliance. After the
zenith of their movement at Expo '70, Metabolism started to decline with the 1973
oil crisis. This shows the fragility of the power of public architecture and points
to the vulnerability of modern architectural beliefs. The mega scale of the city
plan with the concept of the megastructure was put into question and became
domestically unrealizable, yet they found alternatives in 'the combined demands of
independence of Africa, a modernizing Islam in North Africa and the Middle East, and
the emergence of Singapore, where the Metabolist aesthetic is first established on
the scale of an entire city-state (not by the Japanese, but by gifted locals)'
(Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 14). This can easily remind us of OMA's own astonishing,
but also problematic, works in the Persian Gulf and China where there was a concern
with national branding through the creation of extraordinary buildings. One of the
questions Koolhaas and Obrist address is whether the promotion of avant-garde
architecture with major city plans to alter a nation's physical and political
landscape can only be realized if they are given a tabula rasa. For Koolhaas, the
utopian idealism of the new urban plan suggests that Metabolism can be seen as the
golden age of architecture. At the same time, his concern is that it can be looked
on with nostalgia, because it is hard to realize in contemporary neoliberal society.
Hence, Metabolism can be seen as a telling example to illustrate the contemporary
dilemma about the power and significance of architecture. This paper considers
Metabolism as a modern architectural movement, and discusses the way in which
Metabolism's techno-utopian futurism might be understood through Japanese
sensitivities. It also explores the socio-cultural role of Japanese architects since
the 1960s. In the first part, the focus is on one of the most influential Japanese
architects, Kenzo Tange, who made an enormous contribution to Metabolism before and
after the Second World War. In the second part, the paper focuses more on the
conceptual level of Metabolism and considers their problematic philosophy as utopian
modern architects. It considers the ways in which the concept of megastructure was
deeply controversial in terms of the realization of people's autonomy to create
their own aesthetic lifestyles and sensibilities and to guarantee their equality and
freedom. This was because the centralization of the total city system was inevitably
programmed into the concept of megastructure and thus entailed the risk of
censorship/surveillance at every level of the inhabitants' urban life. To conclude,
the paper seeks to position Metabolism in continuity with classical utopianism and
situate it against the background of the 1960s Japanese social context to argue that
the Metabolists could usefully be characterized as 'social architects'. Metabolism
is therefore a useful example to illustrate the critical conflicts between
architectural philosophy and the exigencies of the market in contemporary neoliberal
societies. The Emergence of Metabolism The Debut of Metabolism Kenzo Tange was the
key person who nurtured and developed the Metabolism movement. After the success of
his Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park project, which was recognized by Josep Lluis Sert
at ` Le Corbusier's studio, he was invited to participate in the Congres
International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) conference in Hoddesdon, England, in
1951 (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 110). Tange's plan was well received and appealed
to participants in the CIAM conference. This was the moment when Tange's reputation
4 become established as an internationally well-known modern architect. The
expansion of Tange's international network accordingly provided his students at the
University of Tokyo with new perspectives through the 5 encounter with the modern
architectural movements in the West. Tange's growing international reputation made
it possible to invite the world's leading modern architects (Louis Kahn, Alison and
Peter Smithson and Ralph Erskine) to the World Design Conference which took place in
Tokyo in 1960. Tange's assistant, Takeshi Asada, took the initiative for the
preparation and selection of the conference committee and working group which
consisted of young active architects, architectural critics and designers. Thanks to
Asada's leadership and his broader vision of the future of Japanese architecture,
the group grew into the avant-garde architectural activist movement known as
Metabolism. With the strong support of Asada, Noboru Kawazoe, Noriaki (Kisho)
Kurokawa, Kiyonori Kikutake, Masato Ota, and Fumihiko Maki, all initial members of
Metabolism, completed a short pamphlet, 'Metabolism 1960: The Proposal for New
Urbanism', which was distributed by 6 Kurokawa and Kiyonori Awazu to the
international avant-garde delegates of the World Design Conference for their own
purposes.<component x="45.35" y="442.26" width="340.17" height="154.16" page="2"

each member proposes future designs of our coming world through his concrete designs
and illustrations. We regard human society as a vital process - a continuous
development from atom to nebula. The reason why we use such a biological word,
metabolism, is that we believe design and technology should be a denotation of human
vitality. We are not going to accept metabolism as a natural historical process, but
we are trying to encourage active metabolic development of our society through our
proposals. Thanks to their successful informal debut at the World Design Conference,
the Metabolists consequently became internationally acknowledged as avant-garde
architects who developed a new concept of the future city along with innovative
architectural design. Biology and Metabolism metaborisumu) The term Metabolism ( was
used as the group's name to express the basic idea of architectural design and city
planning. They believed that the city was an organic entity which has the function
of shinchintaisha) metabolism ( . This meant 'regeneration' or 'replacement of the
old with the new' and was seen as 'one of the most essential features of living
things' (Kawazoe cited in Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 235). Kawazoe was the person
who chose the term Metabolism, which . appeared first in his introduction to the
pamphlet 'Metabolism 1960' For him, Metabolism was regarded as the most appropriate
term to refer to the idea that architecture and the city should be continuously 7
able to grow, change and renew as if they were organic processes of life. Cities
were seen not as static and fixed arrays of material structure but as corresponding
to metabolic processes which develop to adjust to everchanging environments.
'Organic' was a leitmotiv not only for the Metabolists but also for Towards an
Organic Architecture their western counterparts. In his book (1950), Bruno Zevi
argues that the structure of organic architecture is 'like an organism that grows in
accord with the laws of its own individual existence, with its own specific order,
in harmony with its own functions and with its environment' (cited in Neder, 2008:
132). This architectural concept was followed by Walter Curt Behrendt, who was
identified by Frank Lloyd Wright as the founder of organic architecture. Behrendt
also used plants as a metaphor to describe his buildings (Neder, 2008: 122-33). Like
their western counterparts who developed the idea of the organism as the key concept
to describe the nature of urban evolution, members of the Metabolists also believed
that with modern technology and design, modern architecture could change society and
people's everyday lives. Megastructure: The City as a Building One of the most
important concepts was 'megastructure'. In the 1950s and the 1960s, the idea of
megastructure was used by architectural movements and became an important
architectural topic both inside and outside Japan. Megastructure refers to the mega
scale of the city plan which contains all the functions and systems for the city.
Reyner Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past Banham, in his book (1976),
explains that a megastructure can be seen as a single structural framework with
numerous modular units which are able to extend and change when each unit needs to
be renewed. More interestingly, Jonathan Barnett offers a much clearer definition of
megastructure as The Elusive City: Five Centuries of 'the city as a building' in his
book Design, Ambition and Miscalculation (1986). The idea of megastructure has
always been central to the concept of modern architecture and linked to the
realization of the utopian future 8 Although a mega scale of city planning was not
totally new in city. architectural history, the development of the idea of
megastructural superblocks in the 1950s and 1960s can be found in works of 'Team X',
which emerged from the International Congress of Modern 9 One of the influential
members, Georges Architecture (CIAM). Candilis, began to design housing in Morocco
in 1951 and introduced 'megaform' and 'clusters' as key concepts for the mega scale
of urban 10 development (Ragon cited in Holden, 2009). Archigram, one of the
avant-garde architectural groups formed in the UK in 1961, also developed the
'Plug-In City Scheme'. An influential member, Peter Cook, devised a plug-in
principle which combined many elements of megastructure: 'the principle of
collectivity, of interchangeable units and the incorporation of rapid transport
links' (Sadler, 2005: 14). The Plug-In City was designed for the accelerating flux
of city life; what Cook would call the 'come-go' of Plug-In City was opposed to the
orthodox urban planning with its characteristics of clean, zoned, and hierarchical
separation. 'Plug-In planning promoted architecture as an event that could only be
realized by the active involvement of its inhabitants' (Sadler, 2005: 16; emphasis
in original). Archigram is often compared to Metabolism to point out the uniformity
that emerged at the time with their common futuristic and technoutopian views of
architecture and optimistic imagery. However, the most significant contrast between
them was their fundamental assumptions about what were the major elements and agents
in 'the city'. Archigram was strongly concerned with 'plug-in' spaces for provoking
new lifestyles for individual inhabitants (with the quality of everyday life). On
the other hand, the Metabolists and Tange embarked on metastructural schemes for the
total city system for the mass population, rather than focusing on the city's
inhabitants (individuals in the city) as the key entity. With their fascination for
the idea of megastructure, Tange and the Metabolists developed numerous future city
plans of unprecedented scale: Kikutake's 'Tower Shaped Community' (1959) and 'The
Marine City' (1963), Kurokawa's 'Helix City' (1961), Isozaki's 'City in the Air'
(1961) and Tange's 'Plan for Tokyo 1960' are good examples. Like the European
avant-garde of the 1920s, their megastructure projects were not accomplished, but
their techo-utopian vision of new urbanism supported by a strong belief in
technological innovation was accepted in post-war Japanese society. Tange stated: In
challenging reality, we must prepare and strive for a coming era which must be
characterized by a new type of technological revolution . . . the control and
planning of the production and distribution of energy while creating productivity
far surpassing that of the present. . . . In the not too distant future the impact
of a second technological revolution will change the basic nature of overall
society. (cited in Jencks, 1973: 71) Hence, the Metabolists' megastructures can be
found to have some commonalities with their counterparts in the West: the
fundamental premise is the strong belief that 20th-century advanced technology could
open up the new paradigm of utopian human life. Some of the main characteristics
include: 1. megastructures consist of a 'core' (main framework), 'jointed-together'
units, capsules or cells and constructed collective units; 2. individual units,
capsules or cells can be 'plugged-in' or 'clipped-on' to the core framework and
'plugged-out' from the core framework; 3. the core framework has stronger and longer
sustainability than the jointed units or modules. Jointed units, such as capsules,
can be replaced without major construction; 4. there is the capacity to extend and
regenerate without limit; in other words, it is never complete, therefore it is
continuously 'growing' and 'dying'; 5. units, capsules or cells are standardized so
that it is convenient for mass 11 production and decreasing unit cost. The
Metabolist architects tried to apply the concepts, jointed core, units and capsules
to their various projects, but it was only applied metaphorically or symbolically to
mega scale city plans and only used practically for some building projects. All the
projects mentioned above never took place (except Kurokawa's Nakagin Capsule Tower
Building), in part because of declining economic growth and the technological
limitations of the time. While they were not sufficiently developed in practical
schemas, these unrealized projects evoked a powerful image of the techno-utopian
future city. The Generic City and the Utopian City The architectural ideas the
Metabolists suggested can be related to Koolhaas's notion of the generic city. In
his book S.M.L.XL,he claims that if there is to be a 'new urbanism' it will no
longer aim for stable configuration but for the creation of enabling fields that
accommodate processes that refuse to be crystallized into definitive form (1995:
969). He also elaborates that cities are uncontrollable and keep infinitely
mutating. It seems that the generic city is free from existing urban values but
pursues the changing, never-stable and to some extent over-pragmatic city. Thus the
generic city can emerge and survive whenever it mutates. The generic city is
characterized by its 'continuity' and 'autopoetic' nature, which can recall the
Metabolists' architectural concept of the city as a living organism. However, the
generic city is based on Koolhaas's criticism of traditional urbanism and the need
to deal with rapid urbanization in the age of 'globalization' in the 1990s. It
embraces the chaotic and indeterminate along with disorder and 'the staging of
uncertainty' (Koolhaas et al., 1995: 969). It [the generic city] is easy. It does
not need maintenance. If it gets too small it just expands. If it gets old it just
self-destructs and renews. It is equally exciting - or unexciting - everywhere. It
is 'superficial' - like a Hollywood studio lot, it can produce a new identity every
Monday morning. (1995: 1250) Throughout his statements about the generic city,
Koolhaas emphasizes, on the one hand, its intensity and never-ending excitement, yet
it S.M.L.XL also sounds gloomy, pessimistic and cynical. At the end of , Koolhaas
uses the metaphor of a film theatre to capture the essence of the future city and
concludes: 'The city is no longer. We can leave the theatre now'. In this sense,
Koolhaas's generic city can only be explained through its opposition to the utopian
future city, whereas the Metabolists' new urbanism evoked a totally affirmative
utopian vision. The Utopian City and Its Paradox The Metabolists had a strong
conviction that the qualities of everyday life could be enhanced by the power of
technology in the view of uto12 pianism. They believed that communal spaces in the
ideal future city would permit greater respect for people's autonomy and help
establish democratic relationships. Although all the members of Metabolism did not
always share the same theories, ideas and schemes of urban planning, they had more
or less a common vision of huge communal living spaces. The communal space was often
represented as 'artificial land'. Their megastructure on 'artificial land' often
contained individual living 13 spaces. The mass production of housing units or
capsules required standardization of prefabricated components. However, the
Metabolists insisted that prefabricated parts/units should not constrain the
expression of the inhabitants' individuality, but rather provide various
combinations subject to the individuals' tastes, styles and necessities. They also
thought that the increasing mobility and restless metabolic change of the modern
city led to weaker ties between people and a particular place or land (see Lin,
2010: 91ff.). In opposition to Frank Lloyd Wright's Broadacre City, which was based
on the idea that the 'citizen of the United States would be given a minimum of one
acre of land per person', the Metabolists believed that freedom from the land led to
greater freedom and mobility for the people. Thus, they proclaimed that the land
should be owned and organized by a public institution, not by individuals. The total
city system should also be controlled and governed by a central administration. In
this sense, despite the Metabolists' basic philosophy, which embraced progressive
human development with greater autonomy for people to choose their own lifestyles,
what they actually wanted to create was in danger of turning into the opposite.
There is a fundamental contradiction between their philosophical conception and the
practical design of the city (Lin, 2010: 95). On the one hand, they promised
democracy and freedom in everyday life; on the other hand, they thought that 14 To
life in the future city could be governed though a centralized system. this end,
they considered the architects to be the most influential people in the city system
who should take the initiative to design not only the physical layout of the city
but also control people's lives. A few selected professional architects could be
seen as 'city architects'. When it comes to megastructure, a group of professionals,
such as architects and city planners, should have the power to govern, because they
believed that the design of physical layout and environment can determine people's
everyday practices in the society in which they live. This contradiction was not
limited to the Metabolists but can be found in many utopian modernists. They all
have the same contradiction, and thus the Metabolists' contradiction can be seen in
continuity with classical utopianism. In some ways, it was part of the Metabolists'
mission to believe in the transformation of society. Although utopias are hard to
realize, they can still provide a sense of optimistic future imaginary. This was a
similar principle to that of their western counterparts, such as Le Corbusier and
Lloyd Wright, who sought to create a new order for the world at large (Lin, 2010:
94). Le Corbusier's famous slogan 'Architecture or Revolution' and Wright's belief
that architecture had 'an independent role in shaping social life' suggested that
they believed that they were able to 'correct society on the drawing board'
(Schapiro cited in Scott, 2007: 28). The Metabolists also had similar social ideals
and believed that they were able to design the 'total' planning of the city in order
to create a new society and therefore they would be able to become the dominant
social agent and powerful creator of the new Japan. It was clear that the
Metabolists embraced technocratic principles in line with classic utopian thought.
Although the Metabolists' idea of urbanism claimed to pursue the realization of
people's autonomy, freedom and democratic lives, they clearly embraced technocratic
principles in line with classic utopian idealism. Kenzo Tange was particularly aware
15 of the new opportunity for architects to become powerful social engineers, and so
he called himself a 'social architect' (Lin, 2010: 94). The Decline of Utopian
Metabolism The Metabolist movement developed and culminated in the heyday of the
early 1970s but began to decline in the changing economic climate of the mid-1970s.
Given greater business competitiveness and the expansion of people's financial
capacities along with the development of modern consumer culture, the projects of
the Metabolists became more entangled with commercial interests. A good example was
the 1970 Osaka Expo, which was supposed to be a good opportunity for the Metabolists
to display their architecture, especially their image of the utopian future city.
Although their buildings (pavilions) were supposed to express their utopian
idealistic city concepts, based on modern architectural technology and the drive to
represent a new image of Japan, their designs turned into eye-catching billboards
forcefully driven by sponsors' commercial interests. Metabolism almost lost its
autonomy to express a distinctive era and become a slave to commercialism. They had
to shift gradually their philosophical orientation from utopian modernism to
neoliberal capitalism. Another factor was the economic recession after the oil
crisis of 1973, given that the Japanese economy mainly relied on imported oil from
the Middle East. The declining economic growth and the increasing instability of the
architectural industry meant that many aspects of the Japanese economy had to be
reconsidered and, therefore, the mega-scale of urban development became problematic.
More importantly, they had a fundamental methodological and theoretical problem. The
Metabolists' urban theory largely depended on megascale urban design and
technological development along with super-utopian optimism in order to pursue the
organic system of the future city. However, there was always the doubt that
megastructures could be realized with limited technological progress coupled with
suspicion about the optimistic utopian vision itself. Although Isozaki was
sympathetic to some Metabolist ideas such as 'the city as a process', he was always
suspicious of the Metabolists' overoptimistic linear view of the continuous
development of the city. For the Metabolists, urban development amounted to an
organic system which could be more or less predictable and controllable. Whereas,
for Isozaki, 'the city is formless and accidental' (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 37)
and therefore could face unpredictable catastrophic destruction. He argued that
organic metabolism in nature is always evolving and incalculable and thus could not
be planned - likewise the city. Japan has experienced military destruction and
contingent events, such as the atomic bomb, several massive natural disasters such
as the Kanto great earthquake in 1923 which destroyed and burned most of Tokyo and,
most recently, the 2011 Fukushima tsunami and nuclear power station radiation
leakage. These provide clear evidence of Isozaki's assumption that city development
could be interrupted by tragic accidents and thus could not be seen as linear.
Consequently, because of all sorts of reasons mentioned above, we can understand
that the Metabolists' super-utopian techno-urban development could not be sustained
as the leading position in Japanese architecture. If the Metabolism movement was 'a
circumstantial product of a particular time and place' (Maki cited in Koolhaas and
Obrist, 2011: 307), it too must necessarily come to a conclusion with the end of the
era. Metabolists' Utopian and Dystopian Inflections In order to contextualize the
Metabolists' techno-utopian vision, it could be useful if we look back to the time
when the Metabolists emerged, 16 around the turn of the 1960s. The 20th-century
utopia can be seen in 17 continuity with the 19th-century evolutionary utopian
vision of society. The first generation of modern architects in the 'machine age',
such as Le Corbusier, were inspired by industrial society: the steam engine, the
automobile and the airplane, which seemed to bring humanity emancipation from labour
and promise greater social equality. Later, the newer generations, such as 'Team 10'
and 'Archigram', sought to express technologically-determined society in
hypothetical architectural visions. The Metabolists can also be positioned in
continuity with those visions which were based on trust in the independence of
humanity from nature and the belief that human beings could live in an artificial
world produced by advanced technology. Yet they started to become aware that the
artificial world they lived in caused negative side-effects, such as pollution and
the deterioration of the ecosystem, including humans. On the one hand, science and
technology rapidly progressed: IBM's first commercial scientific computer, IBM 701,
was announced to the public in 1952; the double helix structure of DNA was
discovered in 1953; the national aeronautics and space administration in the United
States was created in 1958. On the other hand, humanmade environments started to
degenerate and threaten human life; the Vietnam War started in 1962, raising
criticism about its brutal technologically-advanced weapons; Minamata disease in
Japan was first diagnosed in 1956 and was one of the earliest and most influential
incidents to make Japanese people aware of the risks of modern life. Accordingly,
there has been a gradual shift away from na&#x131;ve techno&#xA8; optimism since the
1960s. The demystification of scientific rationality gave rise to risk
consciousness. In his book Risk Society, Beck claims that civilization brought about
threats which we find when we see ourselves 'exposed to radiation' (e.g. the
Fukushima nuclear power station incident), or ingesting 'toxic levels' (e.g.
Minamata disease), and in the anxieties of a 'nuclear holocaust' (e.g. the Hiroshima
atomic bomb) (Beck, 1992: 72). His account fits surprisingly well both the
historical 18 and current Japanese social contexts. An invisible world becomes
rendered visible, a dangerous world which closely resonates with a dystopian vision
of the future, and we can only perceive the world we live in largely through the
critical risk consciousness of a dystopian culture. In Japanese history, people had
repeatedly encountered major disasters and calamities. When the Kanto great
earthquake occurred in 1923, Tange was 10 years old (and his mentor, Kunio Maekawa,
was 18 years old - he also faced the bombing of Tokyo in 1945 and was terrified but
at the same time delighted by the potential to reconstruct Tokyo). When the world's
first (Hiroshima) and second (Nagasaki) atom bombs exploded in 1945, Arata Isozaki
was 14 years 19 old and the youngest Metabolist, Kisho Kurokawa, was 11 years old.
They were undoubtedly shocked and traumatized by those unprecedented events. The
profound tragedies they experienced would reflect their perception of the future
world. They could not believe in an eternal stable society. For them, a future world
could be characterized more by the precognition of catastrophe than expectations of
utopia. Yet the need for utopia can always be found in the middle of dystopian times
as utopia offers 'compensatory escapism' (Levitas, 1982: 53) or the moratorium of
the future status quo. If the Metabolists were fatalistic they would need a utopia,
because establishing continuity from the (catastrophic) present to the hopeful
future was so challenging. The more catastrophic the society in which you live, the
more you need a utopian fantasy. Hence, it can be said that the Metabolists'
techno-utopianism emerged amidst the dystopian vision prominent in Japanese society
in the 1960s. Conclusion As has been argued, Metabolism can be seen as a distinct
modern architectural movement which entailed a paradigm shift in architectural
aesthetics in relation to not only form and design but also architectural concepts
and philosophy in the context of 1960s Japan. In the wake of severe war-time
destruction, Metabolism had the ambition to create a new Japanese image and national
identity by representing the futuristic utopian modern city. Although their primary
intention failed, they eventually created Japanese techno-utopian aesthetics in
their architectural philosophy. In both backstage and frontstage areas of the
movement, Kenso Tange was arguably the most influential mentor for the Metabolists
as the leading Japanese architect. He was devoted to reconstructing the national
image through his architectural vocabulary and practice in the decades before and
after the war. Given the new social environment, he embraced technological progress,
along with the megastructure city planning supposed to help re-create a new image of
post-war Japan. The Metabolists were strongly inspired by Tange's architectural
practices, theoretical articulation of city planning and professional identity as a
social architect. Clearly, the Metabolists were influenced not only by the global
modern architectural movements but also by dramatic technological advances and the
progress of science. Therefore their concepts were inspired by genetics, biology,
space technology, computer science, communication technology and modern art in the
20th century. The term Metabolism referred to a biological world of metamorphosis
and transformation (Pernice, 2007: 358-9). The city was seen as a living organism,
growing in symbiosis with its own functions and environments. This suggests an
appreciation of the mutability of nature and the recognition that the practice of
building 20 should be attuned to such natural processes. The Metabolists believed
that the city is a process and changeable, thus it is formless and 'non-plan'
(Hughes and Sadler, 2000). However, architects paradoxically need to make a plan for
the city. Although they embraced people's autonomy and freedom in the future
society, their major concept, megastructure, was accompanied by the idea of a
central administrative system where professional architects could play a key role in
designing and controlling urban life. Here is the contradiction. This was the idea
that 'a single creator can build a society wherein a huge number of people will
live' (Otaka cited in Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 35). Individuals are required to
adapt to and live under the technocrat society. This resonates with Tange's
philosophy of the role of the architect. He sought to establish the social role of
architects and anticipated that modern architecture should play a key role in the
transformation of the city and city habits. Thus they should thrive in creating a
new image for Japan. The idea of the social role of architects was an essential
belief of the utopian modernists in both the West and Japan. In order to re-create a
new image of Japan, it was impossible for the Metabolists to separate the city from
its historical past, and for them it was important that the city was seen as a
vehicle for embodying memories. The generic city, on the other hand, is 'the city
without history' (Koolhaas et al., 1995: 1250). This was Koolhaas's response to a
paradox in contemporary urbanism. 'The commitment to the historical concentric form
of the [European] city leads to the search to both preserve the authentic city of
the historical inner cities and the drive to constantly modernize them to make sure
they also keep their role as centres of society' (Hajer, 1999: 140). For him, 'Not
proximity but connectivity, not history but adaptations are the key variables' (p.
141). The generic city as a global contemporary city no longer evokes homogeneous
identity but can be multiple. The Metabolists' urbanism sought to create
Japaneseness through historical memories. In terms of the ambition of creating a
national image and the image of a future Japan, the mega-city plan was the most
important productive avenue explored by the Metabolist movement. However, they
overemphasized the city 'megastructure' as entailing a new paradigm of urbanism.
Tange's 'Tokyo City Plan 1960', for instance, was the project which attempted to
create 'a total system of the city' for populations of ten million or more. His
perception of the mega scale of the city was inspired by modern architects in the
West. He became increasingly conscious of the issue of scale through visiting
large-scale European architecture and was inspired by Le Corbusier's Unite
d'Habitation in Marseille in 1951. The huge scale of urban architecture against the
human fascinated him (Tange, 2011 [1984]: 218). Consequently the emphasis on mass,
the flow of people 21 and cars, brought the danger that the sense of individuality
and autonomy could be erased; it made it easier to embrace the idea of meritocracy,
22 managerialism and technocracy. As mentioned above, Tange and the Metabolists
invoked a biological analogy and advocated a city in which 'the natural force of the
city continues to renew itself like an organism'. However, this natural force comes
from living entities - individuals and existing nature. As long as people live in
the city, the city keeps producing 'happenings', 'events', 'stories', 'meanings',
and 'emotions' which can 23 never be destroyed by the mechanical force. The
increasing power of consumerism and the economic recession badly impacted on the
further development of Metabolism. This could be seen as one of the most serious
critical defects of Metabolism. More significantly, the Metabolists tended to ignore
the fact that the city is always full of performers. Their city was modelled on
biology but focused on the buildings, city structure and system and, therefore,
neglected the living organic entities, the human beings, which are not passive but
active and living inside the city. For the Metabolists, individuals as 24 performers
in the city amounted to 'invisible entities'. In this respect, the idea of designing
'human spaces' in the form of a set of capsules or 'cells' in order to integrate
humans into the mega-systems was part of the ambitious intention of the Metabolists
to change social life, to influence human habitus and to change everyday lifestyles
(the classic idea that humans should follow structure and system). Coda: New
Architectural Climate in Contemporary Japan As a postscript, it can be said that the
new generation of Japanese architects, contrary to the Metabolists, are no longer
involved in creating a mega-scale project in the city, but they work on individual
buildings which amount to 'sheltered enclaves where their clients could hide from
hostile environments in the city' (Lin, 2010: 229). The new generation of Japanese
architects has re-discovered architectural aesthetics in the space inhabited by
living organic entities - individuals - as the major actors. If urban life is
constituted and constructed by unexpected, unanticipated and incalculable
possibilities and risks and thus is always changing and never stable, the
individuals in urban life have to negotiate and interchange with their surroundings
and need to continuously be recreating and managing 'the horizon of what we consider
to be life' (see AbdouMaliq, 2011: 355). If this is the case, new urbanism
developments cannot be easily contextualized, theorized and hypothesized. This
suggests that 'people and materials that operate within any space actively or
potentially can step in and out of different senses of what is required and
possible, different performances and framing devices, different vertically layered
strata of articulation and different ways of paying attention and of being
implicated in what is going on' (AbdouMaliq, 2011: 356). It is important, then, to
see that megacities are 'living' and 'evolving' complex and fluid intensities which
are transformed by how individuals are performing. Here, it is clear that the focus
has shifted from longing for the centralization of the city system and megastructure
to hoping to realize the individualization of living space for urban 25 individuals.
Unlike the Metabolists, today's Japanese architects no longer consider the
speculative future city tinged by romanticism but seek realizable 'sheltered' living
spaces for individuals. They no longer seek an evolutionary change of society;
rather, they long for a self-controlled sanctuary from the hostile and risky outside
world. Yet a self-controlled sanctuary doesn't mean a self-imposed quarantine but a
place which can be sustained by restless interactive relationships with the outside
world. Here, one of the leading new generation of contemporary architects, Kengo
Kuma, emphasizes relationships between human beings and all the entities in
environments though architectural forms. For him, the relationalities with the
outside world provide the key concept. Emphasizing the mutual relationship between
architecture and the environment is also a concept found in the early stage of
Koolhaas's architectural theory. In his interview about the 'Berlin Wall as
Architecture' (Obrist, 2003: 508), Koolhaas explains that he tried to see the Berlin
Wall as architecture to understand the real power of architecture. He found the
meanings of the Wall could be determined by both political and physical
environments. He observed 'how West Berlin was actually imprisoned by the Wall, yet
paradoxically West Berlin was called "free" and that the much larger area beyond the
Wall was not considered free'. He also found that: . . . the Wall was not really a
single object but a system that consisted partly of things that were destroyed on
the site of the Wall, sections of buildings that were still standing and absorbed or
incorporated into the Wall, and additional walls, some really massive and modern,
others more ephemeral, all together contributing to an enormous zone. That was one
of the most exciting things: it was one wall that always assumed a different
condition. . . . In permanent transformation, it was also very contextual, because
on each side it had a different character; it would adjust itself to different
circumstances. He emphasizes, then, that architecture is not just contextualized by
different environments but that architecture itself contextualizes environments. In
this permanently changing inter-rationality, architecture is not just a transforming
entity - it becomes a ' phenomenon' (Kuma, 2009). Continuing this line of thought,
Kuma insists that 'the architect must consider to whom, when and how the building
will appear, and those calculations must include an idea of to whom, when and how
the building will be invisible' (Kuma, 2009: 49). To understand this complex
relationship and focus on much broader sensory modalities which include not only
geopolitical conditions but also biological natural environments, he proposes 'a new
organic architecture' based on a new view of organisms. He argues that 'an organism
is not autonomous but instead by assimilating and excreting external matter at
amazing speed escapes an increase in entropy and manages to live on' (Kuma, 2009:
57-8). For him, like an organism, 'architecture cannot be autonomous and can only
exist as relationships'. He thinks that 'the overwhelmingly more powerful
environment determines whether we live or die' (Kuma, 2009: 60). Nevertheless, the
environment today is clearly deteriorating and thus we feel more dystopian
sensitivities about our future life. His starting point is not trying to control or
change existing environments, but to find the best way to harmonize with the present
world we are facing. Whereas the Metabolists concentrated on the total city system
as a self-efficient system and tended to ignore what is outside the city system,
Kuma's scope provides a much broader framework for understanding the
inter-relationalities between culture/human beings and nature/environments through
not aggressive but temperate architectural forms. Kuma's architectural philosophy,
which is to some extent shared by contemporary Japanese architects, had not
completely crystalized until the apocalyptic disaster of the Tohoku earthquake and
tsunami and the accompanying Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station incident, still
an ongoing serious crisis. This disaster meant that over 100,000 people lost their
homes and were forced to live in public shelters (relief centres) without privacy
and with limited space. Hastily built temporary housing can only provide 'empty
shells' (Turnbull (ed.) 2012: 135). Toyo Ito expressed these sentiments after
visiting the affected areas and witnessing the devastating conditions (Koolhaas and
Obrist, 2011: 697). One outcome was his proposal 'Home for All', which was a call
for design submissions for 'communal gathering spaces they can build in the disaster
areas in between the relief centres and temporary housing' (Ito et al., 2012: 135)
in summer 2011. This was a joint proposal with Riken Yamamoto, Hiroshi Naito, Kazuko
Sejima and Kengo Kuma. What they initially found in the affected area was that
'people try to smile and make do, using empty boxes for dining tables, staging
amateur concerts in cramped quarters in extreme circumstances' (Ito et al., 2012:
135). The group of architects stated: What we see here are the very origins of
architecture, the minimal shaping of communal spaces. An architect is someone who
can make such places for meagre meals show a little more humanity, make them a
little more beautiful, a little more comfortable. Here they no longer pursue the
creation of megacities but are dedicated to creating simple communal spaces where
individuals can communicate, perform and carry out their everyday practices. Ito
suggests that 'we [architects] need to start by questioning the way we relate to
nature [environments]' and questions again 'the people or community which we
[architects] always argue for in our architecture - aren't they just an abstracted
scheme?' (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 697). Architects, then, can seek to reassert
the power of people as significant active agents who can bring vitality and
re-vitalized space - both for architecture and for cities. As long as individuals,
as living entities, in the city do not lose their autonomy and keep performing
across information and material networks in everyday transactions, the city won't
lose its inherent feature, which is to restlessly produce 'events', 'happenings',
'memories' and 'histories'. As long as architects continuously endeavour to better
understand both mental and spatial environments for human lives in urban landscapes,
they can potentially create a new paradigm of architectural concepts and an image of
the future city. The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
Power Station incident clearly have brought a new urgency to the question of how we
can better integrate human imperatives with those of nature without destroying our
fragile ecological system. The question is how to find a better paradigm to
facilitate a dynamic shift from 20th-century politics of science to the recognition
of natural environments as not only limited and endangered resources, but also
uncontrollable assets for human technology. This raises the question of 'how can we
modernize modernization?' (Beck, 1992), a question which we are still far from
finding a way to adequately answer. As long as human technologies, such as nuclear
power, continue to produce unforeseen events which can escalate beyond our control,
the sense of living in a dystopian time would be more realistic.<component x="68.66"

Reconstruction Agency on 12 June 2014. Kahoku Shinpo 2. [newspaper]. Available at:
http://www.kahoku.co.j p/ tohokunews/201403/20140311_73016. html ( accessed 6 June
2014). 3. The official report from National Police Agency on 10 June 2014. 4. He
also attended the last CIAM in Otterlo, the Netherlands, in 1959. 5. In the
aftermath of the Second World War, leading western architects came to Japan more
frequently: Walter Gropius in 1953 to work on the post-war housing crises; Le
Corbusier in 1955 to work for the National Museum of Western Arts and Konrad
Wachsmann in 1956 to give a series of seminars at the Tokyo Institute of Technology
(Lin, 2010: 16). Konrad Wachsmann and Walter Gropius were well-known as the
inventors of the Package House (General Panel System) in the 1940s. Wachsmann's
innovative idea of prefab housing was the 'wedge connector', which is a cast-steel
mechanism built into the wood frames of the modular three-foot-four-inch plywood
panels. The connector was 'the only means of holding the parts of the house together
without the use of nails, screws, bolts or glue' but only a hammer. His design for
mobile aircraft hangars for the US Air Force was also a remarkable architectural
invention during the Second World War and the 1950s. It was a massive space which
was described as a 'tetrahedronoctahedron structure' that can be easily combined and
could be collapsed and shipped anywhere for speedy construction. He developed the
design and construction of the wedge connector and interchangeable building
components, both of which were required in war-time and post-war social
reconstruction. A number of students were selected (Noboru Kawazoe, Kenji Ekuan and
Arata Isozaki) to attend the various seminars. They became the future Metabolists,
and learned the new design of prefabrication and the advanced technology of the
space frame from Wachsmann. They were strongly inspired by Wachsmann's ideas and fed
them into the fundamental ideas of Metabolism. 6. They were not authorized to do so,
but the ambitious Kurokawa and Awazu went ahead and distributed their pamphlet at
the conference. 7. This was a time of major new discoveries and innovative research
projects in biology and biological engineering. It is clear that Metabolism's
concept formation was strongly inspired by many of the breakthroughs in biology, the
life sciences and the medical sciences. One of the major breakthroughs in molecular
biology was the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA by James D. Watson
and Francis Crick of Cambridge University in 1953. One of the Metabolists, Kisho
Kurokawa, was inspired by this sensational discovery and applied this concept for
the 'Helix City Plan for Tokyo 1961' L'Architecture d'aujour d'hui (which was
published in in 1962). He used the model of the spiral shape of the DNA helix to
plan the future city and predicted it had the same function as the organic system
which duplicates itself like DNA. For him, 'the spiral design of the towers was
explicitly opposed to the Cartesian model of a priori master-mass plan which . . .
could not account for the natural curvilinear evolution of environments' (Parisi,
2009: 348). 8. The original ideas of megastructure can be traced back to the city
project for Paris, Henry-Jules Borie's Aerodomes (1865), which integrated
multi-level urban buildings that include transportation infrastructure, and Arturo
Soria y Mata's project (1882) for a continuous linear industrial city intended to
span between Cadiz and St Petersburg (Holden, 2009: 7). 9. Team X sought a different
theoretical framework from the previous generation. They were also critical about
the functionalist's urban plan and CIAM's bureaucratic administration. 10. Through
their lectures and publications, the members of Team X created and diffused their
ideas of structuralism (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema) and brutalism (Alison and
Peter Smithson). 11. Kikutake's Tower Shaped Community and The Marine City presented
the mega tower buildings which were constructed via several meters tall concrete
cylinders and dwellings and other accommodation attached to the core cylinders. He
proposed 'vertical land' (on the ground and beneath the sea). Part of The Marine
City plan was accomplished as Aquapolis for the International Ocean Expo, Okinawa,
Japan, 1975. Kurokawa's 'Helix City' (1961) envisioned a module system which was a
reflection of the discovery of the structure of DNA. This was constructed with
gigantic scale spiral towers (each with a capacity for 10,000 people) which were
joined by an infrastructure of bridges. His 'Nakagin Capsule Tower Building' was not
a city plan but epitomized well Metabolism's fundamental concept. According to their
different 'metabolic cycles', Kurokawa divided the Nakagin Building into two basic
components: the mega-structure (two reinforced concrete shafts connected with
bridged units every three storeys) with the total set of capsules providing 144
individual living units. They were designed with different lifespans: the main
shafts would last 60 years, while the capsules would be up for replacement in 25
years. Isozaki's 'City in the Air' (1961) proposed a 'forest-like' city plan which
applied the 'joint core system'. Each 'tree-like' mega scale 'vertical core provides
the path for public transport with "branches" (lateral paths of movement) emanating
from this core which in turn sustain "leaves" (the housing units), which intertwine
and link-up to generate a network in the air' (Isozaki, 2001: 74). The
multiplication of treelike structures produces finally a 'forest'. Tange's 'Plan for
Tokyo 1960' was designed for the rapidly increasing industrial and urban sprawl, to
provide a new urban proposal for the city's future. In this plan, the most striking
idea was to fill up Tokyo Bay to create artificial land which was intended to cross
the bay with a mega-scale linear expansion of interlocking communication routes.
This was based on the idea of the linear city with a tree-like structure. 12. If we
think about the social context in which we live, utopianism seems a completely dated
and inappropriate concept. However, a number of theorists believed that utopia can
act as a catalyst for social change and that we cannot live meaningful lives without
utopias. Karl Mannheim's 'Ideology and Utopia' (1952), for example, makes this
argument against 'the relinquishment of utopias' (Mannheim cited in Mazlish, 2003:
44). This was not a pragmatic ideal but more an emphasis on 'spiritual significance'
(Turner, 1992: 187) and hope. What the Metabolists envisaged was the hope of a
future city which embodied the idea of democracy, egalitarianism, classlessness and
the freedom of the individual. 13. The capacity for units of individual living
spaces ranged from 2000 in Kurokawa's 'Agricultural City' to 500,000 in Kikutake's
'Ocean City' (Lin, 2010: 74). 14. Recent concerns about the issues of democracy and
freedom in contemporary urban life have been exacerbated in the debates about the
implementation of advanced computer informational systems, such as the use of
'citizen sensors' (Gabrys, 2014), to improve resource efficiencies, sustainable
environments and secure everyday practices. Ubiquitous computing systems potentially
make it possible for citizens to input their level of energy consumption in various
everyday activities to the central database. On the one hand, citizen participation
in urban sustainability schemas can create the chance for greater public
intervention in the governance of cities. Yet on the other hand it can also open the
door to greater surveillance, so as to further by stealth governance of citizens'
urban life. In this respect, it raises the question of how far inhabitants as
citizens can perform democratically. 15. However, his main social responsibility to
be a social architect did not go beyond the role of an agent of the government until
he announced the 'Plan for Tokyo 1960'. The plan first appeared on Japan's national
television network NHK as a special TV programme, and its ideas were not published
Shukan in any architectural journal but instead in the popular news journal Asahi
[Asahi Weekly]. As a result of this, the plan received instant public attention.
This gesture suggested that his plan was not commissioned by the government and
therefore it was his own proposal of a future Tokyo (Lin, 2010: 144-6). The plan was
eventually taken up by the Japanese Minister of Transportation as a potential
national project. Although the plan was never realized, at this point Tange become
an autonomous social reformer or social engineer, not just an agent. 16. If a utopia
is 'a circumstantial product' of the time, like the notion of 'modern', utopias
could be always emerging from surrounding social environments at any time and place.
Thus each era and society has its own utopian idealism. Levitas states: 'If you look
at the history of the English utopia, the kind of utopia prevalent in the 19th
century forms a special case, and that, by extension, one can see that utopias do
indeed exist in the present time, they are merely different in content and in social
role, because they are predicated on different assumptions about social development,
time and power' (Levitas, 1982: 54). 17. 'The utopias of the 19th century were
predicated on a view of social development that was evolutionary - i.e. continuous
and progressive, and on the assumption of human control over that evolution'
(Levitas, 1982: 54). 18. Beck states that 'dangerous, hostile substances lie
concealed behind the harmless facades. Everything must be viewed with a double gaze,
and only be correctly understood and judged through this doubling. The world of the
visible must be investigated, relativized and evaluated with respect to a second
reality, only existent in thought and yet concealed in the world. The standards for
evaluation lie only in the second, not in the visible world' (Beck, 1992: 72). 19.
Kurokawa developed the concept of impermanence, derived from Shintoism and also
Buddhism. He believed that the concept of impermanence could be used to apply the
idea that the city and architecture are continuously changing and growing. For him,
'everything we see is impermanent. Whole cities can vanish in a day of warfare. It's
this idea that the Japanese believe in, not the outward form. It's the philosophy'
(Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 385). 20. Metabolism can be contrasted to Koolhaas's
'generic city'. Koolhaas saw the city as 'liberated from the captivity of centre,
from the straitjacket of identity'. A city in which 'if it gets small it just
expands. If it gets old it just self-destructs and renews' (Koolhaas et al., 1995:
1249-50). This idea of selfmaintenance by 'mutation' resonates with the Metabolists'
organic city. 21. He argued that the mega-city, like Tokyo, urgently needed to
change its old structure and system in order to solve the problem of rapid expansion
along with a radically growing population. In this view, he explained that the
transportation system was particularly significant for dealing with the increasing
mobility. Thus, mobility can determine the structure of the city. 22. Over 60 years
after the emergence of Metabolism, there is a continuous strain of this idea in the
present debate about the contemporary city plan. With the growing attention given
computational information programmes, especially digital tracking systems, a new
type of urban planning concerned with the sustainability of the city has become a
key issue for contemporary society. 'All urban actors, at whatever scale - from the
pedestrian to the megacity itself - respond to embedded regularities they help to
materialize and normalize, in cognitive, affective and rhythmic ways' (Crandall,
2010: 71). 23. This could resonate with Archigram's 'Living City' which sought to
not only liberate people in the city by celebrating technological innovation but
also empower the inhabitants to create their own way of life. Archigram focused more
on the inhabitants as individuals who were incalculable living entities, and
acknowledged that the individuals were significant active entities who could
contribute to creating a 'Living City', which appreciated the immediacy and feeling
for urban life. 'The future would not be the architect's total design, but a
collaboration between architect and inhabitants' (Sadler, 2005: 65). In other words,
for them, the city was not seen as architecture with hardware, but as 'the
individuals, "bare and naked man" with his complex of personal beliefs and motives'
(Sadler, 2005: 65). 24. Unlike the other Metabolists, such as Kurokawa and Kikutake,
Fumihiko Maki rarely proposed megastructures and was primarily interested in
urbanism, not technology. He invented 'group-form', which was inspired by seeing
cities and villages in North Africa, India, the Middle East and Europe. He learnt 'a
variety of vernacular human settlement and was particularly impressed by their
repetitive patterns and the intricate order with the grouping of building' (Lin,
2010: 32). Through this trip, he became much concerned with individual units, which
are largely subject to vernacular human activities, and focused on a human-oriented
vision of city planning. 25. AbdouMaliq also emphasizes the uncertainty of urbanism,
which is always in process and progress. He remarks: 'The exigencies of dwelling
require a constant process of converting what is accessible into the tools of new
possibilities and attention', adding that 'The distance between reiteration and
change is always uncertain, and long histories of repetition need not constitute
likely guarantees' (2013: 245). References AbdouMaliq S (2013) Cities of

40.5 meters at the highest point wiped away almost everything in the affected area.
The official casualty record on 10 March 2014 shows 15,884 deaths and 2 3 2633
missing plus over 400,000 houses and buildings destroyed. These series of incidents
caused extensive and severe damage to not only the infrastructures of the affected
area but also the Japanese people's psyche. Confronting the ruins has prompted the
Japanese to not only reconsider how to rebuild their lives, but also to work towards
an alternative understanding of the complex human-nature relationship. This
particular combination of natural and man-made disasters inevitably raises questions
about Japanese modernity and the faith in modernization in the post-war era. One of
Japan's leading architects, Toyo Ito, remarks: The reported scene of a fishing
village in Sanriku [northern coast of the Tohoku region facing the Pacific Ocean]
devoured in seconds by the tsunami struck me and made me wonder what Japan's 60
years of modernization since the war was all about. . . . I am amazed by the fragile
state of things despite all the economic and technological 'strength' Japan has been
so proud of. . . . Was our achievement of the past several decades a house of cards?
(Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 697) Japan is now faced with finding a different way of
living which problematizes many fundamental features of Japanese society. Yet this
was, nevertheless, not the first time this type of experience had occurred in
Japanese history. The massive destruction of Japanese cities in the Second World War
created a feeling of emptiness and despondency, at the same time as it produced a
great opportunity to transform architectural philosophy and practice. Given the need
to rebuild the devastated cities along with reinvigorating the economy, new urban
planning proposals were needed. As a defeated nation, Japan suffered from a crisis
of national identity and thus sought to re-construct its cities as well as to remake
the new image of Japan. The modern architectural movement Metabolism originated in
the 1960s and represented a new conceptualization of architecture and the city
landscape which embraced utopian futurism. Metabolism offered the opportunity to
re-construct the national image and to establish the social role of modern
architects in Japan. In doing so, the Metabolists followed the modern utopian
architectural assumptions in believing that architects could change society and
people's habits for the good: in effect, they saw their mission as 'social
architects'. Their architectural conception was based on the mega scale and the
total city plan. Rather than designing single, or sets of, large buildings, they
sought to design the whole city. The Metabolists' ambitious dream largely relied on
the concept of 'megastructure', engaging with futuristic, high-tech and utopian
architectural design and total city regulation systems. Here we can see there is an
inescapable paradox between their idealistic philosophical conception and their aim
to practically design the city (see Lin, 2010: 95). On the one hand, the Metabolists
pursued the goal of egalitarian and democratic living environments for as many
people as possible. They believed that the mass production and systematic quality
control of materials by development architectural technology could make it possible
to create innovative living spaces. On the other hand, the central control system
for the megastructure ultimately requires centralization and planned control, in
line with the Metabolists' main ambition to be 'social architects' and social
engineers. The Metabolists, then, believed that their new conceptualization of urban
design helped legitimate not only their identity as modern architects but also
established a more utopian image of a future Japan. In developing their theory, the
Metabolists sought to promote the idea that the city could be regarded as a
supra-individual organism which could generate its own autopoetic momentum/force.
The concept of metabolism is profoundly associated with ideas of natural processes
and organismic development. The architecture of the 20th century, 'the age of the
machine', was often characterized by Le Corbusier's declaration that the home was a
machine for living. For him, 'the futurist city of Antonio Sant'Elia was an
expression of the dynamism of the machine' (Kurokawa, 1994: 16). The machine seemed
to promise a dream-like future. In contrast to 'the age of the machine', the
Metabolists advocated 'the age of life'. As one of the renowned Metabolists, Kisho
Kurokawa, remarks: 'Machines do not grow, change or metabolise of their own accord.
"Metabolism" was indeed an excellent choice for a key word to announce the beginning
of "the age of life"' (Kurokawa, 1994: 24). withAlthough Rem Koolhaas's (1995)
architectural philosophy (city out history - the city that acknowledges its debt to
the past) and the Metabolists' (city withhistory) had very different senses of
history, there are some interesting common resonances with Koolhaas's notion of the
generic city with its emphasis on 'mutations' and 'autopoesis'. Project Japan, Rem
Koolhaas and Hans Ulrich Obrist's recent book, appeared in 2011. It consists of
interviews with the surviving members of Metabolism and people around them, along
with a good deal of archival information and brilliant images. The book provides 'a
vivid documentary of the last avant-garde movement and the last moment that
architecture was a public rather than a private affair' (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011:
cover comment). Metabolism can be looked back on as the nostalgic glory-days of
Japanese architects. The Metabolists sought to establish a higher and more
influential social status for architects who could reinvent the concept of modern
architecture. Recent architectural thought has become more in tune with the business
climate and follows the principle of free-market capitalism or, in other words,
neoliberalism. Architects today can no longer expect to be the powerful engine of
modernization. They can no longer plan to transform the nation via public
architectural power in conjunction with a strategic government alliance. After the
zenith of their movement at Expo '70, Metabolism started to decline with the 1973
oil crisis. This shows the fragility of the power of public architecture and points
to the vulnerability of modern architectural beliefs. The mega scale of the city
plan with the concept of the megastructure was put into question and became
domestically unrealizable, yet they found alternatives in 'the combined demands of
independence of Africa, a modernizing Islam in North Africa and the Middle East, and
the emergence of Singapore, where the Metabolist aesthetic is first established on
the scale of an entire city-state (not by the Japanese, but by gifted locals)'
(Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 14). This can easily remind us of OMA's own astonishing,
but also problematic, works in the Persian Gulf and China where there was a concern
with national branding through the creation of extraordinary buildings. One of the
questions Koolhaas and Obrist address is whether the promotion of avant-garde
architecture with major city plans to alter a nation's physical and political
landscape can only be realized if they are given a tabula rasa. For Koolhaas, the
utopian idealism of the new urban plan suggests that Metabolism can be seen as the
golden age of architecture. At the same time, his concern is that it can be looked
on with nostalgia, because it is hard to realize in contemporary neoliberal society.
Hence, Metabolism can be seen as a telling example to illustrate the contemporary
dilemma about the power and significance of architecture. This paper considers
Metabolism as a modern architectural movement, and discusses the way in which
Metabolism's techno-utopian futurism might be understood through Japanese
sensitivities. It also explores the socio-cultural role of Japanese architects since
the 1960s. In the first part, the focus is on one of the most influential Japanese
architects, Kenzo Tange, who made an enormous contribution to Metabolism before and
after the Second World War. In the second part, the paper focuses more on the
conceptual level of Metabolism and considers their problematic philosophy as utopian
modern architects. It considers the ways in which the concept of megastructure was
deeply controversial in terms of the realization of people's autonomy to create
their own aesthetic lifestyles and sensibilities and to guarantee their equality and
freedom. This was because the centralization of the total city system was inevitably
programmed into the concept of megastructure and thus entailed the risk of
censorship/surveillance at every level of the inhabitants' urban life. To conclude,
the paper seeks to position Metabolism in continuity with classical utopianism and
situate it against the background of the 1960s Japanese social context to argue that
the Metabolists could usefully be characterized as 'social architects'. Metabolism
is therefore a useful example to illustrate the critical conflicts between
architectural philosophy and the exigencies of the market in contemporary neoliberal
societies. The Emergence of Metabolism The Debut of Metabolism Kenzo Tange was the
key person who nurtured and developed the Metabolism movement. After the success of
his Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park project, which was recognized by Josep Lluis Sert
at ` Le Corbusier's studio, he was invited to participate in the Congres
International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) conference in Hoddesdon, England, in
1951 (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 110). Tange's plan was well received and appealed
to participants in the CIAM conference. This was the moment when Tange's reputation
4 become established as an internationally well-known modern architect. The
expansion of Tange's international network accordingly provided his students at the
University of Tokyo with new perspectives through the 5 encounter with the modern
architectural movements in the West. Tange's growing international reputation made
it possible to invite the world's leading modern architects (Louis Kahn, Alison and
Peter Smithson and Ralph Erskine) to the World Design Conference which took place in
Tokyo in 1960. Tange's assistant, Takeshi Asada, took the initiative for the
preparation and selection of the conference committee and working group which
consisted of young active architects, architectural critics and designers. Thanks to
Asada's leadership and his broader vision of the future of Japanese architecture,
the group grew into the avant-garde architectural activist movement known as
Metabolism. With the strong support of Asada, Noboru Kawazoe, Noriaki (Kisho)
Kurokawa, Kiyonori Kikutake, Masato Ota, and Fumihiko Maki, all initial members of
Metabolism, completed a short pamphlet, 'Metabolism 1960: The Proposal for New
Urbanism', which was distributed by 6 Kurokawa and Kiyonori Awazu to the
international avant-garde delegates of the World Design Conference for their own
purposes.<component x="45.35" y="442.26" width="340.17" height="154.16" page="2"

each member proposes future designs of our coming world through his concrete designs
and illustrations. We regard human society as a vital process - a continuous
development from atom to nebula. The reason why we use such a biological word,
metabolism, is that we believe design and technology should be a denotation of human
vitality. We are not going to accept metabolism as a natural historical process, but
we are trying to encourage active metabolic development of our society through our
proposals. Thanks to their successful informal debut at the World Design Conference,
the Metabolists consequently became internationally acknowledged as avant-garde
architects who developed a new concept of the future city along with innovative
architectural design. Biology and Metabolism metaborisumu) The term Metabolism ( was
used as the group's name to express the basic idea of architectural design and city
planning. They believed that the city was an organic entity which has the function
of shinchintaisha) metabolism ( . This meant 'regeneration' or 'replacement of the
old with the new' and was seen as 'one of the most essential features of living
things' (Kawazoe cited in Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 235). Kawazoe was the person
who chose the term Metabolism, which . appeared first in his introduction to the
pamphlet 'Metabolism 1960' For him, Metabolism was regarded as the most appropriate
term to refer to the idea that architecture and the city should be continuously 7
able to grow, change and renew as if they were organic processes of life. Cities
were seen not as static and fixed arrays of material structure but as corresponding
to metabolic processes which develop to adjust to everchanging environments.
'Organic' was a leitmotiv not only for the Metabolists but also for Towards an
Organic Architecture their western counterparts. In his book (1950), Bruno Zevi
argues that the structure of organic architecture is 'like an organism that grows in
accord with the laws of its own individual existence, with its own specific order,
in harmony with its own functions and with its environment' (cited in Neder, 2008:
132). This architectural concept was followed by Walter Curt Behrendt, who was
identified by Frank Lloyd Wright as the founder of organic architecture. Behrendt
also used plants as a metaphor to describe his buildings (Neder, 2008: 122-33). Like
their western counterparts who developed the idea of the organism as the key concept
to describe the nature of urban evolution, members of the Metabolists also believed
that with modern technology and design, modern architecture could change society and
people's everyday lives. Megastructure: The City as a Building One of the most
important concepts was 'megastructure'. In the 1950s and the 1960s, the idea of
megastructure was used by architectural movements and became an important
architectural topic both inside and outside Japan. Megastructure refers to the mega
scale of the city plan which contains all the functions and systems for the city.
Reyner Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past Banham, in his book (1976),
explains that a megastructure can be seen as a single structural framework with
numerous modular units which are able to extend and change when each unit needs to
be renewed. More interestingly, Jonathan Barnett offers a much clearer definition of
megastructure as The Elusive City: Five Centuries of 'the city as a building' in his
book Design, Ambition and Miscalculation (1986). The idea of megastructure has
always been central to the concept of modern architecture and linked to the
realization of the utopian future 8 Although a mega scale of city planning was not
totally new in city. architectural history, the development of the idea of
megastructural superblocks in the 1950s and 1960s can be found in works of 'Team X',
which emerged from the International Congress of Modern 9 One of the influential
members, Georges Architecture (CIAM). Candilis, began to design housing in Morocco
in 1951 and introduced 'megaform' and 'clusters' as key concepts for the mega scale
of urban 10 development (Ragon cited in Holden, 2009). Archigram, one of the
avant-garde architectural groups formed in the UK in 1961, also developed the
'Plug-In City Scheme'. An influential member, Peter Cook, devised a plug-in
principle which combined many elements of megastructure: 'the principle of
collectivity, of interchangeable units and the incorporation of rapid transport
links' (Sadler, 2005: 14). The Plug-In City was designed for the accelerating flux
of city life; what Cook would call the 'come-go' of Plug-In City was opposed to the
orthodox urban planning with its characteristics of clean, zoned, and hierarchical
separation. 'Plug-In planning promoted architecture as an event that could only be
realized by the active involvement of its inhabitants' (Sadler, 2005: 16; emphasis
in original). Archigram is often compared to Metabolism to point out the uniformity
that emerged at the time with their common futuristic and technoutopian views of
architecture and optimistic imagery. However, the most significant contrast between
them was their fundamental assumptions about what were the major elements and agents
in 'the city'. Archigram was strongly concerned with 'plug-in' spaces for provoking
new lifestyles for individual inhabitants (with the quality of everyday life). On
the other hand, the Metabolists and Tange embarked on metastructural schemes for the
total city system for the mass population, rather than focusing on the city's
inhabitants (individuals in the city) as the key entity. With their fascination for
the idea of megastructure, Tange and the Metabolists developed numerous future city
plans of unprecedented scale: Kikutake's 'Tower Shaped Community' (1959) and 'The
Marine City' (1963), Kurokawa's 'Helix City' (1961), Isozaki's 'City in the Air'
(1961) and Tange's 'Plan for Tokyo 1960' are good examples. Like the European
avant-garde of the 1920s, their megastructure projects were not accomplished, but
their techo-utopian vision of new urbanism supported by a strong belief in
technological innovation was accepted in post-war Japanese society. Tange stated: In
challenging reality, we must prepare and strive for a coming era which must be
characterized by a new type of technological revolution . . . the control and
planning of the production and distribution of energy while creating productivity
far surpassing that of the present. . . . In the not too distant future the impact
of a second technological revolution will change the basic nature of overall
society. (cited in Jencks, 1973: 71) Hence, the Metabolists' megastructures can be
found to have some commonalities with their counterparts in the West: the
fundamental premise is the strong belief that 20th-century advanced technology could
open up the new paradigm of utopian human life. Some of the main characteristics
include: 1. megastructures consist of a 'core' (main framework), 'jointed-together'
units, capsules or cells and constructed collective units; 2. individual units,
capsules or cells can be 'plugged-in' or 'clipped-on' to the core framework and
'plugged-out' from the core framework; 3. the core framework has stronger and longer
sustainability than the jointed units or modules. Jointed units, such as capsules,
can be replaced without major construction; 4. there is the capacity to extend and
regenerate without limit; in other words, it is never complete, therefore it is
continuously 'growing' and 'dying'; 5. units, capsules or cells are standardized so
that it is convenient for mass 11 production and decreasing unit cost. The
Metabolist architects tried to apply the concepts, jointed core, units and capsules
to their various projects, but it was only applied metaphorically or symbolically to
mega scale city plans and only used practically for some building projects. All the
projects mentioned above never took place (except Kurokawa's Nakagin Capsule Tower
Building), in part because of declining economic growth and the technological
limitations of the time. While they were not sufficiently developed in practical
schemas, these unrealized projects evoked a powerful image of the techno-utopian
future city. The Generic City and the Utopian City The architectural ideas the
Metabolists suggested can be related to Koolhaas's notion of the generic city. In
his book S.M.L.XL,he claims that if there is to be a 'new urbanism' it will no
longer aim for stable configuration but for the creation of enabling fields that
accommodate processes that refuse to be crystallized into definitive form (1995:
969). He also elaborates that cities are uncontrollable and keep infinitely
mutating. It seems that the generic city is free from existing urban values but
pursues the changing, never-stable and to some extent over-pragmatic city. Thus the
generic city can emerge and survive whenever it mutates. The generic city is
characterized by its 'continuity' and 'autopoetic' nature, which can recall the
Metabolists' architectural concept of the city as a living organism. However, the
generic city is based on Koolhaas's criticism of traditional urbanism and the need
to deal with rapid urbanization in the age of 'globalization' in the 1990s. It
embraces the chaotic and indeterminate along with disorder and 'the staging of
uncertainty' (Koolhaas et al., 1995: 969). It [the generic city] is easy. It does
not need maintenance. If it gets too small it just expands. If it gets old it just
self-destructs and renews. It is equally exciting - or unexciting - everywhere. It
is 'superficial' - like a Hollywood studio lot, it can produce a new identity every
Monday morning. (1995: 1250) Throughout his statements about the generic city,
Koolhaas emphasizes, on the one hand, its intensity and never-ending excitement, yet
it S.M.L.XL also sounds gloomy, pessimistic and cynical. At the end of , Koolhaas
uses the metaphor of a film theatre to capture the essence of the future city and
concludes: 'The city is no longer. We can leave the theatre now'. In this sense,
Koolhaas's generic city can only be explained through its opposition to the utopian
future city, whereas the Metabolists' new urbanism evoked a totally affirmative
utopian vision. The Utopian City and Its Paradox The Metabolists had a strong
conviction that the qualities of everyday life could be enhanced by the power of
technology in the view of uto12 pianism. They believed that communal spaces in the
ideal future city would permit greater respect for people's autonomy and help
establish democratic relationships. Although all the members of Metabolism did not
always share the same theories, ideas and schemes of urban planning, they had more
or less a common vision of huge communal living spaces. The communal space was often
represented as 'artificial land'. Their megastructure on 'artificial land' often
contained individual living 13 spaces. The mass production of housing units or
capsules required standardization of prefabricated components. However, the
Metabolists insisted that prefabricated parts/units should not constrain the
expression of the inhabitants' individuality, but rather provide various
combinations subject to the individuals' tastes, styles and necessities. They also
thought that the increasing mobility and restless metabolic change of the modern
city led to weaker ties between people and a particular place or land (see Lin,
2010: 91ff.). In opposition to Frank Lloyd Wright's Broadacre City, which was based
on the idea that the 'citizen of the United States would be given a minimum of one
acre of land per person', the Metabolists believed that freedom from the land led to
greater freedom and mobility for the people. Thus, they proclaimed that the land
should be owned and organized by a public institution, not by individuals. The total
city system should also be controlled and governed by a central administration. In
this sense, despite the Metabolists' basic philosophy, which embraced progressive
human development with greater autonomy for people to choose their own lifestyles,
what they actually wanted to create was in danger of turning into the opposite.
There is a fundamental contradiction between their philosophical conception and the
practical design of the city (Lin, 2010: 95). On the one hand, they promised
democracy and freedom in everyday life; on the other hand, they thought that 14 To
life in the future city could be governed though a centralized system. this end,
they considered the architects to be the most influential people in the city system
who should take the initiative to design not only the physical layout of the city
but also control people's lives. A few selected professional architects could be
seen as 'city architects'. When it comes to megastructure, a group of professionals,
such as architects and city planners, should have the power to govern, because they
believed that the design of physical layout and environment can determine people's
everyday practices in the society in which they live. This contradiction was not
limited to the Metabolists but can be found in many utopian modernists. They all
have the same contradiction, and thus the Metabolists' contradiction can be seen in
continuity with classical utopianism. In some ways, it was part of the Metabolists'
mission to believe in the transformation of society. Although utopias are hard to
realize, they can still provide a sense of optimistic future imaginary. This was a
similar principle to that of their western counterparts, such as Le Corbusier and
Lloyd Wright, who sought to create a new order for the world at large (Lin, 2010:
94). Le Corbusier's famous slogan 'Architecture or Revolution' and Wright's belief
that architecture had 'an independent role in shaping social life' suggested that
they believed that they were able to 'correct society on the drawing board'
(Schapiro cited in Scott, 2007: 28). The Metabolists also had similar social ideals
and believed that they were able to design the 'total' planning of the city in order
to create a new society and therefore they would be able to become the dominant
social agent and powerful creator of the new Japan. It was clear that the
Metabolists embraced technocratic principles in line with classic utopian thought.
Although the Metabolists' idea of urbanism claimed to pursue the realization of
people's autonomy, freedom and democratic lives, they clearly embraced technocratic
principles in line with classic utopian idealism. Kenzo Tange was particularly aware
15 of the new opportunity for architects to become powerful social engineers, and so
he called himself a 'social architect' (Lin, 2010: 94). The Decline of Utopian
Metabolism The Metabolist movement developed and culminated in the heyday of the
early 1970s but began to decline in the changing economic climate of the mid-1970s.
Given greater business competitiveness and the expansion of people's financial
capacities along with the development of modern consumer culture, the projects of
the Metabolists became more entangled with commercial interests. A good example was
the 1970 Osaka Expo, which was supposed to be a good opportunity for the Metabolists
to display their architecture, especially their image of the utopian future city.
Although their buildings (pavilions) were supposed to express their utopian
idealistic city concepts, based on modern architectural technology and the drive to
represent a new image of Japan, their designs turned into eye-catching billboards
forcefully driven by sponsors' commercial interests. Metabolism almost lost its
autonomy to express a distinctive era and become a slave to commercialism. They had
to shift gradually their philosophical orientation from utopian modernism to
neoliberal capitalism. Another factor was the economic recession after the oil
crisis of 1973, given that the Japanese economy mainly relied on imported oil from
the Middle East. The declining economic growth and the increasing instability of the
architectural industry meant that many aspects of the Japanese economy had to be
reconsidered and, therefore, the mega-scale of urban development became problematic.
More importantly, they had a fundamental methodological and theoretical problem. The
Metabolists' urban theory largely depended on megascale urban design and
technological development along with super-utopian optimism in order to pursue the
organic system of the future city. However, there was always the doubt that
megastructures could be realized with limited technological progress coupled with
suspicion about the optimistic utopian vision itself. Although Isozaki was
sympathetic to some Metabolist ideas such as 'the city as a process', he was always
suspicious of the Metabolists' overoptimistic linear view of the continuous
development of the city. For the Metabolists, urban development amounted to an
organic system which could be more or less predictable and controllable. Whereas,
for Isozaki, 'the city is formless and accidental' (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 37)
and therefore could face unpredictable catastrophic destruction. He argued that
organic metabolism in nature is always evolving and incalculable and thus could not
be planned - likewise the city. Japan has experienced military destruction and
contingent events, such as the atomic bomb, several massive natural disasters such
as the Kanto great earthquake in 1923 which destroyed and burned most of Tokyo and,
most recently, the 2011 Fukushima tsunami and nuclear power station radiation
leakage. These provide clear evidence of Isozaki's assumption that city development
could be interrupted by tragic accidents and thus could not be seen as linear.
Consequently, because of all sorts of reasons mentioned above, we can understand
that the Metabolists' super-utopian techno-urban development could not be sustained
as the leading position in Japanese architecture. If the Metabolism movement was 'a
circumstantial product of a particular time and place' (Maki cited in Koolhaas and
Obrist, 2011: 307), it too must necessarily come to a conclusion with the end of the
era. Metabolists' Utopian and Dystopian Inflections In order to contextualize the
Metabolists' techno-utopian vision, it could be useful if we look back to the time
when the Metabolists emerged, 16 around the turn of the 1960s. The 20th-century
utopia can be seen in 17 continuity with the 19th-century evolutionary utopian
vision of society. The first generation of modern architects in the 'machine age',
such as Le Corbusier, were inspired by industrial society: the steam engine, the
automobile and the airplane, which seemed to bring humanity emancipation from labour
and promise greater social equality. Later, the newer generations, such as 'Team 10'
and 'Archigram', sought to express technologically-determined society in
hypothetical architectural visions. The Metabolists can also be positioned in
continuity with those visions which were based on trust in the independence of
humanity from nature and the belief that human beings could live in an artificial
world produced by advanced technology. Yet they started to become aware that the
artificial world they lived in caused negative side-effects, such as pollution and
the deterioration of the ecosystem, including humans. On the one hand, science and
technology rapidly progressed: IBM's first commercial scientific computer, IBM 701,
was announced to the public in 1952; the double helix structure of DNA was
discovered in 1953; the national aeronautics and space administration in the United
States was created in 1958. On the other hand, humanmade environments started to
degenerate and threaten human life; the Vietnam War started in 1962, raising
criticism about its brutal technologically-advanced weapons; Minamata disease in
Japan was first diagnosed in 1956 and was one of the earliest and most influential
incidents to make Japanese people aware of the risks of modern life. Accordingly,
there has been a gradual shift away from na&#x131;ve techno&#xA8; optimism since the
1960s. The demystification of scientific rationality gave rise to risk
consciousness. In his book Risk Society, Beck claims that civilization brought about
threats which we find when we see ourselves 'exposed to radiation' (e.g. the
Fukushima nuclear power station incident), or ingesting 'toxic levels' (e.g.
Minamata disease), and in the anxieties of a 'nuclear holocaust' (e.g. the Hiroshima
atomic bomb) (Beck, 1992: 72). His account fits surprisingly well both the
historical 18 and current Japanese social contexts. An invisible world becomes
rendered visible, a dangerous world which closely resonates with a dystopian vision
of the future, and we can only perceive the world we live in largely through the
critical risk consciousness of a dystopian culture. In Japanese history, people had
repeatedly encountered major disasters and calamities. When the Kanto great
earthquake occurred in 1923, Tange was 10 years old (and his mentor, Kunio Maekawa,
was 18 years old - he also faced the bombing of Tokyo in 1945 and was terrified but
at the same time delighted by the potential to reconstruct Tokyo). When the world's
first (Hiroshima) and second (Nagasaki) atom bombs exploded in 1945, Arata Isozaki
was 14 years 19 old and the youngest Metabolist, Kisho Kurokawa, was 11 years old.
They were undoubtedly shocked and traumatized by those unprecedented events. The
profound tragedies they experienced would reflect their perception of the future
world. They could not believe in an eternal stable society. For them, a future world
could be characterized more by the precognition of catastrophe than expectations of
utopia. Yet the need for utopia can always be found in the middle of dystopian times
as utopia offers 'compensatory escapism' (Levitas, 1982: 53) or the moratorium of
the future status quo. If the Metabolists were fatalistic they would need a utopia,
because establishing continuity from the (catastrophic) present to the hopeful
future was so challenging. The more catastrophic the society in which you live, the
more you need a utopian fantasy. Hence, it can be said that the Metabolists'
techno-utopianism emerged amidst the dystopian vision prominent in Japanese society
in the 1960s. Conclusion As has been argued, Metabolism can be seen as a distinct
modern architectural movement which entailed a paradigm shift in architectural
aesthetics in relation to not only form and design but also architectural concepts
and philosophy in the context of 1960s Japan. In the wake of severe war-time
destruction, Metabolism had the ambition to create a new Japanese image and national
identity by representing the futuristic utopian modern city. Although their primary
intention failed, they eventually created Japanese techno-utopian aesthetics in
their architectural philosophy. In both backstage and frontstage areas of the
movement, Kenso Tange was arguably the most influential mentor for the Metabolists
as the leading Japanese architect. He was devoted to reconstructing the national
image through his architectural vocabulary and practice in the decades before and
after the war. Given the new social environment, he embraced technological progress,
along with the megastructure city planning supposed to help re-create a new image of
post-war Japan. The Metabolists were strongly inspired by Tange's architectural
practices, theoretical articulation of city planning and professional identity as a
social architect. Clearly, the Metabolists were influenced not only by the global
modern architectural movements but also by dramatic technological advances and the
progress of science. Therefore their concepts were inspired by genetics, biology,
space technology, computer science, communication technology and modern art in the
20th century. The term Metabolism referred to a biological world of metamorphosis
and transformation (Pernice, 2007: 358-9). The city was seen as a living organism,
growing in symbiosis with its own functions and environments. This suggests an
appreciation of the mutability of nature and the recognition that the practice of
building 20 should be attuned to such natural processes. The Metabolists believed
that the city is a process and changeable, thus it is formless and 'non-plan'
(Hughes and Sadler, 2000). However, architects paradoxically need to make a plan for
the city. Although they embraced people's autonomy and freedom in the future
society, their major concept, megastructure, was accompanied by the idea of a
central administrative system where professional architects could play a key role in
designing and controlling urban life. Here is the contradiction. This was the idea
that 'a single creator can build a society wherein a huge number of people will
live' (Otaka cited in Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 35). Individuals are required to
adapt to and live under the technocrat society. This resonates with Tange's
philosophy of the role of the architect. He sought to establish the social role of
architects and anticipated that modern architecture should play a key role in the
transformation of the city and city habits. Thus they should thrive in creating a
new image for Japan. The idea of the social role of architects was an essential
belief of the utopian modernists in both the West and Japan. In order to re-create a
new image of Japan, it was impossible for the Metabolists to separate the city from
its historical past, and for them it was important that the city was seen as a
vehicle for embodying memories. The generic city, on the other hand, is 'the city
without history' (Koolhaas et al., 1995: 1250). This was Koolhaas's response to a
paradox in contemporary urbanism. 'The commitment to the historical concentric form
of the [European] city leads to the search to both preserve the authentic city of
the historical inner cities and the drive to constantly modernize them to make sure
they also keep their role as centres of society' (Hajer, 1999: 140). For him, 'Not
proximity but connectivity, not history but adaptations are the key variables' (p.
141). The generic city as a global contemporary city no longer evokes homogeneous
identity but can be multiple. The Metabolists' urbanism sought to create
Japaneseness through historical memories. In terms of the ambition of creating a
national image and the image of a future Japan, the mega-city plan was the most
important productive avenue explored by the Metabolist movement. However, they
overemphasized the city 'megastructure' as entailing a new paradigm of urbanism.
Tange's 'Tokyo City Plan 1960', for instance, was the project which attempted to
create 'a total system of the city' for populations of ten million or more. His
perception of the mega scale of the city was inspired by modern architects in the
West. He became increasingly conscious of the issue of scale through visiting
large-scale European architecture and was inspired by Le Corbusier's Unite
d'Habitation in Marseille in 1951. The huge scale of urban architecture against the
human fascinated him (Tange, 2011 [1984]: 218). Consequently the emphasis on mass,
the flow of people 21 and cars, brought the danger that the sense of individuality
and autonomy could be erased; it made it easier to embrace the idea of meritocracy,
22 managerialism and technocracy. As mentioned above, Tange and the Metabolists
invoked a biological analogy and advocated a city in which 'the natural force of the
city continues to renew itself like an organism'. However, this natural force comes
from living entities - individuals and existing nature. As long as people live in
the city, the city keeps producing 'happenings', 'events', 'stories', 'meanings',
and 'emotions' which can 23 never be destroyed by the mechanical force. The
increasing power of consumerism and the economic recession badly impacted on the
further development of Metabolism. This could be seen as one of the most serious
critical defects of Metabolism. More significantly, the Metabolists tended to ignore
the fact that the city is always full of performers. Their city was modelled on
biology but focused on the buildings, city structure and system and, therefore,
neglected the living organic entities, the human beings, which are not passive but
active and living inside the city. For the Metabolists, individuals as 24 performers
in the city amounted to 'invisible entities'. In this respect, the idea of designing
'human spaces' in the form of a set of capsules or 'cells' in order to integrate
humans into the mega-systems was part of the ambitious intention of the Metabolists
to change social life, to influence human habitus and to change everyday lifestyles
(the classic idea that humans should follow structure and system). Coda: New
Architectural Climate in Contemporary Japan As a postscript, it can be said that the
new generation of Japanese architects, contrary to the Metabolists, are no longer
involved in creating a mega-scale project in the city, but they work on individual
buildings which amount to 'sheltered enclaves where their clients could hide from
hostile environments in the city' (Lin, 2010: 229). The new generation of Japanese
architects has re-discovered architectural aesthetics in the space inhabited by
living organic entities - individuals - as the major actors. If urban life is
constituted and constructed by unexpected, unanticipated and incalculable
possibilities and risks and thus is always changing and never stable, the
individuals in urban life have to negotiate and interchange with their surroundings
and need to continuously be recreating and managing 'the horizon of what we consider
to be life' (see AbdouMaliq, 2011: 355). If this is the case, new urbanism
developments cannot be easily contextualized, theorized and hypothesized. This
suggests that 'people and materials that operate within any space actively or
potentially can step in and out of different senses of what is required and
possible, different performances and framing devices, different vertically layered
strata of articulation and different ways of paying attention and of being
implicated in what is going on' (AbdouMaliq, 2011: 356). It is important, then, to
see that megacities are 'living' and 'evolving' complex and fluid intensities which
are transformed by how individuals are performing. Here, it is clear that the focus
has shifted from longing for the centralization of the city system and megastructure
to hoping to realize the individualization of living space for urban 25 individuals.
Unlike the Metabolists, today's Japanese architects no longer consider the
speculative future city tinged by romanticism but seek realizable 'sheltered' living
spaces for individuals. They no longer seek an evolutionary change of society;
rather, they long for a self-controlled sanctuary from the hostile and risky outside
world. Yet a self-controlled sanctuary doesn't mean a self-imposed quarantine but a
place which can be sustained by restless interactive relationships with the outside
world. Here, one of the leading new generation of contemporary architects, Kengo
Kuma, emphasizes relationships between human beings and all the entities in
environments though architectural forms. For him, the relationalities with the
outside world provide the key concept. Emphasizing the mutual relationship between
architecture and the environment is also a concept found in the early stage of
Koolhaas's architectural theory. In his interview about the 'Berlin Wall as
Architecture' (Obrist, 2003: 508), Koolhaas explains that he tried to see the Berlin
Wall as architecture to understand the real power of architecture. He found the
meanings of the Wall could be determined by both political and physical
environments. He observed 'how West Berlin was actually imprisoned by the Wall, yet
paradoxically West Berlin was called "free" and that the much larger area beyond the
Wall was not considered free'. He also found that: . . . the Wall was not really a
single object but a system that consisted partly of things that were destroyed on
the site of the Wall, sections of buildings that were still standing and absorbed or
incorporated into the Wall, and additional walls, some really massive and modern,
others more ephemeral, all together contributing to an enormous zone. That was one
of the most exciting things: it was one wall that always assumed a different
condition. . . . In permanent transformation, it was also very contextual, because
on each side it had a different character; it would adjust itself to different
circumstances. He emphasizes, then, that architecture is not just contextualized by
different environments but that architecture itself contextualizes environments. In
this permanently changing inter-rationality, architecture is not just a transforming
entity - it becomes a ' phenomenon' (Kuma, 2009). Continuing this line of thought,
Kuma insists that 'the architect must consider to whom, when and how the building
will appear, and those calculations must include an idea of to whom, when and how
the building will be invisible' (Kuma, 2009: 49). To understand this complex
relationship and focus on much broader sensory modalities which include not only
geopolitical conditions but also biological natural environments, he proposes 'a new
organic architecture' based on a new view of organisms. He argues that 'an organism
is not autonomous but instead by assimilating and excreting external matter at
amazing speed escapes an increase in entropy and manages to live on' (Kuma, 2009:
57-8). For him, like an organism, 'architecture cannot be autonomous and can only
exist as relationships'. He thinks that 'the overwhelmingly more powerful
environment determines whether we live or die' (Kuma, 2009: 60). Nevertheless, the
environment today is clearly deteriorating and thus we feel more dystopian
sensitivities about our future life. His starting point is not trying to control or
change existing environments, but to find the best way to harmonize with the present
world we are facing. Whereas the Metabolists concentrated on the total city system
as a self-efficient system and tended to ignore what is outside the city system,
Kuma's scope provides a much broader framework for understanding the
inter-relationalities between culture/human beings and nature/environments through
not aggressive but temperate architectural forms. Kuma's architectural philosophy,
which is to some extent shared by contemporary Japanese architects, had not
completely crystalized until the apocalyptic disaster of the Tohoku earthquake and
tsunami and the accompanying Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station incident, still
an ongoing serious crisis. This disaster meant that over 100,000 people lost their
homes and were forced to live in public shelters (relief centres) without privacy
and with limited space. Hastily built temporary housing can only provide 'empty
shells' (Turnbull (ed.) 2012: 135). Toyo Ito expressed these sentiments after
visiting the affected areas and witnessing the devastating conditions (Koolhaas and
Obrist, 2011: 697). One outcome was his proposal 'Home for All', which was a call
for design submissions for 'communal gathering spaces they can build in the disaster
areas in between the relief centres and temporary housing' (Ito et al., 2012: 135)
in summer 2011. This was a joint proposal with Riken Yamamoto, Hiroshi Naito, Kazuko
Sejima and Kengo Kuma. What they initially found in the affected area was that
'people try to smile and make do, using empty boxes for dining tables, staging
amateur concerts in cramped quarters in extreme circumstances' (Ito et al., 2012:
135). The group of architects stated: What we see here are the very origins of
architecture, the minimal shaping of communal spaces. An architect is someone who
can make such places for meagre meals show a little more humanity, make them a
little more beautiful, a little more comfortable. Here they no longer pursue the
creation of megacities but are dedicated to creating simple communal spaces where
individuals can communicate, perform and carry out their everyday practices. Ito
suggests that 'we [architects] need to start by questioning the way we relate to
nature [environments]' and questions again 'the people or community which we
[architects] always argue for in our architecture - aren't they just an abstracted
scheme?' (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 697). Architects, then, can seek to reassert
the power of people as significant active agents who can bring vitality and
re-vitalized space - both for architecture and for cities. As long as individuals,
as living entities, in the city do not lose their autonomy and keep performing
across information and material networks in everyday transactions, the city won't
lose its inherent feature, which is to restlessly produce 'events', 'happenings',
'memories' and 'histories'. As long as architects continuously endeavour to better
understand both mental and spatial environments for human lives in urban landscapes,
they can potentially create a new paradigm of architectural concepts and an image of
the future city. The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
Power Station incident clearly have brought a new urgency to the question of how we
can better integrate human imperatives with those of nature without destroying our
fragile ecological system. The question is how to find a better paradigm to
facilitate a dynamic shift from 20th-century politics of science to the recognition
of natural environments as not only limited and endangered resources, but also
uncontrollable assets for human technology. This raises the question of 'how can we
modernize modernization?' (Beck, 1992), a question which we are still far from
finding a way to adequately answer. As long as human technologies, such as nuclear
power, continue to produce unforeseen events which can escalate beyond our control,
the sense of living in a dystopian time would be more realistic.<component x="68.66"

Reconstruction Agency on 12 June 2014. Kahoku Shinpo 2. [newspaper]. Available at:
http://www.kahoku.co.j p/ tohokunews/201403/20140311_73016. html ( accessed 6 June
2014). 3. The official report from National Police Agency on 10 June 2014. 4. He
also attended the last CIAM in Otterlo, the Netherlands, in 1959. 5. In the
aftermath of the Second World War, leading western architects came to Japan more
frequently: Walter Gropius in 1953 to work on the post-war housing crises; Le
Corbusier in 1955 to work for the National Museum of Western Arts and Konrad
Wachsmann in 1956 to give a series of seminars at the Tokyo Institute of Technology
(Lin, 2010: 16). Konrad Wachsmann and Walter Gropius were well-known as the
inventors of the Package House (General Panel System) in the 1940s. Wachsmann's
innovative idea of prefab housing was the 'wedge connector', which is a cast-steel
mechanism built into the wood frames of the modular three-foot-four-inch plywood
panels. The connector was 'the only means of holding the parts of the house together
without the use of nails, screws, bolts or glue' but only a hammer. His design for
mobile aircraft hangars for the US Air Force was also a remarkable architectural
invention during the Second World War and the 1950s. It was a massive space which
was described as a 'tetrahedronoctahedron structure' that can be easily combined and
could be collapsed and shipped anywhere for speedy construction. He developed the
design and construction of the wedge connector and interchangeable building
components, both of which were required in war-time and post-war social
reconstruction. A number of students were selected (Noboru Kawazoe, Kenji Ekuan and
Arata Isozaki) to attend the various seminars. They became the future Metabolists,
and learned the new design of prefabrication and the advanced technology of the
space frame from Wachsmann. They were strongly inspired by Wachsmann's ideas and fed
them into the fundamental ideas of Metabolism. 6. They were not authorized to do so,
but the ambitious Kurokawa and Awazu went ahead and distributed their pamphlet at
the conference. 7. This was a time of major new discoveries and innovative research
projects in biology and biological engineering. It is clear that Metabolism's
concept formation was strongly inspired by many of the breakthroughs in biology, the
life sciences and the medical sciences. One of the major breakthroughs in molecular
biology was the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA by James D. Watson
and Francis Crick of Cambridge University in 1953. One of the Metabolists, Kisho
Kurokawa, was inspired by this sensational discovery and applied this concept for
the 'Helix City Plan for Tokyo 1961' L'Architecture d'aujour d'hui (which was
published in in 1962). He used the model of the spiral shape of the DNA helix to
plan the future city and predicted it had the same function as the organic system
which duplicates itself like DNA. For him, 'the spiral design of the towers was
explicitly opposed to the Cartesian model of a priori master-mass plan which . . .
could not account for the natural curvilinear evolution of environments' (Parisi,
2009: 348). 8. The original ideas of megastructure can be traced back to the city
project for Paris, Henry-Jules Borie's Aerodomes (1865), which integrated
multi-level urban buildings that include transportation infrastructure, and Arturo
Soria y Mata's project (1882) for a continuous linear industrial city intended to
span between Cadiz and St Petersburg (Holden, 2009: 7). 9. Team X sought a different
theoretical framework from the previous generation. They were also critical about
the functionalist's urban plan and CIAM's bureaucratic administration. 10. Through
their lectures and publications, the members of Team X created and diffused their
ideas of structuralism (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema) and brutalism (Alison and
Peter Smithson). 11. Kikutake's Tower Shaped Community and The Marine City presented
the mega tower buildings which were constructed via several meters tall concrete
cylinders and dwellings and other accommodation attached to the core cylinders. He
proposed 'vertical land' (on the ground and beneath the sea). Part of The Marine
City plan was accomplished as Aquapolis for the International Ocean Expo, Okinawa,
Japan, 1975. Kurokawa's 'Helix City' (1961) envisioned a module system which was a
reflection of the discovery of the structure of DNA. This was constructed with
gigantic scale spiral towers (each with a capacity for 10,000 people) which were
joined by an infrastructure of bridges. His 'Nakagin Capsule Tower Building' was not
a city plan but epitomized well Metabolism's fundamental concept. According to their
different 'metabolic cycles', Kurokawa divided the Nakagin Building into two basic
components: the mega-structure (two reinforced concrete shafts connected with
bridged units every three storeys) with the total set of capsules providing 144
individual living units. They were designed with different lifespans: the main
shafts would last 60 years, while the capsules would be up for replacement in 25
years. Isozaki's 'City in the Air' (1961) proposed a 'forest-like' city plan which
applied the 'joint core system'. Each 'tree-like' mega scale 'vertical core provides
the path for public transport with "branches" (lateral paths of movement) emanating
from this core which in turn sustain "leaves" (the housing units), which intertwine
and link-up to generate a network in the air' (Isozaki, 2001: 74). The
multiplication of treelike structures produces finally a 'forest'. Tange's 'Plan for
Tokyo 1960' was designed for the rapidly increasing industrial and urban sprawl, to
provide a new urban proposal for the city's future. In this plan, the most striking
idea was to fill up Tokyo Bay to create artificial land which was intended to cross
the bay with a mega-scale linear expansion of interlocking communication routes.
This was based on the idea of the linear city with a tree-like structure. 12. If we
think about the social context in which we live, utopianism seems a completely dated
and inappropriate concept. However, a number of theorists believed that utopia can
act as a catalyst for social change and that we cannot live meaningful lives without
utopias. Karl Mannheim's 'Ideology and Utopia' (1952), for example, makes this
argument against 'the relinquishment of utopias' (Mannheim cited in Mazlish, 2003:
44). This was not a pragmatic ideal but more an emphasis on 'spiritual significance'
(Turner, 1992: 187) and hope. What the Metabolists envisaged was the hope of a
future city which embodied the idea of democracy, egalitarianism, classlessness and
the freedom of the individual. 13. The capacity for units of individual living
spaces ranged from 2000 in Kurokawa's 'Agricultural City' to 500,000 in Kikutake's
'Ocean City' (Lin, 2010: 74). 14. Recent concerns about the issues of democracy and
freedom in contemporary urban life have been exacerbated in the debates about the
implementation of advanced computer informational systems, such as the use of
'citizen sensors' (Gabrys, 2014), to improve resource efficiencies, sustainable
environments and secure everyday practices. Ubiquitous computing systems potentially
make it possible for citizens to input their level of energy consumption in various
everyday activities to the central database. On the one hand, citizen participation
in urban sustainability schemas can create the chance for greater public
intervention in the governance of cities. Yet on the other hand it can also open the
door to greater surveillance, so as to further by stealth governance of citizens'
urban life. In this respect, it raises the question of how far inhabitants as
citizens can perform democratically. 15. However, his main social responsibility to
be a social architect did not go beyond the role of an agent of the government until
he announced the 'Plan for Tokyo 1960'. The plan first appeared on Japan's national
television network NHK as a special TV programme, and its ideas were not published
Shukan in any architectural journal but instead in the popular news journal Asahi
[Asahi Weekly]. As a result of this, the plan received instant public attention.
This gesture suggested that his plan was not commissioned by the government and
therefore it was his own proposal of a future Tokyo (Lin, 2010: 144-6). The plan was
eventually taken up by the Japanese Minister of Transportation as a potential
national project. Although the plan was never realized, at this point Tange become
an autonomous social reformer or social engineer, not just an agent. 16. If a utopia
is 'a circumstantial product' of the time, like the notion of 'modern', utopias
could be always emerging from surrounding social environments at any time and place.
Thus each era and society has its own utopian idealism. Levitas states: 'If you look
at the history of the English utopia, the kind of utopia prevalent in the 19th
century forms a special case, and that, by extension, one can see that utopias do
indeed exist in the present time, they are merely different in content and in social
role, because they are predicated on different assumptions about social development,
time and power' (Levitas, 1982: 54). 17. 'The utopias of the 19th century were
predicated on a view of social development that was evolutionary - i.e. continuous
and progressive, and on the assumption of human control over that evolution'
(Levitas, 1982: 54). 18. Beck states that 'dangerous, hostile substances lie
concealed behind the harmless facades. Everything must be viewed with a double gaze,
and only be correctly understood and judged through this doubling. The world of the
visible must be investigated, relativized and evaluated with respect to a second
reality, only existent in thought and yet concealed in the world. The standards for
evaluation lie only in the second, not in the visible world' (Beck, 1992: 72). 19.
Kurokawa developed the concept of impermanence, derived from Shintoism and also
Buddhism. He believed that the concept of impermanence could be used to apply the
idea that the city and architecture are continuously changing and growing. For him,
'everything we see is impermanent. Whole cities can vanish in a day of warfare. It's
this idea that the Japanese believe in, not the outward form. It's the philosophy'
(Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 385). 20. Metabolism can be contrasted to Koolhaas's
'generic city'. Koolhaas saw the city as 'liberated from the captivity of centre,
from the straitjacket of identity'. A city in which 'if it gets small it just
expands. If it gets old it just self-destructs and renews' (Koolhaas et al., 1995:
1249-50). This idea of selfmaintenance by 'mutation' resonates with the Metabolists'
organic city. 21. He argued that the mega-city, like Tokyo, urgently needed to
change its old structure and system in order to solve the problem of rapid expansion
along with a radically growing population. In this view, he explained that the
transportation system was particularly significant for dealing with the increasing
mobility. Thus, mobility can determine the structure of the city. 22. Over 60 years
after the emergence of Metabolism, there is a continuous strain of this idea in the
present debate about the contemporary city plan. With the growing attention given
computational information programmes, especially digital tracking systems, a new
type of urban planning concerned with the sustainability of the city has become a
key issue for contemporary society. 'All urban actors, at whatever scale - from the
pedestrian to the megacity itself - respond to embedded regularities they help to
materialize and normalize, in cognitive, affective and rhythmic ways' (Crandall,
2010: 71). 23. This could resonate with Archigram's 'Living City' which sought to
not only liberate people in the city by celebrating technological innovation but
also empower the inhabitants to create their own way of life. Archigram focused more
on the inhabitants as individuals who were incalculable living entities, and
acknowledged that the individuals were significant active entities who could
contribute to creating a 'Living City', which appreciated the immediacy and feeling
for urban life. 'The future would not be the architect's total design, but a
collaboration between architect and inhabitants' (Sadler, 2005: 65). In other words,
for them, the city was not seen as architecture with hardware, but as 'the
individuals, "bare and naked man" with his complex of personal beliefs and motives'
(Sadler, 2005: 65). 24. Unlike the other Metabolists, such as Kurokawa and Kikutake,
Fumihiko Maki rarely proposed megastructures and was primarily interested in
urbanism, not technology. He invented 'group-form', which was inspired by seeing
cities and villages in North Africa, India, the Middle East and Europe. He learnt 'a
variety of vernacular human settlement and was particularly impressed by their
repetitive patterns and the intricate order with the grouping of building' (Lin,
2010: 32). Through this trip, he became much concerned with individual units, which
are largely subject to vernacular human activities, and focused on a human-oriented
vision of city planning. 25. AbdouMaliq also emphasizes the uncertainty of urbanism,
which is always in process and progress. He remarks: 'The exigencies of dwelling
require a constant process of converting what is accessible into the tools of new
possibilities and attention', adding that 'The distance between reiteration and
change is always uncertain, and long histories of repetition need not constitute
likely guarantees' (2013: 245). References AbdouMaliq S (2013) Cities of

  <reference order="4">He also attended the last CIAM in Otterlo, the Netherlands,
in 1959.</reference>
  <reference order="5">In the aftermath of the Second World War, leading western
architects came to Japan more frequently: Walter Gropius in 1953 to work on the
post-war housing crises; Le Corbusier in 1955 to work for the National Museum of
Western Arts and Konrad Wachsmann in 1956 to give a series of seminars at the Tokyo
Institute of Technology (Lin, 2010: 16). Konrad Wachsmann and Walter Gropius were
well-known as the inventors of the Package House (General Panel System) in the
1940s. Wachsmann's innovative idea of prefab housing was the 'wedge connector',
which is a cast-steel mechanism built into the wood frames of the modular
three-foot-four-inch plywood panels. The connector was 'the only means of holding
the parts of the house together without the use of nails, screws, bolts or glue' but
only a hammer. His design for mobile aircraft hangars for the US Air Force was also
a remarkable architectural invention during the Second World War and the 1950s. It
was a massive space which was described as a 'tetrahedronoctahedron structure' that
can be easily combined and could be collapsed and shipped anywhere for speedy
construction. He developed the design and construction of the wedge connector and
interchangeable building components, both of which were required in war-time and
post-war social reconstruction. A number of students were selected (Noboru Kawazoe,
Kenji Ekuan and Arata Isozaki) to attend the various seminars. They became the
future Metabolists, and learned the new design of prefabrication and the advanced
technology of the space frame from Wachsmann. They were strongly inspired by
Wachsmann's ideas and fed them into the fundamental ideas of Metabolism.</reference>
  <reference order="6">They were not authorized to do so, but the ambitious Kurokawa
and Awazu went ahead and distributed their pamphlet at the conference.</reference>
  <reference order="7">This was a time of major new discoveries and innovative
research projects in biology and biological engineering. It is clear that
Metabolism's concept formation was strongly inspired by many of the breakthroughs in
biology, the life sciences and the medical sciences. One of the major breakthroughs
in molecular biology was the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA by James
D. Watson and Francis Crick of Cambridge University in 1953. One of the Metabolists,
Kisho Kurokawa, was inspired by this sensational discovery and applied this concept
for the 'Helix City Plan for Tokyo 1961' L'Architecture d'aujour d'hui (which was
published in in 1962). He used the model of the spiral shape of the DNA helix to
plan the future city and predicted it had the same function as the organic system
which duplicates itself like DNA. For him, 'the spiral design of the towers was
explicitly opposed to the Cartesian model of a priori master-mass plan which . . .
could not account for the natural curvilinear evolution of environments' (Parisi,
2009: 348).</reference>
  <reference order="8">The original ideas of megastructure can be traced back to the
city project for Paris, Henry-Jules Borie's Aerodomes (1865), which integrated
multi-level urban buildings that include transportation infrastructure, and Arturo
Soria y Mata's project (1882) for a continuous linear industrial city intended to
span between Cadiz and St Petersburg (Holden, 2009: 7).</reference>
  <reference order="9">Team X sought a different theoretical framework from the
previous generation. They were also critical about the functionalist's urban plan
and CIAM's bureaucratic administration.</reference>
  <reference order="10">Through their lectures and publications, the members of Team
X created and diffused their ideas of structuralism (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema)
and brutalism (Alison and Peter Smithson).</reference>
  <reference order="11">Kikutake's Tower Shaped Community and The Marine City
presented the mega tower buildings which were constructed via several meters tall
concrete cylinders and dwellings and other accommodation attached to the core
cylinders. He proposed 'vertical land' (on the ground and beneath the sea). Part of
The Marine City plan was accomplished as Aquapolis for the International Ocean Expo,
Okinawa, Japan, 1975. Kurokawa's 'Helix City' (1961) envisioned a module system
which was a reflection of the discovery of the structure of DNA. This was
constructed with gigantic scale spiral towers (each with a capacity for 10,000
people) which were joined by an infrastructure of bridges. His 'Nakagin Capsule
Tower Building' was not a city plan but epitomized well Metabolism's fundamental
concept. According to their different 'metabolic cycles', Kurokawa divided the
Nakagin Building into two basic components: the mega-structure (two reinforced
concrete shafts connected with bridged units every three storeys) with the total set
of capsules providing 144 individual living units. They were designed with different
lifespans: the main shafts would last 60 years, while the capsules would be up for
replacement in 25 years. Isozaki's 'City in the Air' (1961) proposed a 'forest-like'
city plan which applied the 'joint core system'. Each 'tree-like' mega scale
'vertical core provides the path for public transport with "branches" (lateral paths
of movement) emanating from this core which in turn sustain "leaves" (the housing
units), which intertwine and link-up to generate a network in the air' (Isozaki,
2001: 74). The multiplication of treelike structures produces finally a 'forest'.
Tange's 'Plan for Tokyo 1960' was designed for the rapidly increasing industrial and
urban sprawl, to provide a new urban proposal for the city's future. In this plan,
the most striking idea was to fill up Tokyo Bay to create artificial land which was
intended to cross the bay with a mega-scale linear expansion of interlocking
communication routes. This was based on the idea of the linear city with a tree-like
structure.</reference>
  <reference order="12">If we think about the social context in which we live,
utopianism seems a completely dated and inappropriate concept. However, a number of
theorists believed that utopia can act as a catalyst for social change and that we
cannot live meaningful lives without utopias. Karl Mannheim's 'Ideology and Utopia'
(1952), for example, makes this argument against 'the relinquishment of utopias'
(Mannheim cited in Mazlish, 2003: 44). This was not a pragmatic ideal but more an
emphasis on 'spiritual significance' (Turner, 1992: 187) and hope. What the
Metabolists envisaged was the hope of a future city which embodied the idea of
democracy, egalitarianism, classlessness and the freedom of the
individual.</reference>
  <reference order="13">The capacity for units of individual living spaces ranged
from 2000 in Kurokawa's 'Agricultural City' to 500,000 in Kikutake's 'Ocean City'
(Lin, 2010: 74).</reference>
  <reference order="14">Recent concerns about the issues of democracy and freedom in
contemporary urban life have been exacerbated in the debates about the
implementation of advanced computer informational systems, such as the use of
'citizen sensors' (Gabrys, 2014), to improve resource efficiencies, sustainable
environments and secure everyday practices. Ubiquitous computing systems potentially
make it possible for citizens to input their level of energy consumption in various
everyday activities to the central database. On the one hand, citizen participation
in urban sustainability schemas can create the chance for greater public
intervention in the governance of cities. Yet on the other hand it can also open the
door to greater surveillance, so as to further by stealth governance of citizens'
urban life. In this respect, it raises the question of how far inhabitants as
citizens can perform democratically.</reference>
  <reference order="15">However, his main social responsibility to be a social
architect did not go beyond the role of an agent of the government until he
announced the 'Plan for Tokyo 1960'. The plan first appeared on Japan's national
television network NHK as a special TV programme, and its ideas were not published
Shukan in any architectural journal but instead in the popular news journal Asahi
[Asahi Weekly]. As a result of this, the plan received instant public attention.
This gesture suggested that his plan was not commissioned by the government and
therefore it was his own proposal of a future Tokyo (Lin, 2010: 144-6). The plan was
eventually taken up by the Japanese Minister of Transportation as a potential
national project. Although the plan was never realized, at this point Tange become
an autonomous social reformer or social engineer, not just an agent.</reference>
  <reference order="16">If a utopia is 'a circumstantial product' of the time, like
the notion of 'modern', utopias could be always emerging from surrounding social
environments at any time and place. Thus each era and society has its own utopian
idealism. Levitas states: 'If you look at the history of the English utopia, the
kind of utopia prevalent in the 19th century forms a special case, and that, by
extension, one can see that utopias do indeed exist in the present time, they are
merely different in content and in social role, because they are predicated on
different assumptions about social development, time and power' (Levitas, 1982:
54).</reference>
  <reference order="17">'The utopias of the 19th century were predicated on a view
of social development that was evolutionary - i.e. continuous and progressive, and
on the assumption of human control over that evolution' (Levitas, 1982:
54).</reference>
  <reference order="18">Beck states that 'dangerous, hostile substances lie
concealed behind the harmless facades. Everything must be viewed with a double gaze,
and only be correctly understood and judged through this doubling. The world of the
visible must be investigated, relativized and evaluated with respect to a second
reality, only existent in thought and yet concealed in the world. The standards for
evaluation lie only in the second, not in the visible world' (Beck, 1992:
72).</reference>
  <reference order="19">Kurokawa developed the concept of impermanence, derived from
Shintoism and also Buddhism. He believed that the concept of impermanence could be
used to apply the idea that the city and architecture are continuously changing and
growing. For him, 'everything we see is impermanent. Whole cities can vanish in a
day of warfare. It's this idea that the Japanese believe in, not the outward form.
It's the philosophy' (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 385).</reference>
  <reference order="20">Metabolism can be contrasted to Koolhaas's 'generic city'.
Koolhaas saw the city as 'liberated from the captivity of centre, from the
straitjacket of identity'. A city in which 'if it gets small it just expands. If it
gets old it just self-destructs and renews' (Koolhaas et al., 1995: 1249-50). This
idea of selfmaintenance by 'mutation' resonates with the Metabolists' organic
city.</reference>
  <reference order="21">He argued that the mega-city, like Tokyo, urgently needed to
change its old structure and system in order to solve the problem of rapid expansion
along with a radically growing population. In this view, he explained that the
transportation system was particularly significant for dealing with the increasing
mobility. Thus, mobility can determine the structure of the city.</reference>
  <reference order="22">Over 60 years after the emergence of Metabolism, there is a
continuous strain of this idea in the present debate about the contemporary city
plan. With the growing attention given computational information programmes,
especially digital tracking systems, a new type of urban planning concerned with the
sustainability of the city has become a key issue for contemporary society. 'All
urban actors, at whatever scale - from the pedestrian to the megacity itself -
respond to embedded regularities they help to materialize and normalize, in
cognitive, affective and rhythmic ways' (Crandall, 2010: 71).</reference>
  <reference order="23">This could resonate with Archigram's 'Living City' which
sought to not only liberate people in the city by celebrating technological
innovation but also empower the inhabitants to create their own way of life.
Archigram focused more on the inhabitants as individuals who were incalculable
living entities, and acknowledged that the individuals were significant active
entities who could contribute to creating a 'Living City', which appreciated the
immediacy and feeling for urban life. 'The future would not be the architect's total
design, but a collaboration between architect and inhabitants' (Sadler, 2005: 65).
In other words, for them, the city was not seen as architecture with hardware, but
as 'the individuals, "bare and naked man" with his complex of personal beliefs and
motives' (Sadler, 2005: 65).</reference>
  <reference order="24">Unlike the other Metabolists, such as Kurokawa and Kikutake,
Fumihiko Maki rarely proposed megastructures and was primarily interested in
urbanism, not technology. He invented 'group-form', which was inspired by seeing
cities and villages in North Africa, India, the Middle East and Europe. He learnt 'a
variety of vernacular human settlement and was particularly impressed by their
repetitive patterns and the intricate order with the grouping of building' (Lin,
2010: 32). Through this trip, he became much concerned with individual units, which
are largely subject to vernacular human activities, and focused on a human-oriented
vision of city planning.</reference>

  <reference order="20">Metabolism can be contrasted to Koolhaas's 'generic city'.
Koolhaas saw the city as 'liberated from the captivity of centre, from the
straitjacket of identity'. A city in which 'if it gets small it just expands. If it
gets old it just self-destructs and renews' (Koolhaas et al., 1995: 1249-50). This
idea of selfmaintenance by 'mutation' resonates with the Metabolists' organic
city.</reference>
  <reference order="21">He argued that the mega-city, like Tokyo, urgently needed to
change its old structure and system in order to solve the problem of rapid expansion
along with a radically growing population. In this view, he explained that the

mobility. Thus, mobility can determine the structure of the city.</reference>
  <reference order="22">Over 60 years after the emergence of Metabolism, there is a
continuous strain of this idea in the present debate about the contemporary city
plan. With the growing attention given computational information programmes,
especially digital tracking systems, a new type of urban planning concerned with the
sustainability of the city has become a key issue for contemporary society. 'All
urban actors, at whatever scale - from the pedestrian to the megacity itself -
respond to embedded regularities they help to materialize and normalize, in
cognitive, affective and rhythmic ways' (Crandall, 2010: 71).</reference>
  <reference order="23">This could resonate with Archigram's 'Living City' which
sought to not only liberate people in the city by celebrating technological
innovation but also empower the inhabitants to create their own way of life.
Archigram focused more on the inhabitants as individuals who were incalculable
living entities, and acknowledged that the individuals were significant active
entities who could contribute to creating a 'Living City', which appreciated the
immediacy and feeling for urban life. 'The future would not be the architect's total
design, but a collaboration between architect and inhabitants' (Sadler, 2005: 65).

as 'the individuals, "bare and naked man" with his complex of personal beliefs and

Fumihiko Maki rarely proposed megastructures and was primarily interested in

cities and villages in North Africa, India, the Middle East and Europe. He learnt 'a
variety of vernacular human settlement and was particularly impressed by their
repetitive patterns and the intricate order with the grouping of building' (Lin,
2010: 32). Through this trip, he became much concerned with individual units, which
are largely subject to vernacular human activities, and focused on a human-oriented

  <resolved_reference order="5">In the aftermath of the Second World War, leading
western architects came to Japan more frequently: Walter Gropius in 1953 to work on
the post-war housing crises; Le Corbusier in 1955 to work for the National Museum of
Western Arts and Konrad Wachsmann in 1956 to give a series of seminars at the Tokyo
Institute of Technology (Lin, 2010: 16). Konrad Wachsmann and Walter Gropius were
well-known as the inventors of the Package House (General Panel System) in the
1940s. Wachsmann's innovative idea of prefab housing was the 'wedge connector',
which is a cast-steel mechanism built into the wood frames of the modular
three-foot-four-inch plywood panels. The connector was 'the only means of holding
the parts of the house together without the use of nails, screws, bolts or glue' but
only a hammer. His design for mobile aircraft hangars for the US Air Force was also
a remarkable architectural invention during the Second World War and the 1950s. It
was a massive space which was described as a 'tetrahedronoctahedron structure' that
can be easily combined and could be collapsed and shipped anywhere for speedy
construction. He developed the design and construction of the wedge connector and
interchangeable building components, both of which were required in war-time and
post-war social reconstruction. A number of students were selected (Noboru Kawazoe,
Kenji Ekuan and Arata Isozaki) to attend the various seminars. They became the
future Metabolists, and learned the new design of prefabrication and the advanced
technology of the space frame from Wachsmann. They were strongly inspired by
Wachsmann's ideas and fed them into the fundamental ideas of
Metabolism.</resolved_reference>
  <resolved_reference order="6">They were not authorized to do so, but the ambitious
Kurokawa and Awazu went ahead and distributed their pamphlet at the
conference.</resolved_reference>
  <resolved_reference order="7">This was a time of major new discoveries and
innovative research projects in biology and biological engineering. It is clear that
Metabolism's concept formation was strongly inspired by many of the breakthroughs in
biology, the life sciences and the medical sciences. One of the major breakthroughs
in molecular biology was the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA by James
D. Watson and Francis Crick of Cambridge University in 1953. One of the Metabolists,
Kisho Kurokawa, was inspired by this sensational discovery and applied this concept
for the 'Helix City Plan for Tokyo 1961' L'Architecture d'aujour d'hui (which was
published in in 1962). He used the model of the spiral shape of the DNA helix to
plan the future city and predicted it had the same function as the organic system
which duplicates itself like DNA. For him, 'the spiral design of the towers was
explicitly opposed to the Cartesian model of a priori master-mass plan which . . .
could not account for the natural curvilinear evolution of environments' (Parisi,
2009: 348).</resolved_reference>
  <resolved_reference order="8">The original ideas of megastructure can be traced
back to the city project for Paris, Henry-Jules Borie's Aerodomes (1865), which
integrated multi-level urban buildings that include transportation infrastructure,
and Arturo Soria y Mata's project (1882) for a continuous linear industrial city
intended to span between Cadiz and St Petersburg (Holden, 2009:
7).</resolved_reference>
  <resolved_reference order="9">Team X sought a different theoretical framework from
the previous generation. They were also critical about the functionalist's urban

  <resolved_reference order="10">Through their lectures and publications, the

and Jacob Bakema) and brutalism (Alison and Peter Smithson).</resolved_reference>
  <resolved_reference order="11">Kikutake's Tower Shaped Community and The Marine
City presented the mega tower buildings which were constructed via several meters
tall concrete cylinders and dwellings and other accommodation attached to the core
cylinders. He proposed 'vertical land' (on the ground and beneath the sea). Part of
The Marine City plan was accomplished as Aquapolis for the International Ocean Expo,
Okinawa, Japan, 1975. Kurokawa's 'Helix City' (1961) envisioned a module system
which was a reflection of the discovery of the structure of DNA. This was
constructed with gigantic scale spiral towers (each with a capacity for 10,000
people) which were joined by an infrastructure of bridges. His 'Nakagin Capsule
Tower Building' was not a city plan but epitomized well Metabolism's fundamental
concept. According to their different 'metabolic cycles', Kurokawa divided the
Nakagin Building into two basic components: the mega-structure (two reinforced
concrete shafts connected with bridged units every three storeys) with the total set
of capsules providing 144 individual living units. They were designed with different
lifespans: the main shafts would last 60 years, while the capsules would be up for
replacement in 25 years. Isozaki's 'City in the Air' (1961) proposed a 'forest-like'
city plan which applied the 'joint core system'. Each 'tree-like' mega scale
'vertical core provides the path for public transport with "branches" (lateral paths
of movement) emanating from this core which in turn sustain "leaves" (the housing
units), which intertwine and link-up to generate a network in the air' (Isozaki,
2001: 74). The multiplication of treelike structures produces finally a 'forest'.
Tange's 'Plan for Tokyo 1960' was designed for the rapidly increasing industrial and
urban sprawl, to provide a new urban proposal for the city's future. In this plan,
the most striking idea was to fill up Tokyo Bay to create artificial land which was
intended to cross the bay with a mega-scale linear expansion of interlocking
communication routes. This was based on the idea of the linear city with a tree-like
structure.</resolved_reference>
  <resolved_reference order="12">If we think about the social context in which we
live, utopianism seems a completely dated and inappropriate concept. However, a
number of theorists believed that utopia can act as a catalyst for social change and
that we cannot live meaningful lives without utopias. Karl Mannheim's 'Ideology and
Utopia' (1952), for example, makes this argument against 'the relinquishment of
utopias' (Mannheim cited in Mazlish, 2003: 44). This was not a pragmatic ideal but
more an emphasis on 'spiritual significance' (Turner, 1992: 187) and hope. What the
Metabolists envisaged was the hope of a future city which embodied the idea of
democracy, egalitarianism, classlessness and the freedom of the
individual.</resolved_reference>
  <resolved_reference order="13">The capacity for units of individual living spaces
ranged from 2000 in Kurokawa's 'Agricultural City' to 500,000 in Kikutake's 'Ocean
City' (Lin, 2010: 74).</resolved_reference>
  <resolved_reference order="14">Recent concerns about the issues of democracy and
freedom in contemporary urban life have been exacerbated in the debates about the
implementation of advanced computer informational systems, such as the use of
'citizen sensors' (Gabrys, 2014), to improve resource efficiencies, sustainable
environments and secure everyday practices. Ubiquitous computing systems potentially
make it possible for citizens to input their level of energy consumption in various
everyday activities to the central database. On the one hand, citizen participation
in urban sustainability schemas can create the chance for greater public
intervention in the governance of cities. Yet on the other hand it can also open the
door to greater surveillance, so as to further by stealth governance of citizens'
urban life. In this respect, it raises the question of how far inhabitants as
citizens can perform democratically.</resolved_reference>
