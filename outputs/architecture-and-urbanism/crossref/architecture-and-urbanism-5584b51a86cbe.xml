in 1959.</reference>
  <reference order="5">In the aftermath of the Second World War, leading western
architects came to Japan more frequently: Walter Gropius in 1953 to work on the
post-war housing crises; Le Corbusier in 1955 to work for the National Museum of
Western Arts and Konrad Wachsmann in 1956 to give a series of seminars at the Tokyo
Institute of Technology (Lin, 2010: 16). Konrad Wachsmann and Walter Gropius were
well-known as the inventors of the Package House (General Panel System) in the
1940s. Wachsmann's innovative idea of prefab housing was the 'wedge connector',
which is a cast-steel mechanism built into the wood frames of the modular
three-foot-four-inch plywood panels. The connector was 'the only means of holding
the parts of the house together without the use of nails, screws, bolts or glue' but
only a hammer. His design for mobile aircraft hangars for the US Air Force was also
a remarkable architectural invention during the Second World War and the 1950s. It
was a massive space which was described as a 'tetrahedronoctahedron structure' that
can be easily combined and could be collapsed and shipped anywhere for speedy
construction. He developed the design and construction of the wedge connector and
interchangeable building components, both of which were required in war-time and
post-war social reconstruction. A number of students were selected (Noboru Kawazoe,
Kenji Ekuan and Arata Isozaki) to attend the various seminars. They became the
future Metabolists, and learned the new design of prefabrication and the advanced
technology of the space frame from Wachsmann. They were strongly inspired by
Wachsmann's ideas and fed them into the fundamental ideas of Metabolism.</reference>
  <reference order="6">They were not authorized to do so, but the ambitious Kurokawa
and Awazu went ahead and distributed their pamphlet at the conference.</reference>
  <reference order="7">This was a time of major new discoveries and innovative
research projects in biology and biological engineering. It is clear that
Metabolism's concept formation was strongly inspired by many of the breakthroughs in
biology, the life sciences and the medical sciences. One of the major breakthroughs
in molecular biology was the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA by James
D. Watson and Francis Crick of Cambridge University in 1953. One of the Metabolists,
Kisho Kurokawa, was inspired by this sensational discovery and applied this concept
for the 'Helix City Plan for Tokyo 1961' L'Architecture d'aujour d'hui (which was
published in in 1962). He used the model of the spiral shape of the DNA helix to
plan the future city and predicted it had the same function as the organic system
which duplicates itself like DNA. For him, 'the spiral design of the towers was
explicitly opposed to the Cartesian model of a priori master-mass plan which . . .
could not account for the natural curvilinear evolution of environments' (Parisi,
2009: 348).</reference>
  <reference order="8">The original ideas of megastructure can be traced back to the
city project for Paris, Henry-Jules Borie's Aerodomes (1865), which integrated
multi-level urban buildings that include transportation infrastructure, and Arturo
Soria y Mata's project (1882) for a continuous linear industrial city intended to
span between Cadiz and St Petersburg (Holden, 2009: 7).</reference>
  <reference order="9">Team X sought a different theoretical framework from the
previous generation. They were also critical about the functionalist's urban plan
and CIAM's bureaucratic administration.</reference>
  <reference order="10">Through their lectures and publications, the members of Team
X created and diffused their ideas of structuralism (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema)
and brutalism (Alison and Peter Smithson).</reference>
  <reference order="11">Kikutake's Tower Shaped Community and The Marine City
presented the mega tower buildings which were constructed via several meters tall
concrete cylinders and dwellings and other accommodation attached to the core
cylinders. He proposed 'vertical land' (on the ground and beneath the sea). Part of
The Marine City plan was accomplished as Aquapolis for the International Ocean Expo,
Okinawa, Japan, 1975. Kurokawa's 'Helix City' (1961) envisioned a module system
which was a reflection of the discovery of the structure of DNA. This was
constructed with gigantic scale spiral towers (each with a capacity for 10,000
people) which were joined by an infrastructure of bridges. His 'Nakagin Capsule
Tower Building' was not a city plan but epitomized well Metabolism's fundamental
concept. According to their different 'metabolic cycles', Kurokawa divided the
Nakagin Building into two basic components: the mega-structure (two reinforced
concrete shafts connected with bridged units every three storeys) with the total set
of capsules providing 144 individual living units. They were designed with different
lifespans: the main shafts would last 60 years, while the capsules would be up for
replacement in 25 years. Isozaki's 'City in the Air' (1961) proposed a 'forest-like'
city plan which applied the 'joint core system'. Each 'tree-like' mega scale
'vertical core provides the path for public transport with "branches" (lateral paths
of movement) emanating from this core which in turn sustain "leaves" (the housing
units), which intertwine and link-up to generate a network in the air' (Isozaki,
2001: 74). The multiplication of treelike structures produces finally a 'forest'.
Tange's 'Plan for Tokyo 1960' was designed for the rapidly increasing industrial and
urban sprawl, to provide a new urban proposal for the city's future. In this plan,
the most striking idea was to fill up Tokyo Bay to create artificial land which was
intended to cross the bay with a mega-scale linear expansion of interlocking
communication routes. This was based on the idea of the linear city with a tree-like
structure.</reference>
  <reference order="12">If we think about the social context in which we live,
utopianism seems a completely dated and inappropriate concept. However, a number of
theorists believed that utopia can act as a catalyst for social change and that we
cannot live meaningful lives without utopias. Karl Mannheim's 'Ideology and Utopia'
(1952), for example, makes this argument against 'the relinquishment of utopias'
(Mannheim cited in Mazlish, 2003: 44). This was not a pragmatic ideal but more an
emphasis on 'spiritual significance' (Turner, 1992: 187) and hope. What the
Metabolists envisaged was the hope of a future city which embodied the idea of
democracy, egalitarianism, classlessness and the freedom of the
individual.</reference>
  <reference order="13">The capacity for units of individual living spaces ranged
from 2000 in Kurokawa's 'Agricultural City' to 500,000 in Kikutake's 'Ocean City'
(Lin, 2010: 74).</reference>
  <reference order="14">Recent concerns about the issues of democracy and freedom in
contemporary urban life have been exacerbated in the debates about the
implementation of advanced computer informational systems, such as the use of
'citizen sensors' (Gabrys, 2014), to improve resource efficiencies, sustainable
environments and secure everyday practices. Ubiquitous computing systems potentially
make it possible for citizens to input their level of energy consumption in various
everyday activities to the central database. On the one hand, citizen participation
in urban sustainability schemas can create the chance for greater public
intervention in the governance of cities. Yet on the other hand it can also open the
door to greater surveillance, so as to further by stealth governance of citizens'
urban life. In this respect, it raises the question of how far inhabitants as
citizens can perform democratically.</reference>
  <reference order="15">However, his main social responsibility to be a social
architect did not go beyond the role of an agent of the government until he
announced the 'Plan for Tokyo 1960'. The plan first appeared on Japan's national
television network NHK as a special TV programme, and its ideas were not published
Shukan in any architectural journal but instead in the popular news journal Asahi
[Asahi Weekly]. As a result of this, the plan received instant public attention.
This gesture suggested that his plan was not commissioned by the government and
therefore it was his own proposal of a future Tokyo (Lin, 2010: 144-6). The plan was
eventually taken up by the Japanese Minister of Transportation as a potential
national project. Although the plan was never realized, at this point Tange become
an autonomous social reformer or social engineer, not just an agent.</reference>
  <reference order="16">If a utopia is 'a circumstantial product' of the time, like
the notion of 'modern', utopias could be always emerging from surrounding social
environments at any time and place. Thus each era and society has its own utopian
idealism. Levitas states: 'If you look at the history of the English utopia, the
kind of utopia prevalent in the 19th century forms a special case, and that, by
extension, one can see that utopias do indeed exist in the present time, they are
merely different in content and in social role, because they are predicated on
different assumptions about social development, time and power' (Levitas, 1982:
54).</reference>
  <reference order="17">'The utopias of the 19th century were predicated on a view
of social development that was evolutionary - i.e. continuous and progressive, and
on the assumption of human control over that evolution' (Levitas, 1982:
54).</reference>
  <reference order="18">Beck states that 'dangerous, hostile substances lie
concealed behind the harmless facades. Everything must be viewed with a double gaze,
and only be correctly understood and judged through this doubling. The world of the
visible must be investigated, relativized and evaluated with respect to a second
reality, only existent in thought and yet concealed in the world. The standards for
evaluation lie only in the second, not in the visible world' (Beck, 1992:
72).</reference>
  <reference order="19">Kurokawa developed the concept of impermanence, derived from
Shintoism and also Buddhism. He believed that the concept of impermanence could be
used to apply the idea that the city and architecture are continuously changing and
growing. For him, 'everything we see is impermanent. Whole cities can vanish in a
day of warfare. It's this idea that the Japanese believe in, not the outward form.
It's the philosophy' (Koolhaas and Obrist, 2011: 385).</reference>
  <reference order="20">Metabolism can be contrasted to Koolhaas's 'generic city'.
Koolhaas saw the city as 'liberated from the captivity of centre, from the
straitjacket of identity'. A city in which 'if it gets small it just expands. If it
gets old it just self-destructs and renews' (Koolhaas et al., 1995: 1249-50). This
idea of selfmaintenance by 'mutation' resonates with the Metabolists' organic
city.</reference>
  <reference order="21">He argued that the mega-city, like Tokyo, urgently needed to
change its old structure and system in order to solve the problem of rapid expansion
along with a radically growing population. In this view, he explained that the
transportation system was particularly significant for dealing with the increasing
mobility. Thus, mobility can determine the structure of the city.</reference>
  <reference order="22">Over 60 years after the emergence of Metabolism, there is a
continuous strain of this idea in the present debate about the contemporary city
plan. With the growing attention given computational information programmes,
especially digital tracking systems, a new type of urban planning concerned with the
sustainability of the city has become a key issue for contemporary society. 'All
urban actors, at whatever scale - from the pedestrian to the megacity itself -
respond to embedded regularities they help to materialize and normalize, in
cognitive, affective and rhythmic ways' (Crandall, 2010: 71).</reference>
  <reference order="23">This could resonate with Archigram's 'Living City' which
sought to not only liberate people in the city by celebrating technological
innovation but also empower the inhabitants to create their own way of life.
Archigram focused more on the inhabitants as individuals who were incalculable
living entities, and acknowledged that the individuals were significant active
entities who could contribute to creating a 'Living City', which appreciated the
immediacy and feeling for urban life. 'The future would not be the architect's total
design, but a collaboration between architect and inhabitants' (Sadler, 2005: 65).
In other words, for them, the city was not seen as architecture with hardware, but
as 'the individuals, "bare and naked man" with his complex of personal beliefs and
motives' (Sadler, 2005: 65).</reference>
  <reference order="24">Unlike the other Metabolists, such as Kurokawa and Kikutake,
Fumihiko Maki rarely proposed megastructures and was primarily interested in
urbanism, not technology. He invented 'group-form', which was inspired by seeing
cities and villages in North Africa, India, the Middle East and Europe. He learnt 'a
variety of vernacular human settlement and was particularly impressed by their
repetitive patterns and the intricate order with the grouping of building' (Lin,
2010: 32). Through this trip, he became much concerned with individual units, which
are largely subject to vernacular human activities, and focused on a human-oriented
vision of city planning.</reference>
