the constructed environments and climate in a tropical climate situation [1-3], this
article discusses urbanism (or the architecture of public spaces) and its interaction
with the environment-normally defined according to the climate of European countries
[4-8]-from a tropical country's perspective. The main changes that urban design
should go through are unnoticed in the work of a designer-since his/her theoretical
concepts about shape, esthetics, and landscaping have been elaborated without
considering local climate and, consequently, without considering the needs of the
users, either. As European open spaces need protection against cold winds as well as
to take advantage of solar radiation and of low sky luminance, the different climatic
conditions in the tropics should be considered for the benefit of all
users.<component x="42.52" y="133.89" width="251.07" height="200.47" page="1"

approach to urbanism design in the tropics and in the European countries are not well
understood, mostly as a consequence of the economic and, moreover, the cultural
dependency since colonial times. Unfortunately, Latin American universities are still
working with this uncontested colonialist frame of mind. Thus, the purpose of
integrating urbanism and climate in tropical countries is still very incipient (see
for example Ref [9]). The several points of view referred in this paper intend to
contribute with a reflection about the subject.<component x="311.53" y="229.53"

tropics- regions characterized by low latitude and excessive solar radiation-is
determined by the thermodynamic balance between absorbed solar energy and dissipated
energy, based on four mechanisms: the emission of long wave radiation (from the
surrounding surfaces), the materials heat conduction, the water evaporation, and heat
convection from surfaces to the air [10-12]. Energetic balance of external
surroundings near the building can lead to two questions: how microclimate elements
affect energy consumption in the architectonic space [13] and how the building system
affects the microclimate [14]. The manifestation of heat islands is a principal topic
to consider. It depends directly on urban design, such as the streets and the grid
shapes, the location of green spaces, the building ensemble that modulates the
environment shape, the recovering materials, and the quality of surfaces. In general,
reaching thermal comfort and decreasing the electrical energy consumption in the
tropics is possible, by working with an urban design that modifies the wind path in a
convenient way, the shadows, and the presence of water. The constructed environment
with different colored surfaces and with reflective properties is also important in
order to control the in-coming solar energy and the wind.<component x="311.53"

lateness="0.4" reference_score="2.41">Heat islands are microclimate regions with
temperatures higher than in their surroundings [15-17]. In countries with cold
climate, they are advantageous during the winter time, since they decrease the demand
of energy for heating. In tropical countries, these islands may occur when the heat
dissipation by infrared radiation is smaller than the thermal energy increase due to
a large exposition to solar radiation. They become larger or smaller depending on the
size of sky view factors and ventilation, and also on the urbanization design. They
directly influence the airconditioning consumption of electric energy [13]. It is
worth mentioning that the rate of ventilation in open spaces may rise or may lower
the heat islands' temperature (the latter could be called a ''cold island''). Surface
colors of paved surroundings with different temperatures, emissivity and
reflectivity, different diffusivity and effusivity of materials can modify an
environment causing uncomfortable sensations to their users, who withdraw from using
the spaces [18]. These elements are important to determine wind standards
disturbances, turbulences, and doldrums, and to determine the wind shadow spaces.
Heat islands formation is not always bad. It depends on the influence on the people's
thermal comfort and on the energy consumption through air conditioning. It should be
acknowledged that temperatures fluctuate throughout the day. A region could be a heat
island during the day and a cold island at night, or vice versa. If we take the
building occupation period into consideration-or the occupation period of a town
section, whose buildings use follows the same pattern-a heat island may lose its
importance. For example, a nightly heat island in a district of buildings with daily
occupation, such as office-buildings, does not interfere in the thermal comfort issue
nor in terms of energy consumption through air conditioning. The same occurs with a
daily heat island in a section of buildings with nightly use. If avoiding heat
islands formation was possible by urban design, what needs to be taken care of is to
prevent their occurrence during the day, in daily occupied sections, and at night, in
nightly occupied areas. That is why several geometric relations that link buildings
height and streets width to heat islands need revision based on the above concepts.
There is no doubt that the relationship between daylight versus height will not
change, but the results may vary when promoting or obstructing the wind corridors. At
the same time, the sky view factors must be read from a different perspective in
relation to European urban projects, since the differences of solar exposition as
well as of infrared emissions should be taken into account. Therefore, the daily
occupation of urban sections should have reduced sky view factors to avoid a great
exposition to solar radiation and to be less permeable to daily winds, which bring
air masses with higher temperatures than that of the microclimates. Nightly
occupation sections, as dormitory buildings quarters, should have large sky view
factors and be permeable to winds, so as to dissipate the hot air masses formed
during the day. Regarding the soil occupation, it must be reminded that all
anthropogenic heat sources contribute to increase the heat islands temperatures. As
it was said, in the case of cold countries, these islands behave as sources that help
to produce thermal comfort sensation, which is not true in the tropics. Just to have
an idea of how much heat people may produce, it could be compared to the energy that
comes from the sun: the solar energy that the city of Sao Paulo &#x2DC; receives by
square meter of the horizontal surface is of 2 150 kWh/m month. The average energy
produced by each 2 inhabitant, per square meter, is of 187 kWh/m month, i.e., 20%
more energy than the incident solar energy. Certainly, this average proportion
increases when considering zones of greater population density-it is well known that
park temperatures are always lower than in inhabited areas. The fact that the towns
present lower temperatures during weekends confirms the anthropogenic heat
contribution to heat islands formation. Many authors have registered the correlation
between zones of industrial, commercial, and services concentration-based on a great
deal of con2 crete-and the raise of temperature and pollution. Therefore, contrary to
the conclusions of the cold countries urbanism, cities in the tropics should not have
a compact shape, but rather a loose shape of built environment, in order to reduce
the possibilities of heat islands. It must be highlighted that this constitutes a
real problem in huge cities, but not when it comes to small ones.<component x="32.71"

climate and the people comfort. The choice of the grid and the geometric relations
between the buildings height and the street widths determine where and when there
should be shadow and which winds should be at pedestrian level. In big cities, the
compact shapes-determined by the construction industry speculation-obstruct natural
winds. In case the vehicles' circulation is very intense during all the day, the wind
will follow the traffic flow up to the third floor level. But, two factors dissuade
the use of these air currents: the intense noise and the air mass pollution [20].
Therefore, dwelling apartments should be located over the third floor. The
orientation of streets and urban ways must take into account the local solar
trajectories and the principal frequencies of winds. It is strongly unadvisable to
design East-West straight streets, because they cause visual 3 discomfort in the
early morning and in late afternoon and extreme thermal discomfort near
noon.<component x="42.52" y="498.48" width="251.07" height="224.39" page="3"

quarters is also important because the trees' transpiration by evaporation reduces
the air temperature in summer. One needs to be careful with these spaces in humid
places, since humidity rises very easily, bearing in mind, also, that if the canopies
are too thick they would block the ventilation. Therefore, urban design must consider
the kind of vegetation that would adjust better in tropical climate region, humid or
dry. Another consideration is about how much solar radiation the vegetation reflects
and how much it absorbs, its transmission coefficient (the shadow quality), how many
liters it transpires (or takes out from the soil), how much of the infrared radiation
emitted by the soil it blocks, how much is emitted by its leaves, etc., because these
factors have a decisive influence for the thermal and visual comfort of citizens. The
presence of vegetation or of green areas is of great significance, since it is
capable of absorbing almost 50% of the incident solar radiation. The World Health
Organiza2 tion (WHO) recommends a minimum of 12 m /inhab of 4 arboreous zone. On the
other hand, the increase of the impermeable covering area (or the modification of the
urban soil permeability) means a decrease of soil evaporation. The greater the area
covered by buildings and constructions, the greater impermeability will result from 5
compacted soil. the relation between the paved soil and the naked but
Impermeabilization is one of the elements that have influence on the reduction of the
relative air humidity, on the infrared radiation increase, which results from the
superficial temperature raise, and on the thermal energy accumulated, as well as on
floods and mud slides provoked by intense raining. The size of squares (plazas) or
other open spaces will promote the movement of the nearby air at the pedestrian
level-knowing that the corridors formed by streets increase the wind flow-creating
calm zones near the floor. The width of the open space, the kind of soil covering,
vegetation, and type and shape of the closing surfaces determine the air movement
[22]. In terms of spaces where people traverse with great intensity, it is
fundamental to have control over the incident solar energy, which besides promoting
thermal comfort will help to prevent skin cancer. It is possible to take actions to
deal with direct and diffuse radiation (obstructing it with different kinds of a
coverage) and/or the reflected radiation (obstructing it by confinement or by
modifying adjacent spaces) in order to reduce their incidence over pedestrians. It is
worth remembering that once the design's objective related to people thermal and
visual comfort is clearly focused, those spaces with intense human occupation can be
classified, just for operational aspects, as ''Living Spaces'' (with specification
about the kind of activity and/or the function the space is meant to hold), ''Passing
Spaces'' (where people must pass by to reach to other spaces and/or activities), and
''Adjacent Spaces''. This work needs to consider knowing the schedules of the
population use, the amount of people that use them, the kind of clothing people wear,
besides the microclimate data, the seasons' characteristics, topography, and/or the
open space surrounding elements. The fundamental issue here is that solar radiation
must be reduced, surface temperatures must also be lowered, in order to decrease the
infrared radiation liquid flow, as well as the air temperature (if this is done by
evaporative cooling, never exceed 80% of the final relative humidity). The
temperature of surrounding surfaces must be reduced by cold pavements, water
curtains, and confined water slides or by sprinkled coverings, to reduce the infrared
radiation flow. The convective flow reduction can be obtained by lowering the air
temperature (sensitive or latent cooling) and by aiding the movement of cooled air
(canalize the breezes or use fans or water streams).<component x="42.52" y="135.87"

activities and the period of occupation they are meant for, thus that they may
correspond to the thermal and visual comfort of their users. For uncovered places
with a great movement of people, the use of vegetal or artificial coverings to
protect them from the solar radiation is fundamental. The environmental
protection-reflection of inner solar radiation or of the great quantity of infrared
radiation emitter by nearby surfaces-must be treated to eliminate or reduce these
sources of thermal and visual discomfort. Galleries, marquises, tense screens, or
vegetation over the heads of the pedestrian, or the open places under stilts
(''pilotis''), are of extreme importance, protecting them from intense solar
radiation or tropical rains. Materials employed and the buildings sizes affect the
thermal comfort of pedestrian on the pavement. The diffusivity of the materials will
affect the internal thermal comfort and the electricity consumption of the air 6
conditioning, but its superficial effusivity, i.e., its capacity to retain and send
back thermal energy, will be responsible for the pedestrian comfort. The colors of
the surrounding surfaces are also important due to its capacity to absorb different
amounts of solar radiation. These amounts will be determined by the facility of
radiation to reach these surfaces, considering the existing elements that reduce
radiation, such as marquises, trees, etc. Surface colors and reflectivity and the
surrounding materials diffusivity and effusivity modify infrared radiation and
therefore the comfort sensation for pedestrian.<component x="311.53" y="44.2"

lateness="0.8" reference_score="5.52">In the humid tropics, air renewal brings
benefits not only because it incorporates air masses with lower temperature, but
because the renewed air brings less relative humidity than in the case of inhabited
regions. Consequently, during occupation period it is important to promote
ventilation where people are present. But, if ventilation with hot winds is promoted
in uninhabited regions, the result is the town simply heating without benefits for
the thermal comfort, because nobody is there. The direct sprinkling of water on
people's skin raises the comfort sensation. However, this is only true for those
persons whose skin have been moistened with droplets; for others, whose skin has not
been moistened, the discomfort sensation becomes worse because of the higher air
relative humidity. This situation makes it difficult to evaporate transpiration-the
most significant way to lower the skin temperature in the tropics. Shadow and
fountains may have a fundamental importance in the dry tropics [23], or in regions
with long periods of dryness. In relation to the latter, there are many microclimates
with these characteristics in the Brazilian central plateau and in the northeast
regions. In these cases, the adoption of an urban design that changes the features
with the season's changes is recommended. As it happens with several European parks,
where there are trees with falling leaves with plenty of shadows during the summer,
letting the desired sun get trough in the winter, public spaces of tropical regions
should also provide fountains and/or water curtains during the dry seasons,
forbidding the use of such equipments and promote ventilation in the wet periods.
Similar considerations must be made referring to artificial lakes or decorative water
mirrors, which can be good for dry regions but lead to thermal discomfort in humid
regions. In addition to the solar energy absorption increase-in several hours of
daytime-the reflection of the water surface may cause glazing.<component x="32.71"

be considerably controlled to provide human thermal comfort to guarantee the use of
these public spaces. Referring to the geometry, sun trajectory diagrams and solar
masks, corresponding to the place latitude, must be known and taking into account.
Shadowing areas by constructed elements (pergolas, marquises or kiosks) or by the
disposition of trees, together with the use of low absorbing or reflective surface
materials, can minimize the problems provoked by excessive solar radiation-first by
the control of solar radiation that arrives directly on people and also by
diminishing the environmental temperature. In the same way, space design must
guarantee the penetration of breezes that cause well being and refreshing sensations
in the environment, as well as blocking the undesirable winds. Among the principal
effects of wind in urban climate, it can be pointed out the stilts, the corner, the
matting, the whirl, the barrier, Venturi, different pressure zones, the canalization,
and the pyramid effects, studied by European authors with the principal aim of
reducing the thermal (cold) and security discomfort of pedestrian [24]. The security
measures for the users of these open spaces will be the same in the tropics, but the
effects that control the thermal comfort must be the opposite: the wind must be
directed to people instead of protecting people from it, to improve the comfort
sensation. The induced air movement, if correctly used, could carry an additional
comfort lowering the temperature of surrounding surfaces in the adjacent spaces. It
must be observed that the difference of surfaces temperature, produced by incident
solar radiation, creates air flows of climb the hills up and down, or flows between
heat islands and parks. Then, the climate of a town will be a function of the soil
use, of the geometry of the environment, of the materials and surfaces, and of the
presence of vegetation.<component x="301.72" y="211.56" width="251.03"

lateness="1.0" reference_score="6.81">It is worth to acknowledge that daylight design
in most cases is not taken into account by tropical urban designers. Since the
''tropical sky'' luminance is high, all European measures suggested to increase it
make no sense in a brilliant sky landscape. Therefore, a usual urban design for the
tropics does not take daylight into consideration, but does not realize that other
kinds of problems are present. Excessive daylight does not mean visual comfort.
Because of this misunderstanding, no attempts are made to reduce the illumination
level, nor to reduce the contrast produced by the environmental reflection [25]. In
relation to the buildings envelope, to the areas that are too exposed to sunlight, it
is well known that highly reflective colors reduce the internal temperature but, on
the other hand, they raise the thermal and visual discomfort of the pedestrian.
Nevertheless, the mirrored buildings are the main big problem because, besides the
inner thermal discomfort created by the large glazing, they multiply the negative
effects of solar radiation on pedestrians. That is why Schools of Architecture in
tropical countries must inform to their students that, when they import design
solutions from a European town to a tropical one, they are importing factors that
will change history and climate. Perhaps, this would be a correct attitude if the
urban planner aim is to provoke these changes. But, if the changes occur based on a
misunderstanding, in terms of the climate interaction with the town, these solutions
are certainly not correct. A simple historical example of an imported change from a
different climate: with the introduction of the ''city for cars'' conception, streets
paved with stone bricks were asphalted making the temperature to rise, a very good
solution for Paris, but a very bad one for Rio de Janeiro.<component x="301.72"

the constructed environments and climate in a tropical climate situation [1-3], this
article discusses urbanism (or the architecture of public spaces) and its interaction
with the environment-normally defined according to the climate of European countries
[4-8]-from a tropical country's perspective. The main changes that urban design
should go through are unnoticed in the work of a designer-since his/her theoretical
concepts about shape, esthetics, and landscaping have been elaborated without
considering local climate and, consequently, without considering the needs of the
users, either. As European open spaces need protection against cold winds as well as
to take advantage of solar radiation and of low sky luminance, the different climatic
conditions in the tropics should be considered for the benefit of all
users.<component x="42.52" y="133.89" width="251.07" height="200.47" page="1"

approach to urbanism design in the tropics and in the European countries are not well

working with this uncontested colonialist frame of mind. Thus, the purpose of
integrating urbanism and climate in tropical countries is still very incipient (see

tropics- regions characterized by low latitude and excessive solar radiation-is
determined by the thermodynamic balance between absorbed solar energy and dissipated
energy, based on four mechanisms: the emission of long wave radiation (from the
surrounding surfaces), the materials heat conduction, the water evaporation, and heat
convection from surfaces to the air [10-12]. Energetic balance of external
surroundings near the building can lead to two questions: how microclimate elements
affect energy consumption in the architectonic space [13] and how the building system
affects the microclimate [14]. The manifestation of heat islands is a principal topic
to consider. It depends directly on urban design, such as the streets and the grid
shapes, the location of green spaces, the building ensemble that modulates the
environment shape, the recovering materials, and the quality of surfaces. In general,
reaching thermal comfort and decreasing the electrical energy consumption in the
tropics is possible, by working with an urban design that modifies the wind path in a
convenient way, the shadows, and the presence of water. The constructed environment
with different colored surfaces and with reflective properties is also important in
order to control the in-coming solar energy and the wind.<component x="311.53"

temperatures higher than in their surroundings [15-17]. In countries with cold
climate, they are advantageous during the winter time, since they decrease the demand
of energy for heating. In tropical countries, these islands may occur when the heat
dissipation by infrared radiation is smaller than the thermal energy increase due to
a large exposition to solar radiation. They become larger or smaller depending on the
size of sky view factors and ventilation, and also on the urbanization design. They
directly influence the airconditioning consumption of electric energy [13]. It is
worth mentioning that the rate of ventilation in open spaces may rise or may lower
the heat islands' temperature (the latter could be called a ''cold island''). Surface
colors of paved surroundings with different temperatures, emissivity and
reflectivity, different diffusivity and effusivity of materials can modify an
environment causing uncomfortable sensations to their users, who withdraw from using
the spaces [18]. These elements are important to determine wind standards
disturbances, turbulences, and doldrums, and to determine the wind shadow spaces.
Heat islands formation is not always bad. It depends on the influence on the people's
thermal comfort and on the energy consumption through air conditioning. It should be
acknowledged that temperatures fluctuate throughout the day. A region could be a heat
island during the day and a cold island at night, or vice versa. If we take the
building occupation period into consideration-or the occupation period of a town
section, whose buildings use follows the same pattern-a heat island may lose its
importance. For example, a nightly heat island in a district of buildings with daily
occupation, such as office-buildings, does not interfere in the thermal comfort issue
nor in terms of energy consumption through air conditioning. The same occurs with a
daily heat island in a section of buildings with nightly use. If avoiding heat
islands formation was possible by urban design, what needs to be taken care of is to
prevent their occurrence during the day, in daily occupied sections, and at night, in
nightly occupied areas. That is why several geometric relations that link buildings
height and streets width to heat islands need revision based on the above concepts.
There is no doubt that the relationship between daylight versus height will not
change, but the results may vary when promoting or obstructing the wind corridors. At
the same time, the sky view factors must be read from a different perspective in
relation to European urban projects, since the differences of solar exposition as
well as of infrared emissions should be taken into account. Therefore, the daily
occupation of urban sections should have reduced sky view factors to avoid a great
exposition to solar radiation and to be less permeable to daily winds, which bring
air masses with higher temperatures than that of the microclimates. Nightly
occupation sections, as dormitory buildings quarters, should have large sky view
factors and be permeable to winds, so as to dissipate the hot air masses formed
during the day. Regarding the soil occupation, it must be reminded that all
anthropogenic heat sources contribute to increase the heat islands temperatures. As
it was said, in the case of cold countries, these islands behave as sources that help
to produce thermal comfort sensation, which is not true in the tropics. Just to have
an idea of how much heat people may produce, it could be compared to the energy that
comes from the sun: the solar energy that the city of Sao Paulo &#x2DC; receives by
square meter of the horizontal surface is of 2 150 kWh/m month. The average energy
produced by each 2 inhabitant, per square meter, is of 187 kWh/m month, i.e., 20%
more energy than the incident solar energy. Certainly, this average proportion
increases when considering zones of greater population density-it is well known that
park temperatures are always lower than in inhabited areas. The fact that the towns
present lower temperatures during weekends confirms the anthropogenic heat
contribution to heat islands formation. Many authors have registered the correlation
between zones of industrial, commercial, and services concentration-based on a great
deal of con2 crete-and the raise of temperature and pollution. Therefore, contrary to
the conclusions of the cold countries urbanism, cities in the tropics should not have
a compact shape, but rather a loose shape of built environment, in order to reduce
the possibilities of heat islands. It must be highlighted that this constitutes a
real problem in huge cities, but not when it comes to small ones.<component x="32.71"

climate and the people comfort. The choice of the grid and the geometric relations
between the buildings height and the street widths determine where and when there
should be shadow and which winds should be at pedestrian level. In big cities, the
compact shapes-determined by the construction industry speculation-obstruct natural
winds. In case the vehicles' circulation is very intense during all the day, the wind
will follow the traffic flow up to the third floor level. But, two factors dissuade
the use of these air currents: the intense noise and the air mass pollution [20].
Therefore, dwelling apartments should be located over the third floor. The
orientation of streets and urban ways must take into account the local solar
trajectories and the principal frequencies of winds. It is strongly unadvisable to
design East-West straight streets, because they cause visual 3 discomfort in the
early morning and in late afternoon and extreme thermal discomfort near
noon.<component x="42.52" y="498.48" width="251.07" height="224.39" page="3"

quarters is also important because the trees' transpiration by evaporation reduces
the air temperature in summer. One needs to be careful with these spaces in humid
places, since humidity rises very easily, bearing in mind, also, that if the canopies
are too thick they would block the ventilation. Therefore, urban design must consider
the kind of vegetation that would adjust better in tropical climate region, humid or
dry. Another consideration is about how much solar radiation the vegetation reflects
and how much it absorbs, its transmission coefficient (the shadow quality), how many
liters it transpires (or takes out from the soil), how much of the infrared radiation
emitted by the soil it blocks, how much is emitted by its leaves, etc., because these
factors have a decisive influence for the thermal and visual comfort of citizens. The
presence of vegetation or of green areas is of great significance, since it is
capable of absorbing almost 50% of the incident solar radiation. The World Health
Organiza2 tion (WHO) recommends a minimum of 12 m /inhab of 4 arboreous zone. On the
other hand, the increase of the impermeable covering area (or the modification of the
urban soil permeability) means a decrease of soil evaporation. The greater the area
covered by buildings and constructions, the greater impermeability will result from 5
compacted soil. the relation between the paved soil and the naked but
Impermeabilization is one of the elements that have influence on the reduction of the
relative air humidity, on the infrared radiation increase, which results from the
superficial temperature raise, and on the thermal energy accumulated, as well as on
floods and mud slides provoked by intense raining. The size of squares (plazas) or
other open spaces will promote the movement of the nearby air at the pedestrian
level-knowing that the corridors formed by streets increase the wind flow-creating
calm zones near the floor. The width of the open space, the kind of soil covering,
vegetation, and type and shape of the closing surfaces determine the air movement
[22]. In terms of spaces where people traverse with great intensity, it is
fundamental to have control over the incident solar energy, which besides promoting
thermal comfort will help to prevent skin cancer. It is possible to take actions to
deal with direct and diffuse radiation (obstructing it with different kinds of a
coverage) and/or the reflected radiation (obstructing it by confinement or by
modifying adjacent spaces) in order to reduce their incidence over pedestrians. It is
worth remembering that once the design's objective related to people thermal and
visual comfort is clearly focused, those spaces with intense human occupation can be
classified, just for operational aspects, as ''Living Spaces'' (with specification
about the kind of activity and/or the function the space is meant to hold), ''Passing
Spaces'' (where people must pass by to reach to other spaces and/or activities), and
''Adjacent Spaces''. This work needs to consider knowing the schedules of the
population use, the amount of people that use them, the kind of clothing people wear,
besides the microclimate data, the seasons' characteristics, topography, and/or the
open space surrounding elements. The fundamental issue here is that solar radiation
must be reduced, surface temperatures must also be lowered, in order to decrease the
infrared radiation liquid flow, as well as the air temperature (if this is done by
evaporative cooling, never exceed 80% of the final relative humidity). The
temperature of surrounding surfaces must be reduced by cold pavements, water
curtains, and confined water slides or by sprinkled coverings, to reduce the infrared
radiation flow. The convective flow reduction can be obtained by lowering the air
temperature (sensitive or latent cooling) and by aiding the movement of cooled air
(canalize the breezes or use fans or water streams).<component x="42.52" y="135.87"

activities and the period of occupation they are meant for, thus that they may
correspond to the thermal and visual comfort of their users. For uncovered places
with a great movement of people, the use of vegetal or artificial coverings to
protect them from the solar radiation is fundamental. The environmental
protection-reflection of inner solar radiation or of the great quantity of infrared
radiation emitter by nearby surfaces-must be treated to eliminate or reduce these
sources of thermal and visual discomfort. Galleries, marquises, tense screens, or
vegetation over the heads of the pedestrian, or the open places under stilts
(''pilotis''), are of extreme importance, protecting them from intense solar
radiation or tropical rains. Materials employed and the buildings sizes affect the
thermal comfort of pedestrian on the pavement. The diffusivity of the materials will
affect the internal thermal comfort and the electricity consumption of the air 6
conditioning, but its superficial effusivity, i.e., its capacity to retain and send
back thermal energy, will be responsible for the pedestrian comfort. The colors of
the surrounding surfaces are also important due to its capacity to absorb different
amounts of solar radiation. These amounts will be determined by the facility of
radiation to reach these surfaces, considering the existing elements that reduce
radiation, such as marquises, trees, etc. Surface colors and reflectivity and the
surrounding materials diffusivity and effusivity modify infrared radiation and
therefore the comfort sensation for pedestrian.<component x="311.53" y="44.2"

benefits not only because it incorporates air masses with lower temperature, but
because the renewed air brings less relative humidity than in the case of inhabited
regions. Consequently, during occupation period it is important to promote
ventilation where people are present. But, if ventilation with hot winds is promoted
in uninhabited regions, the result is the town simply heating without benefits for
the thermal comfort, because nobody is there. The direct sprinkling of water on
people's skin raises the comfort sensation. However, this is only true for those
persons whose skin have been moistened with droplets; for others, whose skin has not
been moistened, the discomfort sensation becomes worse because of the higher air
relative humidity. This situation makes it difficult to evaporate transpiration-the
most significant way to lower the skin temperature in the tropics. Shadow and
fountains may have a fundamental importance in the dry tropics [23], or in regions
with long periods of dryness. In relation to the latter, there are many microclimates
with these characteristics in the Brazilian central plateau and in the northeast
regions. In these cases, the adoption of an urban design that changes the features
with the season's changes is recommended. As it happens with several European parks,
where there are trees with falling leaves with plenty of shadows during the summer,
letting the desired sun get trough in the winter, public spaces of tropical regions
should also provide fountains and/or water curtains during the dry seasons,
forbidding the use of such equipments and promote ventilation in the wet periods.
Similar considerations must be made referring to artificial lakes or decorative water
mirrors, which can be good for dry regions but lead to thermal discomfort in humid
regions. In addition to the solar energy absorption increase-in several hours of
daytime-the reflection of the water surface may cause glazing.<component x="32.71"

be considerably controlled to provide human thermal comfort to guarantee the use of
these public spaces. Referring to the geometry, sun trajectory diagrams and solar
masks, corresponding to the place latitude, must be known and taking into account.
Shadowing areas by constructed elements (pergolas, marquises or kiosks) or by the
disposition of trees, together with the use of low absorbing or reflective surface
materials, can minimize the problems provoked by excessive solar radiation-first by
the control of solar radiation that arrives directly on people and also by
diminishing the environmental temperature. In the same way, space design must
guarantee the penetration of breezes that cause well being and refreshing sensations
in the environment, as well as blocking the undesirable winds. Among the principal
effects of wind in urban climate, it can be pointed out the stilts, the corner, the
matting, the whirl, the barrier, Venturi, different pressure zones, the canalization,
and the pyramid effects, studied by European authors with the principal aim of
reducing the thermal (cold) and security discomfort of pedestrian [24]. The security
measures for the users of these open spaces will be the same in the tropics, but the
effects that control the thermal comfort must be the opposite: the wind must be
directed to people instead of protecting people from it, to improve the comfort
sensation. The induced air movement, if correctly used, could carry an additional
comfort lowering the temperature of surrounding surfaces in the adjacent spaces. It
must be observed that the difference of surfaces temperature, produced by incident
solar radiation, creates air flows of climb the hills up and down, or flows between
heat islands and parks. Then, the climate of a town will be a function of the soil
use, of the geometry of the environment, of the materials and surfaces, and of the
presence of vegetation.<component x="301.72" y="211.56" width="251.03"

in most cases is not taken into account by tropical urban designers. Since the
''tropical sky'' luminance is high, all European measures suggested to increase it
make no sense in a brilliant sky landscape. Therefore, a usual urban design for the
tropics does not take daylight into consideration, but does not realize that other
kinds of problems are present. Excessive daylight does not mean visual comfort.
Because of this misunderstanding, no attempts are made to reduce the illumination
level, nor to reduce the contrast produced by the environmental reflection [25]. In
relation to the buildings envelope, to the areas that are too exposed to sunlight, it
is well known that highly reflective colors reduce the internal temperature but, on
the other hand, they raise the thermal and visual discomfort of the pedestrian.
Nevertheless, the mirrored buildings are the main big problem because, besides the
inner thermal discomfort created by the large glazing, they multiply the negative
effects of solar radiation on pedestrians. That is why Schools of Architecture in
tropical countries must inform to their students that, when they import design
solutions from a European town to a tropical one, they are importing factors that
will change history and climate. Perhaps, this would be a correct attitude if the
urban planner aim is to provoke these changes. But, if the changes occur based on a
misunderstanding, in terms of the climate interaction with the town, these solutions
are certainly not correct. A simple historical example of an imported change from a
different climate: with the introduction of the ''city for cars'' conception, streets
paved with stone bricks were asphalted making the temperature to rise, a very good
solution for Paris, but a very bad one for Rio de Janeiro.<component x="301.72"
