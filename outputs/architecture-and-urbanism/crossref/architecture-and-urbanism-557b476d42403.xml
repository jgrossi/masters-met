REASSURANCE Andrew&#xA0;Millie* Architecture has for many years been of interest to
criminology in terms of its role in social control and crime prevention. This article
focuses on architecture as reassurance and the specific example of the police
station-what is an under-researched topic. Supporting evidence is presented from a
study of police stations in three English police forces. The study's aims were modest
and exploratory, to draw on theoretical and empirical evidence to consider whether
police stations are a worthwhile area of criminological/architectural study, and to
investigate the possibility that police stations could contribute to public
reassurance. Using the language of semiotics, the article argues that meanings
attached to police stations can contribute to reassurance by affecting people's
emotive 'readings' of security and safety; yet, to do this, there has to be a rethink
for many existing stations in terms of what these buildings communicate. The article
adopts an interpretivist view of meaning acknowledging that buildings can mean
different things to different people. It is suggested that numerous police stations
can be read as intimidating fortresses; many others are secret places; while others
are potentially public buildings where the public are welcomed. Implications for a
policy of reassurance are discussed in light of the current cuts to police budgets.
An agenda for further systematic research is suggested. Keywords: architecture,
police stations, reassurance, semiotics Introduction Over the past decade, there have
been calls for British policing to be a more reassuring presence in the community
(Innes 2007; Millie and Herrington 2005; Millie 2010). 'Reassurance policing' was
born as an approach to encourage positive encounters between police and public and to
foster greater police 'visibility, accessibility and familiarity' (Povey 2001: 17).
One way the police could achieve this was to respond positively to populist calls for
'more bobbies on the beat' and, by 2008, dedicated Neighbourhood Policing Teams were
allocated across the whole of England and Wales (HMIC 2008). However, by 2010, the
political and fiscal climate had changed, with demands for budgetary cuts and
reductions in police numbers (HMIC 2011; Millie and Bullock 2012). 52, 1092-1112 at

meant high police numbers are no longer an&#xA0;option. The focus of this article is
a part of policing that is largely overlooked by policing and criminological
research: the police station. The police estate is also a target for budgetary cuts;
yet, it is argued that selling police stations could be short-sighted. Furthermore,
in the current economic climate, they may be sold too cheaply. Instead, it is argued
that, rather than closing stations, police stations could emerge as symbols of
reassurance in the community. The Audit Commission (1999: 1)&#xA0;has previously

the public'. In their current form, this is somewhat optimistic, as not all police
stations can be classed as reassuring. As a way of illustration, the following is
taken from an interview on BBC's (1 August 2009)&#xA0; by Denise Mina with the author
David Peace. The discussion Show was about a setting used for his series of books on
the Yorkshire Ripper: the Red Riding Millgarth Police Station in Leeds: Peace: W ell
that's the Millgarth, the Millgarth Police Station which obviously was, you know, the
place where the Ripper enquiry was based. And in the book it becomes, you know, a
central location for the characters in the novels, as it was for the real policemen.
And it was just, I&#xA0;was going to say it's an intimidating building, but
I&#xA0;mean I've never, I&#xA0;mean have you ever seen a police station that wasn't
intimidating? Mina: But it is really; no that's particularly intimidating. And it's
like the arrow slit windows and the, Yeah it's, er, medieval Leeds. Peace: The
starting point for this article is this quotation from David Peace: '. . . have you
ever seen a police station that wasn't intimidating?' A&#xA0;few months later on the
same programme (26 November 2009), Tom Dyckhoff reported on progress with building a
new Riverside Museum in Glasgow, designed by the renowned architect Zaha Hadid.
Dyckhoff asked the Project Director Jim Heverin 'what can people expect when they go
and visit a Hadid building?'. Heverin's response was that: All of this is a
celebration of how people use and respond to buildings. Quite often for a public
building the ideas are quite simple, of actually trying to create transparency and
porosity, and bring people into the building so that you get maximum usage out of
buildings. In this article, I&#xA0;ask whether police stations are public buildings
and a reassuring presence in the community or, as Peace suggests, an intimidating
presence. Furthermore, is a police station characterized by 'transparency and
porosity' possible? The academic literature has considered the functioning of police
stations-albeit rarely-with important contributions being Holdaway's (1980;
1983)&#xA0; participant observations and Waddington's (1999) research into police
canteen sub-culture. Furthermore, McLaughlin (2008) has considered police station
closure in the context of performance management. There have been a few policy
reports on the police estate (Audit Commission 1999; Home Office 2005)&#xA0; and a
small study by the Institute for Public Policy Research (Rogers and Houston 2004).
There has been no independent academic research on the importance-or otherwise-of
police station architecture and design. This article is a small step in addressing
this omission. The focus is on The Culture at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on
June 12, 2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from emotive communication and
responses to police stations. According to Bahn (1974), police-public reassurance is
all about feelings, defining reassurance as 'the feeling of security and safety that
a citizen experiences when he sees a police officer or patrol car nearby' (Bahn 1974:
340). More recently, Innes and colleagues have focused on semiotic communication-on
what crimes and disorders signal to communities, and whether police officers provide
reassurance by acting as signals of control. According to Innes (2007: 135), the
police have 'an important role to play not just in making people safe but in making
them feel safer also'. Reassurance is thus associated people's subjective feelings of
order and security/fear of crime. Public confidence in the police is assumed to
improve if these feelings are addressed through increased visibility, accessibility
and familiarity (Millie and Herrington&#xA0;2005). 1093<component x="88.97" y="62.12"

forms-may mean different things to the same people in different circumstances. While
it is argued that architectural style can contribute to meaning, it is acknowledged
that it is only one-albeit neglected-aspect of police image and practice that can
influence people's perceptions of policing. The public face of policing is made of a
complex mix of images, encounters and expectations. For example, since the birth of
the police, a semiotic iconography has evolved involving the police station alongside
1 the chequerboard motif, the police car and (in Britain) the uniform, the colour
blue, the blue lamp, all of which are hoped to reassure the public that they are
secure and safe. Yet, negative encounters or attitudes may have a detrimental
influence on reassurance. In the police station context, perception can be influenced
by how a building is experienced or how its occupants are viewed. If the police are
viewed as repressive, then the police station may be viewed as repressive, no matter
what architectural style. Police (mis)conduct will also have a bearing on how the
police are 'read'. From recent British history, the cases of Stephen Lawrence (Foster
et&#xA0; al. 2005) and Ian Tomlinson (Greer and McLaughlin 2012), and the alleged
police corruption that has emerged from the Leveson inquiry into press standards
(Nicoll 2011), may all have an influence on individuals' images of the police,
perhaps more so than any official attempts at 'reassurance'. The article is
structured as follows. After describing the methodology, meanings attached to
architecture are examined with particular focus on the police station. Relationships
between buildings and users are considered and how buildings are divided into
different spaces, with particular reference to Holdaway's (1980) notion of 'front
stage' and 'back stage' spaces within the police station. The article then draws on
empirical evidence for the use and interpretation of police station buildings. Three
approaches to police station architecture are identified and examined in turn, these
being: police station as fortress; police station as secret; and police station as

own meanings. Although this leads to wide variety in interpretations, readers can be
grouped into three overlapping populations for study-these being designers/architects
of buildings, practitioner users and commissioners of buildings, and public users of
buildings. For this article, the focus is on practitioner users and commissioners of
police buildings. It is acknowledged that this is a limitation and views from wider
publics and from designers/architects will be important for future research. However,
the study's aims were more modest and exploratory, to draw on theoretical and
empirical evidence to consider whether police stations are a worthwhile area of
criminological/architectural study, and to investigate the possibility that police
stations could contribute to public reassurance. The study aimed to set an agenda for
further systematic research where wider public perspectives would shed more light on
the subject. The study's focus on practitioner users and commissioners is a useful
start, as it is this group that has the biggest influence on estate policy, and then
has to manage police stations on a day-to-day&#xA0;basis. Semi-structured interviews
were conducted with key police personnel in each force, including representatives
from Estate Services, station managers, civilian front-counter clerks and police
officers. A&#xA0;representative of the Home Office Design Policy Team was also
interviewed. Sixteen people were interviewed in total, each identified through
standard snowballing techniques. All interviews were recorded, transcribed,
anonymized and analysed for key and emerging themes. The data gained from the
interviews were supported by site observations, including study visits to each police
force area and the formation of a photographic database. The stations visited
represented a range of size, function and location. It is acknowledged that the
author's own judgments influenced interpretation. Where this is the case, or where a
practitioner's view is presented, I&#xA0;have been explicit. Evidence is presented
that, for quite a few police stations, architecture and design seem to conspire to
make the public a low priority rather than a central requirement; and, in some cases,
the buildings appear to be designed to repel the public rather than to reassure. Yet
others are more promising and are buildings where the public might be more welcome.
Background: Police Stations and a Search for&#xA0;Meaning Architecture has been an
important consideration for criminology, most notably as an element of social control
(e.g. Foucault 1977; Cohen 1985; Armstrong and McAra 2006), or as aid for crime
prevention (e.g. Jeffery 1971; Newman 1972; Hopper and Droge 2005). Both aspects are
relevant here; however, this article develops the idea of architecture as
reassurance. Key to this are emotional responses and meanings attached to police
stations. Semiotics is a useful way to try to understand sign-values of buildings. It
is a (post)structuralist idea which Eco (1979: 7)&#xA0;defined as 'concerned with
everything that can be taken as a sign'. As noted, buildings can mean different
things to different people and so an interpretivist view of semiotics is adopted,
that reading architecture is subjective. While (most) architecture communicates
function, how this function is read can vary. Furthermore, other meanings are read
informed by individual experience and expectation. For some, emotional responses to
buildings are viewed in terms of topophilia or 'love of place' ( Bachelard 1969; Tuan
1974). For others (e.g. Thrift 2004; Kraftl and Adey 2008), it makes sense to focus
on affect; 1095 at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12,
2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from as Thrift (2004: 57)&#xA0; has put,
it: 'Cities may be seen as rolling maelstroms of affect. Particular affects such as
anger, fear, happiness and joy are continually on the boil, rising here, subsiding
there.' Architecture can clearly contribute to love of place and to such affect.
Aesthetics is similarly relevant, the sensory feeling that, according to Tuan (1993:
1), 'is suggested even more by its opposite, anesthetic, "lack of feeling"- the
condition of living death'. It is quite possible that some police stations have an
anaesthetic&#xA0;quality. Thus, how we read architecture is subjective and we can
have different interpretations. Yet, these interpretations are influenced by a number
of factors, not least the power dynamics of architecture, building use and the
position of reader as powerful or powerless, as Markus (1993) has put it: A
building's form, function and space each has meanings in the field of social
relations, each is capable of signifying who we are, to ourselves, in society and in
the cosmic scheme of things. And each speaks of both power and bond relations.
(Markus 1993:&#xA0;30) Examples of architecture as power can include certain
religious buildings, factories and schools that express power through building
material, choice of architectural style, ornamentation or their size. Victorian
municipal buildings, courthouses, prisons and principle railway stations were
similarly designed with power in mind. Power was expressed through not only
architecture, but also building use and location which dominated local-and sometimes
national or even global-physical and psychic landscapes (Foucault 1977; Markus 1993).
Power is important for police stations and, as shall be discussed, they can be very
intimidating places. For the design of police stations, some power is clearly held by
the architect, but more so by those doing the commissioning in outlining various
requirements that have to be adhered to (this may or may not 3 To quote Gottdiener:
be influenced by public consultation). The production of buildings always involves an
articulation between the instrumentality of power and/or profit taking and aesthetic
design practises that express the sign function of the producers. Implicit in this
practice may also be designs composed with a particular consumer in mind. (Gottdiener
1995:&#xA0;12) In architectural discourse and practice, emphases on symbolic
communication and representation may come and go; however, according to Hirsch
(2006), they are back on the agenda: On the one hand architects tend to focus on the
material, organising matter, afraid of connotations, narration, anxious to leave the
safety of architectural language. But there is a-maybe still vague- suspicion that
representation is back. (Hirsch 2006:&#xA0;19) For contemporary architecture, how a
building is read can be as important as what it does-for instance, with talk of

not enjoy-nor necessarily need-such high-profile architects; yet, what a police
station means is still an important consideration and, with some encouragement,
police stations might more easily represent 'reassurance'. According to an
interviewee from the Metropolitan Police's Public Services Construction, 'if we raise
the profile of buildings, we could raise our presence in the community and raise
public reassurance'. Rogers and Houston (2004) took the view that the traditional
station was already a signal of reassurance: 'The familiar town centre police station
was designed to make the police force both visible and legible. It was an effective
symbol of security and order' (Rogers and Houston 2004: 4). Yet, in Britain, the
police estate comprises a ragtag collection of architectural styles, for example,
including: Victorian gothic revival (e.g. Blyth, Northumbria Police, 1896); art deco
(e.g. Bishopsgate, City of London, 1939); post-war modernism (e.g. Paddington Green,
Metropolitan Police, 1971); 5 (e.g. Bolton Divisional Headquarters, built by John
Laing for Greater post-modern 6 ), 2006);&#xA0;and Manchester Police under PFI
(Private Finance Initiatives contemporary (e.g. Lewisham, Metropolitan Police, built
by John Laing under PFI, 7 ). 2003 Stations are also built for varying purposes
ranging from shop-front offices through to divisional headquarters. It is debatable
whether all these buildings communicate the same&#xA0;meaning. In Britain, the recent
political context for police stations has been the emergence of PFI, the New Labour
Government's endorsement of design quality through the 8 Commission for Architecture
and the Built Environment (CABE), a design review process and the general promotion
of 'better public buildings' (DCMS 2000; CABE 2006). Good design was seen to be
'about providing buildings and spaces that are fit for purpose, built to last and
lift your spirits' (CABE 2006: 4), and both CABE and the Home Office provided project
'enablers' to help public bodies achieve this. Yet, despite greater emphasis on
design quality, having a new-build police station was no guarantee of architectural
quality. For instance, according to a member of the Home Office Design Policy Team:
It's true to say that some forces, I&#xA0;think, don't give enough thought to getting
the right architects. You can go out there and get an architect by whatever means,
you know, perhaps you know somebody, towards engaging the right architect. Yellow
Pages, or whatever. But part of the role of the enabler is to ensure that there is a

reference_score="9.76">The Police Station: Relationships between Building
and&#xA0;User According to the West Mercia Police Estates Manager who was
interviewed, their estate includes 'headquarters, BCU [Basic Command Unit]; each BCU
will have a number of section stations . . . . And they will then have, yeah, what
we've broadly described as Neighbourhood Policing Posts'. Leicestershire Police has a
similar structure, with, according to an Estates Manager interviewed at their
headquarters: You've got your headquarters . . . your BCU, your Basic Command Unit .
. . and then below that you have your local policing unit, so your LPUs, and then we
would have the smaller sort of beat offices, the sort of more Neighbourhood Policing
Offices. With this variety in mind, what is a police station? Buildings can be
conceptualized as a series of spaces and an understanding of space is clearly
important to architectural theory (e.g. Bachelard 1969; Hillier and Hanson 1984;
Lefebvre 1991). For instance, buildings are divided into spaces that have different
access, functions or normative rules and expectations. Buildings also sit within
wider spaces with which they interact, affecting emotional responses and semiotic
meaning attributed to them. Drawing on Goffman's (1969) dramaturgical perspective,
Holdaway (1980) described the police station as a divide between 'front stage' and
'back stage' spaces. The back stage consists of all non-public functions such as
offices, custody suite, canteen, locker rooms, meeting/ interview rooms and so on
(not all stations will have all these functions). Permission is required for public
access to the back stage. The front stage is the space where the public is permitted
and consists of the 'shop front', entrance and counter area. It is this public access
that turns a police building into a police station, with the front stage space acting
as the public face of the&#xA0;station. Alongside members of the public wanting to
report crimes or seek advice, another user group for the station consists of those
reporting for bail, solicitors and others on official duties. In some stations, there
is functional blurring, with the front coun ter used for legal and bail reporting
alongside public enquiries. In other stations, bail reporting is via a separate
entrance that bypasses this public space. The quality and design of the counter area
will have an important impact on public reassur ance; yet, public areas are often
cramped, dominated by security screens dividing the 'front stage' from the 'back
stage', have long queues and lack privacy ( FitzGerald . 2002). Continuing the
theatrical metaphor, the front counter area will add to a et&#xA0;al positive-or
negative-experience in the same way that, for a well-designed theatre, the foyer and
the building itself are a continuation of the theatrical experience and communicate
that the public are welcome and will have a good night out. In fact, in the retail
sector, architecture and design have been used frequently as theatre, to send a
specific message to the customer. An example is in banking, where historically the
building has communicated an aesthetic of 'solidity, wealth and respectability'
(Doyle 2004: 84), often through use of neoclassical styles. Similarly, a
well-designed retail shop front blurs boundaries between shop and street and is
characterized by 'transparency and porosity' so as to entice the passing shopper and
make them feel welcomed and at ease. A&#xA0;simple example is given by Doyle (2004:
84)&#xA0;of a shop that repositioned its entrance from the side to the front of the
building: 'After the reno vations, the store proudly welcomed its customers through
large double doors posi tioned centrally to the front of the shop. This new door
proclaims a number of things 1098 at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12,
2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from about the company. It is more open,
more accessible.' The question is whether this is possible for a police&#xA0;station.
According to Home Office guidance on Design Quality for Police Buildings (2005: 8),
good police buildings should 'be a pleasure to use, visit and look at' and 'meet
public needs'. In order to achieve this, police buildings must: 9 be accessible,
friendly and welcoming to the public, including the disabled, ing openness and
security taking account of the threat level help the public feel protected and that
the police are part of their community [and] help the police to feel proud of their
service. (Home Office 2005: 8) Within this list, how the public and the police 'feel'
is clearly important. Yet, there are seemingly conflicting meanings attributed to
police buildings which need to be 'friendly and welcoming', but also signifying
'security', protection at the same time as being 'part of their community'. What's
more, the buildings need to be something of which the police feel proud. Further
requirements are for 'having the right site' and for being 'operationally efficient'.
It is an ambitious list. For the police station to be a reassuring presence in the
community, the criteria of being 'accessible, friendly and welcoming' are clearly
important. As noted, each of the force's estates has a range of building styles and
age. For instance, according to an Estates Manager for West Mercia Police: . . . 35
per cent of our buildings are under 15&#xA0;years old, 41 per cent are 15 to
40&#xA0;years, and 24 per cent are over 40&#xA0;years old. . . . In that 'over
40&#xA0;years old' bracket we do have a number that are over a hundred
years&#xA0;old. The West Mercia estates strategy was to replace these very old
stations, as they were deemed 'not fit for purpose'. Similarly, according to a
representative from the Metropolitan Police Property Services: . . . we have roughly
six hundred buildings across the estate, and that's both territorial policing and
main policing. Of that building stock, about thirty-five percent predates 1935, and
the majority of that thirty-five percent are the police stations. . . . the youngest
building in Haringey was built in 1904. So you can just imagine the sort of
facilities they&#xA0;are. For the Metropolitan Police, the emphasis was on replacing
the old with new facilities that are seen to fit contemporary models of policing (MPS
and MPA 2007; 2010), such as with improved parking facilities and at locations away
from town centres with easier access to faster roads-the old town centre stations
being replaced by smaller neigh balanc- at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on
June 12, 2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from bourhood bases. The older
buildings can be highly valuable real estate; yet, the closure of town centre
stations that are familiar landmarks to the public is controversial. According to
McLaughlin (2008: 266), at fault is an emphasis on police performance management
which has 'systematically disassembled the "structures of feeling" and traditions
associated with the Dixonian policing model [and] this includes the asset stripping
of multi-functional "blue lamp" police stations'.<component x="93.0" y="62.12"

reference_score="12.67">From this resource-focused, managerialist and modernist
standpoint, community feeling for police stations is an inconvenience to progress
rather than a central requirement. Yet, despite this, many traditional stations
survive within the Metropolitan Police. In some London boroughs, high property prices
and lack of suitable and available land for development preclude the implementation
of a new police estate strategy; as a representative from the Metropolitan Police's
Resource Management (asset utilization) put it, 'at this point in time, I&#xA0;don't
see how we can deliver the generic model for Westminster, simply because you aren't
going to find the sites to do it'. The current economic downturn and
government-imposed budget cuts have changed police priorities. Many forces have
recognized that closing stations and neighbourhood bases may be a quick way of
cutting budgets. For instance, according to the BBC, Essex Police are closing the
front desks at 21 police stations, Lancashire Police is closing 14 stations during
2012 and Surrey Police has sold or is selling up to 13 of its stations (BBC Online
2011 ; 2011 ; 2011 ). For Surrey Police, this cost-cutting choice is intended to abc
'ensure an extra 200 frontline police officers' (BBC Online 2011 ). From a
reassurance perspective, I&#xA0;would suggest such a policy is misguided. However, it
is also true that not all police stations are reassuring places and would not
necessarily be missed. Drawing on the three forces included in the study, three
approaches to police station architecture are identified, these being: police station
as fortress; police station as secret; and police station as public building. These
aspects are considered in turn, before conclusions are drawn on the prospects for
truly public and reassuring police stations. Police Station as&#xA0;Fortress As
noted, criminology has long been interested in social control aspects of
architecture. Much emphasis has been on prison as exemplar of controlling or
disciplining architecture, but other institutions are similarly there to control and
this is expressed in their architecture; as Foucault (1977: 228)&#xA0;famously put
it: 'Is it surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, barracks, hospitals,
which all resemble prisons?' Maybe some police stations can be added to this list.
Drawing on Foucault (1977), Bentham's (1791) panoptic prison is sometimes seen as an
ultimate expression of social control and has been used by some as a metaphor for
CCTV surveillance (see Coleman and McCahill 2011) and for wider aspects of security
and surveillance (Davis 1990). Transferring this to the police station, the result is
the station as secure fortress designed to provide the police with maximum security
and surveillance of the community. In the UK, this model was most dramatically
realized with the bunkering and securitization of c at Universidade Federal de Minas

being 'accessible, friendly and welcoming'-or, to use Ellin's (1997) words, an
architecture of fear. And, for places outside the gaze of the watch towers, CCTV,
checkpoints and military patrols filled many of the gaps in what Azaryahu (2000) has
described for the Israeli context as an all-encompassing securityscape. Such examples

reassurance for some. Under more peaceful conditions, this would seem less likely;
yet, for many Western urban centres, terrorism threats have meant that security has
become a defining discourse (e.g. Coaffee 2000; Sorkin 2008; Graham 2010). On a more
prosaic level, defence can be integral to police stations in order to counter
everyday threats. For instance, according to an interviewee from the Metropolitan
Police's Property Services, the entrance can be designed with security in mind: . . .
in London, the traditional police station was built with steps up to the front door
and it was designed for three bodies to stand next to each other to stop the drunken
hordes on a Friday night going up the stairs. Once inside a police station, the size,
layout and design of the front counter space can add to the feeling of a
fortress-that the public are a low priority and should be kept away. Security
requirements have often led to counters having full screens physi12 cally dividing
the public from the police (or police-employed front-counter clerk). According to a
member of the Metropolitan Police's Property Services, 'we aspire to being as open as
we can be, but then we have to balance that off with the security of colleagues'. The
dilemma between opting for security or openness is summarized by an interviewee from
the Home Office Design Policy Team: . . . well, first of all, you do want people to
come in because the police rely on the support of the public, and you know, it might
be that they're coming to report an incident or can give some infor mation, so it's
got to be the right thing to do to try and attract people. Once they're in the
building, again, you want to make it appear welcoming. But the balance that you're
having to strike is, some times, you get people come in who, perhaps, have got a
grievance and are likely to, perhaps, cause problems. So it's really trying to
establish how you balance those two conflicting issues together, isn't&#xA0;it? There
is a clear need for security for those working at the police station; yet, security
does not have to compromise reassurance. Spaces outside the polfice station have also
got security considerations. For instance, according to af representative of
Metropolitan Police Resource Management, 'ideally, we like a certain amount of
stand-off around a building, obviously, because you need that to ensure the security
of the site'. Since Irish terrorist attacks on London in the 1990s (fCoaffee 2000),
and the more recent al-Qaeda-linked bombings of July 2005, the capital hfas witnessed
increased securitization (Coaffee et&#xA0;al. 2009), especially surrounding selected

Loughborough Police Station in Leicestershire. The station is at the end of a long,
straight cul- desac on the periphery of the town centre-a building of nondescript
modernist construction best described as a box with a large radio mast on top (see
Figure&#xA0;1). The public entrance is visible, yet public parking is restricted and
the station's location makes for a less than ideal public welcome. My reading of the

Loughborough Police Station (left) and Redditch Police Station (right) was as a
fortress with off icers released in twos to deal with local problems. Yet, according
to an off icer at the station, the location is also not ideal operationally- police
stations should not be at the end of a cul- de-sac, as, without an alternative exit,
it would not take a great deal of strategically placed public disorder to dis able
the town's policing capabilit y. A&#xA0;representative from the Metropolitan Police's
Resource Management made a similar point that 'We can't take on cul- de-sac loca
tions, because you have to have a secondary access route in case the f irst one is
unavailable for some reason'. Redditch Police Station (West Mercia Police) is another
particularly unattractive modernist building. My first impression of this station was
as a grey characterless box on the edge of a supermarket car park (also shown in
Figure&#xA0;1). Efforts have been made to improve its public image with the
construction of a new public entrance with canopy and DDA-compliant ramped access.
Yet, my reading of the design was that public access is not the priority, with the
entrance tucked into a corner of the building (compare the public entrance to the
service entrance next door). Furthermore, the railings for the new access ramp
provide a muddled way&#xA0;in. In the current fiscal climate, replacing such
buildings with new-builds is less of an option. However, with a bit more imagination,
both Loughborough and Redditch could 13 as a Station Manager interviewed at Redditch
become reassuring, public buildings; put it, 'you can tidy these buildings up with a
little bit of thought. I&#xA0;am a great believer in flair, and I&#xA0;feel that
we've lost flair at the moment'. This Station Manager makes an important point: that
the solution does not have to be disposal or demolition-that, with the right
designers/architects on board, existing structures can be reinvented. That said, some
stations would require a lot of reinvention. For instance, according to a public
respondent in the IPPR study (Rogers and Houston 2004: 2), 'I think they've designed
it [the police station] on purpose to be as impersonal as possible. It's not a
friendly place'. Another respondent commented about visiting a station: 'I feel like
I&#xA0;was being punished as well.' For police stations to contribute to public
reassurance, 13 Although their locations might still be less than ideal. such
sentiments ought to be taken seriously. 1103 at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais

as&#xA0;Secret The second aspect to police station architecture is 'police station as
secret'. This has as much to do with location and operating issues as to do with
specific design considerations; and some police property is kept deliberately away
from the public gaze. As noted, the Metropolitan Police has introduced non-public
access Patrol Bases that are kept away from the public. Some specialist policing
units also need to be anonymous; for instance, according to a member of the
Metropolitan Police Property Services, 'what we've found, in terms of designing
buildings and thinking about implications of terrorism, is that anonymity is as
important as protecting buildings'. Yet, some police property that is intended to be
public is secret more by accident. An example is the opening of a new shop-front
neighbourhood base by West Mercia Police in Warndon, a suburban estate on the
outskirts of Worcester (see Figure&#xA0;2). The Estates Manager who was interviewed
noted that the public just did not know where the previous office was: We've got
people in there saying 'oh it's nice that the police have got a base here now'. Well
we say, 'actually, we've had a base here for the last fifteen years', and it was
literally just round the corner. But it was round the corner, up on the first floor
of an office block, so you didn't tend to see us that much. So just the mere fact of
a shop front with 'police' written across it has made a difference. However, having a
shop-front presence is not in itself enough for the public to realize the police
presence. In the case of Warndon, according to the Force Estates Manager interviewed,
'The front counter is only open if an officer is there. We don't actually say we're
open for business x-hours a day'. The lack of consistent advertised opening hours
does not help a strategy of reassurance-a problem also identified for the Japanese
system of neighbourhood bases known as hood bases in the Metropolitan Police (Millie
2010). A&#xA0; phone was provided on the outside of the building for emergencies;
otherwise, any visitor would have to take a chance on whether an officer was present
to answer their queries-although, according to the Estates Manager, 'it is very
obvious when the officers are there at shift changeovers, or if they're just going in
for rest'. According to a Station Manager interviewed at Worcester Police Station,
such neighbourhood bases 'because they're so small, they're not intended as a sort of
mini police station. They're intended as a place for police officers to work out of
the community'. However, if a neighbourhood base is designed to look like a shop,
then it would be sensible to operate as a shop and have consistency of opening-and
this needs to be public knowledge-rather than as simply a base for koban (Leishman
2007) and for neighbour- at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12,
2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from changing shifts. This is not
primarily an architectural issue; however, it contributes to the visibility or
invisibility of the building. A further example is provided by Leicestershire Police,
in this case a small shop-front office in the village of Castle Donington-since
closed as part of the current financial cutbacks (see Figure&#xA0;2). An officer
based at Castle Donington made the following observation: I mean, I&#xA0; went to an
old lady's house a few days ago. She goes to the hairdresser's next door, and
I&#xA0;said, 'well actually, next door to where you have your hair done is the police
station.' And although, I&#xA0;mean, you would think it's fairly obvious.
I&#xA0;suppose that some people have busy lives and, one thing and another, it's, you
know, how well known is the actual station? 1104<component x="93.0" y="62.12"

front Police Stations at Warndon Worcester (left) and Castle Donington (right)
According to the Manager of a nearby police station: . . . a lot of people in Castle
Donington, I&#xA0;think, don't even know that that's a police station which is quite
interesting . . . I&#xA0;think it's a flat fa&#xE7;ade, and it's a question of, you
know, we haven't quite got the old oil burning lamp outside to the front. The blue
lamp may not be too significant; however, one small design issue that could be
important is the use of vertical blinds that block the view of the office inte rior
(clearly shown in Figure&#xA0;2 for both Warndon and Castle Donington-the photos
taken while the stations were open). This at first seems a trivial issue; yet, to
return to the criteria for police buildings laid down by the Home Office (2005: 8),
the blinds signal an office space that is the opposite to being 'accessible, friendly
and welcoming to the public'. Furthermore, as Heverin notes (Dyckhoff 2009), good
public buildings ought to be characterized by 'transparency and porosity'. The simple
closing of the blinds means this is not likely to be how the public 'read' the
buildings. It is a common problem (see Millie 2010). Police Station as
Public&#xA0;Building There is a dilemma in designing a police station: on the one
hand, a station has to be a hard place, it has to have security and containment, and
yet, on the other hand, there is a softer focus, that it has to be somewhere where
the public will want to visit and will want to report crimes or seek advice, they
will want to come in. Furthermore, a police station needs to be located so that it is
accessible to the public. Many new-build stations have been build in out-of-town
locations to improve public access by car and to provide greater parking for police
vehicles. One such example is the West Mercia Police Station at Leominster, opened in
2007 (see Figure&#xA0;3). The building is ideally located for vehicular access on an
out-of-town industrial park. It is also well signposted. Yet, my first impression of
the new station was its isolation. Not only is architecture important for creating
meaning, but also the building's spatial context, in this case its location in a
quiet industrial park. By moving away from the town centre, the station also lost the
possibility of being a reassuring presence in the heart of the&#xA0;town. 1105 at
Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12,
2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from Fig. 3 Out-of-Town Police Station
at Leominster, West Mercia Police Such out-of-town developments borrow from retail
practices of the past 30-40&#xA0;years (Thomas and Bromley 1993) where firms opted
for cheaper rents, larger premises and easier car access, over the restrictions of
having town centre shops. However, more recent retail developments have seen a return
to the High Street. For instance, at one time, the grocery giant Tesco had largely
left the High Street in favour of developing out-of-town supermarkets. More recently,
the company identified that growth lay in opening mini-supermarkets, branded as
'Tesco Metro' and 'Tesco Express', which, over the past 10&#xA0;years, have appeared
on most High Streets in Britain. In terms of pub lic reassurance and visibility, the
police would benefit by learning from the retail sector and maintaining (or
reinvesting) in some form of High Street presence. However, for Leicestershire
Police, the current financial squeeze has led to the closure of some High Street
stations. The model of policing attempted by the Metropolitan Police is promising,
where out-of-town facilities are supplemented by neighbourhood bases (Tesco Express?)
and some traditional stations (Tesco Metro?). The difference between this and the
Tesco model is that the Metropolitan Police's out-of-town facilities are not public
access, and not all the neighbourhood bases are consistently open to the public.
Another area of learning from retail is in branding. West Mercia Police has opted for
the internationally recognized simple chequerboard motif, clearly visible for
Redditch Police Station in Figure&#xA0;1 and Leominster in Figure&#xA0;3. For
Leicestershire Police, simplicity of signage was also identified as an issue.
According to their Estates Manager: We used to go along the route of relatively small
plaques that said things like, you know, 'New Parks Local Policing Unit'. Well,
unless you were really working closely with the police, what does a 'Local Policing
Unit' mean? So we tried to move then from that to a sign that said, in fairly bold
letters, 'Police'. For the small market town of Evesham, West Mercia Police took
quite a different approach. Instead of having a dedicated police station, the police
have gone into partnership with the County, District and Town Councils and Job Centre
Plus, in providing a one-stop-shop for the town-the Evesham Community Contact Centre
(see Figure&#xA0;4). This is a refurbished former magistrates' court and police
station. The 'back stage' policing functions are housed in a new building located in
the back yard. However, the 'front stage' functions are carried out by counter staff
who also deal 1106 at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12,
2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from Fig. 4 Evesham Community Contact
Centre with local council issues. According to a Manager working from the Evesham
Contact Centre: We've got six desks. Any customer coming in can go to any of those
desks and, regardless of the person serving them, can report either a police
incident, pay their council tax, arrange to have refuse collected, housing issue,
benefits issue, or it could be something to do with the Town Council about cemeteries
or, you know, issues to do with the mayor or local things. So it works very well. Our
busiest days, we have about a thousand people through. The Centre advertises regular
opening hours and staffing costs are split between the partners. Once data-sharing
protocols were agreed, a simple IT system was installed where, according to the
Centre Manager, 'We have access to their [police] systems as well, so we tend to
flick between our own District/County systems and West Mercia systems'. If someone
wants or needs to speak to a police officer, one can be called from the offices
located in the back&#xA0;yard. As for the design of the Centre, the only indication
that it deals with police matters is the traditional blue lamp hung from the outside
wall. While exterior signage could be improved, Evesham is an example of creative
reinvention of an existing building. Once inside, my impression of the front-counter
space was that it was more akin to contemporary banking practice, more welcoming and
softer than a standard police station. According to a Manager at the centre, this is
a dramatic change from the old station: I think a lot of people used to find, when
they went into the old reception . . . it was just the old building, the feeling, you
felt almost as if you'd done something wrong as soon as you stepped through the door,
you know? The feeling of the new front-counter space is quite different. For
instance, there is free internet access, the space is fully carpeted and access is
DDA-compliant (see Figure&#xA0;4). This softer approach is also applied to the use of
language. For instance, instead of having 'interview rooms', these are labelled
'meeting rooms'-a simple change that may make people feel more at ease. Furthermore,
the counters only have partial protective glazing. According to the Manager
interviewed, 'we've deliberately gone for no glass; 1107 at Universidade Federal de
Minas Gerais on June 12, 2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from just very
slight sort of screens. And it really is what the customers prefer. [There is] very
little problem with aggression, here, from customers'. Counter staff have panic
buttons if necessary. In other stations that have opted for partial or no protective
screens, quick-release shuttering is also available as a further
protective&#xA0;option. How such a softer approach would work for a station where
there is, for instance, a busy night-time economy is less certain. It is acknowledged
that usage and clientele characteristics of police stations may well change with time
of day or day of week. However, during normal opening hours, the one-stop-shop model
is especially useful for people making enquiries where it is not clear who has
responsibility; as the Manager noted, 'people don't know where to go with them, you
know? Neighbour nuisance, is it, is it a police issue or is it a housing issue?' The
approach adopted in Evesham may not be suitable in all situations; however, the
effect is one where the building is more clearly a public building. Conclusions As
noted, the study's aims were modest and exploratory: to draw on theoretical and
empirical evidence to consider whether police stations are a worthwhile area of
criminological/architectural study, and to investigate the possibility that police
stations could contribute to public reassurance. What this article has hopefully
demonstrated is that the police estate can make for interesting criminological and
architectural study. Furthermore, evidence is presented that police stations could
contribute to reas surance; yet, to do this, there has to be a rethink for many
existing stations in terms of what these buildings communicate. It is acknowledged
that improvements to police stations will only be one aspect of a policy of
reassurance. If reassurance is to mean more than image management, then perhaps it
ought to be integral to activity, from call handling and media and internet presence
through to the policing of marginal groups and public order. As an officer working on
a strategy trial of 'reassurance policing' put it, it ought to be a golden thread
running through all policing (Millie and Herrington 2005: 54). Reassurance is clearly
not a priority when certain populations are disproportionately policed, or when there
is police corruption. Fundamental changes in such policing styles and attitudes may
have a bigger impact on reassurance. However, a refocus on police stations as a
reassuring presence in the community can only help with such a policy-and is an area
of policy and academic enquiry that has been largely overlooked. In this article,
examples of fortress-like police stations have been given with the result that the
police can be 'read' as an intimidating presence in the community, rather all
policing at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12,
2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from than as reassuring. Furthermore,
other stations are effectively secret, with poorly advertised opening hours, or
anonymous identities that cannot contribute to public reassurance. Drawing on
architectural practice, it was suggested that truly public buildings are
characterized by 'transparency and porosity' and that this is possible for police
stations. This can be through architectural and design changes that emphasize the
public entrance, or where the boundary between street and station is blurred so that
the building becomes the opposite of intimidating. Transparency and porosity could
also be improved by thinking about police station location, or providing a range of
facilities including a High Street presence (the Tesco model?). Furthermore, it could
be through building new stations in architectural styles appropriate for their
setting. An example is a rural station at Peterchurch (West Mercia Police), built in
2005 as a contemporary 1108<component x="89.0" y="62.12" width="454.46"

them welcome. Halloween we've had kids knocking on the door "trick or treating".
I&#xA0;mean that's, I&#xA0;think it's quite nice that they feel they can do that'.
Transparency and porosity are enhanced by improved signage and also through refitting
or redesigning the front-counter spaces so they are more welcoming. Key to any
attempt at making police stations more reassuring to the public (and to getting more
members of the public through the door) is finding out how people about their local
station. According to an interviewee from the Home Office Design Policy Team,
'Looking at the perception of the building to the public, it's not really something
that we've really engaged with, and I'm just wondering whether, of the projects that
we do, whether that should be something'. I&#xA0; suggest that it should. There is
some consultation and, according to a representative from the Metropolitan Police
Resource Management: . . . it's not a charade . . . it's not quite saying to the
public, 'What would you like us to do?', because in certain boroughs, the answer
would be, 'Nothing, go away and leave us alone'. . . . but what you can say is, 'This
is what we would like to do, we're interested in your views about it'. If there are
serious issues that we're overlooking, for example, then we need to know about that.
If the public response is genuinely 'go away and leave us alone', then the police
ought to be asking 'why'? Clearly, how local populations are policed is critical to
answering this question; however, what this article has demonstrated is that meaning
can also be transmitted by police station architecture. The author David Peace asked
'have you ever seen a police station that wasn't intimidating?' Yet, there are
stations that appear welcoming and, at a time of budget cuts, a policy of police
station closure might be short-sighted. By taking seriously meanings attached to
stations, and by learning from good practice, it would be possible to facilitate a
shift in how policing is understood and acted out within communities. For CABE (2006:
4), a prerequisite for good public buildings is that they can 'lift your spirits'.
This has to be possible for police stations, which could then emerge as symbols of
reassurance in the community. This is surely preferable to stations as symbols of
control and intimidation. What is now needed is research that considers the views of
police station architects. More importantly, the next stage would be to consult the
views of the public reassuring and 'lift your spirits'. on police stations as
fortress, secret or as public buildings, and whether stations can be feel at

Access publication 13 September 2012 POLICE STATIONS, ARCHITECTURE AND PUBLIC
REASSURANCE Andrew&#xA0;Millie* Architecture has for many years been of interest to
criminology in terms of its role in social control and crime prevention. This article
focuses on architecture as reassurance and the specific example of the police
station-what is an under-researched topic. Supporting evidence is presented from a
study of police stations in three English police forces. The study's aims were modest
and exploratory, to draw on theoretical and empirical evidence to consider whether
police stations are a worthwhile area of criminological/architectural study, and to
investigate the possibility that police stations could contribute to public
reassurance. Using the language of semiotics, the article argues that meanings
attached to police stations can contribute to reassurance by affecting people's
emotive 'readings' of security and safety; yet, to do this, there has to be a rethink
for many existing stations in terms of what these buildings communicate. The article
adopts an interpretivist view of meaning acknowledging that buildings can mean
different things to different people. It is suggested that numerous police stations
can be read as intimidating fortresses; many others are secret places; while others
are potentially public buildings where the public are welcomed. Implications for a
policy of reassurance are discussed in light of the current cuts to police budgets.
An agenda for further systematic research is suggested. Keywords: architecture,
police stations, reassurance, semiotics Introduction Over the past decade, there have
been calls for British policing to be a more reassuring presence in the community
(Innes 2007; Millie and Herrington 2005; Millie 2010). 'Reassurance policing' was
born as an approach to encourage positive encounters between police and public and to
foster greater police 'visibility, accessibility and familiarity' (Povey 2001: 17).
One way the police could achieve this was to respond positively to populist calls for
'more bobbies on the beat' and, by 2008, dedicated Neighbourhood Policing Teams were
allocated across the whole of England and Wales (HMIC 2008). However, by 2010, the
political and fiscal climate had changed, with demands for budgetary cuts and
reductions in police numbers (HMIC 2011; Millie and Bullock 2012). 52, 1092-1112 at
Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12,
2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from This new 'age of austerity' has
meant high police numbers are no longer an&#xA0;option. The focus of this article is
a part of policing that is largely overlooked by policing and criminological
research: the police station. The police estate is also a target for budgetary cuts;
yet, it is argued that selling police stations could be short-sighted. Furthermore,
in the current economic climate, they may be sold too cheaply. Instead, it is argued
that, rather than closing stations, police stations could emerge as symbols of
reassurance in the community. The Audit Commission (1999: 1)&#xA0;has previously
claimed<component x="92.97" y="125.56" width="450.49" height="541.51" page="1"

reference_score="10.38">that 'Police stations are a visible form of reassurance for
the public'. In their current form, this is somewhat optimistic, as not all police
stations can be classed as reassuring. As a way of illustration, the following is
taken from an interview on BBC's (1 August 2009)&#xA0; by Denise Mina with the author
David Peace. The discussion Show was about a setting used for his series of books on
the Yorkshire Ripper: the Red Riding Millgarth Police Station in Leeds: Peace: W ell
that's the Millgarth, the Millgarth Police Station which obviously was, you know, the
place where the Ripper enquiry was based. And in the book it becomes, you know, a
central location for the characters in the novels, as it was for the real policemen.
And it was just, I&#xA0;was going to say it's an intimidating building, but
I&#xA0;mean I've never, I&#xA0;mean have you ever seen a police station that wasn't
intimidating? Mina: But it is really; no that's particularly intimidating. And it's
like the arrow slit windows and the, Yeah it's, er, medieval Leeds. Peace: The
starting point for this article is this quotation from David Peace: '. . . have you
ever seen a police station that wasn't intimidating?' A&#xA0;few months later on the
same programme (26 November 2009), Tom Dyckhoff reported on progress with building a
new Riverside Museum in Glasgow, designed by the renowned architect Zaha Hadid.
Dyckhoff asked the Project Director Jim Heverin 'what can people expect when they go
and visit a Hadid building?'. Heverin's response was that: All of this is a
celebration of how people use and respond to buildings. Quite often for a public
building the ideas are quite simple, of actually trying to create transparency and
porosity, and bring people into the building so that you get maximum usage out of
buildings. In this article, I&#xA0;ask whether police stations are public buildings
and a reassuring presence in the community or, as Peace suggests, an intimidating
presence. Furthermore, is a police station characterized by 'transparency and
porosity' possible? The academic literature has considered the functioning of police
stations-albeit rarely-with important contributions being Holdaway's (1980;
1983)&#xA0; participant observations and Waddington's (1999) research into police
canteen sub-culture. Furthermore, McLaughlin (2008) has considered police station
closure in the context of performance management. There have been a few policy
reports on the police estate (Audit Commission 1999; Home Office 2005)&#xA0; and a
small study by the Institute for Public Policy Research (Rogers and Houston 2004).
There has been no independent academic research on the importance-or otherwise-of
police station architecture and design. This article is a small step in addressing
this omission. The focus is on The Culture at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on
June 12, 2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from emotive communication and
responses to police stations. According to Bahn (1974), police-public reassurance is
all about feelings, defining reassurance as 'the feeling of security and safety that
a citizen experiences when he sees a police officer or patrol car nearby' (Bahn 1974:
340). More recently, Innes and colleagues have focused on semiotic communication-on
what crimes and disorders signal to communities, and whether police officers provide
reassurance by acting as signals of control. According to Innes (2007: 135), the
police have 'an important role to play not just in making people safe but in making
them feel safer also'. Reassurance is thus associated people's subjective feelings of
order and security/fear of crime. Public confidence in the police is assumed to
improve if these feelings are addressed through increased visibility, accessibility
and familiarity (Millie and Herrington&#xA0;2005). 1093<component x="88.97" y="62.12"

forms-may mean different things to the same people in different circumstances. While
it is argued that architectural style can contribute to meaning, it is acknowledged
that it is only one-albeit neglected-aspect of police image and practice that can
influence people's perceptions of policing. The public face of policing is made of a
complex mix of images, encounters and expectations. For example, since the birth of
the police, a semiotic iconography has evolved involving the police station alongside
1 the chequerboard motif, the police car and (in Britain) the uniform, the colour
blue, the blue lamp, all of which are hoped to reassure the public that they are
secure and safe. Yet, negative encounters or attitudes may have a detrimental
influence on reassurance. In the police station context, perception can be influenced
by how a building is experienced or how its occupants are viewed. If the police are
viewed as repressive, then the police station may be viewed as repressive, no matter
what architectural style. Police (mis)conduct will also have a bearing on how the
police are 'read'. From recent British history, the cases of Stephen Lawrence (Foster
et&#xA0; al. 2005) and Ian Tomlinson (Greer and McLaughlin 2012), and the alleged
police corruption that has emerged from the Leveson inquiry into press standards
(Nicoll 2011), may all have an influence on individuals' images of the police,
perhaps more so than any official attempts at 'reassurance'. The article is
structured as follows. After describing the methodology, meanings attached to
architecture are examined with particular focus on the police station. Relationships
between buildings and users are considered and how buildings are divided into
different spaces, with particular reference to Holdaway's (1980) notion of 'front
stage' and 'back stage' spaces within the police station. The article then draws on
empirical evidence for the use and interpretation of police station buildings. Three
approaches to police station architecture are identified and examined in turn, these
being: police station as fortress; police station as secret; and police station as
public 2 at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12,

own meanings. Although this leads to wide variety in interpretations, readers can be
grouped into three overlapping populations for study-these being designers/architects
of buildings, practitioner users and commissioners of buildings, and public users of
buildings. For this article, the focus is on practitioner users and commissioners of
police buildings. It is acknowledged that this is a limitation and views from wider
publics and from designers/architects will be important for future research. However,
the study's aims were more modest and exploratory, to draw on theoretical and
empirical evidence to consider whether police stations are a worthwhile area of
criminological/architectural study, and to investigate the possibility that police
stations could contribute to public reassurance. The study aimed to set an agenda for
further systematic research where wider public perspectives would shed more light on
the subject. The study's focus on practitioner users and commissioners is a useful
start, as it is this group that has the biggest influence on estate policy, and then
has to manage police stations on a day-to-day&#xA0;basis. Semi-structured interviews
were conducted with key police personnel in each force, including representatives
from Estate Services, station managers, civilian front-counter clerks and police
officers. A&#xA0;representative of the Home Office Design Policy Team was also
interviewed. Sixteen people were interviewed in total, each identified through
standard snowballing techniques. All interviews were recorded, transcribed,
anonymized and analysed for key and emerging themes. The data gained from the
interviews were supported by site observations, including study visits to each police
force area and the formation of a photographic database. The stations visited
represented a range of size, function and location. It is acknowledged that the
author's own judgments influenced interpretation. Where this is the case, or where a
practitioner's view is presented, I&#xA0;have been explicit. Evidence is presented
that, for quite a few police stations, architecture and design seem to conspire to
make the public a low priority rather than a central requirement; and, in some cases,
the buildings appear to be designed to repel the public rather than to reassure. Yet
others are more promising and are buildings where the public might be more welcome.
Background: Police Stations and a Search for&#xA0;Meaning Architecture has been an
important consideration for criminology, most notably as an element of social control
(e.g. Foucault 1977; Cohen 1985; Armstrong and McAra 2006), or as aid for crime
prevention (e.g. Jeffery 1971; Newman 1972; Hopper and Droge 2005). Both aspects are
relevant here; however, this article develops the idea of architecture as
reassurance. Key to this are emotional responses and meanings attached to police
stations. Semiotics is a useful way to try to understand sign-values of buildings. It
is a (post)structuralist idea which Eco (1979: 7)&#xA0;defined as 'concerned with
everything that can be taken as a sign'. As noted, buildings can mean different
things to different people and so an interpretivist view of semiotics is adopted,
that reading architecture is subjective. While (most) architecture communicates
function, how this function is read can vary. Furthermore, other meanings are read
informed by individual experience and expectation. For some, emotional responses to
buildings are viewed in terms of topophilia or 'love of place' ( Bachelard 1969; Tuan
1974). For others (e.g. Thrift 2004; Kraftl and Adey 2008), it makes sense to focus
on affect; 1095 at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12,
2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from as Thrift (2004: 57)&#xA0; has put,
it: 'Cities may be seen as rolling maelstroms of affect. Particular affects such as
anger, fear, happiness and joy are continually on the boil, rising here, subsiding
there.' Architecture can clearly contribute to love of place and to such affect.
Aesthetics is similarly relevant, the sensory feeling that, according to Tuan (1993:
1), 'is suggested even more by its opposite, anesthetic, "lack of feeling"- the
condition of living death'. It is quite possible that some police stations have an
anaesthetic&#xA0;quality. Thus, how we read architecture is subjective and we can
have different interpretations. Yet, these interpretations are influenced by a number
of factors, not least the power dynamics of architecture, building use and the
position of reader as powerful or powerless, as Markus (1993) has put it: A
building's form, function and space each has meanings in the field of social
relations, each is capable of signifying who we are, to ourselves, in society and in
the cosmic scheme of things. And each speaks of both power and bond relations.
(Markus 1993:&#xA0;30) Examples of architecture as power can include certain
religious buildings, factories and schools that express power through building
material, choice of architectural style, ornamentation or their size. Victorian
municipal buildings, courthouses, prisons and principle railway stations were
similarly designed with power in mind. Power was expressed through not only
architecture, but also building use and location which dominated local-and sometimes
national or even global-physical and psychic landscapes (Foucault 1977; Markus 1993).
Power is important for police stations and, as shall be discussed, they can be very
intimidating places. For the design of police stations, some power is clearly held by
the architect, but more so by those doing the commissioning in outlining various
requirements that have to be adhered to (this may or may not 3 To quote Gottdiener:
be influenced by public consultation). The production of buildings always involves an
articulation between the instrumentality of power and/or profit taking and aesthetic
design practises that express the sign function of the producers. Implicit in this
practice may also be designs composed with a particular consumer in mind. (Gottdiener
1995:&#xA0;12) In architectural discourse and practice, emphases on symbolic
communication and representation may come and go; however, according to Hirsch
(2006), they are back on the agenda: On the one hand architects tend to focus on the
material, organising matter, afraid of connotations, narration, anxious to leave the
safety of architectural language. But there is a-maybe still vague- suspicion that
representation is back. (Hirsch 2006:&#xA0;19) For contemporary architecture, how a
building is read can be as important as what it does-for instance, with talk of
apartment blocks, hotels, shopping malls and stadia 4 Key proponents of at

not enjoy-nor necessarily need-such high-profile architects; yet, what a police
station means is still an important consideration and, with some encouragement,
police stations might more easily represent 'reassurance'. According to an
interviewee from the Metropolitan Police's Public Services Construction, 'if we raise
the profile of buildings, we could raise our presence in the community and raise
public reassurance'. Rogers and Houston (2004) took the view that the traditional
station was already a signal of reassurance: 'The familiar town centre police station
was designed to make the police force both visible and legible. It was an effective
symbol of security and order' (Rogers and Houston 2004: 4). Yet, in Britain, the
police estate comprises a ragtag collection of architectural styles, for example,
including: Victorian gothic revival (e.g. Blyth, Northumbria Police, 1896); art deco
(e.g. Bishopsgate, City of London, 1939); post-war modernism (e.g. Paddington Green,
Metropolitan Police, 1971); 5 (e.g. Bolton Divisional Headquarters, built by John
Laing for Greater post-modern 6 ), 2006);&#xA0;and Manchester Police under PFI
(Private Finance Initiatives contemporary (e.g. Lewisham, Metropolitan Police, built
by John Laing under PFI, 7 ). 2003 Stations are also built for varying purposes
ranging from shop-front offices through to divisional headquarters. It is debatable
whether all these buildings communicate the same&#xA0;meaning. In Britain, the recent
political context for police stations has been the emergence of PFI, the New Labour
Government's endorsement of design quality through the 8 Commission for Architecture
and the Built Environment (CABE), a design review process and the general promotion
of 'better public buildings' (DCMS 2000; CABE 2006). Good design was seen to be
'about providing buildings and spaces that are fit for purpose, built to last and
lift your spirits' (CABE 2006: 4), and both CABE and the Home Office provided project
'enablers' to help public bodies achieve this. Yet, despite greater emphasis on
design quality, having a new-build police station was no guarantee of architectural
quality. For instance, according to a member of the Home Office Design Policy Team:
It's true to say that some forces, I&#xA0;think, don't give enough thought to getting
the right architects. You can go out there and get an architect by whatever means,
you know, perhaps you know somebody, towards engaging the right architect. Yellow

and&#xA0;User According to the West Mercia Police Estates Manager who was
interviewed, their estate includes 'headquarters, BCU [Basic Command Unit]; each BCU
will have a number of section stations . . . . And they will then have, yeah, what
we've broadly described as Neighbourhood Policing Posts'. Leicestershire Police has a
similar structure, with, according to an Estates Manager interviewed at their
headquarters: You've got your headquarters . . . your BCU, your Basic Command Unit .
. . and then below that you have your local policing unit, so your LPUs, and then we
would have the smaller sort of beat offices, the sort of more Neighbourhood Policing
Offices. With this variety in mind, what is a police station? Buildings can be
conceptualized as a series of spaces and an understanding of space is clearly
important to architectural theory (e.g. Bachelard 1969; Hillier and Hanson 1984;
Lefebvre 1991). For instance, buildings are divided into spaces that have different
access, functions or normative rules and expectations. Buildings also sit within
wider spaces with which they interact, affecting emotional responses and semiotic
meaning attributed to them. Drawing on Goffman's (1969) dramaturgical perspective,
Holdaway (1980) described the police station as a divide between 'front stage' and
'back stage' spaces. The back stage consists of all non-public functions such as
offices, custody suite, canteen, locker rooms, meeting/ interview rooms and so on
(not all stations will have all these functions). Permission is required for public
access to the back stage. The front stage is the space where the public is permitted
and consists of the 'shop front', entrance and counter area. It is this public access
that turns a police building into a police station, with the front stage space acting
as the public face of the&#xA0;station. Alongside members of the public wanting to
report crimes or seek advice, another user group for the station consists of those
reporting for bail, solicitors and others on official duties. In some stations, there
is functional blurring, with the front coun ter used for legal and bail reporting
alongside public enquiries. In other stations, bail reporting is via a separate
entrance that bypasses this public space. The quality and design of the counter area
will have an important impact on public reassur ance; yet, public areas are often
cramped, dominated by security screens dividing the 'front stage' from the 'back
stage', have long queues and lack privacy ( FitzGerald . 2002). Continuing the
theatrical metaphor, the front counter area will add to a et&#xA0;al positive-or
negative-experience in the same way that, for a well-designed theatre, the foyer and
the building itself are a continuation of the theatrical experience and communicate
that the public are welcome and will have a good night out. In fact, in the retail
sector, architecture and design have been used frequently as theatre, to send a
specific message to the customer. An example is in banking, where historically the
building has communicated an aesthetic of 'solidity, wealth and respectability'
(Doyle 2004: 84), often through use of neoclassical styles. Similarly, a
well-designed retail shop front blurs boundaries between shop and street and is
characterized by 'transparency and porosity' so as to entice the passing shopper and
make them feel welcomed and at ease. A&#xA0;simple example is given by Doyle (2004:
84)&#xA0;of a shop that repositioned its entrance from the side to the front of the
building: 'After the reno vations, the store proudly welcomed its customers through
large double doors posi tioned centrally to the front of the shop. This new door
proclaims a number of things 1098 at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12,
2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from about the company. It is more open,
more accessible.' The question is whether this is possible for a police&#xA0;station.
According to Home Office guidance on Design Quality for Police Buildings (2005: 8),
good police buildings should 'be a pleasure to use, visit and look at' and 'meet
public needs'. In order to achieve this, police buildings must: 9 be accessible,
friendly and welcoming to the public, including the disabled, ing openness and
security taking account of the threat level help the public feel protected and that
the police are part of their community [and] help the police to feel proud of their
service. (Home Office 2005: 8) Within this list, how the public and the police 'feel'
is clearly important. Yet, there are seemingly conflicting meanings attributed to
police buildings which need to be 'friendly and welcoming', but also signifying
'security', protection at the same time as being 'part of their community'. What's
more, the buildings need to be something of which the police feel proud. Further
requirements are for 'having the right site' and for being 'operationally efficient'.
It is an ambitious list. For the police station to be a reassuring presence in the
community, the criteria of being 'accessible, friendly and welcoming' are clearly
important. As noted, each of the force's estates has a range of building styles and
age. For instance, according to an Estates Manager for West Mercia Police: . . . 35
per cent of our buildings are under 15&#xA0;years old, 41 per cent are 15 to
40&#xA0;years, and 24 per cent are over 40&#xA0;years old. . . . In that 'over
40&#xA0;years old' bracket we do have a number that are over a hundred
years&#xA0;old. The West Mercia estates strategy was to replace these very old
stations, as they were deemed 'not fit for purpose'. Similarly, according to a
representative from the Metropolitan Police Property Services: . . . we have roughly
six hundred buildings across the estate, and that's both territorial policing and
main policing. Of that building stock, about thirty-five percent predates 1935, and
the majority of that thirty-five percent are the police stations. . . . the youngest
building in Haringey was built in 1904. So you can just imagine the sort of
facilities they&#xA0;are. For the Metropolitan Police, the emphasis was on replacing
the old with new facilities that are seen to fit contemporary models of policing (MPS
and MPA 2007; 2010), such as with improved parking facilities and at locations away
from town centres with easier access to faster roads-the old town centre stations

buildings can be highly valuable real estate; yet, the closure of town centre
stations that are familiar landmarks to the public is controversial. According to
McLaughlin (2008: 266), at fault is an emphasis on police performance management
which has 'systematically disassembled the "structures of feeling" and traditions
associated with the Dixonian policing model [and] this includes the asset stripping
of multi-functional "blue lamp" police stations'.<component x="93.0" y="62.12"

reference_score="12.67">From this resource-focused, managerialist and modernist
standpoint, community feeling for police stations is an inconvenience to progress
rather than a central requirement. Yet, despite this, many traditional stations
survive within the Metropolitan Police. In some London boroughs, high property prices
and lack of suitable and available land for development preclude the implementation
of a new police estate strategy; as a representative from the Metropolitan Police's
Resource Management (asset utilization) put it, 'at this point in time, I&#xA0;don't
see how we can deliver the generic model for Westminster, simply because you aren't
going to find the sites to do it'. The current economic downturn and
government-imposed budget cuts have changed police priorities. Many forces have
recognized that closing stations and neighbourhood bases may be a quick way of
cutting budgets. For instance, according to the BBC, Essex Police are closing the
front desks at 21 police stations, Lancashire Police is closing 14 stations during
2012 and Surrey Police has sold or is selling up to 13 of its stations (BBC Online
2011 ; 2011 ; 2011 ). For Surrey Police, this cost-cutting choice is intended to abc
'ensure an extra 200 frontline police officers' (BBC Online 2011 ). From a
reassurance perspective, I&#xA0;would suggest such a policy is misguided. However, it
is also true that not all police stations are reassuring places and would not
necessarily be missed. Drawing on the three forces included in the study, three
approaches to police station architecture are identified, these being: police station
as fortress; police station as secret; and police station as public building. These
aspects are considered in turn, before conclusions are drawn on the prospects for
truly public and reassuring police stations. Police Station as&#xA0;Fortress As
noted, criminology has long been interested in social control aspects of
architecture. Much emphasis has been on prison as exemplar of controlling or
disciplining architecture, but other institutions are similarly there to control and
this is expressed in their architecture; as Foucault (1977: 228)&#xA0;famously put
it: 'Is it surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, barracks, hospitals,
which all resemble prisons?' Maybe some police stations can be added to this list.
Drawing on Foucault (1977), Bentham's (1791) panoptic prison is sometimes seen as an
ultimate expression of social control and has been used by some as a metaphor for
CCTV surveillance (see Coleman and McCahill 2011) and for wider aspects of security
and surveillance (Davis 1990). Transferring this to the police station, the result is
the station as secure fortress designed to provide the police with maximum security
and surveillance of the community. In the UK, this model was most dramatically
realized with the bunkering and securitization of c at Universidade Federal de Minas

being 'accessible, friendly and welcoming'-or, to use Ellin's (1997) words, an
architecture of fear. And, for places outside the gaze of the watch towers, CCTV,
checkpoints and military patrols filled many of the gaps in what Azaryahu (2000) has
described for the Israeli context as an all-encompassing securityscape. Such examples

reassurance for some. Under more peaceful conditions, this would seem less likely;
yet, for many Western urban centres, terrorism threats have meant that security has
become a defining discourse (e.g. Coaffee 2000; Sorkin 2008; Graham 2010). On a more
prosaic level, defence can be integral to police stations in order to counter
everyday threats. For instance, according to an interviewee from the Metropolitan
Police's Property Services, the entrance can be designed with security in mind: . . .
in London, the traditional police station was built with steps up to the front door
and it was designed for three bodies to stand next to each other to stop the drunken
hordes on a Friday night going up the stairs. Once inside a police station, the size,
layout and design of the front counter space can add to the feeling of a
fortress-that the public are a low priority and should be kept away. Security
requirements have often led to counters having full screens physi12 cally dividing
the public from the police (or police-employed front-counter clerk). According to a
member of the Metropolitan Police's Property Services, 'we aspire to being as open as
we can be, but then we have to balance that off with the security of colleagues'. The
dilemma between opting for security or openness is summarized by an interviewee from
the Home Office Design Policy Team: . . . well, first of all, you do want people to
come in because the police rely on the support of the public, and you know, it might
be that they're coming to report an incident or can give some infor mation, so it's
got to be the right thing to do to try and attract people. Once they're in the
building, again, you want to make it appear welcoming. But the balance that you're
having to strike is, some times, you get people come in who, perhaps, have got a
grievance and are likely to, perhaps, cause problems. So it's really trying to
establish how you balance those two conflicting issues together, isn't&#xA0;it? There
is a clear need for security for those working at the police station; yet, security
does not have to compromise reassurance. Spaces outside the polfice station have also
got security considerations. For instance, according to af representative of
Metropolitan Police Resource Management, 'ideally, we like a certain amount of
stand-off around a building, obviously, because you need that to ensure the security
of the site'. Since Irish terrorist attacks on London in the 1990s (fCoaffee 2000),
and the more recent al-Qaeda-linked bombings of July 2005, the capital hfas witnessed
increased securitization (Coaffee et&#xA0;al. 2009), especially surrounding selected

Loughborough Police Station in Leicestershire. The station is at the end of a long,
straight cul- desac on the periphery of the town centre-a building of nondescript
modernist construction best described as a box with a large radio mast on top (see
Figure&#xA0;1). The public entrance is visible, yet public parking is restricted and
the station's location makes for a less than ideal public welcome. My reading of the

Loughborough Police Station (left) and Redditch Police Station (right) was as a
fortress with off icers released in twos to deal with local problems. Yet, according
to an off icer at the station, the location is also not ideal operationally- police
stations should not be at the end of a cul- de-sac, as, without an alternative exit,
it would not take a great deal of strategically placed public disorder to dis able
the town's policing capabilit y. A&#xA0;representative from the Metropolitan Police's
Resource Management made a similar point that 'We can't take on cul- de-sac loca
tions, because you have to have a secondary access route in case the f irst one is
unavailable for some reason'. Redditch Police Station (West Mercia Police) is another
particularly unattractive modernist building. My first impression of this station was
as a grey characterless box on the edge of a supermarket car park (also shown in
Figure&#xA0;1). Efforts have been made to improve its public image with the
construction of a new public entrance with canopy and DDA-compliant ramped access.
Yet, my reading of the design was that public access is not the priority, with the
entrance tucked into a corner of the building (compare the public entrance to the
service entrance next door). Furthermore, the railings for the new access ramp
provide a muddled way&#xA0;in. In the current fiscal climate, replacing such
buildings with new-builds is less of an option. However, with a bit more imagination,
both Loughborough and Redditch could 13 as a Station Manager interviewed at Redditch
become reassuring, public buildings; put it, 'you can tidy these buildings up with a
little bit of thought. I&#xA0;am a great believer in flair, and I&#xA0;feel that
we've lost flair at the moment'. This Station Manager makes an important point: that
the solution does not have to be disposal or demolition-that, with the right
designers/architects on board, existing structures can be reinvented. That said, some
stations would require a lot of reinvention. For instance, according to a public
respondent in the IPPR study (Rogers and Houston 2004: 2), 'I think they've designed
it [the police station] on purpose to be as impersonal as possible. It's not a
friendly place'. Another respondent commented about visiting a station: 'I feel like
I&#xA0;was being punished as well.' For police stations to contribute to public
reassurance, 13 Although their locations might still be less than ideal. such
sentiments ought to be taken seriously. 1103 at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais

as&#xA0;Secret The second aspect to police station architecture is 'police station as
secret'. This has as much to do with location and operating issues as to do with
specific design considerations; and some police property is kept deliberately away
from the public gaze. As noted, the Metropolitan Police has introduced non-public
access Patrol Bases that are kept away from the public. Some specialist policing
units also need to be anonymous; for instance, according to a member of the
Metropolitan Police Property Services, 'what we've found, in terms of designing
buildings and thinking about implications of terrorism, is that anonymity is as
important as protecting buildings'. Yet, some police property that is intended to be
public is secret more by accident. An example is the opening of a new shop-front
neighbourhood base by West Mercia Police in Warndon, a suburban estate on the
outskirts of Worcester (see Figure&#xA0;2). The Estates Manager who was interviewed
noted that the public just did not know where the previous office was: We've got
people in there saying 'oh it's nice that the police have got a base here now'. Well
we say, 'actually, we've had a base here for the last fifteen years', and it was
literally just round the corner. But it was round the corner, up on the first floor
of an office block, so you didn't tend to see us that much. So just the mere fact of
a shop front with 'police' written across it has made a difference. However, having a
shop-front presence is not in itself enough for the public to realize the police
presence. In the case of Warndon, according to the Force Estates Manager interviewed,
'The front counter is only open if an officer is there. We don't actually say we're
open for business x-hours a day'. The lack of consistent advertised opening hours
does not help a strategy of reassurance-a problem also identified for the Japanese
system of neighbourhood bases known as hood bases in the Metropolitan Police (Millie
2010). A&#xA0; phone was provided on the outside of the building for emergencies;
otherwise, any visitor would have to take a chance on whether an officer was present
to answer their queries-although, according to the Estates Manager, 'it is very
obvious when the officers are there at shift changeovers, or if they're just going in
for rest'. According to a Station Manager interviewed at Worcester Police Station,
such neighbourhood bases 'because they're so small, they're not intended as a sort of
mini police station. They're intended as a place for police officers to work out of
the community'. However, if a neighbourhood base is designed to look like a shop,
then it would be sensible to operate as a shop and have consistency of opening-and
this needs to be public knowledge-rather than as simply a base for koban (Leishman
2007) and for neighbour- at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12,
2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from changing shifts. This is not
primarily an architectural issue; however, it contributes to the visibility or
invisibility of the building. A further example is provided by Leicestershire Police,
in this case a small shop-front office in the village of Castle Donington-since
closed as part of the current financial cutbacks (see Figure&#xA0;2). An officer
based at Castle Donington made the following observation: I mean, I&#xA0; went to an
old lady's house a few days ago. She goes to the hairdresser's next door, and
I&#xA0;said, 'well actually, next door to where you have your hair done is the police
station.' And although, I&#xA0;mean, you would think it's fairly obvious.
I&#xA0;suppose that some people have busy lives and, one thing and another, it's, you
know, how well known is the actual station? 1104<component x="93.0" y="62.12"

According to the Manager of a nearby police station: . . . a lot of people in Castle
Donington, I&#xA0;think, don't even know that that's a police station which is quite
interesting . . . I&#xA0;think it's a flat fa&#xE7;ade, and it's a question of, you
know, we haven't quite got the old oil burning lamp outside to the front. The blue
lamp may not be too significant; however, one small design issue that could be
important is the use of vertical blinds that block the view of the office inte rior
(clearly shown in Figure&#xA0;2 for both Warndon and Castle Donington-the photos
taken while the stations were open). This at first seems a trivial issue; yet, to
return to the criteria for police buildings laid down by the Home Office (2005: 8),
the blinds signal an office space that is the opposite to being 'accessible, friendly
and welcoming to the public'. Furthermore, as Heverin notes (Dyckhoff 2009), good
public buildings ought to be characterized by 'transparency and porosity'. The simple
closing of the blinds means this is not likely to be how the public 'read' the
buildings. It is a common problem (see Millie 2010). Police Station as
Public&#xA0;Building There is a dilemma in designing a police station: on the one
hand, a station has to be a hard place, it has to have security and containment, and
yet, on the other hand, there is a softer focus, that it has to be somewhere where
the public will want to visit and will want to report crimes or seek advice, they
will want to come in. Furthermore, a police station needs to be located so that it is
accessible to the public. Many new-build stations have been build in out-of-town
locations to improve public access by car and to provide greater parking for police
vehicles. One such example is the West Mercia Police Station at Leominster, opened in
2007 (see Figure&#xA0;3). The building is ideally located for vehicular access on an
out-of-town industrial park. It is also well signposted. Yet, my first impression of
the new station was its isolation. Not only is architecture important for creating
meaning, but also the building's spatial context, in this case its location in a
quiet industrial park. By moving away from the town centre, the station also lost the
possibility of being a reassuring presence in the heart of the&#xA0;town. 1105 at
Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12,
2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from Fig. 3 Out-of-Town Police Station
at Leominster, West Mercia Police Such out-of-town developments borrow from retail
practices of the past 30-40&#xA0;years (Thomas and Bromley 1993) where firms opted
for cheaper rents, larger premises and easier car access, over the restrictions of
having town centre shops. However, more recent retail developments have seen a return
to the High Street. For instance, at one time, the grocery giant Tesco had largely
left the High Street in favour of developing out-of-town supermarkets. More recently,
the company identified that growth lay in opening mini-supermarkets, branded as
'Tesco Metro' and 'Tesco Express', which, over the past 10&#xA0;years, have appeared
on most High Streets in Britain. In terms of pub lic reassurance and visibility, the
police would benefit by learning from the retail sector and maintaining (or
reinvesting) in some form of High Street presence. However, for Leicestershire
Police, the current financial squeeze has led to the closure of some High Street
stations. The model of policing attempted by the Metropolitan Police is promising,
where out-of-town facilities are supplemented by neighbourhood bases (Tesco Express?)
and some traditional stations (Tesco Metro?). The difference between this and the
Tesco model is that the Metropolitan Police's out-of-town facilities are not public
access, and not all the neighbourhood bases are consistently open to the public.
Another area of learning from retail is in branding. West Mercia Police has opted for
the internationally recognized simple chequerboard motif, clearly visible for
Redditch Police Station in Figure&#xA0;1 and Leominster in Figure&#xA0;3. For
Leicestershire Police, simplicity of signage was also identified as an issue.
According to their Estates Manager: We used to go along the route of relatively small
plaques that said things like, you know, 'New Parks Local Policing Unit'. Well,
unless you were really working closely with the police, what does a 'Local Policing
Unit' mean? So we tried to move then from that to a sign that said, in fairly bold
letters, 'Police'. For the small market town of Evesham, West Mercia Police took
quite a different approach. Instead of having a dedicated police station, the police
have gone into partnership with the County, District and Town Councils and Job Centre
Plus, in providing a one-stop-shop for the town-the Evesham Community Contact Centre
(see Figure&#xA0;4). This is a refurbished former magistrates' court and police
station. The 'back stage' policing functions are housed in a new building located in
the back yard. However, the 'front stage' functions are carried out by counter staff
who also deal 1106 at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12,
2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from Fig. 4 Evesham Community Contact
Centre with local council issues. According to a Manager working from the Evesham
Contact Centre: We've got six desks. Any customer coming in can go to any of those
desks and, regardless of the person serving them, can report either a police
incident, pay their council tax, arrange to have refuse collected, housing issue,
benefits issue, or it could be something to do with the Town Council about cemeteries
or, you know, issues to do with the mayor or local things. So it works very well. Our
busiest days, we have about a thousand people through. The Centre advertises regular
opening hours and staffing costs are split between the partners. Once data-sharing
protocols were agreed, a simple IT system was installed where, according to the
Centre Manager, 'We have access to their [police] systems as well, so we tend to
flick between our own District/County systems and West Mercia systems'. If someone
wants or needs to speak to a police officer, one can be called from the offices
located in the back&#xA0;yard. As for the design of the Centre, the only indication
that it deals with police matters is the traditional blue lamp hung from the outside
wall. While exterior signage could be improved, Evesham is an example of creative
reinvention of an existing building. Once inside, my impression of the front-counter
space was that it was more akin to contemporary banking practice, more welcoming and
softer than a standard police station. According to a Manager at the centre, this is
a dramatic change from the old station: I think a lot of people used to find, when
they went into the old reception . . . it was just the old building, the feeling, you
felt almost as if you'd done something wrong as soon as you stepped through the door,
you know? The feeling of the new front-counter space is quite different. For
instance, there is free internet access, the space is fully carpeted and access is
DDA-compliant (see Figure&#xA0;4). This softer approach is also applied to the use of
language. For instance, instead of having 'interview rooms', these are labelled
'meeting rooms'-a simple change that may make people feel more at ease. Furthermore,
the counters only have partial protective glazing. According to the Manager
interviewed, 'we've deliberately gone for no glass; 1107 at Universidade Federal de
Minas Gerais on June 12, 2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from just very
slight sort of screens. And it really is what the customers prefer. [There is] very
little problem with aggression, here, from customers'. Counter staff have panic
buttons if necessary. In other stations that have opted for partial or no protective
screens, quick-release shuttering is also available as a further
protective&#xA0;option. How such a softer approach would work for a station where
there is, for instance, a busy night-time economy is less certain. It is acknowledged
that usage and clientele characteristics of police stations may well change with time
of day or day of week. However, during normal opening hours, the one-stop-shop model
is especially useful for people making enquiries where it is not clear who has
responsibility; as the Manager noted, 'people don't know where to go with them, you
know? Neighbour nuisance, is it, is it a police issue or is it a housing issue?' The
approach adopted in Evesham may not be suitable in all situations; however, the
effect is one where the building is more clearly a public building. Conclusions As
noted, the study's aims were modest and exploratory: to draw on theoretical and
empirical evidence to consider whether police stations are a worthwhile area of
criminological/architectural study, and to investigate the possibility that police
stations could contribute to public reassurance. What this article has hopefully
demonstrated is that the police estate can make for interesting criminological and
architectural study. Furthermore, evidence is presented that police stations could
contribute to reas surance; yet, to do this, there has to be a rethink for many
existing stations in terms of what these buildings communicate. It is acknowledged
that improvements to police stations will only be one aspect of a policy of
reassurance. If reassurance is to mean more than image management, then perhaps it
ought to be integral to activity, from call handling and media and internet presence
through to the policing of marginal groups and public order. As an officer working on
a strategy trial of 'reassurance policing' put it, it ought to be a golden thread
running through all policing (Millie and Herrington 2005: 54). Reassurance is clearly
not a priority when certain populations are disproportionately policed, or when there
is police corruption. Fundamental changes in such policing styles and attitudes may
have a bigger impact on reassurance. However, a refocus on police stations as a
reassuring presence in the community can only help with such a policy-and is an area
of policy and academic enquiry that has been largely overlooked. In this article,
examples of fortress-like police stations have been given with the result that the
police can be 'read' as an intimidating presence in the community, rather all
policing at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12,
2015http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from than as reassuring. Furthermore,
other stations are effectively secret, with poorly advertised opening hours, or
anonymous identities that cannot contribute to public reassurance. Drawing on
architectural practice, it was suggested that truly public buildings are
characterized by 'transparency and porosity' and that this is possible for police
stations. This can be through architectural and design changes that emphasize the
public entrance, or where the boundary between street and station is blurred so that
the building becomes the opposite of intimidating. Transparency and porosity could
also be improved by thinking about police station location, or providing a range of
facilities including a High Street presence (the Tesco model?). Furthermore, it could
be through building new stations in architectural styles appropriate for their
setting. An example is a rural station at Peterchurch (West Mercia Police), built in
2005 as a contemporary 1108<component x="89.0" y="62.12" width="454.46"

police station. According to a front-counter clerk working at this station, 'we make
them welcome. Halloween we've had kids knocking on the door "trick or treating".
I&#xA0;mean that's, I&#xA0;think it's quite nice that they feel they can do that'.
Transparency and porosity are enhanced by improved signage and also through refitting
or redesigning the front-counter spaces so they are more welcoming. Key to any
attempt at making police stations more reassuring to the public (and to getting more
members of the public through the door) is finding out how people about their local
station. According to an interviewee from the Home Office Design Policy Team,
'Looking at the perception of the building to the public, it's not really something
that we've really engaged with, and I'm just wondering whether, of the projects that
we do, whether that should be something'. I&#xA0; suggest that it should. There is
some consultation and, according to a representative from the Metropolitan Police
Resource Management: . . . it's not a charade . . . it's not quite saying to the
public, 'What would you like us to do?', because in certain boroughs, the answer
would be, 'Nothing, go away and leave us alone'. . . . but what you can say is, 'This
is what we would like to do, we're interested in your views about it'. If there are
serious issues that we're overlooking, for example, then we need to know about that.
If the public response is genuinely 'go away and leave us alone', then the police
ought to be asking 'why'? Clearly, how local populations are policed is critical to
answering this question; however, what this article has demonstrated is that meaning
can also be transmitted by police station architecture. The author David Peace asked
'have you ever seen a police station that wasn't intimidating?' Yet, there are
stations that appear welcoming and, at a time of budget cuts, a policy of police
station closure might be short-sighted. By taking seriously meanings attached to
stations, and by learning from good practice, it would be possible to facilitate a
shift in how policing is understood and acted out within communities. For CABE (2006:
4), a prerequisite for good public buildings is that they can 'lift your spirits'.
This has to be possible for police stations, which could then emerge as symbols of
reassurance in the community. This is surely preferable to stations as symbols of
control and intimidation. What is now needed is research that considers the views of
police station architects. More importantly, the next stage would be to consult the
views of the public reassuring and 'lift your spirits'. on police stations as
fortress, secret or as public buildings, and whether stations can be feel at
