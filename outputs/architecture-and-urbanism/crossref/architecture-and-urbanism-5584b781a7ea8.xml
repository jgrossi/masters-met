are becoming an increasingly common urban development concept in peri-urban areas of
South-east Asian cities. While these projects are beginning to receive academic
attention, the majority of studies have a limited capacity to explain why and how
they are produced. Most satellite cities built in the past five years have some
degree of foreign influence from other East Asian countries in terms of invested
capital, planning concepts or urban design and architecture. The majority of this
influence originates from within the East Asian region. This paper argues that an
investigation which incorporates both the relational and the territorial can
increase an understanding of the production of satellite cities. This argument is
illustrated with empirical research on two satellite city projects in Phnom Penh,
Cambodia: one by a Korean developer and another by Indonesian conglomerate Ciputra.

cities and form of inter-referenced urbanism'' as they gated communities, some of

While there are planning and design principles ''based on many similarities,
satellite cities are typically an interpretation of how a global urbanism integrate
various functions-residential, commercial and leisure-that are normally present in
an urban area. As this paper highlights, Phnom Penh is but the latest location for a
trend that permeated the larger cities of Indonesia in the 1980s and 1990s and that
has since moved into Cambodia, Vietnam and elsewhere. The growing popularity of the
satellite city concept is in part due to the increasing entrepreneurialism of urban
governance, in which a greater premium is placed on attracting private-sector
investment (Shatkin, 2011). Related to this are the relatively weak planning laws in
some South-east Asian cities which make it possible for such large urban development
projects to materialise. The trend also reflects the demand from the growing middle
classes for housing and better infrastructure, and from businesses for modern office
space in less congested areas. While the proliferation of private-sector satellite
city development is beginning to attract scholarly attention (for example, Chen et
al., 2009; Douglass and Huang, 2007; Shatkin, 2011), there has until now been a lack
of emphasis on the role of intraregional networks in the production of satellite
cities. More than a decade ago, Kris Olds suggested that it would be useful for
analysts of the UMP [urban mega project] development process in both
consumption-orientated and production- orientated projects to work with new urban
theories which focus on economic and cultural interconnections, flows, linkages, and
interdependencies (Olds, 1995, p. 1736). of a larger size and, more significantly,
they should look and function''. While the satellite cities in Indonesia were built
by domestic companies, the more recently developed projects in other South-east
Asian countries are mainly funded by intra-Asian foreign direct investment. They are
also based on models of urban design and governance practices in other Asian cities,
or they utilise best practice examples which are extracted and emulated from other
cities. The mobility of capital, concepts and expertise has been and remains central
to the process of diffusion of these urban projects throughout South-east Asia. By
examining the networks through which satellite cities are produced, this paper
exposes the diverse connections between cities. It also continues the project of
avoiding positioning cities in the North Atlantic world, at the leading edge of
urban theory and practice (Robinson, 2002). There is currently in the literature a
growing clamour for caution in applying Western-centric urban theories to cities in
other contexts. Receptive to the call from Jennifer Robinson (2002, 2006), a number
of urban scholars have appreciated the importance of considering all cities as
'ordinary' in order to post-colonialise the discipline of urban studies, thus
contributing to ''develop[ing] a more cosmopolitan account of city-ness'' (Robinson,
2002, p. 532). Robinson's (2002) fundamental argument is that there has been a
persistent and unhelpful polarisation in the field of urban studies between analyses
of global and world cities on the one hand, and developmentalist accounts on the
other.<component x="48.19" y="56.02" width="382.7" height="564.14" page="2"

lateness="0.375" reference_score="5.85">The 'ordinary city' approach aims to promote
urban theory that acknowledges the relational webs of interaction between cities and
highlights connections beyond those merely of business services. Robinson's ideas
have been amplified by a number of urbanists who have suggested that research should
approach the varied 'worlding' process of cities (Roy, 2009), and that work on
cities in the global South should not simply 'add on' case studies to existing
Western theory (McFarlane, 2008). Similar debates have been initiated within the
field of economic geography (Pollard et al., 2009). These arguments have been driven
forwards by relational comparative theorising that moves beyond ''static
theorisations of place, space and scale'' (Ward, 2010, p. 473), viewing the city as
''open and constituted in and through relations that stretch across space and are
territorialised in place'' (Ward, 2010, p. 481). While the relational is important,
it must be balanced by an understanding of place-specificities, such as how local
urban actors manage the impacts of and interact with these global/regional flows
(McCann and Ward, 2010). Researchers have begun to consider the ways in which cities
in non-Western contexts are interlinked. Such research includes Bunnell and Das'
(2010) work on urban policy transfer between Kuala Lumpur and Hyderabad, while Lowry
and McCann (2011) and Roy and Ong (2011) have written on ways in which Asian cities
are acting as models for other cities in Asia and the West. This is part of a
broader movement towards considering the 'worlding' processes of Asian cities and
the ways in which they are becoming models that are subsequently replicated
throughout the region (Roy and Ong, 2011). It is important, however, not to relocate
the problem of Western-centric essentialism by creating a new Eastern version, as
Hogan et al. (2012) have observed. Nor should it be suggested that the East Asian
region is a bounded unit. The processes of regionalisation and globalisation are
interlinked and overlapping (Ching, 2000) and, in practical terms, activities in
other parts of the world have considerable ramifications for Asia. This paper builds
on the aforementioned theoretical ideas by using the empirical example of satellite
city development in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Urban issues in Cambodia have been
under-researched compared with cities in other South-east Asian countries. Phnom
Penh is a city that was totally abandoned during the Khmer Rouge regime of 1975-79,
but has seen rapid changes in the past decade, as Cambodia has become more
integrated into the regional and global economic system. The increase in real estate
development and investment, twinned with rapid in-migration from rural areas and low
capacity for urban planning, has created many challenges for sustainable urban
development. The central city has witnessed numerous new high-rise buildings and
shopping malls, sometimes on land previously occupied by low-income housing. On the
urban edge, a number of satellite city mega projects are under construction, the two
most advanced being Camko City undertaken by World City Co. Ltd from South Korea and
Grand Phnom Penh International City by Indonesian company Ciputra. These two
projects will be discussed in detail later in the paper. However, this is not solely
a story about private-sector actors. The national state and the local state have a
role to play both in Cambodia and in the countries from which the flows of capital
and expertise originate. The empirical research draws on approximately 30 interviews
with urban planning professionals, local and national government officers,
non-governmental organisations, real estate agents and developers conducted between
October 2010 and August 2011. It also makes considerable use of data gathered from a
variety of sources including newspapers, research reports, investment statistics,
legal documents and government policies, as well as 20 shorter interviews with
people living near the two satellite cities discussed. The remainder of the paper is
divided into five parts. It begins by offering an overview of the development of
satellite cities in South-east Asia, tracing their origin and increasing popularity
as a form of urban development. The second section provides a brief overview of
recent urban development in Phnom Penh. The paper then moves on to examine the
production of satellite cities in Phnom Penh. This includes a detailed account of
the two case studies and an analysis of how they are produced. It draws attention to
the diversity of networks involved, as well as the role of local institutions.
Satellite Cities in South-east Asia The satellite cities that have been developed in
the peri-urban areas of South-east Asian cities since the 1990s differ on a number
of counts from the new towns constructed in the post-war period. Post-war new towns
were largely developed by the state and favoured no particular social class or
income group as residents (Chen et al., 2009). The new town concept, stemming
originally from the ideas of Ebenezer Howard on garden cities, became widespread in
East and South-east Asia in the cities of British colonial territories such as
Singapore, Malaysia and pre-1997 Hong Kong. Garden cities and new towns also became
a feature of cities outside Britain's direct sphere of influence such as Tokyo,
Seoul and Taipei, as well as those influenced by Soviet planning initiatives, such
as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin (Phillips and Yeh, 1987). In the city-states of
Singapore and Hong Kong, the planning of new towns was a response to population
pressure because of rapid industrialisation. These new towns- for example, Ang Mo
Kio in Singapore and Sha Tin in Hong Kong-were mainly designed to provide public
housing (Pun, 1987; Wang, 1987), only later beginning to have social services,
amenities and employment opportunities. New towns were built to provide new housing,
but also as tools for the decentralisation of urban growth in a region characterised
by primate cities, much as new towns were developed in the south-east of Britain in
the post-war period to ease housing congestion in London. The satellite cities that
form the focus of this paper are different from their garden city and new town
antecedents because they are developed by private companies on a for-profit basis.
This kind of development originated in the 1970s and represented a new type of urban
development on the edge of South-east Asian cities, originating on the periphery of
Jakarta. These settlements are generally entirely financed and planned by a single
private developer and designed for (newly) prosperous local families and
expatriates. Dick and Rimmer (1998) suggest that initially, new towns in Jakarta
developed because of the response from private land developers to a demand from the
growing middle class, especially ethnic Chinese. Integrated urban development
projects are more profitable for developers than single-purpose projects since they
incorporate several functions, including residential, business, retail, leisure and
recreation into one development where functions feed off one another to form an
aggregated urban system. The first private-sector satellite city in the Jakarta
urban agglomeration was Pondok Indah. Initiated in 1975, this 720-hectare middle-
and upper-class housing development was built on former rubber plantation land. It
was established by Ciputra in collaboration with Lim Sioe Liong (also referred to by
his Indonesian name, Sudono Salim) (Winarso, 1999). Lim, once the wealthiest
businessperson in Indonesia, was founder of the Salim Group, one of the three most
prominent Indonesian ethnic-Chinese development companies, the other two being
Ciputra Group and the Lippo Group. The Lippo Group developed satellite cities such
as Lippo Karawaci and Lippo Cikarang, two examples of the 20 or so satellite cities
over 500 hectares already constructed or approved as of 1997 (Firman, 2004). The
mega projects of the Lippo Group appear to be modelled on the design principles of
the garden city movement and the later stateplanned new towns. At the same time,
they evoke 19th-century traditions of familybased development capital working in a
somewhat unregulated environment with little contractual trust between companies
(Hogan and Houston, 2002). The Lippo Group has two main goals according to one of
the company's senior executives: to make profits from real estate development and to
design selfcontained cities which can be a model to be emulated both in Jakarta and
the wider region (Benton, 2000). Satellite city developments are commonly seen as
reinforcing spatial segregation as they shift the wealthy into scattered residential
developments. Developers rather than local governments perform urban management
tasks while the local state acts as a body for expediting the development of
satellite city projects (Zhu, 2010). In the past 10 years, the development of
private satellite cities in the peri-urban areas of South-east Asia has become
increasingly common as governments increasingly view the urban periphery as the most
appropriate arena for privatised urban growth (Leaf, 2002). Douglass and Huang
(2007) have examined a number of examples of this phenomenon that have been recently
completed or are still under construction. Phu My Hung ('Saigon South') in Ho Chi
Minh City is financed by Taiwanese developers and will cover 33 square km of land
and house one million people (see also Waibel, 2006). Na Be New Town is being built
by a Korean developer and is modelled on successful satellite cities already
constructed in Korea. The largest of the satellite city projects surrounding Ho Chi
Minh City, called the North West Metropolitan Area, is currently in the early stages
of construction. A Malaysian company is undertaking this project, which will cost an
estimated US$3 billion and will be some 18 kilometres long and 5 kilometres wide. It
is a similar picture in Hanoi, where the Indonesian developer Ciputra is building a
satellite city under the name Ciputra International City, and a Korean developer is
constructing an even larger project called An Khanh (Star World). It is worth
mentioning that private-sector-developed satellite cities are not unique to Asia.
Similar developments are located on the desert periphery of Cairo, financed by
UAE-based companies and modelled on comparable projects in Dubai (Singerman and
Amar, 2006). The process of 'Dubaisation' has infused urban development practices
throughout the Middle East and Africa, in Khartoum, Sudan and Nouakchott, Mauritania
(Choplin and Franck, 2010). Foreign companies are not behind the construction of all
satellite cities and, furthermore, smaller developments often represent more
significant drivers of change. Labbe and Boudreau (2011), in their research on
Hanoi, caution against overemphasising the imposition of 'spectacular' foreign urban
development models, arguing that such an emphasis is inappropriate because foreign
capital is behind only a small minority of satellite city projects. While much of
the extant research focuses on a select number of foreign proj ects (as mentioned
earlier), Labbe and Boudreau draw attention to the roughly 500 new residential
developments around Hanoi developed for the most part by state-owned Vietnamese
companies and with a variety of built forms, financial arrangements and target
populations. In and around Phnom Penh, many large residential developments have
appeared over the past decade, normally built by local Cambodian-Chinese
enterprises. However, most of these are solely residential estates. The two most
advanced examples of mixed-use 'satellite city' projects are Camko City and Grand
Phnom Penh International City, which are used as the primary case studies in this
paper. Because Phnom Penh is smaller than most other South-east Asian capitals (it
has a population of less than two million), satellite cities form an even more
significant feature of its urban landscape. It is apparent that satellite cities are
becoming a common phenomenon throughout the region. As already shown, what started
in Jakarta has spread throughout the Asian region from Hanoi and Phnom Penh to
Kolkata. This paper, in agreement with Shatkin (2011), first, seeks to argue that
urban networks are central to their development. Such networks may consist of
capital investment, the movement of particular architectural, urban design or
governance styles, or the reification of the imagined qualities of certain
'paradigmatic' cities. Kolkata West International City, for example, is financed
through a joint venture between Salim Group and Ciputra of Indonesia and Universal
Success Enterprises Ltd of Singapore. Secondly, certain urban design styles are
replicated, often as a result of the involvement of consultants. Surbana, a spin-off
company of Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority, works on satellite city
masterplanning in various countries, exporting the urban development knowledge
accrued at home. Thirdly, specific cities are deemed successful and replicated in
other contexts. Citra Raya, another Ciputra project, is located in Surabaya. The
city is marketed as a 'miniSingapore', capitalising on the city-state's image as
wealthy, modern and liveable. The urban landscape is planted with trees and public
space is adorned with Singapore icons such as statues of the Merlion and Stamford
Raffles. Although the concept and design may be evocative of American suburbia and
gated communities, the production process is firmly grounded within East Asia. In
this sense, there is need for a revision of Dick and Rimmer's (1998) argument that
in the age of globalisation there is a convergence in urban form between South-east
Asian cities and those in the West. On the simplest level, satellite city urban form
borrows heavily from the style of American gated communities. In the case of the
Lippo Group, it has been said that this is because the head of the company, James
Riady, spent time in California whilst studying for a graduate business degree
(Silver, 2008). However, a deeper examination of the production of East Asian
satellite cities requires a more thorough look beyond urban form towards the
networks through which they are produced. Phnom Penh's Recent Development Our
particular focus in this paper is on Phnom Penh, where a number of satellite city
projects have been proposed or are currently under construction. The two major
satellite cities funded by foreign investors are Camko City and Grand Phnom Penh
International City, developed respectively by Korean (World City Co. Ltd) and
Indonesian (Ciputra Group) companies, the latter acting in partnership with a local
Cambodian company. These projects are<component x="49.61" y="49.81" width="185.39"

peri-urban districts of Sensok and Russei Keo (Figure 1). Camko City is located on
the very edge of the existing built-up area of Phnom Penh city, whilst Grand Phnom
Penh International City is situated 5 km further north. Another satellite city,
built by a local company, Overseas Cambodian Investment Corporation and known as
Chrouy Changvar City of the Future, was recently given approval by the government.
There are also approximately 90 housing developments (known as borei in Khmer) being
undertaken by local companies (Municipality of Phnom Penh, 2011a). These are not all
'gated communities' and many are targeted at lower- and middleincome buyers. Some of
them are very large, up to 2000 hectares, such as Borei Santepheap III and AZ City.
The development of satellite cities is set in the context of Cambodia's political
economy and changing position in global capital networks. During the 1990s,
political instability linked to the remaining Khmer Rouge factions and the 1997
fighting between the Cambodian People's Party and 3 meant that there were only
FUNCINPEC, small investments in urban development. There was little pressure on land
and prices thus remained mostly very low. Yet between 2004 and 2007, the price of
land in central Phnom Penh increased exponentially from around US$250 to US$2000 per
square metre (GTZ, 2009). This increase was due to a combination of interrelated
factors. The elections of 2003 gave way to a period of relative political stability
(Albritton, 2004). Talk of political stability gave the cue to foreign investors
that now was the time to put money into Cambodia, where there was the potential for
higher returns than could be had in more developed countries. This was augmented by
the fact that tighter regulations in financial centres such as Singapore resulted in
capital flowing to places with looser legal environments such as Cambodia, where the
government was receptive to foreign direct investment (FDI). According to the most
recent data, China is the largest source of FDI in Cambodia, with investments worth
US$893 million in 2009, while Korea was the largest foreign investor in Cambodia in
2006 and 2008, with figures of US$1.009 billion and US$1.237 billion respectively
(KOTRA, 2010). In terms specifically of real estate and urban development capital,
South Korea heads the rankings. Real estate and construction accounted for 71 per
cent of the total South Korean investment during 2010 (KOTRA, 2010). Concurrently,
wealthy Cambodians began to bring back money stored in overseas bank accounts
(Cambodia Daily, 2005). Land is seen as one of the very few secure places in which
to invest money in a country where suspicion of the banking system remains and where
speculation has been widespread. In 2008 the global economic crisis began to have an
impact on Cambodia's urban development, although it primarily affected projects
financed by foreign investors. Real estate prices fell, economic growth slowed and
banks began to restrict loans for developers and customers as global capital markets
slowed down. Many of the projects announced in the boom period were either cancelled
(for example, GS Engineering and Construction's (E&amp;C) International Financial
Centre), put on hold (POSCO E&amp;C's Star River condominiums) or paused mid-way
through construction (Gold Tower 42). All of these three were Korean developments.
Although the city centre has changed spectacularly with the construction of shopping
malls and high-rise buildings, much of the new development has occurred in periurban
areas. In terms of population growth, the outer four districts experienced an
increase of between 90 per cent and 180 per cent in the decade from 1998 to 2008.
Meanwhile, all but one of the central districts saw a small decline in population
(Municipality of Phnom Penh, 2011b). This population growth in peri-urban areas is
due to new housing developments, garment factory worker accommodation and the
relocation of poor urban communities from the centre to the periphery of the city.
In 2009, 72 per cent of poor urban families were living in the four outer districts,
up from 50 per cent in 1997 (STT, 2009). Between 1990 and 2011, 30 000 families
(accounting for about 150 000 people) in Phnom Penh were displaced (STT, 2011),
two-thirds of them since 2000. As the former paddy fields around Phnom Penh have
been sold for development, the government has expanded the boundary of the
municipality to encompass districts of Kandal province in an attempt to improve
urban planning (Phnom Penh Post, 2010a). Land prices in peri-urban areas peaked in
2006-08 at approximately $200-250 per square metre, while in 2011 the price had
fallen to around half that level (Phnom Penh Post, 2011), still a big increase from
a decade earlier when land values were just a few dollars per square metre. The
drivers of peri-urbanisation in Phnom Penh are clearly similar to those in other
major cities in the South-east Asian region: land at lower prices and unclear and
weak spatial planning policies (Hudalah et al., 2007; Webster, 2002).<component

lateness="0.8125" reference_score="7.57">Camko City Camko City is a $2 billion
project, planned to cover 120 hectares when, and if, all phases are constructed as
originally intended. The concept originated from a visit by several Korean
businesspeople to Cambodia in the mid 2000s. They felt that there was no suitable
office space for global businesses. At the time, most companies were located in
converted villas or small office buildings, and they were often subject to
electricity cuts and monsoon season flooding. Opinion was mobilised behind the
construction of a modern office district with high-quality infrastructure located
outside the congested city centre. Hence the company's name 'World City Company' and
the slogan branding Camko City as ''the first global city in Phnom Penh''.
Commercial space is the primary objective, but related to this is the construction
of luxury houses and apartments, as well as leisure facilities, an international
school and a hospital. Camko City was designated as a 'Financial Development
District', a type of special economic zone with incentives from the Ministry of
Commerce to attract financial industries, especially those from Korea. Cambodia's
new stock exchange was originally planned for Camko City but is now due to open in
Canadia Tower, the first high-rise office building in central Phnom Penh, because of
delays in Camko City's construction. In addition to the main investment and project
management company, Landmark World-wide, Camko City involves a roll call of related
Korean companies in financing (Shinhan Bank and Busan Sangho Bank), construction
(Hanil), construction management (Korea Power Engineering Company) and
infrastructure planning (Yooshin). Urban design and architecture were undertaken by
K2A, a company based in Hong Kong. The international consultancy company AECOM,
which has offices in most large cities in the region, was employed to conduct a
market assessment and positioning study in Phnom Penh. At the time of writing
(October 2011), the first phase, consisting of villas, townhouses and several high-
and mid-rise condominiums, has been completed. Despite the fact that there are over
1000 units completed and they are 90 per cent sold out (interview, Camko City
management), it is apparent that these sales have been mainly speculative as only
150 families are living there. In mid 2010, the government passed a new law to
deregulate the property market by allowing foreigners to own property above the
first floor of a building, up to a maximum limit of 70 per cent foreign ownership in
one particular development (Phnom Penh Post, 2010b). Since then, approximately 30
per cent of the high-rise units in Camko City have been sold to foreigners, mainly
from Korea and Singapore. Villas and townhouses are bought principally by wealthy,
high-ranking government officials and business people. The cost of condominiums
ranges from $150 000 to $300 000, while landed properties range from $200 000 to
well over $500 000 for the larger villas. Most of the condominiums are bought as
investments to rent and are advertised at around $600-800 per month. Grand Phnom
Penh International City Located nearby is Grand Phnom Penh International City, a
260-hectare development undertaken through a joint venture between Ciputra Group of
Indonesia and the YLP Group of Cambodia. Within the joint venture, YLP Group
initially owned and prepared the land, while Ciputra is responsible for the design,
planning and construction. Surbana designed an underground infrastructure system for
communications and utilities. This development is more consumptionoriented than
Camko City and is built around a large golf course. According to the master plan for
the development, it will house 4000 families upon completion and contain facilities
such as schools, a hospital, water amusement park, hotel, shopping mall and office
buildings. As of 2011, approximately 200 houses and the golf course have been
completed since the project's inception in 2007 (interview, planner, Ciputra).
Ciputra do not anticipate completing the project until at least 2020. Prices range
from $100 000 for the smallest houses ('Sicily') to over $600 000 for the largest
property ('Chateau 3'). Only Cambodian citizens can purchase houses here as they are
landed property rather than a condominium in a co-owned building. Tracing Korean and
Indonesian Connections South Korea is the largest investor in real estate and
construction projects in Cambodia. South Korean companies were among the first to
open garment factories in the 1990s, later being pioneers in the real estate and
urban development industries. Koreans began investing in real estate projects in
2004/05, when the Korean domestic market was in a downturn (Postlewaite, 2008), and
investment increased rapidly until 2008 and the global financial crisis. Korean
projects have predominantly focused on high-rise condominium buildings as well as
Camko City. Parallelto these investment flows has been the formation of significant
Korean business networks, with at least 550 Korean companies operating in Cambodia
(KOTRA, 2010). Korean capital has been brought in through Korean banks; construction
machinery and materials have been imported from Korea with generous import tax
exemptions; and Korean construction companies, architects, engineers, surveyors and
property lawyers are working in partnership with developers. All this has resulted
in a significant migration of Korean professionals to Cambodia; estimates range from
4000 to 7000 (Phnom Penh Post, 2008). In Camko City, almost all of the materials and
construction machinery was imported from Korea. A number of factors explain the
Korean interest in urban development projects in Phnom Penh. Korean businesses were
the first to see the potential in Cambodia. The situation in Cambodia reminded them
of what they had experienced in Korea after the Korean War, when the country
developed rapidly and property prices and land values increased exponentially
(interview, Korean trade organisation official). They predicted that the same would
happen in Cambodia and they argue that their prediction was accurate, at least until
2009. On a similar note, Korea's rapid urbanisation and development meant that
Korean companies have gained considerable expertise in urban development. This is
particularly the case regarding the technologies and construction techniques
required for high-rise apartment buildings. The urban development arms of large
Korean conglomerates such as POSCO Engineering modified to fit local cultural
contexts. In the Cambodian case, the design team undertook market research and
ascertained that Cambodian buyers prefer larger houses than their Indonesian
customers (interview, planner and designer, Ciputra). They also named houses after
places in France, reflecting the country's history as a French protectorate. In
comparison with Korea, Indonesia does not have a particularly large presence in
Cambodia in terms of investment, or significant political ties. The satellite city
development is driven more by the networks of the Ciputra company itself, which has
begun diversifying its business activities overseas to Phnom Penh, as well as
Kolkata, Hanoi and Shenyang in China (Jakarta Globe, 2009). The company name
originates from that of the company founder, Ir. Ciputra (his original Chinese name
was Tjie Tjin Hoan), and still remains an ethnicChinese family business. The company
anticipates that greater profits can be had abroad (Jakarta Post, 2011). Ciputra's
regional expansion emanates from its position as one of the leading property
developers in Indonesia. Its strong position is primarily due to the company's
ability to obtain large areas of cheap rural land, along with the rights to convert
that land into urban usage. Large developers with privileged access to finance and
close political connections were able to do this (Leisch, 2002; Rimmer and Dick,
2009). Ciputra, for example, aligned itself with the Salim Group, which had close
links with President Suharto (Dieleman, 2011; Dieleman and Sachs, 2008). Local
Interactions with Regional Flows Mutually constitutive with the regional flows are
local forces, particularly the interactions with the local and national state.
national Real estate and construction is one of the government's four economic
priority areas because of its perceived potential for job creation (Hun Sen, 2008);
it accounted for 20 per cent of economic growth between 1998 and 2006 (Ear, 2008).
The Council for the Development of Cambodia is tasked with ensuring an easy passage
for potential investments as well as promoting Cambodia overseas as a destination
for foreign direct investment. Cambodia, in fact, has a very open economy. Companies
can be foreign owned in almost all sectors of the economy; there is a low corporate
tax rate (20 per cent) and profits can be freely repatriated. A draft summary of the
city's master plan, which is still in the process of being finalised, mentions
explicitly that the East Asian region is one from which capital can be mobilised.
Over 90 per cent of cross-border real estate investment in Asia originates from
within the region (CBRE, 2009). At the city scale, satellite city development has
occurred through large land acquisitions enacted through sub-decrees signed at the
highest levels of government. A satellite city project proposed by a local company
the Ly Yong Phat Group, was preceded by a sub-decree legally changing the status of
1300 hectares of land from state/public to state/private property (Cambodia Daily,
2011). Another, named Chrouy Changvar City, is being built by Overseas Cambodia
Investment Corporation on the site of a cancelled Malaysian project named Sunway
City. In this case, the national government designated the land as a 'development
zone', leaving the Municipality of Phnom Penh the task of announcing and regulating
a ban on all land sales, new construction and earthworks within the zone, as well as
compensating landowners (Municipality of Phnom Penh, 2011c). Local companies are
undertaking both these projects, although it is not clear from where all of the
financing originates. The land for Camko City was purchased by Korean investors from
two local companies who had previously prepared the land for development (interview,
Camko City management). Grand Phnom Penh International City was developed through
collaboration with the YLP Group, owned by a military family. The opaqueness of the
planning process helps the interests of wellconnected developers, a situation that
is similar to satellite city developments in Indonesia (Firman, 2000). There are a
number of challenges to effective urban planning in Phnom Penh in addition to the
rather top-down nature of project approvals alluded to in the previous paragraph. In
particular, the legal framework for urban planning has not kept up with the influx
of capital in urban development and the large size of new projects. The most
relevant piece of urban planning legislation, Sub-decree No. 86 on construction
permits, was designed for individual buildings rather than developments of the size
of an urban district. This is beginning to change with the introduction of Subdecree
No. 39 on the management of borei housing developments. This law seeks to manage the
impact of large urban development projects and covers issues such as landownership
transfers and means of avoiding environmental problems for surrounding communities.
In addition, there are many other difficulties facing urban planning in Cambodia for
which there is not sufficient space here to explore. These include the lack of
government budget and human resources for urban planning, the low priority given to
urban issues and the extent of illegal urban development. Urban development projects
are by and large decided at high levels of government before a real urban planning
process takes place at the local level. This means that the social and environmental
impacts are not fully taken into account. As has been suggested in the comparable
case of Hanoi (Montheard, 2010; DiGregorio, 2011), periurban developments such as
satellite cities can destabilise existing populations and endanger people's
livelihoods because of the wider transformation of the landscape even if no actual
displacement takes place. Satellite cities can damage the environment through the
filling-in of much-needed floodwater run-off areas. The severe flooding that
engulfed parts of central Cambodia and Thailand in the autumn of 2011 testifies to
the importance of this. While focusing on the construction of urban facilities for
the transnational rich, it is important to remain aware of the serious impact that
these have on the livelihoods of peri-urban farmers and other long-time residents.
In this paper we have focused on the processes behind these urban development
projects, but that should not lead to a neglect of underlying issues of social
displacement. Conclusions Satellite cities are becoming an ever more common feature
in the peri-urban areas of South-east Asian cities. They are significant because of
both their size and the configuration of the roles of public and private actors. In
the majority of cases, satellite cities materialise through foreign influence in
terms of financing or design, much of which originates from within the East Asian
region. The paper focused on Phnom Penh, examining Camko City and Grand Phnom Penh
International City. Methodologically, the paper sought to understand the process of
satellite city development by taking into account the relational and territorial
aspects. The development of Camko City can be partly explained by the expertise of
Korean urban development companies as well as the dense network of relations between
the two countries. Grand Phnom Penh International City, on the other hand, is less
dependent on close political relationships. It is contingent on the motivations of
the ethnic-Chinese Ciputra company to regionalise and the company's history and
experience of satellite city development in Indonesia. We attribute the energies
devoted to these urban development projects to a number of factors. The lack of
state capacity for urban planning and appetite for city building creates the
conditions in which private companies undertake urban development projects of an
enormous size. In addition, the state's failure to provide adequate urban
infrastructures encourages the private sector to move in. This caters to a growing
demand for satellite city living from middle- and upper-income groups, who are wooed
by images of a cosmopolitan lifestyle. Businesses too evince the desire to move out
of makeshift space in the city centre into the appropriately international setting
of a satellite city. At the same time, governments have become increasingly
entrepreneurial in order to attract investment from regional urban development
companies. We have shown here that much of the investment in satellite city projects
originates from within the East Asian region, including much but not all of it from
Korea and Indonesia. It is indeed predominantly from regional firms that
citybuilding expertise and experience come. This conclusion suggests the need for a
reconceptualisation of Dick and Rimmer's (1998) by-now rather dated assertion that
satellite cities represent a convergence around American styles of urbanism. In
underlining the role of regional capital and expertise, we hope to have contributed
to scholarly attempts to understand cities in East Asia on their own terms as part
of regional trends and processes and not simply through the lens of Western
theory.<component x="245.48" y="49.81" width="185.41" height="366.49" page="8"

'satellite city' throughout, but the terms 'new town', 'urban integrated mega
project', 'new urban area' and 'privatopolis' are also used by developers to refer
broadly to the same type of urban development. It is important, however, to bear in
mind that, in the academic and planning literature, the term 'new town' generally
refers to new settlements built by the state. 2. We include South-east Asia within

are becoming an increasingly common urban development concept in peri-urban areas of
South-east Asian cities. While these projects are beginning to receive academic
attention, the majority of studies have a limited capacity to explain why and how
they are produced. Most satellite cities built in the past five years have some
degree of foreign influence from other East Asian countries in terms of invested
capital, planning concepts or urban design and architecture. The majority of this
influence originates from within the East Asian region. This paper argues that an
investigation which incorporates both the relational and the territorial can
increase an understanding of the production of satellite cities. This argument is
illustrated with empirical research on two satellite city projects in Phnom Penh,
Cambodia: one by a Korean developer and another by Indonesian conglomerate Ciputra.

cities and form of inter-referenced urbanism'' as they gated communities, some of

While there are planning and design principles ''based on many similarities,
satellite cities are typically an interpretation of how a global urbanism integrate
various functions-residential, commercial and leisure-that are normally present in
an urban area. As this paper highlights, Phnom Penh is but the latest location for a
trend that permeated the larger cities of Indonesia in the 1980s and 1990s and that
has since moved into Cambodia, Vietnam and elsewhere. The growing popularity of the
satellite city concept is in part due to the increasing entrepreneurialism of urban
governance, in which a greater premium is placed on attracting private-sector
investment (Shatkin, 2011). Related to this are the relatively weak planning laws in
some South-east Asian cities which make it possible for such large urban development
projects to materialise. The trend also reflects the demand from the growing middle
classes for housing and better infrastructure, and from businesses for modern office
space in less congested areas. While the proliferation of private-sector satellite
city development is beginning to attract scholarly attention (for example, Chen et
al., 2009; Douglass and Huang, 2007; Shatkin, 2011), there has until now been a lack
of emphasis on the role of intraregional networks in the production of satellite
cities. More than a decade ago, Kris Olds suggested that it would be useful for
analysts of the UMP [urban mega project] development process in both
consumption-orientated and production- orientated projects to work with new urban
theories which focus on economic and cultural interconnections, flows, linkages, and
interdependencies (Olds, 1995, p. 1736). of a larger size and, more significantly,
they should look and function''. While the satellite cities in Indonesia were built
by domestic companies, the more recently developed projects in other South-east
Asian countries are mainly funded by intra-Asian foreign direct investment. They are
also based on models of urban design and governance practices in other Asian cities,
or they utilise best practice examples which are extracted and emulated from other
cities. The mobility of capital, concepts and expertise has been and remains central
to the process of diffusion of these urban projects throughout South-east Asia. By
examining the networks through which satellite cities are produced, this paper
exposes the diverse connections between cities. It also continues the project of
avoiding positioning cities in the North Atlantic world, at the leading edge of
urban theory and practice (Robinson, 2002). There is currently in the literature a
growing clamour for caution in applying Western-centric urban theories to cities in
other contexts. Receptive to the call from Jennifer Robinson (2002, 2006), a number
of urban scholars have appreciated the importance of considering all cities as
'ordinary' in order to post-colonialise the discipline of urban studies, thus
contributing to ''develop[ing] a more cosmopolitan account of city-ness'' (Robinson,
2002, p. 532). Robinson's (2002) fundamental argument is that there has been a
persistent and unhelpful polarisation in the field of urban studies between analyses
of global and world cities on the one hand, and developmentalist accounts on the
other.<component x="48.19" y="56.02" width="382.7" height="564.14" page="2"

lateness="0.375" reference_score="5.85">The 'ordinary city' approach aims to promote
urban theory that acknowledges the relational webs of interaction between cities and
highlights connections beyond those merely of business services. Robinson's ideas
have been amplified by a number of urbanists who have suggested that research should
approach the varied 'worlding' process of cities (Roy, 2009), and that work on
cities in the global South should not simply 'add on' case studies to existing
Western theory (McFarlane, 2008). Similar debates have been initiated within the
field of economic geography (Pollard et al., 2009). These arguments have been driven
forwards by relational comparative theorising that moves beyond ''static
theorisations of place, space and scale'' (Ward, 2010, p. 473), viewing the city as
''open and constituted in and through relations that stretch across space and are
territorialised in place'' (Ward, 2010, p. 481). While the relational is important,
it must be balanced by an understanding of place-specificities, such as how local
urban actors manage the impacts of and interact with these global/regional flows
(McCann and Ward, 2010). Researchers have begun to consider the ways in which cities
in non-Western contexts are interlinked. Such research includes Bunnell and Das'
(2010) work on urban policy transfer between Kuala Lumpur and Hyderabad, while Lowry
and McCann (2011) and Roy and Ong (2011) have written on ways in which Asian cities
are acting as models for other cities in Asia and the West. This is part of a
broader movement towards considering the 'worlding' processes of Asian cities and
the ways in which they are becoming models that are subsequently replicated
throughout the region (Roy and Ong, 2011). It is important, however, not to relocate
the problem of Western-centric essentialism by creating a new Eastern version, as
Hogan et al. (2012) have observed. Nor should it be suggested that the East Asian
region is a bounded unit. The processes of regionalisation and globalisation are
interlinked and overlapping (Ching, 2000) and, in practical terms, activities in
other parts of the world have considerable ramifications for Asia. This paper builds
on the aforementioned theoretical ideas by using the empirical example of satellite
city development in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Urban issues in Cambodia have been
under-researched compared with cities in other South-east Asian countries. Phnom
Penh is a city that was totally abandoned during the Khmer Rouge regime of 1975-79,
but has seen rapid changes in the past decade, as Cambodia has become more
integrated into the regional and global economic system. The increase in real estate
development and investment, twinned with rapid in-migration from rural areas and low
capacity for urban planning, has created many challenges for sustainable urban
development. The central city has witnessed numerous new high-rise buildings and
shopping malls, sometimes on land previously occupied by low-income housing. On the
urban edge, a number of satellite city mega projects are under construction, the two
most advanced being Camko City undertaken by World City Co. Ltd from South Korea and
Grand Phnom Penh International City by Indonesian company Ciputra. These two
projects will be discussed in detail later in the paper. However, this is not solely
a story about private-sector actors. The national state and the local state have a
role to play both in Cambodia and in the countries from which the flows of capital
and expertise originate. The empirical research draws on approximately 30 interviews
with urban planning professionals, local and national government officers,
non-governmental organisations, real estate agents and developers conducted between
October 2010 and August 2011. It also makes considerable use of data gathered from a
variety of sources including newspapers, research reports, investment statistics,
legal documents and government policies, as well as 20 shorter interviews with
people living near the two satellite cities discussed. The remainder of the paper is
divided into five parts. It begins by offering an overview of the development of
satellite cities in South-east Asia, tracing their origin and increasing popularity
as a form of urban development. The second section provides a brief overview of
recent urban development in Phnom Penh. The paper then moves on to examine the
production of satellite cities in Phnom Penh. This includes a detailed account of
the two case studies and an analysis of how they are produced. It draws attention to
the diversity of networks involved, as well as the role of local institutions.
Satellite Cities in South-east Asia The satellite cities that have been developed in
the peri-urban areas of South-east Asian cities since the 1990s differ on a number
of counts from the new towns constructed in the post-war period. Post-war new towns
were largely developed by the state and favoured no particular social class or
income group as residents (Chen et al., 2009). The new town concept, stemming
originally from the ideas of Ebenezer Howard on garden cities, became widespread in
East and South-east Asia in the cities of British colonial territories such as
Singapore, Malaysia and pre-1997 Hong Kong. Garden cities and new towns also became
a feature of cities outside Britain's direct sphere of influence such as Tokyo,
Seoul and Taipei, as well as those influenced by Soviet planning initiatives, such
as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin (Phillips and Yeh, 1987). In the city-states of
Singapore and Hong Kong, the planning of new towns was a response to population
pressure because of rapid industrialisation. These new towns- for example, Ang Mo
Kio in Singapore and Sha Tin in Hong Kong-were mainly designed to provide public
housing (Pun, 1987; Wang, 1987), only later beginning to have social services,
amenities and employment opportunities. New towns were built to provide new housing,
but also as tools for the decentralisation of urban growth in a region characterised
by primate cities, much as new towns were developed in the south-east of Britain in
the post-war period to ease housing congestion in London. The satellite cities that
form the focus of this paper are different from their garden city and new town
antecedents because they are developed by private companies on a for-profit basis.
This kind of development originated in the 1970s and represented a new type of urban
development on the edge of South-east Asian cities, originating on the periphery of
Jakarta. These settlements are generally entirely financed and planned by a single
private developer and designed for (newly) prosperous local families and
expatriates. Dick and Rimmer (1998) suggest that initially, new towns in Jakarta
developed because of the response from private land developers to a demand from the
growing middle class, especially ethnic Chinese. Integrated urban development
projects are more profitable for developers than single-purpose projects since they
incorporate several functions, including residential, business, retail, leisure and
recreation into one development where functions feed off one another to form an
aggregated urban system. The first private-sector satellite city in the Jakarta
urban agglomeration was Pondok Indah. Initiated in 1975, this 720-hectare middle-
and upper-class housing development was built on former rubber plantation land. It
was established by Ciputra in collaboration with Lim Sioe Liong (also referred to by
his Indonesian name, Sudono Salim) (Winarso, 1999). Lim, once the wealthiest
businessperson in Indonesia, was founder of the Salim Group, one of the three most
prominent Indonesian ethnic-Chinese development companies, the other two being
Ciputra Group and the Lippo Group. The Lippo Group developed satellite cities such
as Lippo Karawaci and Lippo Cikarang, two examples of the 20 or so satellite cities
over 500 hectares already constructed or approved as of 1997 (Firman, 2004). The
mega projects of the Lippo Group appear to be modelled on the design principles of
the garden city movement and the later stateplanned new towns. At the same time,
they evoke 19th-century traditions of familybased development capital working in a
somewhat unregulated environment with little contractual trust between companies
(Hogan and Houston, 2002). The Lippo Group has two main goals according to one of
the company's senior executives: to make profits from real estate development and to
design selfcontained cities which can be a model to be emulated both in Jakarta and
the wider region (Benton, 2000). Satellite city developments are commonly seen as
reinforcing spatial segregation as they shift the wealthy into scattered residential
developments. Developers rather than local governments perform urban management
tasks while the local state acts as a body for expediting the development of
satellite city projects (Zhu, 2010). In the past 10 years, the development of
private satellite cities in the peri-urban areas of South-east Asia has become
increasingly common as governments increasingly view the urban periphery as the most
appropriate arena for privatised urban growth (Leaf, 2002). Douglass and Huang
(2007) have examined a number of examples of this phenomenon that have been recently
completed or are still under construction. Phu My Hung ('Saigon South') in Ho Chi
Minh City is financed by Taiwanese developers and will cover 33 square km of land
and house one million people (see also Waibel, 2006). Na Be New Town is being built
by a Korean developer and is modelled on successful satellite cities already
constructed in Korea. The largest of the satellite city projects surrounding Ho Chi
Minh City, called the North West Metropolitan Area, is currently in the early stages
of construction. A Malaysian company is undertaking this project, which will cost an
estimated US$3 billion and will be some 18 kilometres long and 5 kilometres wide. It
is a similar picture in Hanoi, where the Indonesian developer Ciputra is building a
satellite city under the name Ciputra International City, and a Korean developer is
constructing an even larger project called An Khanh (Star World). It is worth
mentioning that private-sector-developed satellite cities are not unique to Asia.
Similar developments are located on the desert periphery of Cairo, financed by
UAE-based companies and modelled on comparable projects in Dubai (Singerman and
Amar, 2006). The process of 'Dubaisation' has infused urban development practices
throughout the Middle East and Africa, in Khartoum, Sudan and Nouakchott, Mauritania
(Choplin and Franck, 2010). Foreign companies are not behind the construction of all
satellite cities and, furthermore, smaller developments often represent more
significant drivers of change. Labbe and Boudreau (2011), in their research on
Hanoi, caution against overemphasising the imposition of 'spectacular' foreign urban
development models, arguing that such an emphasis is inappropriate because foreign
capital is behind only a small minority of satellite city projects. While much of
the extant research focuses on a select number of foreign proj ects (as mentioned
earlier), Labbe and Boudreau draw attention to the roughly 500 new residential
developments around Hanoi developed for the most part by state-owned Vietnamese
companies and with a variety of built forms, financial arrangements and target
populations. In and around Phnom Penh, many large residential developments have
appeared over the past decade, normally built by local Cambodian-Chinese
enterprises. However, most of these are solely residential estates. The two most
advanced examples of mixed-use 'satellite city' projects are Camko City and Grand
Phnom Penh International City, which are used as the primary case studies in this
paper. Because Phnom Penh is smaller than most other South-east Asian capitals (it
has a population of less than two million), satellite cities form an even more
significant feature of its urban landscape. It is apparent that satellite cities are
becoming a common phenomenon throughout the region. As already shown, what started
in Jakarta has spread throughout the Asian region from Hanoi and Phnom Penh to
Kolkata. This paper, in agreement with Shatkin (2011), first, seeks to argue that
urban networks are central to their development. Such networks may consist of
capital investment, the movement of particular architectural, urban design or
governance styles, or the reification of the imagined qualities of certain
'paradigmatic' cities. Kolkata West International City, for example, is financed
through a joint venture between Salim Group and Ciputra of Indonesia and Universal
Success Enterprises Ltd of Singapore. Secondly, certain urban design styles are
replicated, often as a result of the involvement of consultants. Surbana, a spin-off
company of Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority, works on satellite city
masterplanning in various countries, exporting the urban development knowledge
accrued at home. Thirdly, specific cities are deemed successful and replicated in
other contexts. Citra Raya, another Ciputra project, is located in Surabaya. The
city is marketed as a 'miniSingapore', capitalising on the city-state's image as
wealthy, modern and liveable. The urban landscape is planted with trees and public
space is adorned with Singapore icons such as statues of the Merlion and Stamford
Raffles. Although the concept and design may be evocative of American suburbia and
gated communities, the production process is firmly grounded within East Asia. In
this sense, there is need for a revision of Dick and Rimmer's (1998) argument that
in the age of globalisation there is a convergence in urban form between South-east
Asian cities and those in the West. On the simplest level, satellite city urban form
borrows heavily from the style of American gated communities. In the case of the
Lippo Group, it has been said that this is because the head of the company, James
Riady, spent time in California whilst studying for a graduate business degree
(Silver, 2008). However, a deeper examination of the production of East Asian
satellite cities requires a more thorough look beyond urban form towards the
networks through which they are produced. Phnom Penh's Recent Development Our
particular focus in this paper is on Phnom Penh, where a number of satellite city
projects have been proposed or are currently under construction. The two major
satellite cities funded by foreign investors are Camko City and Grand Phnom Penh
International City, developed respectively by Korean (World City Co. Ltd) and
Indonesian (Ciputra Group) companies, the latter acting in partnership with a local
Cambodian company. These projects are<component x="49.61" y="49.81" width="185.39"

peri-urban districts of Sensok and Russei Keo (Figure 1). Camko City is located on
the very edge of the existing built-up area of Phnom Penh city, whilst Grand Phnom
Penh International City is situated 5 km further north. Another satellite city,
built by a local company, Overseas Cambodian Investment Corporation and known as
Chrouy Changvar City of the Future, was recently given approval by the government.
There are also approximately 90 housing developments (known as borei in Khmer) being
undertaken by local companies (Municipality of Phnom Penh, 2011a). These are not all
'gated communities' and many are targeted at lower- and middleincome buyers. Some of
them are very large, up to 2000 hectares, such as Borei Santepheap III and AZ City.
The development of satellite cities is set in the context of Cambodia's political
economy and changing position in global capital networks. During the 1990s,
political instability linked to the remaining Khmer Rouge factions and the 1997
fighting between the Cambodian People's Party and 3 meant that there were only
FUNCINPEC, small investments in urban development. There was little pressure on land
and prices thus remained mostly very low. Yet between 2004 and 2007, the price of
land in central Phnom Penh increased exponentially from around US$250 to US$2000 per
square metre (GTZ, 2009). This increase was due to a combination of interrelated
factors. The elections of 2003 gave way to a period of relative political stability
(Albritton, 2004). Talk of political stability gave the cue to foreign investors
that now was the time to put money into Cambodia, where there was the potential for
higher returns than could be had in more developed countries. This was augmented by
the fact that tighter regulations in financial centres such as Singapore resulted in
capital flowing to places with looser legal environments such as Cambodia, where the
government was receptive to foreign direct investment (FDI). According to the most
recent data, China is the largest source of FDI in Cambodia, with investments worth
US$893 million in 2009, while Korea was the largest foreign investor in Cambodia in
2006 and 2008, with figures of US$1.009 billion and US$1.237 billion respectively
(KOTRA, 2010). In terms specifically of real estate and urban development capital,
South Korea heads the rankings. Real estate and construction accounted for 71 per
cent of the total South Korean investment during 2010 (KOTRA, 2010). Concurrently,
wealthy Cambodians began to bring back money stored in overseas bank accounts
(Cambodia Daily, 2005). Land is seen as one of the very few secure places in which
to invest money in a country where suspicion of the banking system remains and where
speculation has been widespread. In 2008 the global economic crisis began to have an
impact on Cambodia's urban development, although it primarily affected projects
financed by foreign investors. Real estate prices fell, economic growth slowed and
banks began to restrict loans for developers and customers as global capital markets
slowed down. Many of the projects announced in the boom period were either cancelled
(for example, GS Engineering and Construction's (E&amp;C) International Financial
Centre), put on hold (POSCO E&amp;C's Star River condominiums) or paused mid-way
through construction (Gold Tower 42). All of these three were Korean developments.
Although the city centre has changed spectacularly with the construction of shopping
malls and high-rise buildings, much of the new development has occurred in periurban
areas. In terms of population growth, the outer four districts experienced an
increase of between 90 per cent and 180 per cent in the decade from 1998 to 2008.
Meanwhile, all but one of the central districts saw a small decline in population
(Municipality of Phnom Penh, 2011b). This population growth in peri-urban areas is
due to new housing developments, garment factory worker accommodation and the
relocation of poor urban communities from the centre to the periphery of the city.
In 2009, 72 per cent of poor urban families were living in the four outer districts,
up from 50 per cent in 1997 (STT, 2009). Between 1990 and 2011, 30 000 families
(accounting for about 150 000 people) in Phnom Penh were displaced (STT, 2011),
two-thirds of them since 2000. As the former paddy fields around Phnom Penh have
been sold for development, the government has expanded the boundary of the
municipality to encompass districts of Kandal province in an attempt to improve
urban planning (Phnom Penh Post, 2010a). Land prices in peri-urban areas peaked in
2006-08 at approximately $200-250 per square metre, while in 2011 the price had
fallen to around half that level (Phnom Penh Post, 2011), still a big increase from
a decade earlier when land values were just a few dollars per square metre. The
drivers of peri-urbanisation in Phnom Penh are clearly similar to those in other
major cities in the South-east Asian region: land at lower prices and unclear and
weak spatial planning policies (Hudalah et al., 2007; Webster, 2002).<component

lateness="0.8125" reference_score="7.57">Camko City Camko City is a $2 billion
project, planned to cover 120 hectares when, and if, all phases are constructed as
originally intended. The concept originated from a visit by several Korean
businesspeople to Cambodia in the mid 2000s. They felt that there was no suitable
office space for global businesses. At the time, most companies were located in
converted villas or small office buildings, and they were often subject to
electricity cuts and monsoon season flooding. Opinion was mobilised behind the
construction of a modern office district with high-quality infrastructure located
outside the congested city centre. Hence the company's name 'World City Company' and
the slogan branding Camko City as ''the first global city in Phnom Penh''.
Commercial space is the primary objective, but related to this is the construction
of luxury houses and apartments, as well as leisure facilities, an international
school and a hospital. Camko City was designated as a 'Financial Development
District', a type of special economic zone with incentives from the Ministry of
Commerce to attract financial industries, especially those from Korea. Cambodia's
new stock exchange was originally planned for Camko City but is now due to open in
Canadia Tower, the first high-rise office building in central Phnom Penh, because of
delays in Camko City's construction. In addition to the main investment and project
management company, Landmark World-wide, Camko City involves a roll call of related
Korean companies in financing (Shinhan Bank and Busan Sangho Bank), construction
(Hanil), construction management (Korea Power Engineering Company) and
infrastructure planning (Yooshin). Urban design and architecture were undertaken by
K2A, a company based in Hong Kong. The international consultancy company AECOM,
which has offices in most large cities in the region, was employed to conduct a
market assessment and positioning study in Phnom Penh. At the time of writing
(October 2011), the first phase, consisting of villas, townhouses and several high-
and mid-rise condominiums, has been completed. Despite the fact that there are over
1000 units completed and they are 90 per cent sold out (interview, Camko City
management), it is apparent that these sales have been mainly speculative as only
150 families are living there. In mid 2010, the government passed a new law to
deregulate the property market by allowing foreigners to own property above the
first floor of a building, up to a maximum limit of 70 per cent foreign ownership in
one particular development (Phnom Penh Post, 2010b). Since then, approximately 30
per cent of the high-rise units in Camko City have been sold to foreigners, mainly
from Korea and Singapore. Villas and townhouses are bought principally by wealthy,
high-ranking government officials and business people. The cost of condominiums
ranges from $150 000 to $300 000, while landed properties range from $200 000 to
well over $500 000 for the larger villas. Most of the condominiums are bought as
investments to rent and are advertised at around $600-800 per month. Grand Phnom
Penh International City Located nearby is Grand Phnom Penh International City, a
260-hectare development undertaken through a joint venture between Ciputra Group of
Indonesia and the YLP Group of Cambodia. Within the joint venture, YLP Group
initially owned and prepared the land, while Ciputra is responsible for the design,
planning and construction. Surbana designed an underground infrastructure system for
communications and utilities. This development is more consumptionoriented than
Camko City and is built around a large golf course. According to the master plan for
the development, it will house 4000 families upon completion and contain facilities
such as schools, a hospital, water amusement park, hotel, shopping mall and office
buildings. As of 2011, approximately 200 houses and the golf course have been
completed since the project's inception in 2007 (interview, planner, Ciputra).
Ciputra do not anticipate completing the project until at least 2020. Prices range
from $100 000 for the smallest houses ('Sicily') to over $600 000 for the largest
property ('Chateau 3'). Only Cambodian citizens can purchase houses here as they are
landed property rather than a condominium in a co-owned building. Tracing Korean and
Indonesian Connections South Korea is the largest investor in real estate and
construction projects in Cambodia. South Korean companies were among the first to
open garment factories in the 1990s, later being pioneers in the real estate and
urban development industries. Koreans began investing in real estate projects in
2004/05, when the Korean domestic market was in a downturn (Postlewaite, 2008), and
investment increased rapidly until 2008 and the global financial crisis. Korean
projects have predominantly focused on high-rise condominium buildings as well as
Camko City. Parallelto these investment flows has been the formation of significant
Korean business networks, with at least 550 Korean companies operating in Cambodia
(KOTRA, 2010). Korean capital has been brought in through Korean banks; construction
machinery and materials have been imported from Korea with generous import tax
exemptions; and Korean construction companies, architects, engineers, surveyors and
property lawyers are working in partnership with developers. All this has resulted
in a significant migration of Korean professionals to Cambodia; estimates range from
4000 to 7000 (Phnom Penh Post, 2008). In Camko City, almost all of the materials and
construction machinery was imported from Korea. A number of factors explain the
Korean interest in urban development projects in Phnom Penh. Korean businesses were
the first to see the potential in Cambodia. The situation in Cambodia reminded them
of what they had experienced in Korea after the Korean War, when the country
developed rapidly and property prices and land values increased exponentially
(interview, Korean trade organisation official). They predicted that the same would
happen in Cambodia and they argue that their prediction was accurate, at least until
2009. On a similar note, Korea's rapid urbanisation and development meant that
Korean companies have gained considerable expertise in urban development. This is
particularly the case regarding the technologies and construction techniques
required for high-rise apartment buildings. The urban development arms of large
Korean conglomerates such as POSCO Engineering modified to fit local cultural
contexts. In the Cambodian case, the design team undertook market research and
ascertained that Cambodian buyers prefer larger houses than their Indonesian
customers (interview, planner and designer, Ciputra). They also named houses after
places in France, reflecting the country's history as a French protectorate. In
comparison with Korea, Indonesia does not have a particularly large presence in
Cambodia in terms of investment, or significant political ties. The satellite city
development is driven more by the networks of the Ciputra company itself, which has
begun diversifying its business activities overseas to Phnom Penh, as well as
Kolkata, Hanoi and Shenyang in China (Jakarta Globe, 2009). The company name
originates from that of the company founder, Ir. Ciputra (his original Chinese name
was Tjie Tjin Hoan), and still remains an ethnicChinese family business. The company
anticipates that greater profits can be had abroad (Jakarta Post, 2011). Ciputra's
regional expansion emanates from its position as one of the leading property
developers in Indonesia. Its strong position is primarily due to the company's
ability to obtain large areas of cheap rural land, along with the rights to convert
that land into urban usage. Large developers with privileged access to finance and
close political connections were able to do this (Leisch, 2002; Rimmer and Dick,
2009). Ciputra, for example, aligned itself with the Salim Group, which had close
links with President Suharto (Dieleman, 2011; Dieleman and Sachs, 2008). Local
Interactions with Regional Flows Mutually constitutive with the regional flows are
local forces, particularly the interactions with the local and national state.
national Real estate and construction is one of the government's four economic
priority areas because of its perceived potential for job creation (Hun Sen, 2008);
it accounted for 20 per cent of economic growth between 1998 and 2006 (Ear, 2008).
The Council for the Development of Cambodia is tasked with ensuring an easy passage
for potential investments as well as promoting Cambodia overseas as a destination
for foreign direct investment. Cambodia, in fact, has a very open economy. Companies
can be foreign owned in almost all sectors of the economy; there is a low corporate
tax rate (20 per cent) and profits can be freely repatriated. A draft summary of the
city's master plan, which is still in the process of being finalised, mentions
explicitly that the East Asian region is one from which capital can be mobilised.
Over 90 per cent of cross-border real estate investment in Asia originates from
within the region (CBRE, 2009). At the city scale, satellite city development has
occurred through large land acquisitions enacted through sub-decrees signed at the
highest levels of government. A satellite city project proposed by a local company
the Ly Yong Phat Group, was preceded by a sub-decree legally changing the status of
1300 hectares of land from state/public to state/private property (Cambodia Daily,
2011). Another, named Chrouy Changvar City, is being built by Overseas Cambodia
Investment Corporation on the site of a cancelled Malaysian project named Sunway
City. In this case, the national government designated the land as a 'development
zone', leaving the Municipality of Phnom Penh the task of announcing and regulating
a ban on all land sales, new construction and earthworks within the zone, as well as
compensating landowners (Municipality of Phnom Penh, 2011c). Local companies are
undertaking both these projects, although it is not clear from where all of the
financing originates. The land for Camko City was purchased by Korean investors from
two local companies who had previously prepared the land for development (interview,
Camko City management). Grand Phnom Penh International City was developed through
collaboration with the YLP Group, owned by a military family. The opaqueness of the
planning process helps the interests of wellconnected developers, a situation that
is similar to satellite city developments in Indonesia (Firman, 2000). There are a
number of challenges to effective urban planning in Phnom Penh in addition to the
rather top-down nature of project approvals alluded to in the previous paragraph. In
particular, the legal framework for urban planning has not kept up with the influx
of capital in urban development and the large size of new projects. The most
relevant piece of urban planning legislation, Sub-decree No. 86 on construction
permits, was designed for individual buildings rather than developments of the size
of an urban district. This is beginning to change with the introduction of Subdecree
No. 39 on the management of borei housing developments. This law seeks to manage the
impact of large urban development projects and covers issues such as landownership
transfers and means of avoiding environmental problems for surrounding communities.
In addition, there are many other difficulties facing urban planning in Cambodia for
which there is not sufficient space here to explore. These include the lack of
government budget and human resources for urban planning, the low priority given to
urban issues and the extent of illegal urban development. Urban development projects
are by and large decided at high levels of government before a real urban planning
process takes place at the local level. This means that the social and environmental
impacts are not fully taken into account. As has been suggested in the comparable
case of Hanoi (Montheard, 2010; DiGregorio, 2011), periurban developments such as
satellite cities can destabilise existing populations and endanger people's
livelihoods because of the wider transformation of the landscape even if no actual
displacement takes place. Satellite cities can damage the environment through the
filling-in of much-needed floodwater run-off areas. The severe flooding that
engulfed parts of central Cambodia and Thailand in the autumn of 2011 testifies to
the importance of this. While focusing on the construction of urban facilities for
the transnational rich, it is important to remain aware of the serious impact that
these have on the livelihoods of peri-urban farmers and other long-time residents.
In this paper we have focused on the processes behind these urban development
projects, but that should not lead to a neglect of underlying issues of social
displacement. Conclusions Satellite cities are becoming an ever more common feature
in the peri-urban areas of South-east Asian cities. They are significant because of
both their size and the configuration of the roles of public and private actors. In
the majority of cases, satellite cities materialise through foreign influence in
terms of financing or design, much of which originates from within the East Asian
region. The paper focused on Phnom Penh, examining Camko City and Grand Phnom Penh
International City. Methodologically, the paper sought to understand the process of
satellite city development by taking into account the relational and territorial
aspects. The development of Camko City can be partly explained by the expertise of
Korean urban development companies as well as the dense network of relations between
the two countries. Grand Phnom Penh International City, on the other hand, is less
dependent on close political relationships. It is contingent on the motivations of
the ethnic-Chinese Ciputra company to regionalise and the company's history and
experience of satellite city development in Indonesia. We attribute the energies
devoted to these urban development projects to a number of factors. The lack of
state capacity for urban planning and appetite for city building creates the
conditions in which private companies undertake urban development projects of an
enormous size. In addition, the state's failure to provide adequate urban
infrastructures encourages the private sector to move in. This caters to a growing
demand for satellite city living from middle- and upper-income groups, who are wooed
by images of a cosmopolitan lifestyle. Businesses too evince the desire to move out
of makeshift space in the city centre into the appropriately international setting
of a satellite city. At the same time, governments have become increasingly
entrepreneurial in order to attract investment from regional urban development
companies. We have shown here that much of the investment in satellite city projects
originates from within the East Asian region, including much but not all of it from
Korea and Indonesia. It is indeed predominantly from regional firms that
citybuilding expertise and experience come. This conclusion suggests the need for a
reconceptualisation of Dick and Rimmer's (1998) by-now rather dated assertion that
satellite cities represent a convergence around American styles of urbanism. In
underlining the role of regional capital and expertise, we hope to have contributed
to scholarly attempts to understand cities in East Asia on their own terms as part
of regional trends and processes and not simply through the lens of Western
theory.<component x="245.48" y="49.81" width="185.41" height="366.49" page="8"
