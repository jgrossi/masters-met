      <abstract>
        <p>Recently, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) have been increasingly isolated from veterinarians and companion animals. With a view to preventing the spread of MRSA and MRSP, we evaluated the occurrence and molecular characteristics of each in a veterinary college. MRSA and MRSP were isolated from nasal samples from veterinarians, staff members, and veterinary students affiliated with a veterinary hospital. Using stepwise logistic regression, we identified two factors associated with MRSA carriage: (i) contact with an identified animal MRSA case (odds ratio [OR], 6.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.2 to 21.6) and (ii) being an employee (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.0 to 19.4). The majority of MRSA isolates obtained from individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital and dog patients harbored spa type t002 and a type II staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), similar to the hospital-acquired MRSA isolates in Japan. MRSA isolates harboring spa type t008 and a type IV SCCmec were obtained from one veterinarian on three different sampling occasions and also from dog patients. MRSA carriers can also be a source of MRSA infection in animals. The majority of MRSP isolates (85.2%) carried hybrid SCCmec type II-III, and almost all the remaining MRSP isolates (11.1%) carried SCCmec type V. MRSA and MRSP were also isolated from environmental samples collected from the veterinary hospital (5.1% and 6.4%, respectively). The application of certain disinfection procedures is important for the prevention of nosocomial infection, and MRSA and MRSP infection control strategies should be adopted in veterinary medical practice.</p>

      <p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an
important cause of nosocomial infections in human hospitals.
The prevalence of hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA)
infection among inpatients in intensive care units (ICUs)
continues to increase steadily in Japan. Recently, cases of
community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) have been documented
in persons without an established risk factor for HA-MRSA
infection (14, 32, 36, 49).</p>
      <p>There has also been an increase in the number of reports of the
isolation of MRSA from veterinarians and companion animals (5,
21, 23–26, 28, 31, 34, 38, 44, 50, 51, 53). Values reported for the
prevalence of MRSA among veterinary staff include 17.9% in the
United Kingdom (21), 10% in Japan (38), 3.9% in Scotland (13),
and 3.0% in Denmark (28). Loeffler et al. reported that the
prevalence of MRSA among dog patients and healthy dogs
owned by veterinary staff members was 8.9% (21). In Japan, an
MRSA isolate was detected in only one inpatient dog (3.8%) and
could not be detected in any of 31 outpatient dogs (38). In the
United States, MRSA isolates were detected in both dog (0.1%)
and cat (0.1%) patients (31). The prevalence of MRSA among
healthy dogs has been reported to be 0.7% (5). Hanselman et al.
suggested that MRSA colonization may be an occupational risk
for large-animal veterinarians (12). Recently, Burstiner et al.
reported that the frequency of MRSA colonization among
companion-animal veterinary personnel was equal to the frequency
among large-animal veterinary personnel (6).</p>
      <p>In addition, other methicillin-resistant coagulase-positive
staphylococci (MRCPS), such as methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) and methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus schleiferi (MRSS), isolated from dogs, cats, and
a veterinarian have been reported (11, 31, 38, 40, 52). MRSP
isolates have also been detected among inpatient dogs (46.2%)
and outpatient dogs (19.4%) in a Japanese veterinary teaching
hospital (38). In Canada, however, MRSP and MRSS isolates
were detected in only 2.1% and 0.5% of dog patients,
respectively (11).</p>
      <p>Methicillin-resistant staphylococci produce
penicillin-binding protein 2 , which reduces their affinity for -lactam
antibiotics. This protein is encoded by the mecA gene (48), which
is carried on the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec
(SCCmec). SCCmec is a mobile genetic element characterized
by the combination of the mec and ccr complexes (16), and it
is classified into subtypes according to differences in the
junkyard regions (43). SCCmec typing can be used as a molecular
tool (22, 27, 30, 33, 36, 55) for examining the molecular
epidemiology of methicillin-resistant staphylococci.</p>
      <p>In this study, we investigated the occurrence and
characteristics of MRCPS isolates in a veterinary hospital in order to
establish the transmission route of MRCPS in a veterinary
hospital and with a view to preventing the spread of MRCPS
infection. In addition, we evaluated the factors associated with
MRCPS. Further, as Heller et al. have reported the
distribution of MRSA within veterinary hospital environments and
suggested the necessity to review cleaning protocols of hospital
environments (13), we also attempted to isolate MRCPS from
environmental samples collected in a veterinary hospital for an
evaluation of MRSA transmission cycle though environmental
surfaces in the veterinary hospital.</p>
      <p>MATERIALS AND METHODS</p>
      <p>Sampling. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Graduate
School of Dairy Science, Rakuno Gakuen University (RGU). Volunteers were
recruited to provide the nasal swabs for the isolation of MRCPS from staff
affiliated with the Department of Veterinary Companion Animals (DVCA) of
the veterinary hospital and with three nonclinical laboratories in the School of
Veterinary Medicine, RGU. Nasal swab samples were collected using BBL
culture swab EZ (Becton Dickinson Japan, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in March
and April 2007 from 20 of the 46 veterinarians (43.5%) affiliated with the DVCA,
all 21 staff members (including veterinary technicians) affiliated with the DVCA,
and 51 of 60 veterinary students (85%) affiliated with the DVCA. In addition, 5
staff members and 31 veterinary students of the 42 personnel (85.7%) affiliated
with nonclinical laboratories also provided nasal samples. Ten nasal samples
from the 31 veterinary students affiliated with nonclinical laboratories were
collected in October 2007.</p>
      <p>On a single day, we also collected 75 environmental surface samples (e.g., from
floors, top parts of medical examination stands, and cages) from 30 areas in the
veterinary hospital, including the following areas: waiting area; consulting,
procedure, and operation rooms; dispensary; animal wards; administrative office;
and a veterinarian’s office. Sampling areas were selected from areas frequented
by individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital and by animal patients. These
samples were collected using single-use cotton swabs moistened with sterile
physiological saline. In cases where presumptive MRCPS isolates were obtained
from individuals who had companion animals at home, samples of buccal mucosa
from the companion animals were also tested.</p>
      <p>In the second sampling period from February to April 2008, the nasal samples
were collected from 31 of 50 clinical veterinarians (62%), all 18 staff members,
and 65 of 89 veterinary students (73%) affiliated with the DCVA of the
veterinary hospital. In addition, three veterinarians, one staff member, and nine
veterinary students affiliated with the Department of Large Animal Clinical
Sciences provided nasal samples. Additionally, a total of 81 environmental surface
samples were collected from areas similar to those described above.</p>
      <p>Eight presumed MRSA strains from dog patients were also collected for use
in this study for comparison with MRSA isolates from veterinarians, and
veterinary students. These strains were isolated from the affected parts of dog patients
during the period from 2007 to 2008. These strains were identified genetically
and characterized by SCCmec and molecular typing in this study.</p>
      <p>Fact-finding inquiry. In order to establish the factors associated with MRCPS
carriage in humans, information on the following was gathered from subjects:
hospitalization and surgery received within the previous year, antibiotics taken
within the previous month, known contact with MRSA-identified animal
patients, career, affiliations, and the presence of companion animals at home.
During the 2008 investigation, we questioned volunteers about their
participation in the previous investigation in 2007 and their MRSA-positive or -negative
status as determined by the previous test. Human samples and questionnaire
answers were coded to protect anonymity.</p>
      <p>Isolation of MRCPS. Swabs were directly inoculated onto CHROMagar
MRSA medium (Kanto Kagaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and incubated at 35°C
for 24 h. For enrichment, the same swabs were inoculated into 5-ml portions of
heart infusion broth (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) containing
7.5% sodium chloride and incubated at 35°C for 48 h. Enrichment cultures were
streaked out on CHROMagar MRSA medium and incubated as described
above. Representative colonies colored light purple (presumptive MRSA), blue,
or white were selected from each sample and subcultured on nutrient agar
(Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.).</p>
      <p>For testing, we selected one isolate from each sample that was a
catalasepositive, Gram-positive coccus and coagulase positive in tube tests with rabbit
plasma (Eiken Chemistry Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The isolates were stored in a
Microbank (Pro-Lab Diagnostics Inc., Richmond Hill, Canada) at 80°C.</p>
      <p>Following the detection of MRSA carriage, 10 MRSA carriers requested
consultation with a school doctor for treatment. They were treated with
mupirocin ointment for 3 days. The nasal samples were again tested for the presence
of MRSA after 1 month of treatment.</p>
      <p>Detection of mecA and pvl, SCCmec typing, and identification of S. aureus and
S. pseudintermedius. Staphylococcal genomic DNA was extracted from cultures
using a QIAamp DNA minikit (Qiagen Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) or an InstaGene
matrix (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Tokyo, Japan).</p>
      <p>The Panton-Valentine leukocidin (pvl), mecA, and femA genes were
investigated using multiplex PCR 1 (M-PCR 1) (Table 1); the primers for femA gene
are specific to S. aureus. M-PCR 1 was performed in a 50- l reaction mixture
containing 1 HF PCR buffer (containing 1.5 mM MgCl2), 200 M (each)
deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 200 nM (each) primer (Table 1), 1 U
Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), and 1 l of sample
DNA. The samples were subjected to an initial denaturation at 98°C for 30 s,
followed by 30 amplification cycles, with each cycle consisting of 98°C for 5 s,
57°C for 10 s, and 72°C at 10 s. A final primer extension was performed at 72°C
for 5 min, and the samples were then maintained at 4°C.</p>
      <p>To identify the species of isolates other than S. aureus, direct sequencing of the
sodA and hsp60 genes was performed as previously described (19, 37, 39).
Sequencing reactions were performed using a Big Dye Terminator version 1.1 cycle
sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an ABI Prism 310
genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Additionally, restriction patterns
produced by MboI (Takara Bio, Ltd., Shiga, Japan) digestion of PCR 1-amplified pta
were also analyzed for the identification of S. pseudintermedius by the method of
Bannoehr et al. (4).</p>
      <p>SCCmec typing was performed by amplification of the mec regions (classes A,
B, and C) and the ccr regions (types 1, 2, 3, and 5). The class of mec complex was
determined by M-PCR 2 (18). The type of ccr complex was determined by
M-PCR 3 (which detects types 1, 2, and 3) (16) or PCR 2 (which detects type 5).
Moreover, M-PCR 4 was performed to determine the structure of SCCmec using
the strategy of Oliveira and de Lencastre (33) with Phusion DNA polymerase
(Finnzymes). Finally, the structure of the J1 region was confirmed for SCCmec
type III isolates by PCR 3. The primer sequences are listed in Table 1.</p>
      <p>Antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We performed MIC determinations for
14 antimicrobial agents (7). For the isolates obtained in 2007, MIC tests were
conducted using the agar dilution method with Mueller-Hinton agar (Oxoid Ltd.,
Hampshire, United Kingdom). The following antimicrobial agents were tested:
oxacillin, ampicillin, cefazolin, kanamycin, gentamicin, erythromycin,
chloramphenicol, minocycline, oxytetracycline, vancomycin, and enrofloxacin (all from
Sigma-Aldrich Japan K. K., Tokyo, Japan); imipenem (Banyu Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan); arbekacin (Meiji Seika Ltd., Tokyo, Japan); and
teicoplanin (Astellas Pharma Inc., Tokyo, Japan). For the isolates obtained in 2008,
we used the broth microdilution method with an Eiken frozen plate (Eiken
Chemistry Co. Ltd.). Again, we tested 14 antimicrobial agents, 12 of which were
the same as those tested for the 2007 isolates. This time, however, we used
tetracycline and ciprofloxacin instead of oxytetracycline and enrofloxacin.</p>
      <p>Molecular typing. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis for MRSA
isolates was performed as previously described (2, 15). Briefly, bacterial cultures
were grown overnight in Mueller-Hinton broth (Oxoid Ltd.) and resuspended in
TN buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 M NaCl, pH 8.0). The cultures were mixed with the
same volume of 2% UltraPure low-melting-point (LMP) agarose (Invitrogen
Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), dissolved in TN buffer, and pipetted into a plug mold.
After bacterial lysis in a lysis buffer containing 5 mg/ml lysozyme (Wako Pure
Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and 20 g/ml lysostaphin
(SigmaAldrich Japan K. K.), genomic DNA was digested with SmaI (Takara Bio, Ltd.).
PFGE was performed using a CHEF-DRIII system (Bio-Rad Laboratories
Inc.), under the following conditions: switch time of 5.3 to 34.9 s and running
time of 20 h for MRSA (15); included angle, 120°; voltage, 6 V/cm; and set
temperature, 14°C.</p>
      <p>All MRSA isolates were typed by DNA sequence analysis of the X region of
the protein A gene (spa) as previously described (42). The spa types of MRSA
isolates were determined by using Ridom SpaServer (http://www.spaserver.ridom
.de/).</p>
      <p>Statistical analysis. Categorical comparisons were performed using Fisher’s
exact test. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. The
associations between MRSA and MRSP carriage and each inquiry shown in
Table 3 were evaluated with a stepwise forward logistic regression using SPSS
15.0J software (SPSS Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Variables with a significance
level of P of 0.05 in the univariate analysis were considered for inclusion in the</p>

      <p>Identification and frequencies of MRSA, MRSP, and MRSS.
The occurrence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
pseudintermedius (MRSP), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
schleiferi (MRSS) among each sample type are shown in Table 2.
MRSA isolates were obtained from 11 of 92 individuals
(12.0%; 95% CI, 6.1% to 20.4%) and 10 of 127 individuals
(7.9%; 95% CI, 3.8% to 14.0%) affiliated with the veterinary
hospital in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In addition, MRSA
isolates were also obtained from 2 of 10 MRSA carriers even
after they underwent treatment. Analysis of the environmental
surface samples showed that MRSA had contaminated the
floors of rooms used for X-ray computed tomography (CT)
scans and administration of anesthetics and the cat ward, a cat
cage in the cat ward room, and the top part of an anesthetics
stand in 2007. The following areas were identified as infected:
the floors of rooms in the cat ward, a preliminary meeting
room for veterinary technicians, and an intern veterinarian’s
office in 2008.</p>
      <p>The values for the incidence of MRSP carriage among
individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital were 3.3% (3/92)
(95% CI, 0.7% to 9.2%) and 7.9% (10/127) (95% CI, 3.8% to
14.0%) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. MRSP isolates were
obtained from three buccal mucosa samples from five
companion animals owned by methicillin-resistant coagulase-positive
staphylococci (MRCPS)-positive individuals (60%). In 2007,
MRSP was found to have contaminated the following areas:
the cages for large dogs, the top surfaces of an X-ray CT scan
stand, a stand in the cat ward, the ICU, and the floor of a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) room. These isolates were
identified as MRSP by the high degree of similarity between
their sodA and hsp60 sequences and those of the S.
pseudintermedius strain LMG 22219T and by the MboI restriction
pattern of the PCR-amplified pta gene. Although the
aggregates of MRSP colonies cultured on the CHROMagar MRSA
medium were light purple (similar to the MRSA colonies),
most of the single colonies of MRSP were white and very small.
The diameter of the MRSP single colonies cultured on the
CHROMagar MRSA medium after incubation for 24 h was
approximately 0.5 mm. On the other hand, the diameter of
MRSA single colonies after the same incubation period was
approximately 1 mm.</p>
      <p>In 2008, MRSS isolates were obtained from a nasal swab
sample from a veterinarian (1/127 [0.4%]) and from four
environmental surface samples (4.9%). MRSS was found to have
contaminated the floor of a consulting room, the reception
area, an X-ray CT scan preparation room, and the top surface
of an examination stand. These MRSS isolates were identified
by the high degree of similarity between their sodA and hsp60
sequences with those of the S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans strain
CIP 104370T. The colonies of these isolates cultured on
CHROMagar MRSA medium were also white and appeared
to be very small.</p>
      <p>Seven of eight presumed MRSA strains isolated from dog
patients were confirmed as MRSA. Another isolate from a dog
patient was identified as MRSP. MRSA, MRSP, and MRSS
were not isolated from any of the nasal swab samples obtained
from individuals affiliated with nonclinical laboratories.</p>

duplication, we undertook an analysis of the factors associated
with MRSA and MRSP colonization by assessing the results
from individuals who had first provided samples and answered
the questionnaire. Research students and graduate students
were categorized as employees because they diagnosed and
treated animal patients in the capacity of veterinarians. One
person failed to answer questions regarding hospitalization,
surgery, and antibiotic intake, whereas an additional two
people failed to answer questions regarding the presence of
companion animals in the home; these individuals were therefore
excluded from the analysis. The univariate analysis results for
MRSA and MRSP carriage are shown in Table 3.</p>
      <p>According to the stepwise forward logistic regression, both
contact with MRSA-identified animal patients and
employment were associated with MRSA carriage. The predictive
accuracy was 91.0%, as determined by the Hosmer-Lemeshow
test. The incidence of MRSA carriers among those who had
had contact with MRSA-identified animal patients (19.7%)
was higher than those who had had no contact (3.8%; OR,
6.88; 95% CI, 2.20 to 21.57) (P 0.01). The incidence of
MRSA carriers among employees of the veterinary hospital or
of nonclinical laboratories (18.5%) was higher than that among
students (4.0%; OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.97 to 19.41). Contact with
MRSA-identified animal patients was also associated with
MRSP carriage. The predictive accuracy was 96.8%, as
determined by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The incidence of MRSP
carriers among those who had had contact with
MRSA-identified animal patients (8.2%) was higher than the incidence in
those who had had no contact with MRSA-identified animal
patients (0.8%; OR, 11.55; 95% CI, 1.32 to 101.14) (P 0.05).</p>
      <p>Molecular characterization of MRCPS. Two MRSA isolates
from MRSA carriers after treatment, seven MRSA isolates
from dog patients, 21 MRSA isolates from individuals affiliated
with the veterinary hospital, and eight MRSA isolates from
environmental surface samples were characterized by SCCmec
typing, PFGE, and spa typing. Twenty-seven MRSA isolates
were classified as SCCmec type II. The absence of pUB110 and
kdp was detected in seven isolates and one isolate of SCCmec
type II, respectively. Eight MRSA isolates were classified as
SCCmec type IV. All eight SCCmec type IV MRSA isolates
harbored pUB110, and three of the eight isolates also
harbored pls. Three of the MRSA isolates were classified as
SCCmec type I.</p>
      <p>The genetic relationship among the MRSA isolates, based
on PFGE, is shown in Fig. 1. Analysis using the Dice
coefficient, followed by the unweighted-pair group method with
arithmetic means (UPGMA), revealed 12 clusters (clusters A
to L) of MRSA. Band position tolerance and optimization
were both set at 1.0%. Similarities among the SCCmec type II
isolates that harbored both pUB110 and kdp were higher than
those among isolates that had lost either pUB110 or kdp.</p>
      <p>MRSA isolates with SCCmec type II in clusters I and J had spa
type t062 and t1265, respectively. The remaining 25 MRSA
isolates with SCCmec type II had spa type t002. All eight
MRSA isolates with SCCmec type IV had spa type t008. All
three MRSA isolates with SCCmec type I had spa type t1767.</p>
      <p>Two spa type t002 MRSA isolates in cluster G (2007-IM11
[28] and 2008-98 [28]) were isolated from a nasal sample from
a veterinarian after treatment for MRSA carriage in
November 2007 and in 2008; however, an MRSA isolate from the
same veterinarian before treatment was grouped in cluster J
and did not harbor kdp. The three spa type t008 isolates in
cluster B were obtained from the same veterinarian, before
and after treatment (March and November 2007 and February
2008).</p>
      <p>Twenty-three MRSP isolates carried a class A mec complex
and a type 3 ccr complex. The absence of insertion Tn554 (loci
E and F were negative, according to M-PCR 4) and pT181
(locus H) was found in 23 MRSP isolates. These MRSP
isolates harbored the dcs region and a gene in the J1 region
present in SCCmec type III; the latter was confirmed by PCR
3. The SCCmec structure in these 23 MRSP isolates matched
the DNA sequence of SCCmec type II-III (GenBank accession
no. AM904732); therefore, the SCCmec type of these MRSP
isolates was presumed to be type II-III. Three MRSP isolates
were classified as SCCmec type V and harbored Tn554 in the
chromosomal right junction (locus F was positive). In one
MRSP isolate, ccr was not amplified; therefore, the SCCmec
type was not determined.</p>
      <p>Five MRSS isolates were classified as SCCmec type IV.</p>
      <p>These isolates harbored pls and the dcs region (loci A and D
were positive). No pvl genes were found in any of the MRCPS
isolates.</p>
      <p>Antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The frequencies of
resistance of MRSA, MRSP, and MRSS and the range of the
MICs for each SCCmec type are shown in Table 4. All isolates
were resistant to both oxacillin and ampicillin. All MRSA and
MRSS isolates were resistant to cefazolin; however, more than
half of the MRSP isolates were susceptible to it. Moreover,
almost all MRSA SCCmec type I and II isolates were resistant
to imipenem, whereas almost all MRSA SCCmec type IV
isolates, all MRSP isolates, and MRSS isolates were susceptible
to this antibiotic. The frequencies of MRSP resistance to
kanamycin and gentamicin were higher than those for MRSA
and MRSS.</p>
      <p>DISCUSSION</p>
      <p>Our study revealed that two factors were independently
associated with MRSA carriage: (i) contact with an identified
animal MRSA case, and (ii) being an employee of a veterinary
hospital or a nonclinical laboratory (versus being a student). It
is suggested that animal patients spread MRSA infection
among human individuals in veterinary hospitals. Contact with
MRSA-infected animals has previously been identified as a
risk factor among equine veterinarians (1); however, it has
never been identified among companion-animal veterinarians
and personnel attending a veterinary surgery conference (6, 12,
28). The higher risk of MRSA carriage among employees
might be attributed to their frequency of contact with each
animal patient, their closeness of contact during treatment,
and the duration of their experience in terms of contact with
animal patients.</p>
      <p>Since contact with MRSA-infected animal patients is a
factor considered to be associated with MRSA carriage, it can be
inferred that MRSA carriers may originally have been infected
by animal patients. However, a study conducted on 31
outpatient dogs in Japan reported that MRSA isolates were not
detected in any of the dogs (38); similar previous studies have
also reported that the prevalence of MRSA among dogs and
cats was low (5, 31). Manian reported a case in which MRSA
colonization was detected in a dog, which was believed to be
the source of recurrent MRSA infection in its owner, a
diabetes patient, and his wife; the dog was believed to have
contracted the infection through contact with the owner (24).</p>
      <p>Another previous study reported MRSA colonization in a dog
whose owner was a nurse caring for MRSA patients; it was
concluded that the dog contracted the infection from the
nurse, who was found to be a carrier of MRSA infection (50).</p>
      <p>Thus, human MRSA carriers can also be a source of MRSA
infection in animals encountered in veterinary medical
practice. In the present study, the MRSA isolate with SCCmec type

      <p>IV and spa type t008 was obtained from a dog patient in March
2008 after one veterinarian was identified to be a carrier of
MRSA spa type t008 on three different sampling occasions.</p>
      <p>The dog patient had undergone medical examinations in the
clinical department to which the veterinarian belonged. This
clone might, therefore, have spread from the veterinarian to
the dog patient by direct contact or through the medium of
contaminated environments.</p>
      <p>In this study, the frequencies of MRSA infection among
veterinarians and staff members in the veterinary hospital was
found to be 19.5% (8/41) and 15.1% (8/53) in 2007 and 2008,
respectively. These frequencies are comparable to the values
reported in a previous study in the United Kingdom (17.9%)
(21) and that reported in a study of veterinary personnel
attending a veterinary surgery conference (17.3%) (6); however,
these values were higher than those reported in a Japanese
veterinary teaching hospital (10%) (38), in Scotland (3.9%)
(13), and in Denmark (3.0%) (28). Moreover, the frequency of
MRSA carriers has been reported to be only 0.54% among dog
owners (5).</p>
      <p>SCCmec type II was prevalent among the MRSA isolates
obtained from individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital
and from dog patients. Most of the MRSA isolates with SCCmec
type II also harbored spa type t002. A majority of the
hospitalacquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) isolates identified in Japan also
harbor SCCmec type II and are derived from the New York/
Japan clone (multilocus sequence type 5 [ST5]) (17, 22, 36, 54).</p>
      <p>The MRSA of the Japan clone is generally known to have spa
type t002 (http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/). MRSA isolates
with SCCmec type II have been isolated from patients without
established risk factors for HA-MRSA (36). Moreover,
MRSA isolates with SCCmec type II have also been isolated
from healthy children (14); thus, infection of this MRSA
clone has already spread from hospital environments to a
wider community, including veterinary staff and animal
patients, in Japan.</p>
      <p>Zaraket et al. reported that a MRSA clone with SCCmec
type II has continued to colonize hospitals in Japan and has
undergone genomic divergence (54). In the present study, all
but two MRSA isolates with SCCmec type II had spa type t002;
the remaining two isolates had spa type t062 and t1265. Unlike
spa type t002, the spa type t062 has a deletion in the middle
three repeats (34-17-20) of t002, whereas the spa type t1265
has a double repeat of r12 instead of r17. Moreover, the
MRSA isolates of spa type t002 were grouped into seven
clusters by PFGE, and the SCCmec types therein were classified
into different subtypes. It is not known whether the SCCmec
type II clone varies in veterinary medical practice or if some
clones with a small genetic diversity have been introduced into
the veterinary hospital.</p>
      <p>The PFGE method can help divide MRSA isolates into
more groups than spa typing, as shown in a previous study (44).</p>
      <p>Although spa types depend on the DNA sequence of only
region X of the spa gene, PFGE profiles depend on the
numbers and positions of the restriction sites in the DNA sequence
of the entire genome. Therefore, PFGE enables better
discrimination between strains. On the other hand, spa typing
enabled comparison of the MRSA isolates obtained in this
study with those reported in other studies. In some cases, spa
typing could discriminate MRSA isolates of the same PFGE
type (29). A combination of PFGE and spa typing was more
useful than either method alone in discriminating MRSA
isolates.</p>
      <p>MRSA isolates with SCCmec type I were obtained only in
2008, and these isolates also had spa type t1767. Isolates with
SCCmec type I are not commonly encountered in human
hospitals; however, they are sometimes isolated from Japanese
hospital inpatients at risk of HA-MRSA infection (36, 54). It
has been reported that MRSA isolates harboring SCCmec type
I obtained from inpatients belong to ST 8 or ST 30 strains (36,
54). There is little data regarding multilocus sequence analysis
of MRSA having spa type t1767; however, the only MRSA with
spa type t1767, which was isolated in Hong Kong, belonged to
ST8 (http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/).</p>
      <p>Although the 10 human MRSA carriers were treated to
eradicate colonization, two of these carriers were found to be
harboring MRSA isolates even after 1 month of treatment.</p>
      <p>Recurrent MRSA infection in a patient and healthy MRSA
carriers has been reported previously (24, 50). The genotype of
MRSA from a recurrent carrier changed from SCCmec type II
without kdp gene and spa type t1265 to SCCmec type II
harboring the kdp gene and spa type t002. Because the latter
genotype was more common among the MRSA isolates
obtained from veterinary staff and environmental surfaces, this
carrier might be infected from other MRSA carriers or
contaminated environmental surfaces. Treatment of MRSA
carriers should be undertaken simultaneously with the disinfection
of the entire hospital and implementation of hand hygiene
practices, which has been reported as a strong protective factor
against MRSA colonization (1).</p>
      <p>MRSA was not detected in the five buccal mucosa samples
of dogs owned by MRCPS-positive individuals. We chose
buccal swab and not nasal swab, which is the traditional sample for
MRSA isolation, because sampling from dogs was done at
home by each owner without enough immobilization. Loeffler
et al. reported that the isolation frequency of MRSA from the
buccal swabs of dogs was as high as that from the nasal swabs
(21). However, in another previous study, the nasal, axillary,
and rectal swabs of dogs were tested for isolation MRSA, and
the MRSA isolate was obtained only from the rectum (11).</p>
      <p>Combination sampling of the nasal, buccal, and rectal swabs
obtained from dogs may facilitate detection of MRSA carriage.</p>
      <p>In this investigation, we used the CHROMagar MRSA
medium for the isolation of MRCPS. This medium has been
reported to be highly effective in selecting for MRSA (10, 45).</p>
      <p>In a previous study describing the prevalence of MRSP,
samples were directly inoculated onto mannitol-salt agar
containing 2 mg/liter oxacillin and after the enrichment of
staphylococci in broth containing 7.5% sodium chloride (11). In other
studies, MRSP isolates were selected from staphylococcal
strains by testing their susceptibility to oxacillin (38, 40). The
CHROMagar MRSA medium used in this study contained 6
mg/liter cefoxitin. Although we did not determine the MICs of
cefoxitin for the MRSP isolates obtained in this study, we
found that approximately half of the MRSP isolates were
susceptible to cefazolin. Sasaki et al. also reported that almost all
MRSP isolates were susceptible to cefazolin and cefotiame
(38). The higher susceptibility of MRSP to cephalosporin than
MRSA might explain why the colony size of MRSP on the
CHROMagar MRSA medium was considerably smaller than
that of MRSA. On the other hand, even cefazolin-susceptible
MRSP isolates could be obtained by using the CHROMagar
MRSA medium in this study. In the present study, the
frequency of MRSP isolated from individuals affiliated with the
veterinary hospital (5.9%) was similar to that reported
previously (38). Although it was reported that some MRSP isolates
from dog patients had low-level resistance to oxacillin (MIC, 2
to 4 g/ml) (38), all MRSP isolates obtained in this study
showed high-level resistance to oxacillin (MIC, 16 g/ml).</p>
      <p>The CHROMagar MRSA medium might be unable to detect
MRSP that has low-level resistance to oxacillin.</p>
      <p>Descloux et al. described canine MRSP isolates with a new
SCCmec type II-III, resulting from a combination of S. aureus
SCCmec type III and Staphylococcus epidermidis SCCmec type
II (8). The structure of SCCmec in 23 MRSP isolates, as
confirmed by M-PCR 4 and PCR 3, matched the DNA sequence
of SCCmec type II-III (GenBank accession no. AM904732);
therefore, the SCCmec type of these 23 MRSP isolates was
presumed to be type II-III. There are only a limited number of
reports pertaining to the SCCmec type among MRSP isolates
(8, 30, 38); accordingly, more data regarding the SCCmec types
among MRSP isolates are needed in order to understand the
reasons for the sudden emergence of MRSP, although canine
S. intermedius isolates, which were presumed to be S.
pseudintermedius in the previous studies (3, 39), have been reported as
being susceptible to -lactam antibiotics in the past (41, 46).</p>
      <p>Although contact with MRSA animal patients has also been
recognized as a factor associated with MRSP carriage, the
reason for this association is unknown. A previous study has
suggested the transmission of multidrug-resistant S.
intermedius species among dogs affected by deep pyoderma and their
owners (9). Therefore, animal patients could transmit MRSP
infection to humans.</p>
      <p>Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) isolates are
generally susceptible to most of the antimicrobial agents studied,
except -lactam antibiotics (32, 36, 49). Almost all MRSA and
MRSP isolates investigated in this study were multidrug
resistant but susceptible to the antibiotics used for treating MRSA
infection in medical practice. All of the MRSP isolates were
susceptible to imipenem and minocycline, although most of the
MRSA isolates were resistant to these antibiotics. On the other
hand, MRSS was susceptible to most antibiotics. Hisata et al.
reported that MIC to oxacillin and imipenem differed between
SCCmec types or subtypes of MRSA (14). The degree of
susceptibilities to cefazolin and imipenem differed in the SCCmec
types and bacterial species in this study.</p>
      <p>It is necessary to obtain information regarding the
prevalence of MRSA infection before implementing strategies for
MRSA infection control in veterinary medical practice. The
molecular and epidemiological analyses undertaken in the
present study could provide some information regarding
the transmission of MRSA between humans and companion
animals in a veterinary hospital. MRSA carriers can be a
source of MRSA infection in animals. MRSA animal patients
may then, in turn, lead to MRSA infection in other individuals.</p>
      <p>Moreover, MRSA contamination was detected in the
veterinary hospital environment. MRSA contamination in veterinary
hospitals has been reported in previous studies (13, 21). These
observations suggest that there is a dynamic transmission cycle
of MRSA in veterinary hospitals similar to that occurring in
human hospital environments.</p>
