      <abstract>
        <p>Objectives. In 2006, the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges reported that the shortage (1,500) of public health veterinarians is expected to increase tenfold by 2020. In 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Preventive Medicine Fellows conducted a pilot project among CDC veterinarians to identify national veterinary public health workforce concerns and potential policy strategies. Methods. Fellows surveyed a convenience sample (19/91) of public health veterinarians at CDC to identify veterinary workforce recruitment and retention problems faced by federal agencies; responses were categorized into themes. A focus group (20/91) of staff veterinarians subsequently prioritized the categorized themes from least to most important. Participants identified activities to address the three recruitment concerns with the highest combined weight. Results. Participants identified the following three highest prioritized problems faced by federal agencies when recruiting veterinarians to public health: (1) lack of awareness of veterinarians' contributions to public health practice, (2 ) competitive salaries, and (3) employment and training opportunities. Similarly, key concerns identified regarding retention of public health practice veterinarians included: (1) lack of recognition of veterinary qualifications, (2 ) competitive salaries, and (3) seamless integration of veterinary and human public health. Conclusions. Findings identified multiple barriers that can affect recruitment and retention of veterinarians engaged in public health practice. Next steps should include replicating project efforts among a national sample of public health veterinarians. A committed and determined long-term effort might be required to sustain initiatives and policy proposals to increase U.S. veterinary public health capacity.</p>

      <p>Related to the top three identified priorities for
Question 1 (recruitment), participants identified
activities at the individual (I), agency (A), veterinary
community (VC), and policy (P) levels. To improve
awareness of the veterinary contribution to public
health, at least one key activity was identified at each
level above individual, including increasing oppo-rtuni
ties for veterinarians (A); educating veterinarians and
other public health practitioners on veterinary
contributions (A, VC); engaging the veterinary community
in educating the public health workforce on the role
of veterinarians (A, VC); and gearing veterinary school
programs toward support of public health careers and
activities (VC).</p>
      <p>To improve employment and training opportunities,
key activities identified included increasing the number
of trainees in existing CDC programs (A), increasing
the number of career advancement programs and
guidance for veterinarians (A), identifying public health
champions at each of the veterinary colleges (VC),
and identifying more opportunities for veterinarians
(VC). To improve the salaries of veterinarians in
public health positions, key activities identified included
obtaining agency support for parity in pay with other
doctors of medicine (A), working across civilian and
military personnel systems to achieve parity in pay
for veterinarians (VC), and obtaining support from
the U.S. Congress to increase pay for veterinarians in
federal service (P).</p>
