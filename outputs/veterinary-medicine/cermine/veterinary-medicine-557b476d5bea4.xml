Much of the criticism has concerned the imposition of conventional sex roles based on an anthropomorphic view of animals imposed by the researcher. This conventional view may have hampered research, for example from acknowledging male mate choice. Sexual conflict theory is a fast-growing research field, which initially stems from sexual selection research. We investigated how the sexes are described in sexual conflict research and what characteristics they are assigned. We assessed these topics with literature studies of (1) the terminology used and (2) what parameters are incorporated in sexual conflict models. We found that males and females are consequently described with different words, which have different connotations regarding activity in the conflict. Furthermore, theoretical models mainly investigate conflict costs for females, although costs for both sexes are necessary for coevolutionary dynamics. We argue that sexual conflict research uses stereotypic characterizations of the sexes, where males are active and females reactive. Thus, previous discussions on the use of anthropomorphic terms in sexual selection seem not to have had any impact on sexual conflict research, which is why the topic of stereotyping the sexes is still of current importance. We suggest that scientific gains can be made by eliminating a sex-stereotyped perspective. 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>

      <p>Sexual selection research has contributed to important insights
in evolutionary research, but has also been subjected to
controversy and debate since Darwin (1871). Much of the debate has been
devoted to the relative importance and degree of sexual selection in
the two sexes (Brown Blackwell 1875 cited in Fausto-Sterling 1997;
Gowaty 1997; Clutton-Brock 2007), of which much may stem from
the fact that we, as researchers, have a preconceived view of how
the sexes should act. In recent years, several authors have pointed
at weaknesses and misinterpretations in the theory of sexual
selection (Clutton-Brock 2007; Snyder &amp; Gowaty 2007; Kokko &amp;
Jennions 2008; Roughgarden &amp; Akçay 2010), mainly concerning
the use of sex roles and how they are assigned. Well-known
examples include the common extrapolation from anisogamy to
sex roles stemming from Trivers (1972) (Gowaty 1997;
TangMartinez 1997), the overreliance on Bateman’s principle as an
explanation of mating system differences between species
(Bateman 1948; Tang-Martinez &amp; Ryder 2005; Snyder &amp; Gowaty
2007; Brown et al. 2009) and the use of operational sex ratio
(OSR) rather than both OSR and adult sex ratio (ASR) when
determining sex roles (Kokko &amp; Jennions 2008). Other authors have
criticized sexual selection theory from other viewpoints, namely
the language used, both for stereotypic description of the sexes, for
example coy females (Hrdy 1986; Martin 1991; Fox Keller 2004),
and for using anthropomorphic terms with provocative
connotations, for example rape (Gowaty 1982).</p>
      <p>Accumulated evidence from different taxa shows a more diverse
nature of the sexes than traditionally thought, through male mate
choice (reviewed in Bonduriansky 2001; Hill 1993; Amundsen et al.
1997; Gowaty et al. 2003; Bel-Venner et al. 2008; Härdling et al.
2008; Bonduriansky 2009), female competition (e.g. Kempenaers
1994; Slagsvold &amp; Lifjeld 1994; Sandell &amp; Smith 1996; Rosvall
2008; Rillich et al. 2009) and species with mutual mate choice
(Jones &amp; Hunter 1993; Gowaty et al. 2002; Forsgren et al. 2004;
modelled in Bergstrom &amp; Real 2000). For example, which sex is
predominantly competitive does not determine whether that sex
discriminates between mates, as both sexes can be simultaneously
competitive and choosy (Berglund et al. 2005). The use of
conventional sex roles and anthropomorphic interpretations may
in fact have affected sexual selection research by delaying the
realization and acceptance of female cryptic choice (Birkhead &amp;
Pizzari 2002). In international workshops it has therefore been
suggested to look beyond conventional sex roles (Cunningham &amp;
Birkhead 1997; Kvarnemo et al. 2009), and proposals have been
made on how to overcome the biased research tradition (e.g.
Gowaty &amp; Hubbell 2005; Kokko &amp; Jennions 2008). However, the
debate has not yet addressed sexual conflict studies, although
sexual conflict theory emerged from sexual selection (reviewed in
Bonduriansky 2009).</p>
      <p>The novelty in sexual conflict theory lies within the sexually
antagonistic selection (Parker 1979) rather than selection through
mutual benefits as in classic sexual selection theory (Darwin 1871;
Andersson 1994). That is, in a sexual conflict the sexes’ selection
gradients are opposing. This means that a given trait may be
selected for in one direction for males and in another for females.
Previously, the focus of sexual selection research was on how
variance in male reproductive success is generated (Shuster &amp;
Wade 2003), via both male competition and female choice. With
the advent of sexual conflict research, the focus has shifted towards
female costs of reproduction and how both sexes strive to reach
their fitness interests.</p>
      <p>In this review, we explore sexual conflict in the frame of the
insights of stereotyping in sexual selection research. Ideas on what
sex roles encompass may have the capacity to affect how research is
carried out; thus a continued use of conventional sex roles may
hamper research by limiting the potential research questions. This
is the first study to address how sexual conflict theory has been
conceptualized with regard to sex roles. To identify whether and to
what extent sexual conflict research reflects conventional sex roles,
and whether this affects research, we performed two literature
searches. In the first, we focused on the terminology describing
sexually antagonistic traits. This allowed us to contrast differences
in how the sexes are described. If the previous discussion of
stereotyped terminology in sexual selection research is
acknowledged, we would expect to find neutral or nonsex-specific terms. In
the second literature search, we explored which parameters are
taken into account in sexual conflict models, because only the
parameters that are included will be considered as important for
the conflict’s outcome. If sexual conflict research makes use of
stereotyped sex roles we would expect to find a consistent pattern
throughout both terminology and theoretical models where
distinct words and characters are assigned to the sexes, and where
these words and characters imply active males and passive females.
Sexual Conflict Terminology: Methods and Results</p>
      <p>Sexual conflict researchers have utilized several terms
illustrating how males and females respond to each other during
a sexual conflict (e.g. ‘arms race’, ‘battle of the sexes’, ‘tug of war’),
and have also coined terms describing the sexually antagonistic
traits. By examining the 30 most cited studies that included the</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>keyword ‘sexual conflict’ in Web of Science (28 May 2009, including</title>
      <p>reviews, empirical and theoretical studies), we assessed which
terms are most used (see Appendix for references). The citation
range for the 30 studies was 90e390. Of the 30 studies, 23 used
terms describing sexually antagonistic traits and altogether we
found 17 different terms for males and 11 for females (Fig. 1). The
empirical studies used fewer terms (nine in a total of 10 articles)
compared to the reviews (21 in a total of 12 articles) and the model
papers (16 in a total of eight articles). The terms describing sexually
antagonistic traits were highly sex specific. Some examples are, for
males, harassment, manipulation, coercion, persistence and
adaptation, and, for females, resistance, avoidance, counteradaptation,
reluctance and reduction (see Fig. 1). By categorizing each trait as
active, as reactive or as neutral we could quantify the difference (see
Fig. 1 for categorization of terms). By ‘reactive’ we mean that the
trait is a response to another act, and that the response trait itself
does not fuel reactions by the opposite sex. We let two independent
people categorize the traits, listed alphabetically, without any
information on whether the terms stemmed from males or females.</p>
      <p>The terms classified differently by the two persons were excluded
from the analysis. These excluded terms were words that may be
difficult to categorize because they either fall into a different part of
speech or are ambiguous. For example, persistence is one of the
most common terms used for describing male antagonistic traits,
but it could also be understood in the sense of species persistence.</p>
      <p>We investigated whether there was a difference between how the
sexes were described. We found that males were described as active
and females as reactive (c22 ¼ 187.39, P &lt; 0.0001). These terms may
imply three things: (1) it is the male that has the upper hand (the
male adapts while the female counteradapts; Parker 1979), (2)
males seem to have more diverse and aggressive ways of
safeguarding their interests while females most often ‘resist’ and (3) the
terminology partially reflects sex-stereotypic notions.</p>
      <p>Parameters Included in Sexual Conflict Models: Methods and Results</p>
      <p>We surveyed all theoretical models obtained under the keyword
‘sexual conflict’ in BIOSIS (performed 4 March 2009, N ¼ 26); both
verbal and mathematical models were included but not reviews
(see Table 1 for references). Models for which it was impossible to
assess the conflict parameters (e.g. where the main focus is outside
the conflict or where costs are not incorporated at all) were
excluded. By ‘cost’, we here mean cost arising from mating, parental
investment or antagonistic interactions, but not the cost of
producing antagonistic traits. Thus only costs that are inflicted by
the opposite sex and not the costs that an individual bears from its
own adaptations are considered. When cost for trait production is
incorporated in models it is most often accounted for in both sexes
and included besides the actual mating or parental investment cost,
which we have here defined as conflict cost (see e.g. Parker 1979;
Lankinen et al. 2006). Our aim was not to question the
mathematical correctness of the models, but rather to examine how
extensive they are and how much variation exists between them,
with regard to sex roles. From this literature study, it is evident that
female cost is what has mainly been investigated in sexual conflict
research (Table 1). Fourteen articles include only female conflict
costs or fitness reduction in their model while none considers a cost
for the male only (Table 1). The number of articles that include both
a male and a female cost is very high; 12 papers consider conflict
costs for both sexes (Table 1). Among the articles that include both
male and female conflict costs, six model conflicts over parental
care. Models over mating rate are represented only in the group
with exclusively female conflict costs. Thus, there is a clear
difference in what kinds of costs are incorporated, depending on the
particular conflict. It is also worth noting that in some cases it is
assumed that males are always much more powerful than females
(Clutton-Brock &amp; Parker 1995), that males are allowed to choose
their conflict strategy before females (Barta et al. 2002), and that
male fitness never decreases with mating rate (Haygood 2004). To
investigate whether the trend found in the theoretical models is
valid for the wider sexual conflict field, we performed an additional
search on male cost and female cost found in abstracts in BIOSIS
(two searches: (1) female* cost* sexual* conflict*, (2) female* cost*
sexual* conflict* NOT male* cost* sexual* conflict*, 25 May 2010).</p>
      <p>Of 284 abstracts, 145 included sexual conflict and costs. This search
confirmed the previous pattern: 106 abstracts considered female
costs while 30 took both sexes into account and only nine
considered male costs (Fig. 2).</p>
      <p>We analysed the sex roles in sexual conflict research through
literature studies and found that males are commonly described
with active terms and females with reactive ones. Fitness costs

from sexual conflicts in theoretical models are typically considered
only for females. However, the bias may depend on the particular
conflict being modelled. Apparently, the use of anthropomorphic
and stereotyped terms in biology is commonplace, although
already intensely debated in sexual selection research (Gowaty
1982; Hrdy 1986; Martin 1991; Fox Keller 2004). How is it that
we have not learned from earlier discussions but continue
stereotyping the sexes when a new research field is being established? It
seems to be of major importance to consider stereotyping and its</p>
      <p>Costs for both sexes
effects continuously. Below, we discuss the implications for sexual
conflict research and suggest future directions for more objective
research and further progress.</p>
      <p>On the Use of Sex-stereotyped Terminology</p>
      <p>The terminology used in the most cited sexual conflict studies
implies that males are offensive, that is, they are the ones first
acquiring an antagonistic adaptation, which females then react to.</p>
      <p>In true coevolution it is not possible to disentangle who acts first;
the idea that males take the first step may thus be caused by a
sexstereotypic preconception. It may of course be argued that, for
purely physiological reasons, males would need to take an active
step to penetrate the female. But would this mean that all (or most)
female (re-)actions do not mediate further (re-)actions in males?
One could also compare this situation with other situations in
coevolution, such as hosteparasite or predatoreprey systems,
where similar phrasing may be used with active terms for the
parasite and predator and defensive terms for the host and prey.</p>
      <p>Still, there is one difference: in maleefemale coevolution both males
and females need something from their partner (in contrast to the
prey, which does not need anything from the predator) and it is in
both sexes’ interest to reproduce. They just differ in when, how often
and with whom. The current characterization of sex roles in sexual
conflict research can be compared to how females were described in
more passive terms, for example as coy, in traditional sexual
selection. Thus, males are described with active and females with
reactive phrasing (Fig. 1), although both actively affect each other.</p>
      <p>In the hermaphroditic garden snail Helix aspersa, sperm is
digested by the recipient, and it has been suggested that sperm
digestion could indeed be a direct cost to the male sexual function
(see e.g. Rogers &amp; Chase 2001; Arnqvist &amp; Rowe 2005). In these
snails the male part inserts a so-called love dart in the female
genitalia, which seals the entrance and allows sperm to escape
digestion. The love dart could be explained as a resistance
adaptation to the (our note: manipulative) sperm digestion performed
by the female sexual function. However, the love dart may be
inserted to manipulate the recipient’s sperm digestion (Rogers &amp;
Chase 2001). It is clearly the male that would suffer a cost, but
still the response is not described with a reactive term but with an
active one (manipulation). Why are different words used for
describing antagonistic traits depending on whether it is a male or
a female that is imposing a cost on the partner? Could it be that the
antagonistic terms are based on a traditional view of conventional
sex roles, that is, that in western human society males are
traditionally considered as active and females as passive?</p>
      <p>Our concern is not that the traits and behaviours are described
with different words in the two sexes per se. It is rather the different
connotations that are present throughout the terminology, and, in
turn, how these will affect us as researchers that are our concern.</p>
      <p>The image of reactive females implied by the terminology may affect
the research carried out; for example the male’s response to female
antagonism and the subsequent negative effects in males may not
be investigated. Indeed, it should be possible to use the neutral term
‘sexually antagonistic trait’ for both males and females, and if
necessary describe the trait further. Also, in both males and females
a sexually antagonistic trait can be considered as a manipulation
rather than differentiating between ‘manipulation’ and ‘resistance’.</p>
      <p>The anthropomorphic terminology used for describing
behaviour and traits could further have affected the choice of study
species. So far, only a few studies have investigated sexual conflicts
in organisms beyond bisexual animal species (Bedhomme et al.
2009). Active actions, such as force, may be difficult to envisage in
plants and in animals with very primitive mental resources, and the
stereotypic terminology may limit research to only separate-sexed
animals. That is, sex-stereotypic terms such as ‘harass’ and ‘resist’
will certainly give a picture of a male and a female engaged in
reproduction and other sexual systems may not be associated with
such terms. Also, the captivating words describing the sexes’
interactions (‘battle’, ‘war’ etc.) may be problematic in this respect. This
may be relevant for other fields of evolutionary biology, in particular
sexual selection theory, where anthropomorphic description makes
it seemingly difficult to apply the theory, for example to plants.</p>
      <p>On the Bias in Theoretical Models</p>
      <p>Some authors have stressed the importance of defining and
measuring net costs and benefits of each sex when investigating
sexual conflict (Chapman et al. 2003; Fricke et al. 2009). However,
we found that most sexual conflict models focus on costs only for
the female (Table 1). This was particularly evident in modelled
conflict over mating rate. The potential costs that males in nature
may suffer from female antagonistic actions (i.e. the costs for not
reaching the male optimum) in conflict over mating are not
explored. Models of sexual conflict over parental care seem to have
a more neutral approach to assessing the sexes’ costs and benefits
in the conflict, taking both males’ and females’ fitness interests into
account. This may be a consequence of the fact that which is the
care-giving sex varies between different groups of organisms,
opening our eyes to the idea that care may be a maternal, paternal
or biparental task. In such conflicts both sexes may have similar
choices of staying or deserting, and face the same consequential
costs and benefits. In conflict over mating rate, however, the sexes
may have very different choices and face different consequences. Of
course, no model could address all possible parameters but there
may be a bias in what factors are incorporated. Although
mathematically correct, the models leave out the possibility of negative
effects on males from female antagonistic actions. How accurately
does such a theoretical approach reflect how sexual conflict
operates in nature? Parker (1979) divided the costs of mating into
‘power’ (relative contest costs, i.e. cost of enforcing victory, the
average rates of expenditure of contest costs and the ability to
inflict damage) and ‘value of winning’ (relative fitness difference
between mating and not mating). The cost of power could be
equally big for a male or a female, while the value of winning is
thought to be smaller for females (Parker 1979). This idea comes
from the assumption that sexual selection operates more intensely
on males than on females, because the reproductive potential of
males is often greater (Parker 1979). The assumption that female
fitness decreases at higher mating rates is present already in
Parker’s (1979) paper, the first on sexual conflict theory. This view
may stem from Bateman (1948) and has been criticized elsewhere
(Tang-Martinez &amp; Ryder 2005; Snyder &amp; Gowaty 2007; Brown et al.
2009). There is support for the idea that females gain directly from
polyandry in terms of increased lifetime offspring production
(Arnqvist &amp; Nilsson 2000). For both males and females, several
different relationships between fecundity and mating success are
possible (Arnold 1994). However, in models of sexual conflict, male
fitness is mainly viewed as linearly increasing with number of
matings (e.g. Gavrilets et al. 2001), while female fitness is optimal
at an intermediate mating rate. If mating rate is too high, female
fitness decreases and females suffer a fitness cost. Similarly, if
mating rate is decreased (from female antagonistic adaptations)
male fitness will be lower (than it could potentially be with a higher
mating rate): will a male not suffer a fitness cost similar to females?
Or are females always supposed to be harmed, which gives an
additional cost besides a lower than optimal fitness?</p>
      <p>Even if lowered male mating rates actually give the same outcome
as if male costs were explicitly incorporated, there may be a problem
with not acknowledging the decrease as costs. This view may imply
that it is primarily sexual selection that is operating in males (i.e.
decreased fitness as lost opportunity of mating in comparison with
other males) and sexual conflict, with its important feature of direct
costs, is mainly operating on females (i.e. decreased fitness caused by
conflict cost from male actions). An interesting parallel is what
Clutton-Brock (2007) wrote concerning sexual selection in females:
that despite Darwin’s (1871) broad definition of sexual selection in
both sexes, intrasexual competitive ability of individuals is thought
to contribute to sexual selection if it occurs in males but not in
females (e.g. competition for food to offspring). Maybe such
narrowing of the research field is reflected in sexual conflict if female
costs are attributed to the conflict, while male costs of missed
opportunity of reproduction are considered as sexual selection. This
is despite the possibility that it might be a female adaptation that
prevents the male from reaching his optimum mating rate. Perhaps
a clear division between ‘harm costs’ and ‘lost opportunity costs’
would make it easier to acknowledge costs for males.</p>
      <p>The scientific language used could be an important factor
involved in shaping the gender skew in consideration of costs. As it
is, costs are imposed by active traits (of males) on an individual
(female) with conflict traits or behaviours that have a more
vulnerable resonance (e.g. resistance). Thus, only active
terminology implies that a trait infers costs. In turn, this could strongly
affect which experiments are conducted and thus which research
results we will get. As a result, stereotyping may have limited the
research questions and therefore not have provided an accurate
picture of sexual conflicts in nature.</p>
      <p>Male Costs and Interpretation of Behaviour in Empirical Studies</p>
      <p>Both models and the terms describing sexually antagonistic
traits imply that there are no costs inflicted on males. It is possible
that the costs inflicted on males are implicitly there, for example
through lost opportunity costs of mating if females develop higher
resistance towards males. If so, this assumption should be made
explicit and preferably empirically investigated, which until now
has not been done (Fig. 2). In fact, it is possible to study costs of both
sexes within the same experiment. An example is Holland &amp; Rice’s
(1999) study in which imposed monogamy resulted in less
antagonism from both sexes and higher population fitness. Incorporating
costs of both sexes could have been done in several other studies. In
Rice (1996), for instance, the experimental arrest of female but not
male evolution resulted in reduced female survivorship. It would be
both interesting and possible to arrest male evolution to infer how
male fitness components change when evolution of female
antagonistic traits is allowed.</p>
      <p>Where would one then expect to find male costs? The empirical
evidence is scarce, but some examples are already present: survival
during mating in isopods (Benesh et al. 2007) and cannibalism in
spiders (cf. Arnqvist &amp; Rowe 2005). The traits that male spiders
possess to avoid being cannibalized (such as long legs, agility and
vigilance) are said to represent sexually antagonistic adaptations,
not resistance or counteradaptations! There are other cases where
a male cost could be discussed, for example self-mutilation in
spiders to insert a mating plug in females (in some species this
selfmutilation is so extensive that the males become castrated;
Kuntner et al. 2009a, b), or when females metabolize and neutralize
potentially harmful substances in the sperm ejaculate (Arnqvist &amp;
Nilsson 2000). The reduction in relative mating success following
neutralization of sperm toxins will be comparable to that in other
males in sperm competition, but the actual cost comes from the
female antagonistic trait (toxin neutralization; cf. femaleefemale
competition: Clutton-Brock 2007). Although the costs to females of
toxic accessory gland proteins in the ejaculate have been much
discussed, the potential costs a male incurs from female
manipulation of his ejaculates are, to our knowledge, not
mentioned. Another example of a potential male cost is the sucking
behaviour (digesting or removing seminal components) of
recipients of the hermaphroditic marine worm Macrostomum sp.
(Schärer et al. 2004). All these examples call for increased attention
and a less constrained view of male costs in sexual conflict research
(see Fricke et al. 2009).</p>
      <p>Potential Causes of Bias and Directions for the Future</p>
      <p>The pattern we see from our literature surveys may arise from
factors other than gender bias, that is, a preconceived view of sex
roles. For example, theory and research may have sprung from what
is most elaborate and conspicuous in nature. Thus, arms races and
the more severe ‘battle of the sexes’ may be what attract scientists
in the first place. It may be that, since sexual conflict theory
emerged from sexual selection, research has continued on the path
of sexual selection where males are attributed most variation and
action. It could also be that as science changes with time, we may
eventually reach a state where more features of sexual conflict are
studied in both sexes. However, whatever the reason is for the
stereotypic pattern we discern, it may be worth asking what this
bias is due to and how it will affect research.</p>
      <p>As sexual selection research now suggests that the sex roles are
less distinct than previously thought, and because important
insights may be gained by looking outside the conventional sex
roles (Cunningham &amp; Birkhead 1998), it should be beneficial for
sexual conflict theory to deal with the roles the sexes are assigned.</p>
      <p>Indeed, stereotyped theories may constrain rather than broaden
our views and approaches. As another parallel from sexual
selection theory, the importance of incorporating mutual choice in mate
choice models, not using the traditional approach with only one sex
that chooses, has been highlighted (Bergstrom &amp; Real 2000). We
suggest that the characterization of males and females as active and
reactive (and bearing costs), respectively, may hamper the future
development of sexual conflict research. For example, female
adaptations and male costs may be overlooked and conflict
dynamics may not be fully understood.</p>
      <p>If there is a potential problem with the use of stereotypic sex
roles in sexual conflict research, what should we do to overcome
this bias? Even though we ourselves ponder these questions, we
also fall into the same traps when designing experiments and when
writing articles. One reason is that it is easiest to do ‘what others do’
and when communicating research it is convenient to use the
common terminology to be best understood. However, if theory
should be general it is worth being careful with terminology,
striving to develop broad models (see Gowaty &amp; Hubbell 2005,
2009) and designing empirical studies in which the same conflict
features are studied in both sexes. For example, in cases with
hermaphrodites, where evidence is now accumulating for the
occurrence of sexual conflicts (Koene 2006; Lankinen &amp; Kiboi 2007;
Bedhomme et al. 2009; Madjidian &amp; Lankinen 2009), conventional
thinking about sex roles may be difficult or even useless.</p>
      <p>Following Kuhn, objectivity in research may be an unattainable
goal as scientists’ perceptions are influenced by the paradigm they
work within (Kuhn 1962; discussed with regard to sexual selection
in Fausto-Sterling 1981; Fox Keller 1982). We believe that
researchers in sexual selection can develop a more accurate picture
of the sexual conflict process by becoming aware of and
acknowledging their biases and daring to take a step further. Good examples
of how this has paved the way for new research are that male mate
choice is becoming a ‘hot topic’ (e.g. Bonduriansky 2009) and that
female harassment of males (Bro-Jorgensen 2007) has recently
been considered. Of course, we are not diminishing the importance
of previous sexual conflict research, through which important
insights into conflict dynamics have been obtained. However,
whenever a new research field is established it may be wise to learn
from the past and not fall into old traps. We hope that these
reflections will encourage fruitful discussions that will help
researchers consider their potential biases, gain new insights into
their study systems or rediscover some overlooked aspects of the
theory. Ultimately, objective research is a scientific goal, and
normfree thinking, here in terms of gender, may be a first step towards
a more objective sexual conflict research field.</p>
      <p>Inspiration for this review came from the workshop ‘Gender
Perspective on Sexual Selection’ (organized by Malin Ah-King and
Ingrid Ahnesjö) and the course ‘Gender perspective and
evolutionary biology’ (organized by Marlene Zuk, Malin Ah-King and
Ingrid Ahnesjö), both held at Uppsala University, Sweden. We thank
Jessica Abbott and Shawn Kuchta for categorizing the sexual
conflict terms and Kristina Arnebrant for help with literature
search. We are grateful to Malin Ah-King, Ingrid Ahnesjö, Stefan
Andersson, Daniel Conley, Roger Härdling, Åsa Lankinen, Henrik
Smith, Erik Svensson and Marlene Zuk for constructive comments
