        <p>A fast and generic method has been developed for the simultaneous monitoring of &gt;250 pesticides and veterinary drugs (VDs) in animal feed. A 'dilute-and-shoot' extraction with water and acetonitrile (1 % formic acid) followed by a clean-up step with Florisil cartridges was applied. The extracts were analysed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid analyser quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry using both positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The detection of the residues was accomplished by retention time and accurate mass using an in-house database. The identification of the detected compounds was carried out by searching of fragment ions for each compound and isotopic pattern. The optimised method was validated and recoveries ranged from 60 % to 120 % at three concentrations (10, 50 and 100 μg kg−1) for 30 %, 68 % and 80 % of compounds, respectively, included in the database (364) in chicken feed. Document SANCO 12495/2011 and Directive 2002/657/CE were used as guidelines for method validation. Intra-day and inter-day precisions, expressed as relative standard deviations, were lower than 20 % for more than 90 % of compounds. The limits of quantification ranged from 4 to 200 μg kg−1 for most analytes, which are sufficient to verify compliance of products with legal tolerances. The applicability of the procedure was further tested on different types of feed (chicken, hen, rabbit and horse feed), evaluating recoveries and repeatability. Finally, the method was applied to the analysis of 18 feed samples, detecting some VDs (sulfadiazine, trimethoprim, robenidin and monensin Na) and only one pesticide (chlorpyrifos).</p>

      <p>The use of pesticides and veterinary drugs (VDs) in food
industries is widespread, and they are utilised to fight
against plagues [1] and treat diseases that could affect
animals [2]. However, their fraudulent use can result in the
presence of residues in the final animal products [3, 4],
which involves several problems to public health such as
the increased risk of allergies, the development of
antibioticresistant bacteria and harmful effects on the human system
(e.g. carcinogenic effects) [5, 6].</p>
      <p>The study of pesticide and VD residues in animal feed is
an important issue because they can reach the food chain.</p>
      <p>On the one hand, animal feed is usually employed to
administer drugs to animals [7] and, on the other hand, they
can be prepared with several ingredients, which are not
always free of pesticides [3]. Consequently, in order to
ensure animal safety, the European Union (EU) has
established regulations for the control of residues in feed,
setting maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides [8]
and VDs [9, 10]. Moreover, Regulation (EC) 1831/2003
banned the use of all antibiotics other than coccidiostats
and histomonostats as feed additives (used as growth
promoters) since 1 January 2006. Furthermore, these
products have been completely banned on December 2012 [11].</p>
      <p>Thus, VDs should be strictly applied for the prevention or
treatment of diseases. In this way, these regulated limits
require the determination of an extremely high number of
VD and pesticide residues in feed with the aim of ensuring
their use in a rational and safe way.</p>
      <p>Therefore, sensitive and reliable methodologies have
been developed for the analysis of each group of residues
separately. The determination of pesticides in feed has been
based on Soxhlet [12–14], pressurised liquid extraction
(PLE) [15], matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) [16] or
QuEChERS [17]. Some of these procedures have been
followed by a clean-up step based on solid-phase extraction
(SPE) [14, 18] or dispersive SPE (d-SPE) [17], and
subsequent chromatographic analysis by gas chromatography
(GC) coupled to electron capture detection (ECD) [12, 14],
mass spectrometry (MS) [13, 15] or tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS) [12, 14, 16–18]. For the determination of
VDs, solvent extraction assisted by mechanical shaking
[19–22], modified QuEChERS methodology [23] and PLE
[24, 25] followed by SPE clean-up [19–21, 24, 25] or
liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) [22] have been utilised, using
liquid chromatography coupled to MS (LC–MS) [19] or
MS/MS (LC–MS/MS) [20–25] methodologies.</p>
      <p>Normally, most of these methods are focused on specific
groups of residues, not being suitable for wide-scope
multiresidue analysis able to cover different classes of residues
and contaminants. However, the use of wide-scope methods
inherently involves the need for generic extraction
procedures, and this strategy shortens the possibilities for
cleanup steps [26, 27], in order to minimise analyte losses.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the lack of selectivity in sample preparation
can be compensated by selectivity/sensitivity in
instrumental analysis. Although in terms of sensitivity, the use of GC
or LC coupled to triple quadrupole (QqQ) is usually
preferred, and the number of compounds that can be acquired
by these techniques in one run is limited [28, 29]. The use of
high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), such as
timeof-flight (TOF), hybrid quadrupole-time-of-flight (QqTOF)
or Orbitrap [29], is considered as a powerful alternative.</p>
      <p>These full-scan technologies provide the selectivity and
the sensitivity required for efficient and wide-range
screening, as they combine high, full-spectral sensitivity with high
mass resolution, allowing the measurement of accurate mass
of any ionisable component in the sample. In this way, the
combination of ultra-high performance liquid
chromatography (UHPLC) with TOF, QqTOF or Orbitrap analysers has
demonstrated to be an excellent tool for the analysis of
different classes of residues and contaminants in food and
environmental samples [30–32]. However, the number of
applications in feed matrices is quite limited [28, 33, 34],
where a group of pesticides, VDs, mycotoxins and plant
toxins are determined in horse feed [28, 33] and coccidiostats
in animal feed [34].</p>
      <p>Therefore, the aim of this work is the development of a
reliable and sensitive methodology based on the use of
advanced UHPLC–QqTOF–MS technique for the
quantitative determination and reliable identification of more than
250 pesticides and VDs in different types of feed matrices
using generic methods.
Reagents and apparatus
VD and pesticide analytical standards were purchased from
Riedel-de-Haën (Seelze, Germany), Dr. Ehrenstorfer GmbH
(Ausburg, Germany), Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain), Fluka
(Steinheim, Germany), Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA, USA),
European Pharmacopoeia (Strasbourg, France), Witega
(Berlin, Germany) and LGC Standards (Barcelona, Spain).</p>
      <p>Stock standard solutions of individual compounds (200–
400 mg L−1) were prepared in methanol or acetonitrile
(HPLC grade, Fluka), and they were stored at 5 °C or
−18 °C (VDs). A solution for each family of VDs was
prepared from corresponding individual stock standard
solutions in methanol or acetonitrile and a multi-pesticide
solution was prepared in methanol. Tetracycline and
penicillin solutions were renewed monthly. Then, a
multicompound working solution containing all the analytes
(0.31 mg L−1) was prepared by combining suitable aliquots
of each individual stock standard solution and diluting them
with LC–MS-grade methanol, obtained from Fluka. This
solution was kept at −18 °C.</p>
      <p>Ultrapure water, obtained from a Milli-Q Gradient
water system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), was used for
the preparation of all aqueous solutions. Formic acid
(purity &gt;98 %) and ammonium formate (purity &gt;99 %)
were obtained from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain). LC–MS
water was purchased from Scharlau (Barcelona, Spain)
and LC–MS acetonitrile was obtained from Fluka.</p>
      <p>ExtraBond Florisil cartridges (500 mg) were provided by
Scharlau (Barcelona, Spain). D-SPE sorbents for clean-up
experiments included C18-bonded silica, which was
purchased from Agilent technologies (Santa Clara, CA,
USA), and Florisil from J.T. Backer (Deventer, Holland).</p>
      <p>For accurate mass calibration of the QqTOF instrument, a
sodium formate solution (prepared from a mixture of 100
μL of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution, 200 μL of an
aqueous solution of 10 % of formic acid and 20 mL of
acetonitrile/water (80:20, v/v)) and a leucine–enkephalin
solution at 500 pg μL−1 (prepared from 500 μL of
1 mg mL−1 leucine–enkephalin solution in water with
1,000 mL of acetonitrile/water 50:50, v/v and 0.1 % formic
UHPLC–QqTOF–MS/MS analysis
acid) were used as calibration and lock-mass solution,
respectively. All reagents were purchased from
SigmaAldrich.</p>
      <p>Centrifugations were performed in a high-volume
centrifuge Centronic II (JP Selecta, Barcelona, Spain). An analytical
AB204-S balance (Mettler Toledo, Greinfesee, Switzerland)
was also used. A Reax-2 rotary agitator from Heidolph
(Schwabach, Germany) was used for sample extraction.</p>
      <p>The analyses were carried out using an Acquity UPLC system
using an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm×100 mm,
1.7 μm particle size), both from Waters (Milford, MA, USA).</p>
      <p>The mobile phase consisted of 0.1 % (v/v) formic acid and
ammonium formate 4 mM in water (eluent A) and 0.1 % (v/v)
formic acid and ammonium formate 4 mM in methanol (eluent
B). The analysis started with 95 % of eluent A, which was kept
constant during 1 min. Then, it was linearly decreased up to
0 % in 7 min. This composition was held during 4 min before
returning to the initial composition in 0.5 min, followed by a
re-equilibration time of 1.5 min, giving a total running time of
14 min. The flow rate was 0.3 mL min−1 and the column
temperature was set at 30 °C. Aliquots of 5 μL of the sample
extract were injected into the chromatographic system.</p>
      <p>The UHPLC system was coupled to a QqTOF (Xevo™
QtofMS, Waters) equipped with an electrospray interface
(ESI) operating in positive (ESI+) and negative ionisation
mode (ESI−) using the following parameters: cone voltage,
30 V; capillary voltage, 3.5 kV for ESI (+) and 3.4 kV for
ESI (−); desolvation temperature, 350 °C; source
temperature, 120 °C; cone gas, 80 L h−1; and desolvation gas,
600 L h−1. Mass spectra were acquired in positive-ion and
negative-ion centroid mode. The microchannel plate (MCP)
detector was set at 2,000 V. Resolution was at least 9,000
FWHM at m/z of the lock mass (see below). Dynamic range
enhancement (DRE) was switched on. Mass range in the full
scan experiments was set at m/z 90–1,000 with a scan time
of 0.050 s and interscan time of 0.025 s. In order to perform
the fragmentation acquisition for identification purposes,
MS/MS (MSE™) mode was used. This fragmentation mode
consists in two simultaneous MS acquisition functions: (1)
low energy function (LE) using a collision energy of 4 eV
with poor or no fragmentation; and (2) high energy function
(HE) using collision energy of 30 eV, promoting collision
cell fragmentation. All the analyses were performed using a
lock spray with internal lock mass of a solution of leucine–
enkephalin (12C[M+H]+, m/z 556.2771 and 12C[M−H]−, m/z
554.2620) delivered to the ESI source at 10 μL min−1. The
instrument was verified or calibrated before the analysis by
using the calibration solution.</p>
      <p>Data acquisition was performed using MassLynx 4.1
software with QuanLynx program (Waters).
Different types of feed samples were purchased from several
markets in Almería, Granada, Murcia (Spain) and local
farms located in Almería. All samples were grinded and
stored at room temperature in the dark. A chicken feed
sample was used for optimisation and validation purposes,
after checking that it was free of the selected compounds.</p>
      <p>Pesticides and VDs were extracted from feed using an
extraction method based on the procedure previously described by
Gómez-Pérez et al. [35]. Briefly, 2.5 g of feed was weighed
into a 50-mL propylene tube and 2.5 mL of water (LC–MS
grade) was added. The mixture was shaken in a vortex. Then
7.5 mL of acetonitrile (1 % formic acid, v/v) was added, and
the sample was put into a rotary agitator and extracted by
endover-end shaking for 1 h at 50 rpm. After that, the mixture was
centrifuged for 10 min at 4,500 rpm (2,264×g), and 1 mL of
the supernatant was passed through a Florisil cartridge. The
final extract was transferred to a vial and injected into the
chromatographic system.</p>
      <p>Detection and identification of the analytes
For detection and identification of analytes, an in-house
database containing 364 compounds was performed. In order to
develop it, a previous characterisation of the analytes was
carried out by injection of a multi-compound standard
solution containing all the analytes at 250 μg L−1 into the
UHPLC–QqTOF–MS system under the conditions previously
optimised. Compounds were acquired in both ESI (+) and ESI
(−) mode. In this way, after injection in MS mode, the essential
information obtained was the retention time (RT), ionisation
mode (polarity), characteristic ions and possible adducts. In
total, 364 compounds were included in the database to
facilitate the analysis of pesticides and VDs in feed matrices.</p>
      <p>Additional information related to each analyte can be found
in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM, Table S1).</p>
      <p>To identify the compounds, the same multi-compound
standard solution was injected into the system employing
the MSE™ mode for the detection of the main fragment ions
in the HE acquisition function. Thus, one or more fragment
ions were selected for each compound and included into the
database. In addition to the monitored fragment ions, the
identification of the compounds was also carried out by the
use of the isotopic pattern.</p>
      <p>Validation of the optimised methodology
The proposed method was validated, estimating linearity
range, trueness, intra-day and inter-day precision, and limits
of quantification (LOQs). Document SANCO 12495/2011
[36] and Directive 2002/657/CE [37] were used as
guidelines for method validation.</p>
      <p>Linearity was evaluated performing matrix-matched
calibration, using blank feed extracts and adding the
corresponding amount of working solution with the target
compounds at five concentrations, 1, 2.5, 12.5, 50 and
150 μg kg−1. Calibration curves were obtained by
leastsquares linear regression analysis of the peak area versus
concentration. To evaluate trueness, recovery studies were
carried out at three concentrations (10, 50 and 100 μg kg−1)
using spiked blank feed samples (n =5), and they were
quantified using matrix-matched calibration. Intra-day and
inter-day precision (evaluated in five consecutive days) was
evaluated at the same concentrations (n = 5).</p>
      <p>The instrument LOQs were estimated by analysing
spiked extracted feed samples at low concentrations (from
1 to 50 μg kg−1). They were calculated as the minimum
concentration for which the accurate mass error was &lt;5 ppm
for the characteristic ion of the selected compounds ([M+
H]+, [M+Na]+, [M+NH4]+ or [M−H]−) and one fragment
ion, as well as the experimental isotopic pattern matched
with the theoretical isotopic pattern for these ions.</p>
      <p>Results and discussion
In this work, 129 VDs have been studied, including
macrolides, quinolones, tetracyclines, sulphonamides,
avermectines, nitroimidazoles, coccidiostats, penicillins, amphenicols,
tranquilisers, corticoids, ionophores, non-steroidal
antiinflammatory drugs, β-agonists and estrogens, gestagens
and androgens. Furthermore, 235 pesticides including
organophosphorus, organochlorines, carbamates, neocotinoids,
triazines, triazoles and ureas were also selected.</p>
      <p>Development of the UHPLC–QqTOF–MS analysis
Firstly, general conditions for the ion source and ion
transmission parameters were studied. To this aim, a
solventbased standard at 250 μg L−1 was injected into the system,
in positive and negative mode, and different parameters of
the source and the analyser (scan time, inter-scan time and
collision energy of the acquisition functions of LE and HE
employed in the MSE mode) were optimised in order to
improve absolute sensitivity of the characteristic ions,
observing that the conditions indicated in the previous section
provided suitable results.</p>
      <p>Secondly, in relation to the chromatographic conditions,
generic chromatographic conditions reported in a previous
study [35] were used. The overall analysis time was 14 min,
and the retention time ranged from 0.9 (cyromazine) to
9.4 min (narasin and salinomycin).</p>
      <p>In order to develop a database for the detection of the target
compounds, the analytes were characterised and the essential
information includes retention time (RT), ionisation mode
(polarity), characteristic ions and possible adducts (i.e. with
Na+ or NH4+). In this way, a solvent standard solution of the
studied compounds at 250 μg L−1 was analysed. Because the
QqTOF–MS instrument utilised in this study cannot acquire
simultaneously in (+) and (−), two separate injections were
needed for each polarity mode. The compounds were
monitored employing narrow mass extraction windows (10 ppm)
within their characteristic RT windows (RTWs). Exact mass
values, characteristic ions, RTWs, ionisation mode and mass
errors for the studied VDs and pesticides are shown in
Table S1, Electronic Supplementary Material.</p>
      <p>Regarding the identification of the detected compounds,
it was necessary to select fragments for each compound,
taking into account the identification requirements provided
by the SANCO guidelines [36]. In the case of QqTOF
working at high resolution and mass accuracy, the detection
of two or more diagnostic ions (quasi-molecular ion and at
least one fragment ion) with mass accuracy &lt;5 ppm is
required. Besides, the comparison of the obtained and the
theoretical isotopic patterns was carried out. For that
purpose, a solvent-based standard at 250 μg L−1 was injected
and MS/MS acquisitions were obtained. In this way, the
peak shape of the extracted chromatogram for each fragment
(in the HE acquisition function) was compared to that of the
main ion (in the LE acquisition function) checking that both
traces showed the same RT and elution profile. Moreover,
accurate mass errors must be &lt;5 ppm, as well as the isotopic
pattern of the fragment ion must be similar to the
theoretically profile of the empirical formulae.</p>
      <p>Optimisation of the extraction method
The generic extraction method developed by Mol et al. [33]
allowed the extraction of a wide set of pesticides, VDs and
other contaminants in feed. A slight modification of this
method has already been employed for the simultaneous
determination of pesticides and VDs in other matrices such
as honey in our laboratory [35], and it was selected as the
starting point herein. Initially, the experiments were carried
out employing blank chicken feed samples spiked at
100 μg kg−1. As result of this first assay, 75 % of the
compounds (275 compounds) showed acceptable recoveries
(acceptable range 60–125 %). Tetracyclines and penicillins
were not successfully extracted, and some quinolones and
avermectins did not show adequate performance
characteristics. This could be due to the high volume of acetonitrile
employed, which is not efficient to extract polar analytes
like tetracyclines and penicillins because of co-precipitation
of some analytes with the proteins. However, the
chromatograms obtained after UHPLC–QqTOF–MS analysis showed
numerous background interference peaks for some
compounds (Fig. 1a). This can be explained because of the
complexity of this matrix, which contains cereals, sugars/fruits,
fats, roots/tubers, leguminous/oleaginous plants, amino acids
and/or minerals [7]. Therefore, the high complexity of the
matrix makes the clean-up of the extracts almost mandatory
to obtain reliable results, except in cases where the sensitivity
of the method is high enough to offer the option of simply
diluting the extracts. Hence, clean-up is an important step
when extracts are analysed with TOF, which has showed
lower sensitivity than other HRMS analyser, such as
Orbitrap, in certain food applications [38]. Bearing in mind
this and the results obtained in the first experiment, an
additional clean-up stage was checked. In this way, three fast
clean-up procedures were evaluated: (1) d-SPE with Florisil,
(2) d-SPE with C18 and (3) SPE employing Florisil cartridges.</p>
      <p>For d-SPE clean-ups, 1 mL of sample extract was taken to an
Eppendorf tube containing 100 mg of Florisil or C18
dispersive phase. The mixture was shaken in a vortex for 1 min and
then it was centrifuged for 5 min at 4,500 rpm (2,264×g). The
final extract was collected and was placed in a vial. To test
SPE clean-up, 1 mL of the extract was loaded onto the Florisil
cartridge. The final extract was collected and placed in a vial
for injection. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 2, and it
can be observed that they are similar regarding the number of
extracted compounds, although slightly better recovery results
were obtained when SPE-Florisil was used. Furthermore, the
clean-up with Florisil cartridges provided ‘cleaner’
chromatograms (Fig. 1b) with an apparent lower number of interference
peaks and slightly better sensibility.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the generic approach using a SPE clean-up
step was chosen and tested at lower concentrations in the
further validation: 10 μg kg−1 and 50 μg kg−1.
Ion suppression or matrix enhancement is an important
parameter that must be evaluated during method validation. To study
matrix effect, two calibration sets (from 1 to 150 μg kg−1) were
compared: solvent and matrix-matched standard calibration,
using chicken feed. Matrix effect was calculated as described
elsewhere [35]. It can be noticed that matrix effect was
observed for 86 % of the compounds: 49 % of the analytes
showed ion suppression and 37 % of the compounds matrix
enhancement. On the other hand, only 14 % of the compounds
showed a slight ion suppression (7 %) or ion enhancement
(7 %). Consequently, matrix-matched standard calibration was
used for quantification purposes.</p>
      <p>Linearity was then evaluated in the range from 1 to
150 μg kg−1. Good linearity was obtained when peak area

without clean-up; b clean-up by SPE using Florisil cartridges
Fig. 2 Recovery results obtained for the extraction of spiked chicken
feed samples (100 μg kg−1) without clean-up step and using different
procedures of clean-up, d-SPE procedure employing Florisil, C18 and
SPE procedure employing Florisil cartridges
was used as the analytical response, and determination
coefficients (R2) were higher than 0.9800.</p>
      <p>Trueness was estimated through recovery studies at three
concentrations (10, 50 and 100 μg kg−1). Figure S1 in the
Electronic Supplementary Material shows the total ion
chromatograms obtained for the four different feed samples
(chicken, hen, rabbit and horse) spiked at 50 μg kg−1. Table 1 shows a
summary of the obtained results, whereas full results can be
found in Table S2, Electronic Supplementary Material. It can be
observed that 30 % of compounds (111 compounds) showed
adequate recovery (recovery ranging from 60 % to 125 %) at
the lowest concentration checked (10 μg kg−1). As expected,
the number of compounds showing acceptable recovery at
50 μg kg−1 and 100 μg kg−1 was considerably higher: 68 %
and 80 % (247 and 291 compounds), respectively. Intra-day
and inter-day precision values (expressed as relative standard
derivation, RSD, %) obtained for each concentration are shown
in Table S2, Electronic Supplementary Material. It can be
observed that intra- and inter-day precision values were always
≤20 % for the majority of compounds (Table S2, Electronic
Supplementary Material).</p>
      <p>LOQs obtained for the studied compounds (Table S2,
Electronic Supplementary Material) were lower than or equal
to 10 μg kg−1 for 43 % of the compounds, equal to 50 μg kg−1
for 37 % and equal to or higher than 200 μg kg−1 in sample for
6 % of the target compounds (Table 1). Some compounds
showed LOQs higher than the lowest level of concentration at
which they can be recovered, as heptenophos or isoxicam
(Table S2, Electronic Supplementary Material). It can be
explained due to the quasi-molecular ion, which was used
for quantification, could be perfectly detected at
concentrations lower than the LOQ. However, the fragments were not
detected at such low concentration because of the low
sensitivity of the fragments. In these cases, the isotopic pattern was
used for the reliable identification of the compounds at
concentrations lower than LOQ.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the feasibility of the method for the analysis
of target compounds in different types of feed was checked.</p>
      <p>Thus, three additional types of feed (hen, rabbit and horse
feed) were submitted to validation. Firstly, we tested if
chicken feed could be selected as representative matrix for
these three types of feed. Matrix effect was evaluated and
the same concentrations (from 1 to 150 μg kg−1) were
analysed in each type of feed. Then, the slopes of the
calibration curves were compared with the slope of the
calibration curve obtained in chicken feed samples. A
significant difference was observed among the tested feed
matrices. In the case of hen feed, 21 % of the compounds
showed significant differences with chicken feed, whereas
in rabbit and horse feed, the number of compounds with
significantly different slopes was higher, 69 % and 67 %,
respectively. Therefore, it was not possible to select one type
of feed as a representative matrix, which is probably due to
the different composition of each type of feed (type of
nutritional properties), requiring specific matrix-matched
calibration standards. Moreover, trueness and repeatability
were also evaluated following the same procedure employed

% Compoundsa
a Percentage results based on all target compounds initially included in the study (364 compounds)
b The remaining percentage corresponds with the number of compounds not extracted
in chicken feed, showing the obtained results in Table S3,
Electronic Supplementary Material, and a summary in
Table 1. It can be observed that for hen feed, the percentage
of compounds with adequate recovery and repeatability
values was 25 % (90 compounds) at 10 μg kg−1, 53 %
(193 compounds) at 50 μg kg−1 and 61 % (221 compounds)
at 100 μg kg−1. For rabbit feed, these percentages are 22 %
(81 compounds) at 10 μg kg−1, 51 % (187 compounds) at
50 μg kg−1 and 59 % (216 compounds) at 100 μg kg−1.</p>
      <p>Finally for horse feed, the number of compounds with
adequate figures of merit was 24 % (88 compounds) at
10 μg kg−1, 57 % (209 compounds) at 50 μg kg−1 and
64 % (234 compounds) at 100 μg kg−1. As expected, the
number of compounds extracted in hen, rabbit and horse
feed with acceptable recovery was considerably lower than
in chicken feed due to the fact that these matrices have
different composition (especially different fatty content)
and they can be considered more complex.</p>
      <p>Finally, LOQs obtained for each compound in the matrices
evaluated are shown in Table S3, Electronic Supplementary
Material. It can be observed that 69 % of compounds showed
LOQs ≤50 μg kg−1 in hen feed, whereas in rabbit and horse
feed, the number of compounds with LOQs ≤50 μg kg−1 was
55 % and 61 %, respectively. Table 1 shows a summary of the
results obtained for all the matrices. As aforementioned, some
compounds showed LOQs higher than the lowest concentration
at which they can be recovered. Again, these compounds
showed problems to detect the fragment at LOQ concentration,
although their quasi-molecular ion was perfectly detected.</p>
      <p>Despite the higher levels of LOQ obtained for some
compounds, many of them were lower than MRLs
established by the legislation for some specific compounds,
as it can be seen in Table 2.</p>
      <p>In general, it can be observed that the obtained LOQs
were relatively high. This can be explained bearing in mind
the acquisition mode of the fragments based on the MSE
procedure. Despite its aforementioned advantages, the
success of the MSE approach can be limited by the quality of
the spectrum [31]. The low sensitivity or strongly interfered
spectra make difficult the identification of compounds using
fragments at low concentrations.</p>
      <p>As aforementioned, many analytical methods have been
developed for the determination of compounds belonging to
one family of pesticides or VDs in feed [7, 14, 23, 39, 40].</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the number of multi-class or wide-scope
multiclass methods is scarce. In consequence, it is important to
highlight the ability of the proposed method to analyse a high
variety of pesticides and VDs in different feed samples.</p>
      <p>If the proposed method is compared with the published
multi-class methods developed for the determination of VDs
[22, 24, 41] and pesticides [15, 17] in feed, it can be indicated
that the combination of a generic extraction method with
UHPLC–QqTOF–MS analysis is simpler and faster than
Table 2 Comparison of MRL established for some VDs and pesticides
in animal feed with LOQs obtained with the proposed method
previous methods. Moreover, the presented methodology
increased sample throughput because it only requires a rapid
clean-up step through Florisil cartridges instead of d-SPE
clean-up [17, 41], LLE followed by concentration step [22]
or an extraction by SPE [24]. In relation to the number of
validated compounds, the proposed method allowed the
determination and quantification of an average of 200
compounds in different feed improving the number of compounds
of other works: 33 VDs [41], 10 prohibited medical additives
(three analytes were analysed in qualitative mode) [22], 18
antibacterials [24] and 33 [15] and 122 [17] pesticides.</p>
      <p>Concerning the performance characteristics, the developed
method allowed the extraction and quantification of a high
number of VDs and pesticides at low levels (10 μg kg−1).</p>
      <p>These results are better than those obtained in a previous
multi-class method developed for the determination of 122
pesticides [17], where some pesticides were validated at a
higher concentration, 50 μg kg−1 (for example atrazine,
carbaryl or metalaxyl). In another study, 100 μg kg−1 was the
lowest level at which antibacterial compounds were
determined [22]. In contrast to this, a multi-class method developed
for the analysis of 33 VDs [41] showed good recoveries at low
levels (&lt;10 μg kg−1).</p>
      <p>Regarding LOQs, the obtained values in the proposed
method (ranged from 4 to 200 μg kg−1 in sample) were
lower than those obtained in two previous works [17, 22].</p>
      <p>The first one determined pesticides in wheat grain (7–
400 μg kg−1) [17] and the second one measured VDs in
pig and poultry compound feed (100–169 μg kg−1) [22].</p>
      <p>However, other works showed better LOQs, such as those
obtained by Boscher et al. [41] (LOQs ranging from 3.8 to
65 μg kg−1 in sample, piglet feed) and by Kantiani et al. [24]
(instrumental LOQs from 0.57 to 2.92 μg kg−1). These low
LOQ values can be explained due to the fact that both works
employed QqQ as analyser, which showed better sensitivity
than QqTOF using MSE. Moreover, these methods were
developed for a limited number of compounds.</p>
      <p>One of the main disadvantages of the proposed method is
that it was not able to extract and quantify some families of
compounds, such as tetracyclines, quinolones or penicillins,
which were analysed in other works [24, 41] with good
recoveries, and therefore, current work is focused on this.</p>
      <p>If it is compared with the two wide-scope multi-class
methods previously developed for analysis of VDs and
pesticides in feed samples (horse feed and cereal-based product,
respectively) [33, 42], some advantages can be mentioned.</p>
      <p>Firstly, the generic extraction method was developed from
Mol et al. [33], which is similar to the method proposed in this
work, with a slight modification by the addition of a simple
clean-up step. Secondly, the generic extraction method is faster
than the method developed by van der Lee et al. [42], where the
extraction time was 18 h and it required a clean-up procedure
by gel permeation chromatography and SPE. Furthermore, the
number of pesticides and VDs validated with our method was
higher or similar than the number of compounds of both works,
106 compounds [42] and 222 [33], respectively. Finally,
regarding LOQs, both methods showed similar values compared
with our method. In one of these works, the instrumental LOQs
ranged from 1 to 46 μg kg−1 [42], and in the other one, LODs
ranged from 10 to 50 μg kg−1 [33].</p>
      <p>Analysis of real samples
The optimised method was applied to 18 samples of feed,
including rabbit (four), chicken (seven), hen (two), pig (one),
lamb (one) and horse (one) feed. Moreover, one sample of
Table 3 Concentration of VDs and pesticides in the analysed samples
barley and one sample of maize (two components of animal
feed) were also selected.</p>
      <p>An internal quality control was carried out for every batch
of samples to check if the system is under control, and it
implies four matrix-matched calibrations (in chicken, hen,
rabbit and horse), reagent blanks, full procedural blanks and
fortified extracts at 150 μg kg−1. Instrument blanks were
composed of methanol and were analysed at the beginning
of the batch. Since analyte signals were not found in the
instrumental blanks, no further actions were taken. Full
procedural blanks were prepared by four different types of feed
sample extracted and analysed after instrumental blanks. This
experiment showed zero carry-over for all the analytes,
ensuring that no cross-contamination was taking place.</p>
      <p>As aforementioned, analyte detection and identification
was based on the criteria showed in section ‘Detection and
identification of the analytes’.</p>
      <p>When the samples were analysed by the proposed method,
seven samples contained traces of VDs and pesticides
(Table 3). Some VDs (sulfadiazine, trimetoprim, robenidine
and monensin sodium) and one pesticide (chlorpyrifos) were
detected. Sulfadiazine and trimethoprim were detected in two
chicken samples. One of them contained 1,114 μg kg−1 of
sulfadiazine and 225 μg kg−1 of trimethoprim, and the other
one contained 217 μg kg−1 of sulfadiazine and 72 μg kg−1 of
trimethoprim. Sulfadiazine, which is an antibiotic that belongs
to the group of sulphonamides, is a synthetic bacteriostatic
compound that is commonly used to treat urinary tract
infections. On the other hand, trimethoprim is a dihydropteroate
synthetase inhibitor that is commonly used in combination
with sulphonamides for broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy.</p>
      <p>In veterinary medicines, the combination of sulphonamides
with trimethoprim is widely used for prevention and treatment
of respiratory or gastro-intestinal tract infections in cattle,
swine and poultry [43]. Robenidine was detected in a rabbit
sample at 4,186 μg kg−1, being this level lower than the MRL

established in legislation (6,600 μg kg−1) [44]. Its presence in
this sample can be explained due to this coccidiostat can be
used in fattening and breeding rabbits in feedstuffs [45]. The
coccidiostat monensin sodium was detected in five feed
samples: rabbit (two), pig (one), lamb (one) and horse (one) feed
(Table 3). This coccidiostat is used as additive in feed to protect
animals against coccidiosis in animal husbandry, which can
explain its occurrence. However, all concentrations (up to
315 μg kg−1) were below the established MRLs for each
matrix. Figure 3 shows the extracted ion chromatograms for
sample 2 (rabbit feed sample) containing 4,186 μg kg−1 of
robenidine and 315 μg kg−1 of monensin sodium.</p>
      <p>An important result concerns that only one pesticide was
found, chlorpyrifos, which was detected in four samples at
concentrations higher than the MRL (Table 3) in all cases. Its
occurrence can be explained as a consequence of its wide
application in agriculture and, thus, in the cereals used to
produce feed. Besides, this pesticide is defined by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as ‘one of the
most widely used organophosphate insecticides’ [46].
As aforementioned, the development of wide-scope
multiresidue methods able to cover the analysis of pesticide and
VD residues in feed is a current need due to the gap that exists
in this area of feed safety. Consequently, in this work, an
UHPLC–QqTOF–MS method has been developed for
simultaneous determination of a huge number of target
pesticides and VD residues in feed. A generic sample procedure
followed by a simple clean-up step by Florisil cartridges was
selected as the most appropriate for the analysis of the wide
range of compounds in feed in terms of recovery yields and
matrix effect. The developed method allows the analysis of an
average of 200 residues of different families of pesticides and
VDs in various feed. The developed method was validated
according to Directive 2002/657/CE and Document SANCO
12495/2011; it showed good quantitative results for most of
the studied compounds and the LOQs range from 4 to
200 μg kg−1. Despite the variety of compounds that could
be determined by the current method, further experiments are
needed to include the analysis of tetracyclines, quinolones,
avermectins and penicillins, which could not be determined
with this method. Although the sensitivity attained by the
proposed method was lower than some of published methods,
it was enough to comply with MRLs established by EU.</p>
      <p>Finally, the method was applied to different kinds of feed
demonstrating its applicability as quantitative method in any
type of feed. This method illustrated the feasibility of using
QqTOF for detecting, identifying and quantifying pesticides
and VDs residues in a multi-class method. In spite of the
advantages showed by the proposed method, it shows some
limitations due to some families of VDs, such as tetracyclines,
quinolones and penicillins, which are not properly extracted.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the proposed method showed low sensitivity
making the detection of some compounds and fragments at
low concentrations unfeasible.
