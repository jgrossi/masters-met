contributed to important insights in evolutionary research, but has also been
subjected to controversy and debate since Darwin (1871). Much of the debate has been
devoted to the relative importance and degree of sexual selection in the two sexes
(Brown Blackwell 1875 cited in Fausto-Sterling 1997; Gowaty 1997; Clutton-Brock
2007), of which much may stem from the fact that we, as researchers, have a
preconceived view of how the sexes should act. In recent years, several authors have
pointed at weaknesses and misinterpretations in the theory of sexual selection
(Clutton-Brock 2007; Snyder &amp; Gowaty 2007; Kokko &amp; Jennions 2008; Roughgarden
&amp; Ak&#xE7;ay 2010), mainly concerning the use of sex roles and how they are
assigned. Well-known examples include the common extrapolation from anisogamy to sex
roles stemming from Trivers (1972) (Gowaty 1997; Tang' Martinez 1997), the
overreliance on Bateman s principle as an explanation of mating system differences
between species (Bateman 1948; Tang-Martinez &amp; Ryder 2005; Snyder &amp; Gowaty
2007; Brown et al. 2009) and the use of operational sex ratio (OSR) rather than both
OSR and adult sex ratio (ASR) when determining sex roles (Kokko &amp; Jennions 2008).

theory from other viewpoints, namely the language used, both for stereotypic
description of the sexes, for example coy females (Hrdy 1986; Martin 1991; Fox Keller
2004), and for using anthropomorphic terms with provocative connotations, for example
rape (Gowaty 1982). Accumulated evidence from different taxa shows a more diverse
nature of the sexes than traditionally thought, through male mate choice (reviewed in
Bonduriansky 2001; Hill 1993; Amundsen et al. 1997; Gowaty et al. 2003; Bel-Venner et
al. 2008; H&#xE4;rdling et al. 2008; Bonduriansky 2009), female competition (e.g.
Kempenaers 1994; Slagsvold &amp; Lifjeld 1994; Sandell &amp; Smith 1996; Rosvall
2008; Rillich et al. 2009) and species with mutual mate choice (Jones &amp; Hunter
1993; Gowaty et al. 2002; Forsgren et al. 2004; modelled in Bergstrom &amp; Real
2000). For example, which sex is predominantly competitive does not determine whether
that sex discriminates between mates, as both sexes can be simultaneously competitive
and choosy (Berglund et al. 2005). The use of conventional sex roles and
anthropomorphic interpretations may in fact have affected sexual selection research
by delaying the realization and acceptance of female cryptic choice (Birkhead &amp;
Pizzari 2002). In international workshops it has therefore been suggested to look
beyond conventional sex roles (Cunningham &amp; Birkhead 1997; Kvarnemo et al. 2009),
and proposals have been made on how to overcome the biased research tradition (e.g.
Gowaty &amp; Hubbell 2005; Kokko &amp; Jennions 2008). However, the fl debate has not
yet addressed sexual con ict studies, although fl sexual con ict theory emerged from
sexual selection (reviewed in Bonduriansky 2009). fl The novelty in sexual con ict
theory lies within the sexually antagonistic selection (Parker 1979) rather than
selection through fi mutual bene ts as in classic sexual selection theory (Darwin
1871; fl ' Andersson 1994). That is, in a sexual con ict the sexes selection
gradients are opposing. This means that a given trait may be selected for in one
direction for males and in another for females. Previously, the focus of sexual
selection research was on how variance in male reproductive success is generated
(Shuster &amp; Wade 2003), via both male competition and female choice. With fl the
advent of sexual con ict research, the focus has shifted towards female costs of
reproduction and how both sexes strive to reach fi their tness interests. fl In this
review, we explore sexual con ict in the frame of the insights of stereotyping in
sexual selection research. Ideas on what sex roles encompass may have the capacity to
affect how research is carried out; thus a continued use of conventional sex roles
may hamper research by limiting the potential research questions. This fi fl is the
rst study to address how sexual con ict theory has been conceptualized with regard to
sex roles. To identify whether and to fl fl what extent sexual con ict research re
ects conventional sex roles, and whether this affects research, we performed two
literature fi searches. In the rst, we focused on the terminology describing sexually
antagonistic traits. This allowed us to contrast differences in how the sexes are
described. If the previous discussion of stereotyped terminology in sexual selection
research is acknowlfi fi edged, we would expect to nd neutral or nonsex-speci c
terms. In the second literature search, we explored which parameters are fl taken
into account in sexual con ict models, because only the parameters that are included
will be considered as important for fl fl ' the con ict s outcome. If sexual con ict
research makes use of fi stereotyped sex roles we would expect to nd a consistent
pattern throughout both terminology and theoretical models where distinct words and
characters are assigned to the sexes, and where these words and characters imply
active males and passive females.<component x="311.52" y="77.24" width="251.13"

have utilized several terms illustrating how males and females respond to each other
during fl ' ' ' ' a sexual con ict (e.g. arms race , battle of the sexes , ' 'tug of
war ), have also coined terms describing the sexually antagonistic and traits. By
examining the 30 most cited studies that included the fl ' ' keyword sexual con ict
in Web of Science (28 May 2009, including reviews, empirical and theoretical
studies), we assessed which terms are most used (see Appendix for references). The
citation e range for the 30 studies was 90 390. Of the 30 studies, 23 used terms
describing sexually antagonistic traits and altogether we found 17 different terms
for males and 11 for females (Fig. 1). The empirical studies used fewer terms (nine
in a total of 10 articles) compared to the reviews (21 in a total of 12 articles) and
the model papers (16 in a total of eight articles). The terms describing sexually fi
antagonistic traits were highly sex speci c. Some examples are, for males,
harassment, manipulation, coercion, persistence and adaptation, and, for females,
resistance, avoidance, counteradaptation, reluctance and reduction (see Fig. 1). By
categorizing each trait as active, as reactive or as neutral we could quantify the
difference (see ' ' Fig. 1 for categorization of terms). By reactive we mean that the
trait is a response to another act, and that the response trait itself does not fuel
reactions by the opposite sex. We let two independent people categorize the traits,
listed alphabetically, without any information on whether the terms stemmed from
males or females. fi The terms classi ed differently by the two persons were excluded
from the analysis. These excluded terms were words that may be fi dif cult to
categorize because they either fall into a different part of speech or are ambiguous.
For example, persistence is one of the most common terms used for describing male
antagonistic traits, but it could also be understood in the sense of species
persistence. We investigated whether there was a difference between how the sexes
were described. We found that males were described as active 2 187.39, P 0.0001).
These terms may and females as reactive ( &lt; 2 c &#xBC; imply three things: (1) it
is the male that has the upper hand (the male adapts while the female counteradapts;
Parker 1979), (2) males seem to have more diverse and aggressive ways of safe' '
guarding their interests while females most often resist and (3) the fl terminology
partially re ects sex-stereotypic notions. fl Parameters Included in Sexual Con ict
Models: Methods and Results We surveyed all theoretical models obtained under the
keyword fl ' ' sexual con ict in BIOSIS (performed 4 March 2009, N 26); both &#xBC;
verbal and mathematical models were included but not reviews (see Table 1 for
references). Models for which it was impossible to fl assess the con ict parameters
(e.g. where the main focus is outside fl the con ict or where costs are not
incorporated at all) were ' ' excluded. By cost , we here mean cost arising from
mating, parental investment or antagonistic interactions, but not the cost of fl
producing antagonistic traits. Thus only costs that are in icted by the opposite sex
and not the costs that an individual bears from its own adaptations are considered.
When cost for trait production is incorporated in models it is most often accounted
for in both sexes and included besides the actual mating or parental investment cost,
fi fl which we have here de ned as con ict cost (see e.g. Parker 1979; Lankinen et
al. 2006). Our aim was not to question the mathematical correctness of the models,
but rather to examine how extensive they are and how much variation exists between
them, with regard to sex roles. From this literature study, it is evident that fl
female cost is what has mainly been investigated in sexual con ict fl research (Table
1). Fourteen articles include only female con ict fi costs or tness reduction in
their model while none considers a cost for the male only (Table 1). The number of
articles that include both fl a male and a female cost is very high; 12 papers
consider con ict costs for both sexes (Table 1). Among the articles that include both
fl fl male and female con ict costs, six model con icts over parental care. Models
over mating rate are represented only in the group fl with exclusively female con ict
costs. Thus, there is a clear difference in what kinds of costs are incorporated,
depending on the fl particular con ict. It is also worth noting that in some cases it
is assumed that males are always much more powerful than females (Clutton-Brock &amp;
Parker 1995 ), that males are allowed to choose fl con ict strategy before females
(Barta et al. 2002), and that their fi male tness never decreases with mating rate
(Haygood 2004). To investigate whether the trend found in the theoretical models is
fl fi valid for the wider sexual con ict eld, we performed an additional search on
male cost and female cost found in abstracts in BIOSIS fl (two searches: (1) female
cost sexual con ict , (2) female cost * * * * * * fl fl sexual con ict NOT male cost
sexual con ict , 25 May 2010). * * * * * * fl Of 284 abstracts, 145 included sexual
con ict and costs. This search fi con rmed the previous pattern: 106 abstracts
considered female costs while 30 took both sexes into account and only nine
considered male costs (Fig. 2).<component x="32.82" y="49.89" width="251.17"

most cited sexual con ict studies fi implies that males are offensive, that is, they
are the ones rst acquiring an antagonistic adaptation, which females then react to.
fi In true coevolution it is not possible to disentangle who acts rst; fi the idea
that males take the rst step may thus be caused by a sexstereotypic preconception. It
may of course be argued that, for purely physiological reasons, males would need to
take an active step to penetrate the female. But would this mean that all (or most)
female (re-)actions do not mediate further (re-)actions in males? One could also
compare this situation with other situations in e e coevolution, such as host
parasite or predator prey systems, where similar phrasing may be used with active
terms for the parasite and predator and defensive terms for the host and prey. e
Still, there is one difference: in male female coevolution both males and females
need something from their partner (in contrast to the prey, which does not need
anything from the predator) and it is in ' both sexes interest to reproduce. They
just differ in when, howoften and with whom. The current characterization of sex
roles in sexual fl con ict research can be compared to how females were described in
more passive terms, for example as coy, in traditional sexual selection. Thus, males
are described with active and females with reactive phrasing (Fig. 1), although both
actively affect each other. In the hermaphroditic garden snail Helix aspersa, sperm
is digested by the recipient, and it has been suggested that sperm digestion could
indeed be a direct cost to the male sexual function (see e.g. Rogers &amp; Chase
2001; Arnqvist &amp; Rowe 2005). In these snails the male part inserts a so-called
love dart in the female genitalia, which seals the entrance and allows sperm to
escape digestion. The love dart could be explained as a resistance adaptation to the
(our note: manipulative) sperm digestion performed by the female sexual function.
However, the love dart may be ' inserted to manipulate the recipient s sperm
digestion (Rogers &amp; Chase 2001). It is clearly the male that would suffer a cost,
but still the response is not described with a reactive term but with an active one
(manipulation). Why are different words used for describing antagonistic traits
depending on whether it is a male or a female that is imposing a cost on the partner?
Could it be that the antagonistic terms are based on a traditional view of
conventional sex roles, that is, that in western human society males are
traditionally considered as active and females as passive? Our concern is not that
the traits and behaviours are described with different words in the two sexes per se.
It is rather the different connotations that are present throughout the terminology,
and, in turn, how these will affect us as researchers that are our concern. The image
of reactive females implied by the terminology may affect ' the research carried out;
for example the male s response to female antagonism and the subsequent negative
effects in males may not be investigated. Indeed, it should be possible to use the
neutral term ' ' sexually antagonistic trait for both males and females, and if
necessary describe the trait further. Also, in both males and females a sexually
antagonistic trait can be considered as a manipulation ' ' ' ' rather than
differentiating between manipulation and resistance . The anthropomorphic terminology
used for describing behaviour and traits could further have affected the choice of
study fl species. So far, only a few studies have investigated sexual con icts
organisms beyond bisexual animal species (Bedhomme et al. in fi 2009). Active
actions, such as force, may be dif cult to envisage in plants and in animals with
very primitive mental resources, and the stereotypic terminology may limit research
to only separate-sexed ' ' ' ' animals. That is, sex-stereotypic terms such as harass
and resist will certainly give a picture of a male and a female engaged in
reproduction and other sexual systems may not be associated with ' such terms. Also,
the captivating words describing the sexes inter' ' ' ' actions ( battle , war etc.)
may be problematic in this respect. This fi may be relevant for other elds of
evolutionary biology, in particular sexual selection theory, where anthropomorphic
description makes fi it seemingly dif cult to apply the theory, for example to
plants.<component x="32.82" y="49.9" width="251.17" height="614.7" page="4"

the importance of de ning and fi measuring net costs and bene ts of each sex when
investigating fl sexual con ict (Chapman et al. 2003; Fricke et al. 2009). However,
fl we found that most sexual con ict models focus on costs only for the female (Table
1). This was particularly evident in modelled fl con ict over mating rate. The
potential costs that males in nature may suffer from female antagonistic actions
(i.e. the costs for not fl reaching the male optimum) in con ict over mating are not
fl explored. Models of sexual con ict over parental care seem to have fi ' a more
neutral approach to assessing the sexes costs and bene ts fl fi ' ' in the con ict,
taking both males and females tness interests into account. This may be a consequence
of the fact that which is the care-giving sex varies between different groups of
organisms, opening our eyes to the idea that care may be a maternal, paternal fl or
biparental task. In such con icts both sexes may have similar choices of staying or
deserting, and face the same consequential fi fl costs and bene ts. In con ict over
mating rate, however, the sexes may have very different choices and face different
consequences. Of course, no model could address all possible parameters but there may
be a bias in what factors are incorporated. Although mathematically correct, the
models leave out the possibility of negative effects on males from female
antagonistic actions. How accurately fl fl does such a theoretical approach re ect
how sexual con ict operker (1979) divided the costs of mating into ates in nature?
Par ' ' power (relative contest costs, i.e. cost of enforcing victory, the average
rates of expenditure of contest costs and the ability to fl fi ' ' in ict damage) and
value of winning (relative tness difference between mating and not mating). The cost
of power could be equally big for a male or a female, while the value of winning is
thought to be smaller for females (Parker 1979). This idea comes from the assumption
that sexual selection operates more intensely on males than on females, because the
reproductive potential of males is often greater (Parker 1979). The assumption that
female fi tness decreases at higher mating rates is present already in fi fl ' Parker
s (1979) paper, the rst on sexual con ict theory. This view may stem from Bateman
(1948) and has been criticized elsewhere (Tang-Martinez &amp; Ryder 2005; Snyder
&amp; Gowaty 2007; Brown et al. 2009). There is support for the idea that females
gain directly from polyandry in terms of increased lifetime offspring production
(Arnqvist &amp; Nilsson 2000). For both males and females, several different
relationships between fecundity and mating success are fl possible (Arnold 1994).
However, in models of sexual con ict, male fi tness is mainly viewed as linearly
increasing with number of fi matings (e.g. Gavrilets et al. 2001), while female tness
is optimal at an intermediate mating rate. If mating rate is too high, female fi fi
tness decreases and females suffer a tness cost. Similarly, if mating rate is
decreased (from female antagonistic adaptations) fi male tness will be lower (than it
could potentially be with a higher fi mating rate): will a male not suffer a tness
cost similar to females? Or are females always supposed to be harmed, which gives an
fi additional cost besides a lower than optimal tness? Even if lowered male mating
rates actually give the same outcome as if male costs were explicitly incorporated,
there may be a problem with not acknowledging the decrease as costs. This view may
imply that it is primarily sexual selection that is operating in males (i.e. fi
decreased tness as lost opportunity of mating in comparison with fl other males) and
sexual con ict, with its important feature of direct fi costs, is mainly operating on
females (i.e. decreased tness caused by fl con ict cost from male actions). An
interesting parallel is what Clutton-Brock (2007) wrote concerning sexual selection
in females: fi ' that despite Darwin s (1871) broad de nition of sexual selection in
both sexes, intrasexual competitive ability of individuals is thought to contribute
to sexual selection if it occurs in males but not in females (e.g. competition for
food to offspring). Maybe such narfi fl fl rowing of the research eld is re ected in
sexual con ict if female fl costs are attributed to the con ict, while male costs of
missed opportunity of reproduction are considered as sexual selection. This is
despite the possibility that it might be a female adaptation that prevents the male
from reaching his optimum mating rate. Perhaps ' ' ' ' a clear division between harm
costs and lost opportunity costs would make it easier to acknowledge costs for males.
fi The scienti c language used could be an important factor involved in shaping the
gender skew in consideration of costs. As it is, costs are imposed by active traits
(of males) on an individual fl (female) with con ict traits or behaviours that have a
more vulnerable resonance (e.g. resistance). Thus, only active terminology implies
that a trait infers costs. In turn, this could strongly affect which experiments are
conducted and thus which research results we will get. As a result, stereotyping may
have limited the research questions and therefore not have provided an accurate fl
picture of sexual con icts in nature. Male Costs and Interpretation of Behaviour in
Empirical Studies Both models and the terms describing sexually antagonistic fl
traits imply that there are no costs in icted on males. It is possible fl that the
costs in icted on males are implicitly there, for example through lost opportunity
costs of mating if females develop higher resistance towards males. If so, this
assumption should be made explicit and preferably empirically investigated, which
until now has not been done (Fig. 2). In fact, it is possible to study costs of both
' sexes within the same experiment. An example is Holland &amp; Rice s (1999) study
in which imposed monogamy resulted in less antagfi onism from both sexes and higher
population tness. Incorporating costs of both sexes could have been done in several
other studies. In Rice (1996), for instance, the experimental arrest of female but
not male evolution resulted in reduced female survivorship. It would be both
interesting and possible to arrest male evolution to infer how fi male tness
components change when evolution of female antagonistic traits is allowed. fi Where
would one then expect to nd male costs? The empirical evidence is scarce, but some
examples are already present: survival during mating in isopods (Benesh et al. 2007 )
and cannibalism in (cf. Arnqvist &amp; Rowe 2005). The traits that male spiders
spiders possess to avoid being cannibalized (such as long legs, agility and
vigilance) are said to represent sexually antagonistic adaptations, not resistance or
counteradaptations! There are other cases where a male cost could be discussed, for
example self-mutilation in spiders to insert a mating plug in females (in some
species this selfmutilation is so extensive that the males become castrated; Kuntner
et al. 2009a, b), or when females metabolize and neutralize potentially harmful
substances in the sperm ejaculate (Arnqvist &amp; Nilsson 2000). The reduction in
relative mating success following neutralization of sperm toxins will be comparable
to that in other males in sperm competition, but the actual cost comes from the e
female antagonistic trait (toxin neutralization; cf. female female competition:
Clutton-Brock 2007). Although the costs to females of toxic accessory gland proteins
in the ejaculate have been much discussed, the potential costs a male incurs from
female manipulation of his ejaculates are, to our knowledge, not mentioned. Another
example of a potential male cost is the sucking behaviour (digesting or removing
seminal components) of recipients of the hermaphroditic marine worm Macrostomum sp.
(Sch&#xE4;rer et al. 2004). All these examples call for increased attention fl and a
less constrained view of male costs in sexual con ict research (see Fricke et al.
2009).<component x="301.83" y="49.88" width="251.15" height="562.44" page="4"

literature surveys may arise from factors other than gender bias, that is, a
preconceived view of sex roles. For example, theory and research may have sprung
fromwhat is most elaborate and conspicuous in nature. Thus, arms races and ' ' the
more severe battle of the sexes may be what attract scientists fi fl in the rst
place. It may be that, since sexual con ict theory emerged from sexual selection,
research has continued on the path of sexual selection where males are attributed
most variation and action. It could also be that as science changes with time, we may
fl eventually reach a state where more features of sexual con ict are studied in both
sexes. However, whatever the reason is for the stereotypic pattern we discern, it may
be worth asking what this bias is due to and how it will affect research. As sexual
selection research now suggests that the sex roles are less distinct than previously
thought, and because important insights may be gained by looking outside the
conventional sex fi roles (Cunningham &amp; Birkhead 1998), it should be bene cial
for fl sexual con ict theory to deal with the roles the sexes are assigned. Indeed,
stereotyped theories may constrain rather than broaden our views and approaches. As
another parallel from sexual selection theory, the importance of incorporating mutual
choice in mate choice models, not using the traditional approach with only one sex
that chooses, has been highlighted (Bergstrom &amp; Real 2000). We suggest that the
characterization of males and females as active and reactive (and bearing costs),
respectively, may hamper the future fl development of sexual con ict research. For
example, female fl adaptations and male costs may be overlooked and con ict dynamics
may not be fully understood. If there is a potential problem with the use of
stereotypic sex fl roles in sexual con ict research, what should we do to overcome
this bias? Even though we ourselves ponder these questions, we also fall into the
same traps when designing experiments and when ' ' writing articles. One reason is
that it is easiest to do what others do and when communicating research it is
convenient to use the common terminology to be best understood. However, if theory be
general it is worth being careful with terminology, should striving to develop broad
models (see Gowaty &amp; Hubbell 2005, fl 2009) and designing empirical studies in
which the same con ict features are studied in both sexes. For example, in cases with
hermaphrodites, where evidence is now accumulating for the fl occurrence of sexual
con icts (Koene 2006; Lankinen &amp; Kiboi 2007; Bedhomme et al. 2009; Madjidian
&amp; Lankinen 2009), conventional fi thinking about sex roles may be dif cult or
even useless.<component x="311.52" y="175.48" width="251.14" height="447.27" page="5"

research may be an unattainable fl ' goal as scientists perceptions are in uenced by
the paradigm they work within (Kuhn 1962; discussed with regard to sexual selection
in Fausto-Sterling 1981; Fox Keller 1982). We believe that researchers in sexual
selection can develop a more accurate picture fl of the sexual con ict process by
becoming aware of and acknowledging their biases and daring to take a step further.
Good examples of how this has paved the way for new research are that male mate ' '
choice is becoming a hot topic (e.g. Bonduriansky 2009) and that female harassment of
males (Bro-Jorgensen 2007) has recently been considered. Of course, we are not
diminishing the importance fl of previous sexual con ict research, through which
important fl insights into con ict dynamics have been obtained. However, fi whenever
a new research eld is established it may be wise to learn from the past and not fall
into old traps. We hope that these fl re ections will encourage fruitful discussions
that will help researchers consider their potential biases, gain new insights into
their study systems or rediscover some overlooked aspects of the fi theory.
Ultimately, objective research is a scienti c goal, and normfi free thinking, here in
terms of gender, may be a rst step towards fl fi a more objective sexual con ict
research eld.<component x="311.54" y="49.89" width="251.14" height="91.66" page="5"

contributed to important insights in evolutionary research, but has also been
subjected to controversy and debate since Darwin (1871). Much of the debate has been
devoted to the relative importance and degree of sexual selection in the two sexes
(Brown Blackwell 1875 cited in Fausto-Sterling 1997; Gowaty 1997; Clutton-Brock
2007), of which much may stem from the fact that we, as researchers, have a
preconceived view of how the sexes should act. In recent years, several authors have
pointed at weaknesses and misinterpretations in the theory of sexual selection
(Clutton-Brock 2007; Snyder &amp; Gowaty 2007; Kokko &amp; Jennions 2008; Roughgarden
&amp; Ak&#xE7;ay 2010), mainly concerning the use of sex roles and how they are
assigned. Well-known examples include the common extrapolation from anisogamy to sex
roles stemming from Trivers (1972) (Gowaty 1997; Tang' Martinez 1997), the
overreliance on Bateman s principle as an explanation of mating system differences
between species (Bateman 1948; Tang-Martinez &amp; Ryder 2005; Snyder &amp; Gowaty
2007; Brown et al. 2009) and the use of operational sex ratio (OSR) rather than both
OSR and adult sex ratio (ASR) when determining sex roles (Kokko &amp; Jennions 2008).

theory from other viewpoints, namely the language used, both for stereotypic
description of the sexes, for example coy females (Hrdy 1986; Martin 1991; Fox Keller
2004), and for using anthropomorphic terms with provocative connotations, for example
rape (Gowaty 1982). Accumulated evidence from different taxa shows a more diverse
nature of the sexes than traditionally thought, through male mate choice (reviewed in
Bonduriansky 2001; Hill 1993; Amundsen et al. 1997; Gowaty et al. 2003; Bel-Venner et
al. 2008; H&#xE4;rdling et al. 2008; Bonduriansky 2009), female competition (e.g.
Kempenaers 1994; Slagsvold &amp; Lifjeld 1994; Sandell &amp; Smith 1996; Rosvall
2008; Rillich et al. 2009) and species with mutual mate choice (Jones &amp; Hunter
1993; Gowaty et al. 2002; Forsgren et al. 2004; modelled in Bergstrom &amp; Real
2000). For example, which sex is predominantly competitive does not determine whether
that sex discriminates between mates, as both sexes can be simultaneously competitive
and choosy (Berglund et al. 2005). The use of conventional sex roles and
anthropomorphic interpretations may in fact have affected sexual selection research
by delaying the realization and acceptance of female cryptic choice (Birkhead &amp;
Pizzari 2002). In international workshops it has therefore been suggested to look
beyond conventional sex roles (Cunningham &amp; Birkhead 1997; Kvarnemo et al. 2009),
and proposals have been made on how to overcome the biased research tradition (e.g.
Gowaty &amp; Hubbell 2005; Kokko &amp; Jennions 2008). However, the fl debate has not
yet addressed sexual con ict studies, although fl sexual con ict theory emerged from
sexual selection (reviewed in Bonduriansky 2009). fl The novelty in sexual con ict
theory lies within the sexually antagonistic selection (Parker 1979) rather than
selection through fi mutual bene ts as in classic sexual selection theory (Darwin
1871; fl ' Andersson 1994). That is, in a sexual con ict the sexes selection
gradients are opposing. This means that a given trait may be selected for in one
direction for males and in another for females. Previously, the focus of sexual
selection research was on how variance in male reproductive success is generated
(Shuster &amp; Wade 2003), via both male competition and female choice. With fl the
advent of sexual con ict research, the focus has shifted towards female costs of
reproduction and how both sexes strive to reach fi their tness interests. fl In this
review, we explore sexual con ict in the frame of the insights of stereotyping in
sexual selection research. Ideas on what sex roles encompass may have the capacity to
affect how research is carried out; thus a continued use of conventional sex roles
may hamper research by limiting the potential research questions. This fi fl is the
rst study to address how sexual con ict theory has been conceptualized with regard to
sex roles. To identify whether and to fl fl what extent sexual con ict research re
ects conventional sex roles, and whether this affects research, we performed two
literature fi searches. In the rst, we focused on the terminology describing sexually
antagonistic traits. This allowed us to contrast differences in how the sexes are
described. If the previous discussion of stereotyped terminology in sexual selection
research is acknowlfi fi edged, we would expect to nd neutral or nonsex-speci c
terms. In the second literature search, we explored which parameters are fl taken
into account in sexual con ict models, because only the parameters that are included
will be considered as important for fl fl ' the con ict s outcome. If sexual con ict
research makes use of fi stereotyped sex roles we would expect to nd a consistent
pattern throughout both terminology and theoretical models where distinct words and
characters are assigned to the sexes, and where these words and characters imply
active males and passive females.<component x="311.52" y="77.24" width="251.13"

have utilized several terms illustrating how males and females respond to each other
during fl ' ' ' ' a sexual con ict (e.g. arms race , battle of the sexes , ' 'tug of
war ), have also coined terms describing the sexually antagonistic and traits. By
examining the 30 most cited studies that included the fl ' ' keyword sexual con ict
in Web of Science (28 May 2009, including reviews, empirical and theoretical
studies), we assessed which terms are most used (see Appendix for references). The
citation e range for the 30 studies was 90 390. Of the 30 studies, 23 used terms
describing sexually antagonistic traits and altogether we found 17 different terms
for males and 11 for females (Fig. 1). The empirical studies used fewer terms (nine
in a total of 10 articles) compared to the reviews (21 in a total of 12 articles) and
the model papers (16 in a total of eight articles). The terms describing sexually fi
antagonistic traits were highly sex speci c. Some examples are, for males,
harassment, manipulation, coercion, persistence and adaptation, and, for females,
resistance, avoidance, counteradaptation, reluctance and reduction (see Fig. 1). By
categorizing each trait as active, as reactive or as neutral we could quantify the
difference (see ' ' Fig. 1 for categorization of terms). By reactive we mean that the
trait is a response to another act, and that the response trait itself does not fuel
reactions by the opposite sex. We let two independent people categorize the traits,
listed alphabetically, without any information on whether the terms stemmed from
males or females. fi The terms classi ed differently by the two persons were excluded
from the analysis. These excluded terms were words that may be fi dif cult to
categorize because they either fall into a different part of speech or are ambiguous.
For example, persistence is one of the most common terms used for describing male
antagonistic traits, but it could also be understood in the sense of species
persistence. We investigated whether there was a difference between how the sexes
were described. We found that males were described as active 2 187.39, P 0.0001).
These terms may and females as reactive ( &lt; 2 c &#xBC; imply three things: (1) it
is the male that has the upper hand (the male adapts while the female counteradapts;
Parker 1979), (2) males seem to have more diverse and aggressive ways of safe' '
guarding their interests while females most often resist and (3) the fl terminology
partially re ects sex-stereotypic notions. fl Parameters Included in Sexual Con ict
Models: Methods and Results We surveyed all theoretical models obtained under the
keyword fl ' ' sexual con ict in BIOSIS (performed 4 March 2009, N 26); both &#xBC;
verbal and mathematical models were included but not reviews (see Table 1 for
references). Models for which it was impossible to fl assess the con ict parameters
(e.g. where the main focus is outside fl the con ict or where costs are not
incorporated at all) were ' ' excluded. By cost , we here mean cost arising from
mating, parental investment or antagonistic interactions, but not the cost of fl
producing antagonistic traits. Thus only costs that are in icted by the opposite sex
and not the costs that an individual bears from its own adaptations are considered.
When cost for trait production is incorporated in models it is most often accounted
for in both sexes and included besides the actual mating or parental investment cost,
fi fl which we have here de ned as con ict cost (see e.g. Parker 1979; Lankinen et
al. 2006). Our aim was not to question the mathematical correctness of the models,
but rather to examine how extensive they are and how much variation exists between
them, with regard to sex roles. From this literature study, it is evident that fl
female cost is what has mainly been investigated in sexual con ict fl research (Table
1). Fourteen articles include only female con ict fi costs or tness reduction in
their model while none considers a cost for the male only (Table 1). The number of
articles that include both fl a male and a female cost is very high; 12 papers
consider con ict costs for both sexes (Table 1). Among the articles that include both
fl fl male and female con ict costs, six model con icts over parental care. Models
over mating rate are represented only in the group fl with exclusively female con ict
costs. Thus, there is a clear difference in what kinds of costs are incorporated,
depending on the fl particular con ict. It is also worth noting that in some cases it
is assumed that males are always much more powerful than females (Clutton-Brock &amp;
Parker 1995 ), that males are allowed to choose fl con ict strategy before females
(Barta et al. 2002), and that their fi male tness never decreases with mating rate
(Haygood 2004). To investigate whether the trend found in the theoretical models is
fl fi valid for the wider sexual con ict eld, we performed an additional search on
male cost and female cost found in abstracts in BIOSIS fl (two searches: (1) female
cost sexual con ict , (2) female cost * * * * * * fl fl sexual con ict NOT male cost
sexual con ict , 25 May 2010). * * * * * * fl Of 284 abstracts, 145 included sexual
con ict and costs. This search fi con rmed the previous pattern: 106 abstracts
considered female costs while 30 took both sexes into account and only nine
considered male costs (Fig. 2).<component x="32.82" y="49.89" width="251.17"

most cited sexual con ict studies fi implies that males are offensive, that is, they
are the ones rst acquiring an antagonistic adaptation, which females then react to.
fi In true coevolution it is not possible to disentangle who acts rst; fi the idea
that males take the rst step may thus be caused by a sexstereotypic preconception. It
may of course be argued that, for purely physiological reasons, males would need to
take an active step to penetrate the female. But would this mean that all (or most)
female (re-)actions do not mediate further (re-)actions in males? One could also
compare this situation with other situations in e e coevolution, such as host
parasite or predator prey systems, where similar phrasing may be used with active
terms for the parasite and predator and defensive terms for the host and prey. e
Still, there is one difference: in male female coevolution both males and females
need something from their partner (in contrast to the prey, which does not need
anything from the predator) and it is in ' both sexes interest to reproduce. They
just differ in when, howoften and with whom. The current characterization of sex
roles in sexual fl con ict research can be compared to how females were described in
more passive terms, for example as coy, in traditional sexual selection. Thus, males
are described with active and females with reactive phrasing (Fig. 1), although both
actively affect each other. In the hermaphroditic garden snail Helix aspersa, sperm
is digested by the recipient, and it has been suggested that sperm digestion could
indeed be a direct cost to the male sexual function (see e.g. Rogers &amp; Chase
2001; Arnqvist &amp; Rowe 2005). In these snails the male part inserts a so-called
love dart in the female genitalia, which seals the entrance and allows sperm to
escape digestion. The love dart could be explained as a resistance adaptation to the
(our note: manipulative) sperm digestion performed by the female sexual function.
However, the love dart may be ' inserted to manipulate the recipient s sperm
digestion (Rogers &amp; Chase 2001). It is clearly the male that would suffer a cost,
but still the response is not described with a reactive term but with an active one
(manipulation). Why are different words used for describing antagonistic traits
depending on whether it is a male or a female that is imposing a cost on the partner?
Could it be that the antagonistic terms are based on a traditional view of
conventional sex roles, that is, that in western human society males are
traditionally considered as active and females as passive? Our concern is not that
the traits and behaviours are described with different words in the two sexes per se.
It is rather the different connotations that are present throughout the terminology,
and, in turn, how these will affect us as researchers that are our concern. The image
of reactive females implied by the terminology may affect ' the research carried out;
for example the male s response to female antagonism and the subsequent negative
effects in males may not be investigated. Indeed, it should be possible to use the
neutral term ' ' sexually antagonistic trait for both males and females, and if
necessary describe the trait further. Also, in both males and females a sexually
antagonistic trait can be considered as a manipulation ' ' ' ' rather than
differentiating between manipulation and resistance . The anthropomorphic terminology
used for describing behaviour and traits could further have affected the choice of
study fl species. So far, only a few studies have investigated sexual con icts
organisms beyond bisexual animal species (Bedhomme et al. in fi 2009). Active
actions, such as force, may be dif cult to envisage in plants and in animals with
very primitive mental resources, and the stereotypic terminology may limit research
to only separate-sexed ' ' ' ' animals. That is, sex-stereotypic terms such as harass
and resist will certainly give a picture of a male and a female engaged in
reproduction and other sexual systems may not be associated with ' such terms. Also,
the captivating words describing the sexes inter' ' ' ' actions ( battle , war etc.)
may be problematic in this respect. This fi may be relevant for other elds of
evolutionary biology, in particular sexual selection theory, where anthropomorphic
description makes fi it seemingly dif cult to apply the theory, for example to

the importance of de ning and fi measuring net costs and bene ts of each sex when
investigating fl sexual con ict (Chapman et al. 2003; Fricke et al. 2009). However,
fl we found that most sexual con ict models focus on costs only for the female (Table
1). This was particularly evident in modelled fl con ict over mating rate. The
potential costs that males in nature may suffer from female antagonistic actions
(i.e. the costs for not fl reaching the male optimum) in con ict over mating are not
fl explored. Models of sexual con ict over parental care seem to have fi ' a more
neutral approach to assessing the sexes costs and bene ts fl fi ' ' in the con ict,
taking both males and females tness interests into account. This may be a consequence
of the fact that which is the care-giving sex varies between different groups of
organisms, opening our eyes to the idea that care may be a maternal, paternal fl or
biparental task. In such con icts both sexes may have similar choices of staying or
deserting, and face the same consequential fi fl costs and bene ts. In con ict over
mating rate, however, the sexes may have very different choices and face different
consequences. Of course, no model could address all possible parameters but there may
be a bias in what factors are incorporated. Although mathematically correct, the
models leave out the possibility of negative effects on males from female
antagonistic actions. How accurately fl fl does such a theoretical approach re ect
how sexual con ict operker (1979) divided the costs of mating into ates in nature?
Par ' ' power (relative contest costs, i.e. cost of enforcing victory, the average
rates of expenditure of contest costs and the ability to fl fi ' ' in ict damage) and
value of winning (relative tness difference between mating and not mating). The cost
of power could be equally big for a male or a female, while the value of winning is
thought to be smaller for females (Parker 1979). This idea comes from the assumption
that sexual selection operates more intensely on males than on females, because the
reproductive potential of males is often greater (Parker 1979). The assumption that
female fi tness decreases at higher mating rates is present already in fi fl ' Parker
s (1979) paper, the rst on sexual con ict theory. This view may stem from Bateman
(1948) and has been criticized elsewhere (Tang-Martinez &amp; Ryder 2005; Snyder
&amp; Gowaty 2007; Brown et al. 2009). There is support for the idea that females
gain directly from polyandry in terms of increased lifetime offspring production
(Arnqvist &amp; Nilsson 2000). For both males and females, several different
relationships between fecundity and mating success are fl possible (Arnold 1994).
However, in models of sexual con ict, male fi tness is mainly viewed as linearly
increasing with number of fi matings (e.g. Gavrilets et al. 2001), while female tness
is optimal at an intermediate mating rate. If mating rate is too high, female fi fi
tness decreases and females suffer a tness cost. Similarly, if mating rate is
decreased (from female antagonistic adaptations) fi male tness will be lower (than it
could potentially be with a higher fi mating rate): will a male not suffer a tness
cost similar to females? Or are females always supposed to be harmed, which gives an
fi additional cost besides a lower than optimal tness? Even if lowered male mating
rates actually give the same outcome as if male costs were explicitly incorporated,
there may be a problem with not acknowledging the decrease as costs. This view may
imply that it is primarily sexual selection that is operating in males (i.e. fi
decreased tness as lost opportunity of mating in comparison with fl other males) and
sexual con ict, with its important feature of direct fi costs, is mainly operating on
females (i.e. decreased tness caused by fl con ict cost from male actions). An
interesting parallel is what Clutton-Brock (2007) wrote concerning sexual selection
in females: fi ' that despite Darwin s (1871) broad de nition of sexual selection in
both sexes, intrasexual competitive ability of individuals is thought to contribute
to sexual selection if it occurs in males but not in females (e.g. competition for
food to offspring). Maybe such narfi fl fl rowing of the research eld is re ected in
sexual con ict if female fl costs are attributed to the con ict, while male costs of
missed opportunity of reproduction are considered as sexual selection. This is
despite the possibility that it might be a female adaptation that prevents the male
from reaching his optimum mating rate. Perhaps ' ' ' ' a clear division between harm
costs and lost opportunity costs would make it easier to acknowledge costs for males.
fi The scienti c language used could be an important factor involved in shaping the
gender skew in consideration of costs. As it is, costs are imposed by active traits
(of males) on an individual fl (female) with con ict traits or behaviours that have a
more vulnerable resonance (e.g. resistance). Thus, only active terminology implies
that a trait infers costs. In turn, this could strongly affect which experiments are
conducted and thus which research results we will get. As a result, stereotyping may
have limited the research questions and therefore not have provided an accurate fl
picture of sexual con icts in nature. Male Costs and Interpretation of Behaviour in
Empirical Studies Both models and the terms describing sexually antagonistic fl
traits imply that there are no costs in icted on males. It is possible fl that the
costs in icted on males are implicitly there, for example through lost opportunity
costs of mating if females develop higher resistance towards males. If so, this
assumption should be made explicit and preferably empirically investigated, which
until now has not been done (Fig. 2). In fact, it is possible to study costs of both
' sexes within the same experiment. An example is Holland &amp; Rice s (1999) study
in which imposed monogamy resulted in less antagfi onism from both sexes and higher
population tness. Incorporating costs of both sexes could have been done in several
other studies. In Rice (1996), for instance, the experimental arrest of female but
not male evolution resulted in reduced female survivorship. It would be both
interesting and possible to arrest male evolution to infer how fi male tness
components change when evolution of female antagonistic traits is allowed. fi Where
would one then expect to nd male costs? The empirical evidence is scarce, but some
examples are already present: survival during mating in isopods (Benesh et al. 2007 )
and cannibalism in (cf. Arnqvist &amp; Rowe 2005). The traits that male spiders
spiders possess to avoid being cannibalized (such as long legs, agility and
vigilance) are said to represent sexually antagonistic adaptations, not resistance or
counteradaptations! There are other cases where a male cost could be discussed, for
example self-mutilation in spiders to insert a mating plug in females (in some
species this selfmutilation is so extensive that the males become castrated; Kuntner
et al. 2009a, b), or when females metabolize and neutralize potentially harmful
substances in the sperm ejaculate (Arnqvist &amp; Nilsson 2000). The reduction in
relative mating success following neutralization of sperm toxins will be comparable
to that in other males in sperm competition, but the actual cost comes from the e
female antagonistic trait (toxin neutralization; cf. female female competition:
Clutton-Brock 2007). Although the costs to females of toxic accessory gland proteins
in the ejaculate have been much discussed, the potential costs a male incurs from
female manipulation of his ejaculates are, to our knowledge, not mentioned. Another
example of a potential male cost is the sucking behaviour (digesting or removing
seminal components) of recipients of the hermaphroditic marine worm Macrostomum sp.
(Sch&#xE4;rer et al. 2004). All these examples call for increased attention fl and a
less constrained view of male costs in sexual con ict research (see Fricke et al.
2009).<component x="301.83" y="49.88" width="251.15" height="562.44" page="4"

literature surveys may arise from factors other than gender bias, that is, a
preconceived view of sex roles. For example, theory and research may have sprung
fromwhat is most elaborate and conspicuous in nature. Thus, arms races and ' ' the
more severe battle of the sexes may be what attract scientists fi fl in the rst
place. It may be that, since sexual con ict theory emerged from sexual selection,
research has continued on the path of sexual selection where males are attributed
most variation and action. It could also be that as science changes with time, we may
fl eventually reach a state where more features of sexual con ict are studied in both
sexes. However, whatever the reason is for the stereotypic pattern we discern, it may
be worth asking what this bias is due to and how it will affect research. As sexual
selection research now suggests that the sex roles are less distinct than previously
thought, and because important insights may be gained by looking outside the
conventional sex fi roles (Cunningham &amp; Birkhead 1998), it should be bene cial
for fl sexual con ict theory to deal with the roles the sexes are assigned. Indeed,
stereotyped theories may constrain rather than broaden our views and approaches. As
another parallel from sexual selection theory, the importance of incorporating mutual
choice in mate choice models, not using the traditional approach with only one sex
that chooses, has been highlighted (Bergstrom &amp; Real 2000). We suggest that the
characterization of males and females as active and reactive (and bearing costs),
respectively, may hamper the future fl development of sexual con ict research. For
example, female fl adaptations and male costs may be overlooked and con ict dynamics
may not be fully understood. If there is a potential problem with the use of
stereotypic sex fl roles in sexual con ict research, what should we do to overcome
this bias? Even though we ourselves ponder these questions, we also fall into the
same traps when designing experiments and when ' ' writing articles. One reason is
that it is easiest to do what others do and when communicating research it is
convenient to use the common terminology to be best understood. However, if theory be
general it is worth being careful with terminology, should striving to develop broad
models (see Gowaty &amp; Hubbell 2005, fl 2009) and designing empirical studies in
which the same con ict features are studied in both sexes. For example, in cases with
hermaphrodites, where evidence is now accumulating for the fl occurrence of sexual
con icts (Koene 2006; Lankinen &amp; Kiboi 2007; Bedhomme et al. 2009; Madjidian
&amp; Lankinen 2009), conventional fi thinking about sex roles may be dif cult or
even useless.<component x="311.52" y="175.48" width="251.14" height="447.27" page="5"

research may be an unattainable fl ' goal as scientists perceptions are in uenced by
the paradigm they work within (Kuhn 1962; discussed with regard to sexual selection
in Fausto-Sterling 1981; Fox Keller 1982). We believe that researchers in sexual
selection can develop a more accurate picture fl of the sexual con ict process by
becoming aware of and acknowledging their biases and daring to take a step further.
Good examples of how this has paved the way for new research are that male mate ' '
choice is becoming a hot topic (e.g. Bonduriansky 2009) and that female harassment of
males (Bro-Jorgensen 2007) has recently been considered. Of course, we are not
diminishing the importance fl of previous sexual con ict research, through which
important fl insights into con ict dynamics have been obtained. However, fi whenever
a new research eld is established it may be wise to learn from the past and not fall
into old traps. We hope that these fl re ections will encourage fruitful discussions
that will help researchers consider their potential biases, gain new insights into
their study systems or rediscover some overlooked aspects of the fi theory.
Ultimately, objective research is a scienti c goal, and normfi free thinking, here in
terms of gender, may be a rst step towards fl fi a more objective sexual con ict
research eld.<component x="311.54" y="49.89" width="251.14" height="91.66" page="5"
