method has been developed for the simultaneous monitoring of &gt;250 pesticides and
veteri' ' nary drugs (VDs) in animal feed. A dilute-and-shoot extraction with water
and acetonitrile (1 % formic acid) followed by a clean-up step with Florisil
cartridges was applied. The extracts were analysed by ultra-high performance liquid
chromatography coupled to hybrid analyser quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry
using both positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The detection of the
residues was accomplished by retention time and accurate mass using an in-house
database. The identification of the detected compounds was carried out by searching
of fragment ions for each compound and isotopic pattern. The optimised method was
validated and recoveries ranged from 60 % to 120 % at three concentrations (10, 50
and &#x2212;1 100 g kg ) for 30 %, 68 % and 80 % of compounds, &#x3BC; respectively,
included in the database (364) in chicken feed. Document SANCO 12495/2011 and

inter-day precisions, expressed as relative standard deviations, were lower than 20 %
for more than 90 % of compounds. 1 &#x2212; The limits of quantification ranged from

veterinary drugs (VDs) in food industries is widespread, and they are utilised to
fight against plagues [1] and treat diseases that could affect animals [2]. However,
their fraudulent use can result in the presence of residues in the final animal
products [3, 4], which involves several problems to public health such as the
increased risk of allergies, the development of antibioticresistant bacteria and
harmful effects on the human system (e.g. carcinogenic effects) [5, 6]. The study of
pesticide and VD residues in animal feed is an important issue because they can reach
the food chain. On the one hand, animal feed is usually employed to administer drugs
to animals [7] and, on the other hand, they can be prepared with several ingredients,
which are not always free of pesticides [3]. Consequently, in order to ensure animal
safety, the European Union (EU) has established regulations for the control of
residues in feed, setting maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides [8] and VDs
[9, 10]. Moreover, Regulation (EC) 1831/2003 banned the use of all antibiotics other
than coccidiostats and histomonostats as feed additives (used as growth promoters)
since 1 January 2006. Furthermore, these products have been completely banned on
December 2012 [11]. Thus, VDs should be strictly applied for the prevention or
treatment of diseases. In this way, these regulated limits require the determination
of an extremely high number of VD and pesticide residues in feed with the aim of
ensuring their use in a rational and safe way. Therefore, sensitive and reliable
methodologies have been developed for the analysis of each group of residues
separately. The determination of pesticides in feed has been - based on Soxhlet [12
14], pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) [15], matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD)
[16] or QuEChERS [17]. Some of these procedures have been followed by a clean-up step
based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) [14, 18] or dispersive SPE (d-SPE) [17], and
subsequent chromatographic analysis by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to electron
capture detection (ECD) [12, 14], mass spectrometry (MS) [13, 15] or tandem mass
spectrom- etry (MS/MS) [12, 14, 16 18]. For the determination of VDs, solvent
extraction assisted by mechanical shaking - [19 22], modified QuEChERS methodology
[23] and PLE - [24, 25] followed by SPE clean-up [19 21, 24, 25] or - liquid liquid
extraction (LLE) [22] have been utilised, using - liquid chromatography coupled to MS
(LC MS) [19] or - - MS/MS (LC MS/MS) [20 25] methodologies. Normally, most of these
methods are focused on specific groups of residues, not being suitable for wide-scope
multiresidue analysis able to cover different classes of residues and contaminants.
However, the use of wide-scope methods inherently involves the need for generic
extraction procedures, and this strategy shortens the possibilities for cleanup steps
[26, 27], in order to minimise analyte losses. Nevertheless, the lack of selectivity
in sample preparation can be compensated by selectivity/sensitivity in instrumental
analysis. Although in terms of sensitivity, the use of GC or LC coupled to triple
quadrupole (QqQ) is usually preferred, and the number of compounds that can be
acquired by these techniques in one run is limited [28, 29]. The use of
high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), such as timeof-flight (TOF), hybrid
quadrupole-time-of-flight (QqTOF) or Orbitrap [29], is considered as a powerful
alternative. These full-scan technologies provide the selectivity and the sensitivity
required for efficient and wide-range screening, as they combine high, full-spectral
sensitivity with high mass resolution, allowing the measurement of accurate mass of
any ionisable component in the sample. In this way, the combination of ultra-high
performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) with TOF, QqTOF or Orbitrap analysers has
demonstrated to be an excellent tool for the analysis of different classes of
residues and contaminants in food and - environmental samples [30 32]. However, the
number of applications in feed matrices is quite limited [28, 33, 34], where a group
of pesticides, VDs, mycotoxins and plant toxins are determined in horse feed [28, 33]
and coccidiostats in animal feed [34]. Therefore, the aim of this work is the
development of a reliable and sensitive methodology based on the use of - - advanced
UHPLC QqTOF MS technique for the quantitative determination and reliable
identification of more than 250 pesticides and VDs in different types of feed
matrices using generic methods.<component x="306.14" y="75.19" width="238.09"

it was linearly decreased up to 0 % in 7 min. This composition was held during 4 min
before returning to the initial composition in 0.5 min, followed by a

The flow rate was 0.3 mL min and the column temperature was set at 30 &#xB0;C.
Aliquots of 5 L of the sample &#x3BC; extract were injected into the chromatographic
system. The UHPLC system was coupled to a QqTOF (Xevo &#x2122; QtofMS, Waters)

function (LE) using a collision energy of 4 eV with poor or no fragmentation; and (2)
high energy function (HE) using collision energy of 30 eV, promoting collision cell
fragmentation. All the analyses were performed using a - lock spray with internal

the ion source and ion transmission parameters were studied. To this aim, a
solvent&#x2212;1 based standard at 250 g L was injected into the system, &#x3BC; in
positive and negative mode, and different parameters of the source and the analyser
(scan time, inter-scan time and collision energy of the acquisition functions of LE
and HE E employed in the MS mode) were optimised in order to improve absolute
sensitivity of the characteristic ions, observing that the conditions indicated in
the previous section provided suitable results. Secondly, in relation to the
chromatographic conditions, generic chromatographic conditions reported in a previous
study [35] were used. The overall analysis time was 14 min, and the retention time
ranged from 0.9 (cyromazine) to 9.4 min (narasin and salinomycin). In order to
develop a database for the detection of the target compounds, the analytes were
characterised and the essential information includes retention time (RT), ionisation
mode (polarity), characteristic ions and possible adducts (i.e. with + + Na or NH ).
In this way, a solvent standard solution of the 4 &#x2212;1 studied compounds at 250
g L was analysed. Because the &#x3BC; - QqTOF MS instrument utilised in this study
cannot acquire simultaneously in (+) and ( ), two separate injections were &#x2212;
needed for each polarity mode. The compounds were monitored employing narrow mass
extraction windows (10 ppm) within their characteristic RT windows (RTWs). Exact mass
values, characteristic ions, RTWs, ionisation mode and mass errors for the studied
VDs and pesticides are shown in Table S1, Electronic Supplementary Material.
Regarding the identification of the detected compounds, it was necessary to select
fragments for each compound, taking into account the identification requirements
provided by the SANCO guidelines [36]. In the case of QqTOF working at high
resolution and mass accuracy, the detection of two or more diagnostic ions
(quasi-molecular ion and at least one fragment ion) with mass accuracy &lt;5 ppm is
required. Besides, the comparison of the obtained and the theoretical isotopic
patterns was carried out. For that pur&#x2212;1 pose, a solvent-based standard at 250
g L was injected &#x3BC; and MS/MS acquisitions were obtained. In this way, the peak
shape of the extracted chromatogram for each fragment (in the HE acquisition
function) was compared to that of the main ion (in the LE acquisition function)
checking that both traces showed the same RT and elution profile. Moreover, accurate
mass errors must be &lt;5 ppm, as well as the isotopic pattern of the fragment ion

developed by Mol et al. [33] allowed the extraction of a wide set of pesticides, VDs
and other contaminants in feed. A slight modification of this method has already been
employed for the simultaneous determination of pesticides and VDs in other matrices
such as honey in our laboratory [35], and it was selected as the starting point
herein. Initially, the experiments were carried out employing blank chicken feed
samples spiked at 1 &#x2212; 100 g kg . As result of this first assay, 75 % of the
&#x3BC; compounds (275 compounds) showed acceptable recoveries - (acceptable range 60
125 %). Tetracyclines and penicillins were not successfully extracted, and some
quinolones and avermectins did not show adequate performance characteristics. This
could be due to the high volume of acetonitrile employed, which is not efficient to
extract polar analytes like tetracyclines and penicillins because of co-precipitation
of some analytes with the proteins. However, the chromato- - grams obtained after
UHPLC QqTOF MS analysis showed numerous background interference peaks for some
compounds (Fig. 1a). This can be explained because of the complexity of this matrix,
which contains cereals, sugars/fruits, fats, roots/tubers, leguminous/oleaginous
plants, amino acids and/or minerals [7]. Therefore, the high complexity of the matrix
makes the clean-up of the extracts almost mandatory to obtain reliable results,
except in cases where the sensitivity of the method is high enough to offer the
option of simply diluting the extracts. Hence, clean-up is an important step when
extracts are analysed with TOF, which has showed lower sensitivity than other HRMS
analyser, such as Orbitrap, in certain food applications [38]. Bearing in mind this
and the results obtained in the first experiment, an additional clean-up stage was
checked. In this way, three fast clean-up procedures were evaluated: (1) d-SPE with
Florisil, (2) d-SPE with C18 and (3) SPE employing Florisil cartridges. For d-SPE
clean-ups, 1 mL of sample extract was taken to an Eppendorf tube containing 100 mg of
Florisil or C18 dispersive phase. The mixture was shaken in a vortex for 1 min and
then it was centrifuged for 5 min at 4,500 rpm (2,264&#xD7;g). The final extract was
collected and was placed in a vial. To test SPE clean-up, 1 mL of the extract was
loaded onto the Florisil cartridge. The final extract was collected and placed in a
vial for injection. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 2, and it can be observed
that they are similar regarding the number of extracted compounds, although slightly
better recovery results were obtained when SPE-Florisil was used. Furthermore, the '
' clean-up with Florisil cartridges provided cleaner chromatograms (Fig. 1b) with an
apparent lower number of interference peaks and slightly better sensibility.
Therefore, the generic approach using a SPE clean-up &#x2212;1 further validation: 10

Supplementary Material. It can be observed that intra- and inter-day precision values
were always 20 % for the majority of compounds (Table S2, Electronic &#x2264;
Supplementary Material). LOQs obtained for the studied compounds (Table S2,
Electronic Supplementary Material) were lower than or equal 1 &#x2212;1 &#x2212; to
10 g kg for 43 % of the compounds, equal to 50 g kg &#x3BC; &#x3BC; &#x2212;1 for 37
% and equal to or higher than 200 g kg in sample for &#x3BC; 6 % of the target
compounds (Table 1). Some compounds showed LOQs higher than the lowest level of
concentration at which they can be recovered, as heptenophos or isoxicam (Table S2,
Electronic Supplementary Material). It can be explained due to the quasi-molecular
ion, which was used for quantification, could be perfectly detected at concentrations
lower than the LOQ. However, the fragments were not detected at such low
concentration because of the low sensitivity of the fragments. In these cases, the
isotopic pattern was used for the reliable identification of the compounds at
concentrations lower than LOQ. Additionally, the feasibility of the method for the
analysis of target compounds in different types of feed was checked. Thus, three
additional types of feed (hen, rabbit and horse feed) were submitted to validation.
Firstly, we tested if chicken feed could be selected as representative matrix for
these three types of feed. Matrix effect was evaluated and &#x2212;1 the same
concentrations (from 1 to 150 g kg ) were &#x3BC; analysed in each type of feed.
Then, the slopes of the calibration curves were compared with the slope of the
calibration curve obtained in chicken feed samples. A significant difference was
observed among the tested feed matrices. In the case of hen feed, 21 % of the
compounds showed significant differences with chicken feed, whereas in rabbit and
horse feed, the number of compounds with significantly different slopes was higher,
69 % and 67 %, respectively. Therefore, it was not possible to select one type of
feed as a representative matrix, which is probably due to the different composition
of each type of feed (type of nutritional properties), requiring specific
matrix-matched calibration standards. Moreover, trueness and repeatability were also
evaluated following the same procedure employed<component x="306.14" y="236.76"

&#x3BC; &#x2212;1 at 100 g kg . For rabbit feed, these percentages are 22 % &#x3BC; 1

&#x2212;1 50 g kg and 59 % (216 compounds) at 100 g kg . &#x3BC; &#x3BC; Finally for
horse feed, the number of compounds with adequate figures of merit was 24 % (88
compounds) at 1 1 &#x2212; &#x2212; 10 g kg , 57 % (209 compounds) at 50 g kg and
&#x3BC; &#x3BC; &#x2212;1 64 % (234 compounds) at 100 g kg . As expected, the &#x3BC;
number of compounds extracted in hen, rabbit and horse feed with acceptable recovery
was considerably lower than in chicken feed due to the fact that these matrices have
different composition (especially different fatty content) and they can be considered
more complex. Finally, LOQs obtained for each compound in the matrices evaluated are
shown in Table S3, Electronic Supplementary Material. It can be observed that 69 % of
compounds showed 1 &#x2212; LOQs 50 g kg in hen feed, whereas in rabbit and horse
&#x3BC; &#x2264; 1 &#x2212; feed, the number of compounds with LOQs 50 g kg was
&#x3BC; &#x2264; 55 % and 61 %, respectively. Table 1 shows a summary of the results
obtained for all the matrices. As aforementioned, some compounds showed LOQs higher
than the lowest concentration at which they can be recovered. Again, these compounds
showed problems to detect the fragment at LOQ concentration, although their
quasi-molecular ion was perfectly detected. Despite the higher levels of LOQ obtained
for some compounds, many of them were lower than MRLs established by the legislation
for some specific compounds, as it can be seen in Table 2. In general, it can be
observed that the obtained LOQs were relatively high. This can be explained bearing
in mind E the acquisition mode of the fragments based on the MS procedure. Despite
its aforementioned advantages, the sucE cess of the MS approach can be limited by the
quality of the spectrum [31]. The low sensitivity or strongly interfered spectra make
difficult the identification of compounds using fragments at low concentrations. As
aforementioned, many analytical methods have been developed for the determination of
compounds belonging to one family of pesticides or VDs in feed [7, 14, 23, 39, 40].
Nevertheless, the number of multi-class or wide-scope multiclass methods is scarce.
In consequence, it is important to highlight the ability of the proposed method to
analyse a high variety of pesticides and VDs in different feed samples. If the
proposed method is compared with the published multi-class methods developed for the
determination of VDs [22, 24, 41] and pesticides [15, 17] in feed, it can be
indicated that the combination of a generic extraction method with - - UHPLC QqTOF MS
analysis is simpler and faster than<component x="51.02" y="74.84" width="238.21"

presented methodology increased sample throughput because it only requires a rapid
clean-up step through Florisil cartridges instead of d-SPE clean-up [17, 41], LLE
followed by concentration step [22] or an extraction by SPE [24]. In relation to the
number of validated compounds, the proposed method allowed the determination and
quantification of an average of 200 compounds in different feed improving the number
of compounds of other works: 33 VDs [41], 10 prohibited medical additives (three
analytes were analysed in qualitative mode) [22], 18 antibacterials [24] and 33 [15]
and 122 [17] pesticides. Concerning the performance characteristics, the developed
method allowed the extraction and quantification of a high 1 &#x2212; number of VDs
and pesticides at low levels (10 g kg ). &#x3BC; These results are better than those
obtained in a previous multi-class method developed for the determination of 122
pesticides [17], where some pesticides were validated at a &#x2212;1 higher
concentration, 50 g kg (for example atrazine, car&#x3BC; 1 &#x2212; baryl or
metalaxyl). In another study, 100 g kg was the &#x3BC; lowest level at which
antibacterial compounds were determined [22]. In contrast to this, a multi-class
method developed for the analysis of 33 VDs [41] showed good recoveries at low
&#x2212;1 levels (&lt;10 g kg ). &#x3BC; Regarding LOQs, the obtained values in the
proposed &#x2212;1 method (ranged from 4 to 200 g kg in sample) were &#x3BC; lower
than those obtained in two previous works [17, 22]. - The first one determined
pesticides in wheat grain (7 1 &#x2212; 400 g kg ) [17] and the second one measured
VDs in &#x3BC; 1 &#x2212; - pig and poultry compound feed (100 169 g kg ) [22].
&#x3BC; However, other works showed better LOQs, such as those obtained by Boscher et
al. [41] (LOQs ranging from 3.8 to &#x2212;1 65 g kg in sample, piglet feed) and by
Kantiani et al. [24] &#x3BC; &#x2212;1 (instrumental LOQs from 0.57 to 2.92 g kg ).
These low &#x3BC; LOQ values can be explained due to the fact that both works
employed QqQ as analyser, which showed better sensitivity E than QqTOF using MS .
Moreover, these methods were developed for a limited number of compounds. One of the
main disadvantages of the proposed method is that it was not able to extract and
quantify some families of compounds, such as tetracyclines, quinolones or
penicillins, which were analysed in other works [24, 41] with good recoveries, and
therefore, current work is focused on this. If it is compared with the two wide-scope
multi-class methods previously developed for analysis of VDs and pesticides in feed
samples (horse feed and cereal-based product, respectively) [33, 42], some advantages
can be mentioned. Firstly, the generic extraction method was developed from Mol et
al. [33], which is similar to the method proposed in this work, with a slight
modification by the addition of a simple clean-up step. Secondly, the generic
extraction method is faster than the method developed by van der Lee et al. [42],
where the extraction time was 18 h and it required a clean-up procedure by gel
permeation chromatography and SPE. Furthermore, the number of pesticides and VDs
validated with our method was higher or similar than the number of compounds of both
works, 106 compounds [42] and 222 [33], respectively. Finally, regarding LOQs, both
methods showed similar values compared with our method. In one of these works, the
instrumental LOQs 1 &#x2212; ranged from 1 to 46 g kg [33]. [42], and in the other
one, LODs &#x3BC; &#x2212;1 ranged from 10 to 50 g kg &#x3BC;<component x="306.14"

method has been developed for the simultaneous monitoring of &gt;250 pesticides and
veteri' ' nary drugs (VDs) in animal feed. A dilute-and-shoot extraction with water
and acetonitrile (1 % formic acid) followed by a clean-up step with Florisil
cartridges was applied. The extracts were analysed by ultra-high performance liquid
chromatography coupled to hybrid analyser quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry
using both positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The detection of the
residues was accomplished by retention time and accurate mass using an in-house
database. The identification of the detected compounds was carried out by searching
of fragment ions for each compound and isotopic pattern. The optimised method was
validated and recoveries ranged from 60 % to 120 % at three concentrations (10, 50
and &#x2212;1 100 g kg ) for 30 %, 68 % and 80 % of compounds, &#x3BC; respectively,

veterinary drugs (VDs) in food industries is widespread, and they are utilised to
fight against plagues [1] and treat diseases that could affect animals [2]. However,
their fraudulent use can result in the presence of residues in the final animal
products [3, 4], which involves several problems to public health such as the
increased risk of allergies, the development of antibioticresistant bacteria and
harmful effects on the human system (e.g. carcinogenic effects) [5, 6]. The study of
pesticide and VD residues in animal feed is an important issue because they can reach
the food chain. On the one hand, animal feed is usually employed to administer drugs
to animals [7] and, on the other hand, they can be prepared with several ingredients,
which are not always free of pesticides [3]. Consequently, in order to ensure animal
safety, the European Union (EU) has established regulations for the control of
residues in feed, setting maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides [8] and VDs
[9, 10]. Moreover, Regulation (EC) 1831/2003 banned the use of all antibiotics other
than coccidiostats and histomonostats as feed additives (used as growth promoters)
since 1 January 2006. Furthermore, these products have been completely banned on
December 2012 [11]. Thus, VDs should be strictly applied for the prevention or
treatment of diseases. In this way, these regulated limits require the determination
of an extremely high number of VD and pesticide residues in feed with the aim of
ensuring their use in a rational and safe way. Therefore, sensitive and reliable
methodologies have been developed for the analysis of each group of residues
separately. The determination of pesticides in feed has been - based on Soxhlet [12
14], pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) [15], matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD)
[16] or QuEChERS [17]. Some of these procedures have been followed by a clean-up step
based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) [14, 18] or dispersive SPE (d-SPE) [17], and
subsequent chromatographic analysis by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to electron
capture detection (ECD) [12, 14], mass spectrometry (MS) [13, 15] or tandem mass
spectrom- etry (MS/MS) [12, 14, 16 18]. For the determination of VDs, solvent
extraction assisted by mechanical shaking - [19 22], modified QuEChERS methodology
[23] and PLE - [24, 25] followed by SPE clean-up [19 21, 24, 25] or - liquid liquid
extraction (LLE) [22] have been utilised, using - liquid chromatography coupled to MS
(LC MS) [19] or - - MS/MS (LC MS/MS) [20 25] methodologies. Normally, most of these
methods are focused on specific groups of residues, not being suitable for wide-scope
multiresidue analysis able to cover different classes of residues and contaminants.
However, the use of wide-scope methods inherently involves the need for generic
extraction procedures, and this strategy shortens the possibilities for cleanup steps
[26, 27], in order to minimise analyte losses. Nevertheless, the lack of selectivity
in sample preparation can be compensated by selectivity/sensitivity in instrumental
analysis. Although in terms of sensitivity, the use of GC or LC coupled to triple
quadrupole (QqQ) is usually preferred, and the number of compounds that can be
acquired by these techniques in one run is limited [28, 29]. The use of
high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), such as timeof-flight (TOF), hybrid
quadrupole-time-of-flight (QqTOF) or Orbitrap [29], is considered as a powerful
alternative. These full-scan technologies provide the selectivity and the sensitivity
required for efficient and wide-range screening, as they combine high, full-spectral
sensitivity with high mass resolution, allowing the measurement of accurate mass of
any ionisable component in the sample. In this way, the combination of ultra-high
performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) with TOF, QqTOF or Orbitrap analysers has
demonstrated to be an excellent tool for the analysis of different classes of
residues and contaminants in food and - environmental samples [30 32]. However, the
number of applications in feed matrices is quite limited [28, 33, 34], where a group
of pesticides, VDs, mycotoxins and plant toxins are determined in horse feed [28, 33]
and coccidiostats in animal feed [34]. Therefore, the aim of this work is the
development of a reliable and sensitive methodology based on the use of - - advanced
UHPLC QqTOF MS technique for the quantitative determination and reliable
identification of more than 250 pesticides and VDs in different types of feed
matrices using generic methods.<component x="306.14" y="75.19" width="238.09"

evaluated performing matrix-matched calibration, using blank feed extracts and adding

the ion source and ion transmission parameters were studied. To this aim, a
solvent&#x2212;1 based standard at 250 g L was injected into the system, &#x3BC; in
positive and negative mode, and different parameters of the source and the analyser
(scan time, inter-scan time and collision energy of the acquisition functions of LE
and HE E employed in the MS mode) were optimised in order to improve absolute
sensitivity of the characteristic ions, observing that the conditions indicated in
the previous section provided suitable results. Secondly, in relation to the
chromatographic conditions, generic chromatographic conditions reported in a previous
study [35] were used. The overall analysis time was 14 min, and the retention time
ranged from 0.9 (cyromazine) to 9.4 min (narasin and salinomycin). In order to
develop a database for the detection of the target compounds, the analytes were
characterised and the essential information includes retention time (RT), ionisation
mode (polarity), characteristic ions and possible adducts (i.e. with + + Na or NH ).
In this way, a solvent standard solution of the 4 &#x2212;1 studied compounds at 250
g L was analysed. Because the &#x3BC; - QqTOF MS instrument utilised in this study
cannot acquire simultaneously in (+) and ( ), two separate injections were &#x2212;
needed for each polarity mode. The compounds were monitored employing narrow mass
extraction windows (10 ppm) within their characteristic RT windows (RTWs). Exact mass
values, characteristic ions, RTWs, ionisation mode and mass errors for the studied
VDs and pesticides are shown in Table S1, Electronic Supplementary Material.
Regarding the identification of the detected compounds, it was necessary to select
fragments for each compound, taking into account the identification requirements
provided by the SANCO guidelines [36]. In the case of QqTOF working at high
resolution and mass accuracy, the detection of two or more diagnostic ions
(quasi-molecular ion and at least one fragment ion) with mass accuracy &lt;5 ppm is
required. Besides, the comparison of the obtained and the theoretical isotopic
patterns was carried out. For that pur&#x2212;1 pose, a solvent-based standard at 250
g L was injected &#x3BC; and MS/MS acquisitions were obtained. In this way, the peak
shape of the extracted chromatogram for each fragment (in the HE acquisition
function) was compared to that of the main ion (in the LE acquisition function)
checking that both traces showed the same RT and elution profile. Moreover, accurate
mass errors must be &lt;5 ppm, as well as the isotopic pattern of the fragment ion
must be similar to the theoretically profile of the empirical formulae.<component

developed by Mol et al. [33] allowed the extraction of a wide set of pesticides, VDs
and other contaminants in feed. A slight modification of this method has already been
employed for the simultaneous determination of pesticides and VDs in other matrices
such as honey in our laboratory [35], and it was selected as the starting point
herein. Initially, the experiments were carried out employing blank chicken feed
samples spiked at 1 &#x2212; 100 g kg . As result of this first assay, 75 % of the
&#x3BC; compounds (275 compounds) showed acceptable recoveries - (acceptable range 60
125 %). Tetracyclines and penicillins were not successfully extracted, and some
quinolones and avermectins did not show adequate performance characteristics. This
could be due to the high volume of acetonitrile employed, which is not efficient to
extract polar analytes like tetracyclines and penicillins because of co-precipitation
of some analytes with the proteins. However, the chromato- - grams obtained after
UHPLC QqTOF MS analysis showed numerous background interference peaks for some
compounds (Fig. 1a). This can be explained because of the complexity of this matrix,
which contains cereals, sugars/fruits, fats, roots/tubers, leguminous/oleaginous
plants, amino acids and/or minerals [7]. Therefore, the high complexity of the matrix
makes the clean-up of the extracts almost mandatory to obtain reliable results,
except in cases where the sensitivity of the method is high enough to offer the
option of simply diluting the extracts. Hence, clean-up is an important step when
extracts are analysed with TOF, which has showed lower sensitivity than other HRMS
analyser, such as Orbitrap, in certain food applications [38]. Bearing in mind this
and the results obtained in the first experiment, an additional clean-up stage was
checked. In this way, three fast clean-up procedures were evaluated: (1) d-SPE with
Florisil, (2) d-SPE with C18 and (3) SPE employing Florisil cartridges. For d-SPE
clean-ups, 1 mL of sample extract was taken to an Eppendorf tube containing 100 mg of
Florisil or C18 dispersive phase. The mixture was shaken in a vortex for 1 min and
then it was centrifuged for 5 min at 4,500 rpm (2,264&#xD7;g). The final extract was
collected and was placed in a vial. To test SPE clean-up, 1 mL of the extract was
loaded onto the Florisil cartridge. The final extract was collected and placed in a
vial for injection. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 2, and it can be observed
that they are similar regarding the number of extracted compounds, although slightly
better recovery results were obtained when SPE-Florisil was used. Furthermore, the '
' clean-up with Florisil cartridges provided cleaner chromatograms (Fig. 1b) with an
apparent lower number of interference peaks and slightly better sensibility.
Therefore, the generic approach using a SPE clean-up &#x2212;1 further validation: 10
g kg &#x3BC; step was chosen and tested at lower concentrations in the &#x2212;1 and

Electronic Supplementary Material) were lower than or equal 1 &#x2212;1 &#x2212; to

% and equal to or higher than 200 g kg in sample for &#x3BC; 6 % of the target
compounds (Table 1). Some compounds showed LOQs higher than the lowest level of
concentration at which they can be recovered, as heptenophos or isoxicam (Table S2,
Electronic Supplementary Material). It can be explained due to the quasi-molecular
ion, which was used for quantification, could be perfectly detected at concentrations
lower than the LOQ. However, the fragments were not detected at such low
concentration because of the low sensitivity of the fragments. In these cases, the
isotopic pattern was used for the reliable identification of the compounds at
concentrations lower than LOQ. Additionally, the feasibility of the method for the
analysis of target compounds in different types of feed was checked. Thus, three
additional types of feed (hen, rabbit and horse feed) were submitted to validation.
Firstly, we tested if chicken feed could be selected as representative matrix for
these three types of feed. Matrix effect was evaluated and &#x2212;1 the same
concentrations (from 1 to 150 g kg ) were &#x3BC; analysed in each type of feed.
Then, the slopes of the calibration curves were compared with the slope of the
calibration curve obtained in chicken feed samples. A significant difference was
observed among the tested feed matrices. In the case of hen feed, 21 % of the
compounds showed significant differences with chicken feed, whereas in rabbit and
horse feed, the number of compounds with significantly different slopes was higher,
69 % and 67 %, respectively. Therefore, it was not possible to select one type of
feed as a representative matrix, which is probably due to the different composition
of each type of feed (type of nutritional properties), requiring specific
matrix-matched calibration standards. Moreover, trueness and repeatability were also
evaluated following the same procedure employed<component x="306.14" y="236.76"

compounds) at 1 1 &#x2212; &#x2212; 10 g kg , 57 % (209 compounds) at 50 g kg and
&#x3BC; &#x3BC; &#x2212;1 64 % (234 compounds) at 100 g kg . As expected, the &#x3BC;
number of compounds extracted in hen, rabbit and horse feed with acceptable recovery
was considerably lower than in chicken feed due to the fact that these matrices have
different composition (especially different fatty content) and they can be considered
more complex. Finally, LOQs obtained for each compound in the matrices evaluated are
shown in Table S3, Electronic Supplementary Material. It can be observed that 69 % of
compounds showed 1 &#x2212; LOQs 50 g kg in hen feed, whereas in rabbit and horse
&#x3BC; &#x2264; 1 &#x2212; feed, the number of compounds with LOQs 50 g kg was
&#x3BC; &#x2264; 55 % and 61 %, respectively. Table 1 shows a summary of the results
obtained for all the matrices. As aforementioned, some compounds showed LOQs higher
than the lowest concentration at which they can be recovered. Again, these compounds
showed problems to detect the fragment at LOQ concentration, although their
quasi-molecular ion was perfectly detected. Despite the higher levels of LOQ obtained
for some compounds, many of them were lower than MRLs established by the legislation
for some specific compounds, as it can be seen in Table 2. In general, it can be
observed that the obtained LOQs were relatively high. This can be explained bearing
in mind E the acquisition mode of the fragments based on the MS procedure. Despite
its aforementioned advantages, the sucE cess of the MS approach can be limited by the
quality of the spectrum [31]. The low sensitivity or strongly interfered spectra make
difficult the identification of compounds using fragments at low concentrations. As
aforementioned, many analytical methods have been developed for the determination of
compounds belonging to one family of pesticides or VDs in feed [7, 14, 23, 39, 40].
Nevertheless, the number of multi-class or wide-scope multiclass methods is scarce.
In consequence, it is important to highlight the ability of the proposed method to
analyse a high variety of pesticides and VDs in different feed samples. If the
proposed method is compared with the published multi-class methods developed for the
determination of VDs [22, 24, 41] and pesticides [15, 17] in feed, it can be
indicated that the combination of a generic extraction method with - - UHPLC QqTOF MS
analysis is simpler and faster than<component x="51.02" y="74.84" width="238.21"

presented methodology increased sample throughput because it only requires a rapid
clean-up step through Florisil cartridges instead of d-SPE clean-up [17, 41], LLE
followed by concentration step [22] or an extraction by SPE [24]. In relation to the
number of validated compounds, the proposed method allowed the determination and
quantification of an average of 200 compounds in different feed improving the number
of compounds of other works: 33 VDs [41], 10 prohibited medical additives (three
analytes were analysed in qualitative mode) [22], 18 antibacterials [24] and 33 [15]
and 122 [17] pesticides. Concerning the performance characteristics, the developed
method allowed the extraction and quantification of a high 1 &#x2212; number of VDs
and pesticides at low levels (10 g kg ). &#x3BC; These results are better than those
obtained in a previous multi-class method developed for the determination of 122
pesticides [17], where some pesticides were validated at a &#x2212;1 higher
concentration, 50 g kg (for example atrazine, car&#x3BC; 1 &#x2212; baryl or
metalaxyl). In another study, 100 g kg was the &#x3BC; lowest level at which
antibacterial compounds were determined [22]. In contrast to this, a multi-class
method developed for the analysis of 33 VDs [41] showed good recoveries at low
&#x2212;1 levels (&lt;10 g kg ). &#x3BC; Regarding LOQs, the obtained values in the
proposed &#x2212;1 method (ranged from 4 to 200 g kg in sample) were &#x3BC; lower
than those obtained in two previous works [17, 22]. - The first one determined
pesticides in wheat grain (7 1 &#x2212; 400 g kg ) [17] and the second one measured
VDs in &#x3BC; 1 &#x2212; - pig and poultry compound feed (100 169 g kg ) [22].
&#x3BC; However, other works showed better LOQs, such as those obtained by Boscher et
al. [41] (LOQs ranging from 3.8 to &#x2212;1 65 g kg in sample, piglet feed) and by
Kantiani et al. [24] &#x3BC; &#x2212;1 (instrumental LOQs from 0.57 to 2.92 g kg ).
These low &#x3BC; LOQ values can be explained due to the fact that both works
employed QqQ as analyser, which showed better sensitivity E than QqTOF using MS .
Moreover, these methods were developed for a limited number of compounds. One of the
main disadvantages of the proposed method is that it was not able to extract and
quantify some families of compounds, such as tetracyclines, quinolones or
penicillins, which were analysed in other works [24, 41] with good recoveries, and
therefore, current work is focused on this. If it is compared with the two wide-scope
multi-class methods previously developed for analysis of VDs and pesticides in feed
samples (horse feed and cereal-based product, respectively) [33, 42], some advantages
can be mentioned. Firstly, the generic extraction method was developed from Mol et
al. [33], which is similar to the method proposed in this work, with a slight
modification by the addition of a simple clean-up step. Secondly, the generic
extraction method is faster than the method developed by van der Lee et al. [42],
where the extraction time was 18 h and it required a clean-up procedure by gel
permeation chromatography and SPE. Furthermore, the number of pesticides and VDs
validated with our method was higher or similar than the number of compounds of both
works, 106 compounds [42] and 222 [33], respectively. Finally, regarding LOQs, both
methods showed similar values compared with our method. In one of these works, the
instrumental LOQs 1 &#x2212; ranged from 1 to 46 g kg [33]. [42], and in the other
one, LODs &#x3BC; &#x2212;1 ranged from 10 to 50 g kg &#x3BC;<component x="306.14"

carried out for every batch of samples to check if the system is under control, and
it implies four matrix-matched calibrations (in chicken, hen, rabbit and horse),
reagent blanks, full procedural blanks and &#x2212;1 . Instrument blanks were
fortified extracts at 150 g kg &#x3BC; composed of methanol and were analysed at the
beginning of the batch. Since analyte signals were not found in the instrumental
blanks, no further actions were taken. Full procedural blanks were prepared by four
different types of feed sample extracted and analysed after instrumental blanks. This
experiment showed zero carry-over for all the analytes, ensuring that no
cross-contamination was taking place. As aforementioned, analyte detection and
identification ' was based on the criteria showed in section Detection and '
identification of the analytes . When the samples were analysed by the proposed
method, seven samples contained traces of VDs and pesticides (Table 3). Some VDs
(sulfadiazine, trimetoprim, robenidine and monensin sodium) and one pesticide
(chlorpyrifos) were detected. Sulfadiazine and trimethoprim were detected in two 1
&#x2212; chicken samples. One of them contained 1,114 g kg of &#x3BC; &#x2212;1
sulfadiazine and 225 g kg of trimethoprim, and the other &#x3BC; 1 &#x2212;1 &#x2212;
one contained 217 g kg of sulfadiazine and 72 g kg of &#x3BC; &#x3BC; trimethoprim.
Sulfadiazine, which is an antibiotic that belongs to the group of sulphonamides, is a
synthetic bacteriostatic compound that is commonly used to treat urinary tract
infections. On the other hand, trimethoprim is a dihydropteroate synthetase inhibitor
that is commonly used in combination with sulphonamides for broad-spectrum
antimicrobial therapy. In veterinary medicines, the combination of sulphonamides with
trimethoprim is widely used for prevention and treatment of respiratory or
gastro-intestinal tract infections in cattle, swine and poultry [43]. Robenidine was
detected in a rabbit , being this level lower than the MRL &#x2212;1 sample at 4,186
