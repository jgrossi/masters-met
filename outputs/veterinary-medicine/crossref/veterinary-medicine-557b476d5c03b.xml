October 2010; revised 22 December 2010; accepted 23 December 2010 Objectives: To
describe the use of antimicrobials in a veterinary teaching hospital for companion
animals in Italy, with particular regard to the agreement with recommendations of
prudent use Methods: The study was conducted with a retrospective, cross-sectional
design. The population under investigation included 18905 cats and dogs that were
referred to the hospital between 2000 and 2007. Two different samples of the clinical
paper forms were randomly selected to estimate the prevalence of animals receiving an
antimicrobial prescription and to describe the pattern of antimicrobials used in
relation to the condition being treated. The proportion of antimicrobials prescribed
accomplishing recommendations of prudent use was also estimated, as well as the level
of agreement with specific, diagnosis-based guidelines for antimicrobial use. b
Results: Broad-spectrum antimicrobials, including penicillins with -lactamase
inhibitors, first-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, were the most
frequently prescribed compounds. Antimicrobials prescribed with the support of
microbiological analyses and susceptibility testing were less than 5%. Among the
recommendation of prudent use, the availability of information from laboratory
testing had the poorest degree of agreement, while the other evaluated items were
accomplished in most of the cases. Conclusions: Our results highlight the need to
improve the procedures of antimicrobial prescription in the study setting. This can
be achieved by supporting the guidance for antimicrobial use at the local level, with
the adoption of specific guidelines, and at the national level with a further
implementation of the policies of prudent prescriptions. Keywords: Introduction Over
the last several decades antimicrobial resistance has been considered one of the most
relevant issues in public health due to its dramatic increase worldwide in both
pathogenic and commensal bacteria. The relatively scarce availability in recent years
of new antimicrobial drugs has also contributed to increase the 1 concern. The
adoption of common and harmonized actions between countries and between human and
animal health has been claimed, since 1998, as the most effective approach in 2
facing this global problem. In particular, the adoption of policies of prudent use
such as those recommended by the European 3 Union (EU) in human medicine, as well as
regulatory actions, including limiting the use of certain antimicrobials in food
animals, have been seen as effective tools to preserve the efficacy of
antimicrobials. antimicrobial resistance, prudent use, animal health, veterinary
medicine The threat for human health posed by antimicrobial use in animals arises
from the risk of transferring resistant bacteria or 4 resistance genetic determinants
to humans. The role of companion animals as potential reservoirs of resistant and
multiresistant pathogens for humans has recently received increasing 4 - 7 attention.
Companion animals live in close contact with humans and share with them the
environment and exposures to many sources of pathogens, thus making easy the exchange

recommendations of prudent use issued by international scientific bodies have been
only partially implemented in specific regulatory acts, while different guidelines
for prudent use in dogs and cats are available. Most of these are aimed at addressing
edu9 - 13 cational purposes, while others are more practically applicable in field
conditions, guiding veterinarians in the treatment 14 - 16 of specific conditions in
pets. In Italy, no specific guidelines for prudent use in companion animals are
available and professional guidance for the responsible use of antimicrobials relies
on the best practices addressed by general recommen17 dations of prudent use issued
by the Ministry of Health. 18 Antimicrobials are prescription-only drugs, and
although the regulations in force in both veterinary and human medicine assign the
responsibility of the use of antimicrobials to prescribing veterinarians or
physicians, the general regulatory framework of prudent use is low and no coordinated
national action plans have been implemented in recent years in veterinary or human
medicine. Herein we present the results of a retrospective survey on the use of
antimicrobials in dogs and cats in a university teaching hospital. The aim of the
survey was to describe the pattern of use of antimicrobials with regard to the
clinical condition to treat and evaluate how recommendations of prudent use have been
applied.<component x="42.52" y="423.22" width="257.98" height="279.07" page="2"

University of Pisa (central Italy) hosts one of the 14 schools of Veterinary Medicine
present in Italy (5 in the north, 3 in the centre and 6 in the south, including the
islands of Sicily and Sardinia), as well as a 3 year postgraduate school in small
animal pathology and clinics. The mean annual number of students who graduate in the
school in Pisa is 19 76, representing 6% of all new graduated veterinarians in Italy.
The school is organized into three departments and includes a veterinary teaching
hospital for companion animals. Activities carried out in the hospital include all
diagnostic, clinical and preventive practices, including veterinary primary
healthcare activities. Twelve practitioners usually participate in the clinical
activities, which also involve the students, who compulsorily perform a training
period of 6 months in the hospital before their graduation. The catchment area of the
hospital includes mainly central Italy, and the hospital serves as the reference
point for other practitioners working nearby. During the study period, a mean of 2350
dogs and cats per year were newly admitted to the hospital. Study design, population
under study and sampling The study was conducted with a retrospective,
cross-sectional design. The population under study included 18905 clinical forms of
cats and dogs that were referred to the hospital between 2000 and 2007. All the data
used in the study were obtained by reviewing the individual standardized clinical
paper charts. These were filled in at the time of the first admittance of the animal
to the hospital and included follow-up information and the results of any other
examinations performed in the hospital. Each clinical chart was progressively
identified by a unique identification code (year - number); the complete list was
available in an electronic archive. In our study, only the information relative to

to the hospital was considered. Two different samples were randomly selected from the
population using randomly generated numbers: one for the estimation of the proportion
of animals with an antimicrobial prescription (prevalence of prescription) and the
other to more precisely describe the pattern of antimicrobials used and to evaluate
how they had been prescribed according to the prudent use recommendations. An
antimicrobial prescription was defined as a unique prescription of one or more
antimicrobial medicinal products issued on the same day by the veterinarian to treat
the condition specified by the diagnosis. To estimate the prevalence of
prescriptions, a sample not smaller than 897 clinical forms was calculated (expected
prevalence, 30%; maximum allowable error, 3%; confidence level, 95%). The pattern of
use of antimicrobials and how they had been prescribed with respect to the prudent
use recommendations were studied only for the antimicrobials for systemic
administration, with the exclusion of those prescribed in relation to a surgical
procedure. The latter, mainly prescribed for prophylactic purposes, were excluded
from the analysis because they were considered poorly informative with respect to the
criteria adopted in our study for the evaluation of prudent use. Evaluation of the
appropriateness focused, particularly, on drugs prescribed to treat gastroenteritis,
urinary tract infections (UTIs), respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and pyoderma.
The sample size was, therefore, calculated starting from the minimum required number
of clinical charts with the prescription of systemic antimicrobials for the treatment
of gastroenteritis, UTIs, RTIs and pyoderma. Because these charts accounted for 4.6%
of the total clinical paper charts, as estimated in the first sample, the number
needed for this purpose was 276 (expected proportion of appropriate use, 50%; maximum
allowable error, 5%; confidence level, 95%), leading to a total sample size of 5804
charts. This would have yielded an expected number of 871 clinical charts with a
prescription of systemic antimicrobials for the treatment of any condition, based on
the estimate obtained in the first sample (15%). Antimicrobials were described
according to the class, the route of administration and the condition treated. They
were categorized based on the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification
system, implemented in 1976 by the WHO, or the ATC classification system for 21 and
were also ranked by importance veterinary medicinal products, in human medicine
according to the FAO/WHO/OIE categorization of Cri22 tically Important Antimicrobials
for Human Medicine. Compliance with prudent use recommendations was evaluated for
each antimicrobial using the items included in the guidelines issued by 9 the
Federation of Veterinarians of Europe. These were availability of a diagnosis;
availability of microbiological and susceptibility testing; use of a product approved
for the species; respect of the dosage regimen 20 at Universidade Federal de Minas
Gerais on June 12, 2015http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from and duration of
treatment; avoidance of the empirical combination of two or more antimicrobials; and
limitation, as much as possible, of the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. In
particular, for evaluation of the intake daily dose and the duration of treatment,
the criteria were considered satisfied if the intake daily dose respected the
labelled dose + range recommended by the manufacturer ( 20%) in the package leaflet
and if the duration of treatment was longer than 5 days. The intake daily dose was
computed in mg/kg by multiplying the quantity of active compound prescribed times the
daily number of administrations, divided by the weight of the animal. Since the use
of antimicrobials should not be evaluated without taking into account the specific
condition being treated, the pharmacological properties of the antimicrobials and the
characteristics of the animals, the diagnosis-based guidelines for antimicrobial use
in compa15 nion animals, published by Guardabassi et al. in 2008, were used to
evaluate the appropriateness of the compounds prescribed for the treatment of
gastroenteritis, UTIs, RTIs and pyoderma. Antimicrobials were,<component x="311.81"

be used empirically, without the indication of a microbiological examination or
susceptibility testing), second choice (could be used based on a microbiological
examination) and last resort (could be used based on susceptibility testing and only
if no other antimicrobials of the first or second choice could be used). The use of
an antimicrobial was defined as appropriate whenever all the specific requirements
for the class of choice were met and only if the antimicrobial was not prescribed in
an empirical combination with other antimicrobials. The use of antimicrobials under
any other conditions was considered inappropriate. Data management and statistical
analysis Data entry and data management were carried out using EpiInfo 3.3.2 (CDC,
Atlanta, GA, USA). The dataset was validated by checking the values for consistency,
plausibility and coherence. Incorrect values were classified as 'missing'.
Categorical variables were described using counts and percentages with the relative
95% confidence interval (95% CI). Differences in 2 x proportions were assessed for
statistical significance by the or Fisher's exact test, when needed. The existence of
trends in the use of the antimicrobial classes over the study period was tested by
the Cochrane-Armitage test for linear trend against the null hypothesis that no
association between proportions of antimicrobials used and , years exists. P values
0.05 were considered statistical significant. All the statistical analyses were
performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).<component x="42.52"

prescriptions The prevalence of antimicrobial prescriptions, as estimated from the
854 sampled clinical paper charts eventually collected (688 concerning dogs and 166
cats), was 30.6% (95% CI 27.5%-33.8%). A significantly higher prevalence of
prescriptions was found in cats (44.0%, 95% CI 36.3%-51.9%) compared with dogs
(27.3%, 95% CI 24.0%-30.8%). Two hundred and ninety-three antimicrobials were
recorded from the 261 animals with a prescription. Thirty-one prescriptions (11.9%)
included only topical drugs, 222 prescriptions (85.1%) included only drugs to be
administered systemically and 8 prescriptions (3.1%) included both. Animals receiving
an antimicrobial prescription in relation to a surgical procedure were 122 (46.7% of
all the prescriptions). These accounted for the 86.2% of total surgical cases
recorded in the sample. The most frequently prescribed drugs in surgical patients
were &#xBC; amoxicillin/clavulanate (n 89) and the association benzylpeni&#xBC;
cillin/streptomycin (n 15). Pattern of prescriptions of systemic antimicrobials not
related to surgical procedures One thousand and two clinical paper charts (747
concerning dogs and 255 cats) with a prescription of at least a systemic
antimicrobial not in relation to a surgical procedure were retrieved from the 5804
clinical forms sampled to study the pattern of use of antimicrobials. The total
number of antimicrobials included in the prescriptions was 1071. For 68 animals, a
prescription of two or more antimicrobials in an empirical combination was
found.<component x="42.52" y="197.47" width="258.03" height="217.12" page="3"

belonging to 12 pharmacological subgroups, were recorded. Three of these subgroups,
in particular, included the majority of the prescribed antimicro&#xBC; &#xBC; bials:
penicillins (n 327); cephalosporins (n 258); and quino&#xBC; lones (n 219). Among the
penicillins, penicillins with &#xBC; b -lactamase inhibitors (n 287) prevailed over
extended&#xBC; spectrum penicillins (n 39). Among cephalosporins, the &#xBC;
first-generation compounds (n 219) were prescribed most &#xBC; frequently, while
fluoroquinolones (n 218) accounted for almost all the quinolones subgroup. No
significant time trends in the usage of the antimicrobial pharmacological subgroups
were observed over the study period (Table 1), except for the rarely prescribed
intestinal antiinfectives group. Similarly, no significant differences in the use of
the pharmacological subgroups were observed between the two animal species, with the
exception of the first-generation cephalosporins, scarcely employed in cats and
frequently used in dogs, and the spiramycin/metronidazole combination, more
frequently employed in cats (Figure 1). As far as the clinical conditions were
concerned, most antimicrobials were prescribed to treat infections affecting the skin
(23.2%) and the gastrointestinal tract (19.0%), followed by genitourinary (14.0%) and
respiratory (13.6%) tract diseases. The distribution of antimicrobial compounds used
for the treatment of conditions affecting the different systems is reported in Table
2. Penicillins were prescribed in similar proportions (over the 20% of cases) for the
treatment of all the conditions, but did not seem to represent the elective compounds
for the treatment of any of them. Conversely, the treatment of skin and genitourinary
tract infections was performed using elective compounds; first-generation
cephalosporins for the treatment of skin infections and fluoroquinolones for the
genitourinary infections. The treatment of gastrointestinal tract infections involved
14 pharmaceutical classes, with the three most frequently used antimicrobials
(penicillins with -lactamase inhibitors, spiramycin/metronidazole and
fluoroquinolones) not exceeding, overall, the 59% of all compounds used to treat
these conditions. It is remarkable that a non-negligible proportion of the
antimicrobials used for the treatment of RTIs (9.7%) were third-generation
cephalosporins, an antimicrobial group considered of highly critical importance in
human medicine. In this respect, of the 1060 antimicrobials that b at Universidade
Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12, 2015http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from
could be classified according to the FAO/WHO/OIE classifi22 cation, 689 and 340 were
critically important and highly important antimicrobials, respectively. Among the
critically important group, 38.3% included compounds of the highest &#xBC; priority,
namely fluoroquinolones (n 218), third-generation &#xBC; &#xBC; cephalosporins (n 36)
and macrolides (n 9). The use of critically important antimicrobials predominated in
all the conditions, except in those affecting the skin and the eye (Figure 2).
Information on the route of administration, available for 802 antimicrobials, showed
that the use of products for oral admin&#xBC; istration (n 690) prevailed over those
for parenteral adminis&#xBC; tration (n 112), and accounted for 90% of the total
antimicrobials prescribed in dogs and 73% of the total antimicro, bials prescribed in
cats (P 0.001).<component x="311.81" y="66.85" width="289.66" height="635.44"

Whether our results reflect the behaviours of companion animal practitioners in
prescribing antimicrobials, at the local or national level, cannot be assessed due to
the lack of availability of other information sources, such as quantitative and
qualitative data on antimicrobials consumption. However, our findings are in
agreement with the results of a nationwide telephone sampling survey performed in
Italy in 2006, with the aim to describe, on a self-reported basis, the behaviours of
small animal practitioners in prescribing antimicro23 bials. In particular, both
studies highlighted the frequent attitude of veterinarians in using antimicrobials

antimicrobial susceptibility testing, in this study, most of the cases of pyoderma
were treated with properly chosen antimicrobials, mainly due to the frequent use of
drugs that fit the guideline requirements. Conversely, appropriate antimicrobials
represented only a small proportion of those administered in gastroenteritis and
RTIs, primarily due to the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in self14 limiting
infections that rarely require antimicrobial treatment. In such cases, the lack of a
proper diagnostic approach could have led to excess use of antimicrobials, which
represents a critical issue not only from a public health point of view, but also for
animal welfare. The frequent use of antimicrobials licensed for human use represents
another critical point of the prescription behaviours observed in our study, since
off-label use of human medicinal products in animals is one of the most clearly
regulated issues of prudent use. In Italy, as in the EU, the use of antimicrobials in
companion animals is strictly limited to those products properly authorized to treat
specific conditions in the target species, while the off-label use of products
licensed for other animal species or for the treatment of other conditions in the
same species, or for human use, is only allowed whenever no authorized products or
alternative antimicrobials for veterinary use are available, by way of exception and
under the direct personal responsibility of the prescribing veterinar18,28,29 ian.
Unfortunately no information on the reasons why human antimicrobials were so
frequently prescribed was available in our study. However, it cannot be excluded
that, for the same antimicrobial compound, the lower cost of products for human use
compared with those for veterinary use may have played a role. In conclusion, the
need to strengthen the professional guidance of prudent prescription is clearly
pointed out by the results of our study. At the local level, the development of
hospital guidelines for the stewardship of antimicrobials has 8 especially in
supporting the been reported to be effective, choice of antimicrobials for empirical
use. In any case, the adoption of a full diagnostic approach, including laboratory
testing, represents a crucial step that will help in preventing excess use or
facilitate the use of specific guidelines for prudent prescription. Further support
for prudent use, even at the local level, would arise from the implementation of
stronger policies governing antimicrobial use at the national level, considering the
current poor regulatory framework in force in Italy and the lack of specific
strategies supporting the prudent use of antimicrobials in both companion animals and
human medicine.<component x="42.52" y="196.45" width="258.07" height="505.84"

October 2010; revised 22 December 2010; accepted 23 December 2010 Objectives: To
describe the use of antimicrobials in a veterinary teaching hospital for companion
animals in Italy, with particular regard to the agreement with recommendations of
prudent use Methods: The study was conducted with a retrospective, cross-sectional
design. The population under investigation included 18905 cats and dogs that were
referred to the hospital between 2000 and 2007. Two different samples of the clinical
paper forms were randomly selected to estimate the prevalence of animals receiving an
antimicrobial prescription and to describe the pattern of antimicrobials used in
relation to the condition being treated. The proportion of antimicrobials prescribed
accomplishing recommendations of prudent use was also estimated, as well as the level
of agreement with specific, diagnosis-based guidelines for antimicrobial use. b
Results: Broad-spectrum antimicrobials, including penicillins with -lactamase
inhibitors, first-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, were the most
frequently prescribed compounds. Antimicrobials prescribed with the support of
microbiological analyses and susceptibility testing were less than 5%. Among the
recommendation of prudent use, the availability of information from laboratory
testing had the poorest degree of agreement, while the other evaluated items were
accomplished in most of the cases. Conclusions: Our results highlight the need to
improve the procedures of antimicrobial prescription in the study setting. This can
be achieved by supporting the guidance for antimicrobial use at the local level, with
the adoption of specific guidelines, and at the national level with a further
implementation of the policies of prudent prescriptions. Keywords: Introduction Over
the last several decades antimicrobial resistance has been considered one of the most
relevant issues in public health due to its dramatic increase worldwide in both
pathogenic and commensal bacteria. The relatively scarce availability in recent years
of new antimicrobial drugs has also contributed to increase the 1 concern. The
adoption of common and harmonized actions between countries and between human and
animal health has been claimed, since 1998, as the most effective approach in 2
facing this global problem. In particular, the adoption of policies of prudent use
such as those recommended by the European 3 Union (EU) in human medicine, as well as
regulatory actions, including limiting the use of certain antimicrobials in food
animals, have been seen as effective tools to preserve the efficacy of
antimicrobials. antimicrobial resistance, prudent use, animal health, veterinary
medicine The threat for human health posed by antimicrobial use in animals arises
from the risk of transferring resistant bacteria or 4 resistance genetic determinants
to humans. The role of companion animals as potential reservoirs of resistant and
multiresistant pathogens for humans has recently received increasing 4 - 7 attention.
Companion animals live in close contact with humans and share with them the
environment and exposures to many sources of pathogens, thus making easy the exchange

drugs, dosage and 8 duration of treatment. In companion animals, general
recommendations of prudent use issued by international scientific bodies have been
only partially implemented in specific regulatory acts, while different guidelines
for prudent use in dogs and cats are available. Most of these are aimed at addressing

conditions, guiding veterinarians in the treatment 14 - 16 of specific conditions in
pets. In Italy, no specific guidelines for prudent use in companion animals are
available and professional guidance for the responsible use of antimicrobials relies
on the best practices addressed by general recommen17 dations of prudent use issued
by the Ministry of Health. 18 Antimicrobials are prescription-only drugs, and
although the regulations in force in both veterinary and human medicine assign the
responsibility of the use of antimicrobials to prescribing veterinarians or
physicians, the general regulatory framework of prudent use is low and no coordinated
national action plans have been implemented in recent years in veterinary or human
medicine. Herein we present the results of a retrospective survey on the use of
antimicrobials in dogs and cats in a university teaching hospital. The aim of the
survey was to describe the pattern of use of antimicrobials with regard to the
clinical condition to treat and evaluate how recommendations of prudent use have been

University of Pisa (central Italy) hosts one of the 14 schools of Veterinary Medicine
present in Italy (5 in the north, 3 in the centre and 6 in the south, including the
islands of Sicily and Sardinia), as well as a 3 year postgraduate school in small
animal pathology and clinics. The mean annual number of students who graduate in the
school in Pisa is 19 76, representing 6% of all new graduated veterinarians in Italy.
The school is organized into three departments and includes a veterinary teaching
hospital for companion animals. Activities carried out in the hospital include all
diagnostic, clinical and preventive practices, including veterinary primary
healthcare activities. Twelve practitioners usually participate in the clinical
activities, which also involve the students, who compulsorily perform a training
period of 6 months in the hospital before their graduation. The catchment area of the
hospital includes mainly central Italy, and the hospital serves as the reference
point for other practitioners working nearby. During the study period, a mean of 2350
dogs and cats per year were newly admitted to the hospital. Study design, population
under study and sampling The study was conducted with a retrospective,
cross-sectional design. The population under study included 18905 clinical forms of
cats and dogs that were referred to the hospital between 2000 and 2007. All the data
used in the study were obtained by reviewing the individual standardized clinical
paper charts. These were filled in at the time of the first admittance of the animal
to the hospital and included follow-up information and the results of any other
examinations performed in the hospital. Each clinical chart was progressively

to the hospital was considered. Two different samples were randomly selected from the
population using randomly generated numbers: one for the estimation of the proportion
of animals with an antimicrobial prescription (prevalence of prescription) and the
other to more precisely describe the pattern of antimicrobials used and to evaluate
how they had been prescribed according to the prudent use recommendations. An
antimicrobial prescription was defined as a unique prescription of one or more
antimicrobial medicinal products issued on the same day by the veterinarian to treat
the condition specified by the diagnosis. To estimate the prevalence of
prescriptions, a sample not smaller than 897 clinical forms was calculated (expected
prevalence, 30%; maximum allowable error, 3%; confidence level, 95%). The pattern of
use of antimicrobials and how they had been prescribed with respect to the prudent
use recommendations were studied only for the antimicrobials for systemic
administration, with the exclusion of those prescribed in relation to a surgical
procedure. The latter, mainly prescribed for prophylactic purposes, were excluded
from the analysis because they were considered poorly informative with respect to the
criteria adopted in our study for the evaluation of prudent use. Evaluation of the
appropriateness focused, particularly, on drugs prescribed to treat gastroenteritis,
urinary tract infections (UTIs), respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and pyoderma.
The sample size was, therefore, calculated starting from the minimum required number
of clinical charts with the prescription of systemic antimicrobials for the treatment
of gastroenteritis, UTIs, RTIs and pyoderma. Because these charts accounted for 4.6%
of the total clinical paper charts, as estimated in the first sample, the number
needed for this purpose was 276 (expected proportion of appropriate use, 50%; maximum
allowable error, 5%; confidence level, 95%), leading to a total sample size of 5804
charts. This would have yielded an expected number of 871 clinical charts with a
prescription of systemic antimicrobials for the treatment of any condition, based on
the estimate obtained in the first sample (15%). Antimicrobials were described
according to the class, the route of administration and the condition treated. They
were categorized based on the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification
system, implemented in 1976 by the WHO, or the ATC classification system for 21 and
were also ranked by importance veterinary medicinal products, in human medicine
according to the FAO/WHO/OIE categorization of Cri22 tically Important Antimicrobials
for Human Medicine. Compliance with prudent use recommendations was evaluated for
each antimicrobial using the items included in the guidelines issued by 9 the
Federation of Veterinarians of Europe. These were availability of a diagnosis;
availability of microbiological and susceptibility testing; use of a product approved
for the species; respect of the dosage regimen 20 at Universidade Federal de Minas
Gerais on June 12, 2015http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from and duration of
treatment; avoidance of the empirical combination of two or more antimicrobials; and
limitation, as much as possible, of the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. In
particular, for evaluation of the intake daily dose and the duration of treatment,
the criteria were considered satisfied if the intake daily dose respected the
labelled dose + range recommended by the manufacturer ( 20%) in the package leaflet
and if the duration of treatment was longer than 5 days. The intake daily dose was
computed in mg/kg by multiplying the quantity of active compound prescribed times the
daily number of administrations, divided by the weight of the animal. Since the use
of antimicrobials should not be evaluated without taking into account the specific
condition being treated, the pharmacological properties of the antimicrobials and the
characteristics of the animals, the diagnosis-based guidelines for antimicrobial use
in compa15 nion animals, published by Guardabassi et al. in 2008, were used to
evaluate the appropriateness of the compounds prescribed for the treatment of
gastroenteritis, UTIs, RTIs and pyoderma. Antimicrobials were,<component x="311.81"

be used empirically, without the indication of a microbiological examination or
susceptibility testing), second choice (could be used based on a microbiological
examination) and last resort (could be used based on susceptibility testing and only
if no other antimicrobials of the first or second choice could be used). The use of
an antimicrobial was defined as appropriate whenever all the specific requirements
for the class of choice were met and only if the antimicrobial was not prescribed in
an empirical combination with other antimicrobials. The use of antimicrobials under
any other conditions was considered inappropriate. Data management and statistical
analysis Data entry and data management were carried out using EpiInfo 3.3.2 (CDC,
Atlanta, GA, USA). The dataset was validated by checking the values for consistency,
plausibility and coherence. Incorrect values were classified as 'missing'.
Categorical variables were described using counts and percentages with the relative
95% confidence interval (95% CI). Differences in 2 x proportions were assessed for
statistical significance by the or Fisher's exact test, when needed. The existence of
trends in the use of the antimicrobial classes over the study period was tested by
the Cochrane-Armitage test for linear trend against the null hypothesis that no
association between proportions of antimicrobials used and , years exists. P values
0.05 were considered statistical significant. All the statistical analyses were
performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).<component x="42.52"

prescriptions The prevalence of antimicrobial prescriptions, as estimated from the
854 sampled clinical paper charts eventually collected (688 concerning dogs and 166
cats), was 30.6% (95% CI 27.5%-33.8%). A significantly higher prevalence of
prescriptions was found in cats (44.0%, 95% CI 36.3%-51.9%) compared with dogs
(27.3%, 95% CI 24.0%-30.8%). Two hundred and ninety-three antimicrobials were
recorded from the 261 animals with a prescription. Thirty-one prescriptions (11.9%)
included only topical drugs, 222 prescriptions (85.1%) included only drugs to be
administered systemically and 8 prescriptions (3.1%) included both. Animals receiving
an antimicrobial prescription in relation to a surgical procedure were 122 (46.7% of
all the prescriptions). These accounted for the 86.2% of total surgical cases
recorded in the sample. The most frequently prescribed drugs in surgical patients
were &#xBC; amoxicillin/clavulanate (n 89) and the association benzylpeni&#xBC;
cillin/streptomycin (n 15). Pattern of prescriptions of systemic antimicrobials not
related to surgical procedures One thousand and two clinical paper charts (747
concerning dogs and 255 cats) with a prescription of at least a systemic
antimicrobial not in relation to a surgical procedure were retrieved from the 5804
clinical forms sampled to study the pattern of use of antimicrobials. The total
number of antimicrobials included in the prescriptions was 1071. For 68 animals, a
prescription of two or more antimicrobials in an empirical combination was
found.<component x="42.52" y="197.47" width="258.03" height="217.12" page="3"

belonging to 12 pharmacological subgroups, were recorded. Three of these subgroups,
in particular, included the majority of the prescribed antimicro&#xBC; &#xBC; bials:
penicillins (n 327); cephalosporins (n 258); and quino&#xBC; lones (n 219). Among the
penicillins, penicillins with &#xBC; b -lactamase inhibitors (n 287) prevailed over
extended&#xBC; spectrum penicillins (n 39). Among cephalosporins, the &#xBC;
first-generation compounds (n 219) were prescribed most &#xBC; frequently, while
fluoroquinolones (n 218) accounted for almost all the quinolones subgroup. No
significant time trends in the usage of the antimicrobial pharmacological subgroups
were observed over the study period (Table 1), except for the rarely prescribed
intestinal antiinfectives group. Similarly, no significant differences in the use of
the pharmacological subgroups were observed between the two animal species, with the
exception of the first-generation cephalosporins, scarcely employed in cats and
frequently used in dogs, and the spiramycin/metronidazole combination, more
frequently employed in cats (Figure 1). As far as the clinical conditions were
concerned, most antimicrobials were prescribed to treat infections affecting the skin
(23.2%) and the gastrointestinal tract (19.0%), followed by genitourinary (14.0%) and
respiratory (13.6%) tract diseases. The distribution of antimicrobial compounds used
for the treatment of conditions affecting the different systems is reported in Table
2. Penicillins were prescribed in similar proportions (over the 20% of cases) for the
treatment of all the conditions, but did not seem to represent the elective compounds
for the treatment of any of them. Conversely, the treatment of skin and genitourinary
tract infections was performed using elective compounds; first-generation
cephalosporins for the treatment of skin infections and fluoroquinolones for the
genitourinary infections. The treatment of gastrointestinal tract infections involved
14 pharmaceutical classes, with the three most frequently used antimicrobials
(penicillins with -lactamase inhibitors, spiramycin/metronidazole and
fluoroquinolones) not exceeding, overall, the 59% of all compounds used to treat
these conditions. It is remarkable that a non-negligible proportion of the
antimicrobials used for the treatment of RTIs (9.7%) were third-generation
cephalosporins, an antimicrobial group considered of highly critical importance in
human medicine. In this respect, of the 1060 antimicrobials that b at Universidade
Federal de Minas Gerais on June 12, 2015http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from
could be classified according to the FAO/WHO/OIE classifi22 cation, 689 and 340 were
critically important and highly important antimicrobials, respectively. Among the
critically important group, 38.3% included compounds of the highest &#xBC; priority,
namely fluoroquinolones (n 218), third-generation &#xBC; &#xBC; cephalosporins (n 36)
and macrolides (n 9). The use of critically important antimicrobials predominated in
all the conditions, except in those affecting the skin and the eye (Figure 2).
Information on the route of administration, available for 802 antimicrobials, showed
that the use of products for oral admin&#xBC; istration (n 690) prevailed over those
for parenteral adminis&#xBC; tration (n 112), and accounted for 90% of the total
antimicrobials prescribed in dogs and 73% of the total antimicro, bials prescribed in

Whether our results reflect the behaviours of companion animal practitioners in

the lack of availability of other information sources, such as quantitative and
qualitative data on antimicrobials consumption. However, our findings are in
agreement with the results of a nationwide telephone sampling survey performed in

antimicrobial susceptibility testing, in this study, most of the cases of pyoderma
were treated with properly chosen antimicrobials, mainly due to the frequent use of
drugs that fit the guideline requirements. Conversely, appropriate antimicrobials
represented only a small proportion of those administered in gastroenteritis and
RTIs, primarily due to the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in self14 limiting
infections that rarely require antimicrobial treatment. In such cases, the lack of a
proper diagnostic approach could have led to excess use of antimicrobials, which
represents a critical issue not only from a public health point of view, but also for
animal welfare. The frequent use of antimicrobials licensed for human use represents
another critical point of the prescription behaviours observed in our study, since
off-label use of human medicinal products in animals is one of the most clearly
regulated issues of prudent use. In Italy, as in the EU, the use of antimicrobials in
companion animals is strictly limited to those products properly authorized to treat
specific conditions in the target species, while the off-label use of products
licensed for other animal species or for the treatment of other conditions in the
same species, or for human use, is only allowed whenever no authorized products or
alternative antimicrobials for veterinary use are available, by way of exception and
under the direct personal responsibility of the prescribing veterinar18,28,29 ian.
Unfortunately no information on the reasons why human antimicrobials were so
frequently prescribed was available in our study. However, it cannot be excluded
that, for the same antimicrobial compound, the lower cost of products for human use
compared with those for veterinary use may have played a role. In conclusion, the
need to strengthen the professional guidance of prudent prescription is clearly
pointed out by the results of our study. At the local level, the development of
hospital guidelines for the stewardship of antimicrobials has 8 especially in
supporting the been reported to be effective, choice of antimicrobials for empirical
use. In any case, the adoption of a full diagnostic approach, including laboratory
testing, represents a crucial step that will help in preventing excess use or
facilitate the use of specific guidelines for prudent prescription. Further support
for prudent use, even at the local level, would arise from the implementation of
stronger policies governing antimicrobial use at the national level, considering the
current poor regulatory framework in force in Italy and the lack of specific
strategies supporting the prudent use of antimicrobials in both companion animals and
human medicine.<component x="42.52" y="196.45" width="258.07" height="505.84"
