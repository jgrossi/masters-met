good welfare is not simply the absence of negative experiences, but rather is
primarily the presence of positive experiences such as pleasure. However scientific
investigation of positive emotions has long been neglected. This paper addresses two
main issues: first, it reviews the current state of scientific knowledge that
supports the existence of positive affective states in animals and, second, it
suggests possible applications of this knowledge that may enhance quality of life
under animal management conditions. In the first part of the paper, recent advances
in psychology and neuroscience are reviewed to provide pragmatic frameworks based on
cognitive processes (such as positive anticipation, contrast and controllability) for
further investigations of positive emotions in animals. Thereafter, the
neurobiological bases of positive emotions are highlighted in order to identify
behavioral and physiological expressions of positive experiences in animals.
Monitoring both the autonomic nervous system (via heart rate and its variability) and
the immune system could offer relevant tools to better assess emotional states in
animals, complementary to classical adrenocortical measures. In the second part of
the paper, useful strategies for enhancing positive experiences (such as physical,
social and cognitive enrichment or putative genetic selection) are outlined. Then
this paper emphasizes practical applications for assessing and promoting positive
emotions that may help in providing animals with a better quality of life. Play,
affiliative behaviors and some vocalizations appear to be the most promising
convenient indicators for assessing positive experiences in laboratory and farm
animals under commercial conditions. &#xA9; 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

century, there was a surge of interest in animal sentience. Animal welfare scientists
quickly realized that welfare problems can be better addressed with an understanding
of how animals could feel. It is now widely accepted that animals can feel pain and
suffering, and methods to assess pain and suffering have been developed. However,
there is still no agreement on how to assess positive experiences although these are
suggested to be a core component of good welfare [1,2] Nevertheless, animals that
have successfully obtained commodities such as food or social contact are known to
display signs that are reminiscent of pleasure in humans. Therefore, a central issue
is to be able to assess whether and under what circumstances animals experience
positive emotions. This issue is far more than merely theoretical; it also has
ethical and practical importance for animal welfare. It has been pointed out that
well-being is not simply the absence of negative affects, but also (and even
predominantly) the presence of positive affects [3,4]. That means it is better to
ensure joyful and contented behaviors rather than focusing on behaviors that
represent needs that have to be fulfilled to avoid suffering [5]. In addition, the
absence of signs of pleasure or positive affect may be an indication on its own of a
state of affective discomfort. Indeed anhedonia, which is the inability to experience
pleasure, is one of the core symptoms of depression. Therefore, a new challenge for
animal welfare science is to better understand the link between the ability to
express positive emotions and a more persistent positive affective state, such as
happiness. Moreover, applied ethology deals with a wide range of animal species,
having different emotional repertoires and different behavioral patterns. Another
challenge is thus to describe the range of putative positive emotions in each of the
laboratory and farm animal species. From an evolutionary perspective, emotions are
considered as adaptive programs designed through repeated encounters that are
intended to either direct other physiological programs or to directly solve adaptive
problems faced by a species over time. One of the key factors explaining the
phylogenetic success of emotions is that they would favor adaptive cognition and
action. According to evolutionary psychology, emotions are considered as
super-ordinate mechanisms allowing the whole organism to operate in a homogenous way
when the individual is confronting relevant triggering conditions or situations. They
are adaptations that have arisen in response to the adaptive problem of mechanism
orchestration [6]. Generally speaking, the situations where emotions play a role are
those that recurred ancestrally, those that could not be dealt with without a
governing program, and those in which an error would have resulted in large fitness
costs [7]. However, given the very nature of emotional self-experience, there is
ultimately no way to know if animals experience emotions similar to humans. However,
behavior, structure, and brain chemistry are similar in humans and in a large number
of animal species. It is therefore likely that they feel as we do, including not only
well-studied negative emotions, but also positive ones. Study of emotions in animals
has received a growing interest in the past few decades, as testified by the
emergence of a new discipline referred to as Affective Neuroscience [8]. However,
despite the efforts of pioneering authors such as Colin Allen, Jaak Panksepp, Michel
Cabanac or Kent Berridge, relatively little has been done to further the
understanding of positive emotions by comparison to their negative counterparts such
as fear. Such an imbalance does not seem to be unique to animal studies. Indeed, the
study of emotions in humans suffers the same bias. As in animal studies, the human
psychological study of well-being has long been dominated by stress studies. The
primary reason for this bias is presumably that the expressions of negative
experiences are far more intense than positive affects and therefore easier to study.
These latter experiences are commonly considered as less significant since they are
more labile and their expression is more subtle. Nevertheless, in the last few years,
new disciplines such as Positive Psychology have been growing in order to explore
positive emotions as primary components of subjective well-being [9,10]. The present
paper does not claim to re-equilibrate the balance by itself but to contribute to
promote the promise of studying positive emotions in animals. It addresses two main
issues. It is intended first to review the current state of knowledge regarding the
biological foundations of positive emotions, and second to indicate some possible
applications for improving the quality of life of animals under management
conditions. The presentation of the biological background of positive emotions
successively deals with the cognitive, neurobiological, behavioral, and physiological
aspects that support the existence of positive emotions in animals. Following this
review, the practical applications in animal welfare are outlined. These applications
include useful approaches for enhancing positive experiences and on-going more
persistent affective states, as well as a discussion of the most promising positive
indicators that may be used to monitor animal welfare in both laboratory and farm
animals.<component x="32.71" y="40.04" width="251.06" height="295.98" page="2"

from both biology and psychology on the concept of emotion. Whereas there is not a
general definition, an emotion can be defined as an intense but short-lived affective
response to an event, which is associated with specific body changes [11]. The
duration of an emotion is a much-debated question, but briefness seems widely
accepted. Emotions refer to processes, which are likely to have evolved from basic
mechanisms that gave the animals the ability to avoid harm/punishment or to seek
valuable resources/reward [12,13]. Contemporary approaches to study emotions vary
according to whether they emphasize a classification of the various emotions
(dimensional approaches such as pleasant/ unpleasant valence or weak/strong
excitation), whether they focus on the eliciting mechanisms (neural circuit models
and basic emotion models), or whether they emphasize the different components of an
emotion. In componential approaches, an emotion is classically described as including
a behavioral component (a posture or an activity), an autonomic component (visceral
and endocrine responses) and a subjective component (emotional experience or feeling)
[reviewed by [11]].<component x="42.52" y="40.04" width="251.06" height="188.37"

Although it is claimed that animals are sentient creatures, it is paradoxical that
there is no exact knowledge of what their emotional experiences are about. Rollin
[14] calls attention to the paradox that scientists are reluctant to attribute
emotions, such as anxiety or suffering, to animals, while at the same time
considerable experimental work is manifestly being done to stop pain or to relieve
anxiety in animals. Using the term emotion in animals is often considered
unscientific and implicating anthropomorphic assumptions of human-like subjective
experience. " As pointed out by LeDoux [15], a subjective emotional experience, like
the feeling of being afraid, results when we become consciously aware of an emotion
system of the brain, " like the defense system . In other words, to feel afraid it is
necessary to have access to consciousness that allows awareness of the internal
state. Damasio [16] claims that the consciousness of an emotion corresponds to the
knowledge of the ability to experience emotions. Perceptive (or anoetic)
consciousness is usually defined in terms of the capacity to be aware of feelings,
sensations, thoughts and emotions [17]. There is a vigorous debate as to whether
feelings of consciousness are present in non-human animals, and if so in which
species [reviewed by [8,18,19]]. The common assumption is that the more cognitively
complex an animal is, the more likely it is to be conscious. However, why should
increasing cognitive complexity necessarily be linked to the emergence of
consciousness or vice versa? The approach of using complex cognitive capabilities as
potential indicators of the presence of conscious experience in animals has rightly
been criticized [reviewed by [20]]. Recently, Alexandrov and Sams [21] proposed a
unified concept of consciousness and emotions. It is not our purpose to discuss the
links between cognition and consciousness [reviewed by [22]], but we want to stress
the usefulness of cognitive science for research on emotions in animals and thus for
animal welfare. Feelings require some cognitive abilities to establish temporal and
instrumental contingencies. These abilities allow anticipation or prediction of
events whereas emotional responses involve coping with the situation. Learning
temporal contingency refers to the ability to relate the occurrence of one stimulus
to another when the two occur in succession, the first one becoming a predictor for
the second. Learning an instrumental contingency refers to the ability to assess the
consequences of one's response to the sit" " uation. In this context, affects provide
the common currency [23] with which animals can balance conflicting demands of
avoiding bad things and approaching better ones, and can evaluate the priority to be
given to one over the other [24]. 2.1.2. Cognitive components of emotional processing
All the previously reported studies emphasize the relationship between emotions and
cognition. They describe how an emotional system in the brain is operating and the
minimum mental operation it requires. Cognition has to do with information
processing, and refers to the range of processes involved in the acquisition,
storage, and manipulation of information [25]. Whereas the relationship between
emotions and cognition has received little attention in animal studies, it has been
extensively investigated in human psychology. For most psychologists, there cannot be
any emotion without some form of cognition [reviewed by 26], and several theories
stress the generative role of cognition in the expression of emotional states. For
Lazarus [27], an emotional state requires a primary appraisal of the emotional
stimulus, which is responsible for the action planning and execution; the
consequences of this action are then evaluated through a secondary appraisal.
Cognitive theories of emotion contend that the individual's cognitive appraisal of
the stimulating event determines the quality of - emotion [28 31]. Although labeled
as cognitive, the appraisals are not thought to result from complex analytical
reasoning. Instead, they are presumed to be relatively effortless, intuitive and
automatic evaluations that are sensitive to events related to survival (e.g. threat)
and opportunities (e.g. forming attachments). Various forms of evaluative
processings, ranging from rapid to subtle, occur to differentiate the emotional
experiences. Appraisal may be influenced by innate automatic responses that probably
evolved over many generations (e.g. response to a snake), and by learning and memory
of previous encounters with stimuli during the individual's lifetime [15]. A simple
framework based on cognitive evaluation can be employed for the study of emotions in
animals. Events can be appraised according to whether they are rewarding or punishing
[12,32]. Presentation of rewards leads to positive emotions such as pleasure, while
omission of rewards leads to frustration or anger. Likewise, Lazarus [27] suggested
two simple steps of appraisal. The first step appraises whether the current situation
alters the well-being of the individual (if not, there is no emotional arousal). The
second step appraises the meaning of the alteration. When the alteration reduces
well-being, it leads to a negative emotion whereas when the alteration increases
wellbeing, it leads to a positive emotion. The behavioral and physiological profiles
recorded under these conditions could be used as indicators of putative emotional
states. When a specific internal state is the only discriminating stimulus available
to the animal, it can use the said internal state as a cue to select the appropriate
operant response in order to get a reward. One might say the animal perceives the
internal representation of its state within its central nervous system in a way that
contributes to or determines its actions. As a behavioral outcome the animal will
choose what seems most pleasurable [23]. Measures of cognitive processes, such as
anticipation, can provide information about animal emotion. Indeed, anticipatory
behavior measured in a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm has been identified as a
potential indicator of emotion [33]. Recent developments in human psychology of
emotions could help to create a more complete framework for categorizing emotions in
animals. According to Scherer [34], emotions are determined on the basis of a limited
number of elementary evaluative criteria: (i) the novelty of the event, (ii) its
intrinsic pleasantness, (iii) its goal significance, (iv) the coping potential of the
individual, and (v) the relevance to social norms. The novelty of the event, which
breaks down into suddenness, familiarity and predictability, and its intrinsic
pleasantness are used to evaluate the relevance of the event. The goal significance
concerns the consequences of the event relative to the individual's expectations. The
coping potential indicates how well the individual can control and adapt to the
event. Finally the relevance to norms concerns how the response fits the personal and
social norms. Scherer [34] postulates that the type of emotion results from the
particular combination of elementary criteria used to evaluate the eliciting
situation. Scherer's model appears useful for trying to describe in very objective
terms the types of emotion that are accessible to different animals; it makes it
possible to infer an animal's subjective component and to predict responses according
to the evaluation process [35,36]. Most of the elementary criteria defined by Scherer
[34] are likely to be perceived and used by animals, and the range of emotions that
animals can access may be estimated by investigating to what degree they can
distinguish among elementary criteria and respond to them. By presenting animals with
test situations for which one (or several) likely evaluative criterion has been
experimentally manipulated, and at the same time recording their resultant cardiac
and behavioral reactions, direct relationships between presumed appraisal and
measurable emotional outcomes can be established. Using such an approach,
D&#xE9;sir&#xE9; and collaborators [37] have demonstrated that lambs produce
differential emotional responses to suddenness (startle and tachycardia) and
unfamiliarity (behavioral orientation and increase heart rate variability). In
addition, as would be assumed from the dynamic sequential organization of appraisal
in Scherer's model [34], the combination of suddenness and unfamiliarity criteria
enhances behavioral and cardiac responses that are specific to one or the other
criterion [38]. The a priori framework proposed by D&#xE9;sir&#xE9; and collaborators
[36], which directly considers the cognitive component of emotional processes, helps
in mapping behavioral and physiological responses in animals to particular emotional
states, including positive ones. For instance, an event evaluated as being pleasant,
of moderate predictability, and not sudden should trigger a positive emotion.
Whatever the a priori framework, it is now time to integrate theories and techniques
from cognitive science in order to develop new approaches to understanding emotions
in animals. Emotional processing must now be regarded as comprised of not only
behavioral, physiological, and subjective components but also a cognitive component.
2.1.3. Emotion and mood: acute and long-term evaluations As was previously reported,
cognitive processing is involved in determining emotional experience. However, there
is evidence in humans that causal links between emotions and cognition occur in both
directions, with cognitive manipulations influencing felt emotion and emotional
manipulations influencing cognitive processing [39]. For instance, the emotional
state can lead to changes in cognitive functioning such as an increased tendency to
attend to threatening stimuli during fear, or an enhanced memory for an unhappy event
during sadness [40]. Recently, Paul and collaborators [39] reviewed the variety of
alterations of cognitive processing due to emotions in humans. They classify these
cognitive biases into three categories: attention, memory and judgment biases. For
instance, anxiety has been argued to represent an attentional shift towards potential
threats. Likewise, negative emotions are associated with a heightened ability to
memorize negative events. Judgment processes may be affected by current emotions in a
number of ways: emotion may directly alter the judgment or risk assessment process,
or act indirectly through biases in the attention and memory processes that pertain
to it. Such emotional modulations of cognitive processes can be interpreted to have
adaptive value by helping a fearful or anxious individual to attend to, to memorize
and to make judgments about threatening circumstances. The few studies on animals
show that such effects are not restricted to humans. In rodents, the startle response
induced by exposure to a sudden event tends to occur faster and with greater
amplitude under negative emotional states [41]. Rats housed in conditions designed to
induce a persistent negative mood are less ready to respond to an ambiguous stimulus
as signaling the delivery of a good event [42]. Likewise, rats housed under social
stress or " " isolation exhibit a reduced frequency of behavioral transitions between
the presentation of a conditioned stimulus predicting sucrose reward and the arrival
of that reward, indicating a reduced anticipatory behavior due to judgment
difficulties [43]. Developing similar approaches in farm animals could help to
develop new indicators of persistent emotional states (i.e., bad or good moods), such
as an enhanced expectation of positive events [33]. All these studies demonstrate how
cognitive approaches can be used in animals to probe emotions (as short-term
affective experiences) and moods (as persistent affective experiences). 2.1.4. What
are positive emotions? Except for a few approaches, such as the ones developed by
Wemelsfelder and Farish [44] and by Burghardt [45] that emphasize positive as well as
negative states, studies of negative emotions are generally far more numerous than
those of positive emotions. A number of signs can indicate positive - experience in
animals for example, successful coping, reward, and wanting resulting in
goal-directed behavior. Positive emotions can be separated into three temporal
categories: i) past (e.g. post-consummatory satisfaction), ii) present (e.g. pleasant
sensory activity), and iii) future (e.g. positive expectation, anticipatory joy).
Focusing on present positive emotions, three categories of pleasure have been
proposed in humans [4]: sensory pleasures, higher pleasures (i.e. non-homeostatic
sensory experiences), and gratifications (i.e. inner intellectual experiences), with
at least the first and presumably the second categories being candidates for animal
investigations. Hedonism refers in its narrowest sense to pleasure or positive affect
[46]. Hedonism can also have a broader meaning referring to a general affective
disposition, either positive or negative. The presence of behavioral and
physiological signs of pleasure reminiscent of human euphoria has been demonstrated
in animals. Such signs can be induced both as a result of natural rewards and in
models for addiction resulting from treatment with rewarding drugs such as heroin,
other opioids, or dopaminergic drugs [47]. Animals that are about to obtain food or
are engaged in play often have a typical behavioral pattern characterized by short,
abrupt, and quickly changing movements (Section 3.4). The behavioral and
physiological homology between natural rewards and drugs is striking. The brain
mechanisms involved in mediating rewards have been functionally related to
motivational aspects of natural behaviors and behaviors of addiction. Classically
motivated behaviors can be divided into two components: appetitive and consummatory
behaviors. Interestingly, the appetitive component has also been neurobiologically
dissociated from the consummatory aspects. Scientific evidence demonstrates
similarity in underlying mechanisms for rewards provided by addictive substances and
by natural commodities such as foods (Section 2.2). Preventing a behavior that is
mainly motivated by internal causal factors is a proposed cause of poor welfare of
animals kept in captivity - [48 50]. Thus, one might propose an approach to assessing
and improving animal welfare that focuses on signs of pleasure instead of post hoc
signs of displeasure or of other negative emotional states. After having drawn the
neurobiological basis of positive affects, the next sections of this review should
help to better assess positive emotional states in animals by validating behavioral
and physiological expressions of positive emotions. " " 2.2. Neurobiological bases of
positive emotions: the emotional 433 brain 2.2.1. Actions on the reward system There
is now substantial evidence that emotions are based on neural activity in the limbic
forebrain, i.e. the prefrontal, insular and cingulate cortex, the hippocampus, the
amygdala and the septal nuclei. While the cortical areas do not have direct
homologues in non-mammalian vertebrates, the others are ubiquitous in at least all
tetrapods [51]. Two sensory systems have shortcut access to the limbic system: i)
olfactory nuclei projecting directly to the amygdala, and ii) afferents from the
medial geniculate body, the thalamic relay of acoustic signals [52]. In mammals, all
other sensory modalities also reach the limbic centers, including the amygdala, after
being processed in their respective sensory cortical areas [53]. Emotional states are
distributed among limbic centers. Various emotions have been attributed to neural
activity and the action of several neurotransmitters and modulators in these areas in
humans and laboratory animals. Basically, the main players for positive emotional
states, such as reward and appetitive behavioral motivations and actions (Section
2.3), are the amygdala complex and, most important, the nucleus accumbens septi as a
terminal site of the dopaminergic mesolimbic axis originating in the midbrain ventral
tegmental area (VTA) [reviewed by 54,55]. It is noteworthy in this context that
opioids act on the mesolimbic axis either indirectly by stimulating dopaminergic VTA
neurons or directly by increasing dopamine at the level of the nucleus accumbens,
supporting the view that mesolimbic dopamine is closely linked with rewarding
stimulation and action [56,57], including positive anticipatory behavior [33,58].
Berridge [59] has suggested that, at least in the context of feeding behavior, "" the
positive emotional valences wanting (appetite, incentive " " motivation) and liking
(pleasure) can be dissociated, as they are apparently mediated by different
transmitter systems in the brain, that is dopamine and opioids, respectively.
Amygdala activity has been correlated to negative emotions such as fear and anxiety,
where its role is well established [15,60]. In humans the amygdala complex is
involved in the understanding of emotional facial expressions [61] and in the
perception of perceived or expected negative stimuli as revealed by imaging
techniques [62]. However, there is now evidence that the amygdala complex is also
involved in positive emotions. Pleasurable music has been found to activate the
amygdala and the ventral striatum as well as orbitofrontal centers in humans [63],
and it was recently reported that in monkeys single amygdala neurons respond in
anticipation of fruit reward [64]. Hence, it seems that subpopulations of amygdaloid
neurons exist that respond differently to the emotional value of a stimulus. These
findings indicate that this area is likely not a center that mediates judgment of
negative events exclusively. Together with thalamic centers the amygdala has also
been found to be a relay of oxytocin-mediated social recognition and attachment
[65,66]. It now seems evident that, in mammals, brain oxytocin together with
vasopressin plays an important role in positive social bonding, mainly, though not
exclusively, between mates and between mothers and their offspring [67,68]. Besides
acting at amygdaloid sites, oxytocin also acts at the mesolimbic axis, the nucleus
accumbens in particular, where it triggers dopamine release in the context of social
bonding [69]. The main structures, neuromodulators, sites of origin, and actions are
summarized in Table 1. Within the appraisal framework, the hippocampal and
parahippocampal systems have been found to be involved in the detection and
evaluation of new events that are embedded in semantic, temporal or local relations
[80,81]. The detection of novelty requires perceptual identification and attempts to
match actual sensory input to stored items. If this matching attempt remains
unsuccessful, the situation is perceptually new and may demand increased effort.
Consequently, coping with enriched environments requires activity and exercise, and
such environments favor hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity [82,83].
This view is supported by the involvement of the hippocampal system in the mediation
of stress reactions [84], including the startle response [85]. When there is nothing
new and demanding, however, the hippocampus exerts an inhibitory influence on the
stress axis. More and more neurobiological evidence has now become available
indicating that in fact two<component x="311.53" y="87.84" width="251.13"

be distinguished. These aspects relate to the previously mentioned appetitive and
consummatory behaviors, which are in turn linked to wanting and liking respectively.
Combined, these two aspects are involved in a - cost benefit analysis that subjects
make in relation to rewards and may reflect the effort that individuals are willing
to exert to collect rewards [86]. 2.2.2. Dopamine reflects intensity of wanting while
opioids determine what is wanted The meso-accumbens dopamine system is involved in
the "" disposition to act upon previously liked rewards, i.e. in wanting [47].
Behaviorally, wanting is expressed as changes in transitions of goal-directed
behavioral patterns, such as locomotor and investigatory behavior, prior to obtaining
rewards. These patterns are labeled as anticipatory or appetitive behavior [33].
Depending on species and test conditions, behavioral changes either increase or
decrease [rats: [43,58], mink: [87]]. These changes may be related to the role of
dopamine in integrating cue- and contextassociated details of the response to be
displayed or in other words integrating neuronal inputs from the hippocampus and
amygdala in the output of the nucleus accumbens [88]. The meso-accumbens dopamine
system has a high degree of plasticity, which underlies its role in the organization
of the efficacy of behavior. Highly rewarding incentives may sensitize the system,
since it seems adaptive in the long term that what was "" "" once liked to a certain
extent should be wanted in the future to the same extent. A seemingly contradictory
finding is that stressors such as short-lasting social isolation or poor rearing
conditions [58] also increase anticipatory activity for sucrose as a reward due to
the fact that stress sensitizes this system [33,89]. Hence it seems that under
conditions of apparent loss of control animals must increase their appetitive
attempts to improve the perceived affective state. Stimulation of mu-opioid receptors
in the VTA, the origin of the meso-accumbens dopamine system, enhances dopamine
release in the accumbens [reviewed by [90]]. It was shown in rats that the expression
of anticipatory activity to rewards is blocked by the mu-opioid antagonist naloxone
[33, 91]. This point was further demonstrated in mice lacking the mu-opioid receptor
in a schedule-induced food-anticipation behavior paradigm [90]. These data show that
the meso-accumbens dopamine system is under control of the opioid system, and suggest
that the opioid system is important in adjusting the activity of the mesoaccumbens
dopamine system to challenges from the environment. Opioids in a low dose stimulate
the onset of motivated behavior. They elicit feeding [92], social interaction, and
play in young animals [93], depending on the context. By their stimulation of
motivated behavior and simultaneous suppression of pain etc., they allow the animal
to start obtaining commodities. The opioid system is thus related to the
consummatory, liking aspect of motivation, whereas dopamine, which is the interface
between emotion and motion, would be a system mediating motivation for reward in a
broad sense, including relief from stress, rather than reward per se. In contrast to
states of motivation, where reward is sought and eventually gained, very little is
known about the neuronal basis of satisfaction. In mammals this state of fulfilled
needs and cessation of drive for further rewarding sensations seems to be
characterized by reduced activities in a considerable network of forebrain
structures, including the hypothalamus, amygdala, and frontal and insular cortex
[94]. Shedding more light on the neuronal base of this important state of welfare
will be necessary in future in order to have the full picture of
well-being.<component x="301.72" y="637.75" width="251.02" height="80.83" page="6"

aware of the fact that various perspectives on motivation exist, here we follow the
perspective described in behavioral neuroscience, which is strongly supported by
ethological and neurobiological evidence. In the literature on reward, addiction and
affect [47,19], a close link has been made between neuronal structures and the
components of motivation (e.g. appetitive or consummatory) [33]. The function of
reward systems could be to weigh costs versus benefits of obtaining a commodity. The
outweighing of costs by benefits would coincide with the experience of pleasure. A
number of needs are dealt with autonomously, such as temperature, heart rate etc.
However behaviors that need integration in space and time and that use previously
acquired sensory information require focused attention of the highest emotional and
cognitive brain centers. Selection of the most pressing need is executed by reward
systems based on expectations. Ventral tegmental dopamine has been called the
interface between motivation and movement [95] and links the specific requirement of
a particular need with expected satisfaction of that need and activates higher
cognitive processing. At least in humans one might say that the reward appraisal
centers in combination with the nature of the need are experienced as affective
consciousness. Affective consciousness probably occurs in animals as well though it
will depend upon the cognitive capacity of the animal [19]. Two types of behavioral
needs can be distinguished. First, needs that induce behavioral patterns can be
evaluated by their direct physiological consequences for the underlying motivational
system. For instance, hunger requires eating of food, which affects blood glucose,
leptin levels and other parameters representing the metabolic status of the
individual and influencing food regulation centers in the brain. Second, Jensen and
Toates [96] defined a behavioral need as a specific behavioral pattern that the
animal apparently has to perform, irrespective of the environment or of the animal's
physiological needs. In other words, needs that involve the display of typical
behaviors lack direct physiological consequences and thus also lack direct feedback
from regulatory physiological mechanisms. It seems as though the biological relevance
of regular performance of those behaviors lies in their long-term benefits for the
individual animal or its offspring, e.g. behaviors concerning reproduction, foraging
and grooming. The motivation to perform these essential behavioral patterns is
governed by the display itself rather than to meet short-term physiological needs
[48]. The mechanism underlying the regular display can be understood when it is
assumed that the display itself, rather than its immediate effects, has rewarding
properties. Long-term effects are then a probable outcome of the display, but beyond
what can be monitored by the individual animal. The impact of the display on reward
guarantees its regular occurrence. The absence of such rewarding behavior coincides
with the absence of an important source of reward [33]. 2.3.2. How can behavioral
needs induce pleasure and why do they make the animal vulnerable? Appetitive
behaviors with low probability of success or with a long time interval between onset
and eventual consummatory responses would benefit from a regulating mechanism like
that just described for behavioral needs. The animal can never stop looking for food,
safety, and reproductive opportunities, even following unsuccessful attempts; in
other words investing for the future must have direct rewarding consequences.
Behaviors, which serve as an investment for collecting a necessary incentive, e.g.
food or social companionship, may be self-rewarding in order "" to maintain these
types of searching behaviors. Other examples are hunting in predators, exploration in
a number of species, rooting in pigs, etc. Appetitive or seeking behaviors
(motivational states of wanting) have been associated with mesolimbic dopamine,
whereas consummatory behaviors (liking or hedonic motivational states) have been more
associated with opioids [97,19,47,33]. Social behavior [98,19], reproductive behavior
[98], play [99], autogrooming [100] and dust-bathing [101,102] are supposed to have
rewarding properties. To be self-rewarding, a specific behavior should activate the
mesolimbic system, for instance by the release of endorphins, which then exert a
positive feedback on this behavior, resulting in a longer lasting, on-going
behavioral bout. Taking this process into account, one would expect that opioids may
induce such behaviors, while opioid antagonists would counteract their - display. One
would expect self-rewarding behaviors to interact - cross sensitization and cross
tolerance with drugs of addiction or rewarding stimuli such as food. The opportunity
to display may itself act as a reinforcer and can be used as an incentive in
conditioned place preference studies. Being deprived of opportunities to perform
specific behaviours resulting from these behavioral needs produces signs of
withdrawal paralleling those observed in deprivation of an addictive drug
[19,23,47,95,98]. Exploration in rodents, when modeled by wheel-running behavior,
shows such interaction (cross sensitization) with mesolimbic dopamine and cross
tolerance with morphine [103], an interaction similar to those observed for drugs of
addiction. Cross sensitization between food and drugs of abuse has also been shown,
and this phenomenon could be counteracted by an opiate antagonist [104]. Social
behavior, play and self-grooming can be induced by endorphins and counteracted by
naloxone - [98 100]. A drawback of this efficient mechanism regulating the motivation
of those behaviors that represent animals' behavioral needs is that self-rewarding
behaviors may run out of control - when dopaminergic systems are sensitized by stress
[105 107]. If some stressors amplify animals' wanting for rewards when no external
rewards are immediately available, they may instead look for compensation by
performing self-rewarding behavior [108,109]. Thus, depending on the species and
circumstances, stressed individuals may display excessive locomotion, sexual
activity, or self-grooming. Because highly motivated behaviors are so rewarding,
being deprived of them is a severe stressor. At the same time some of them do not
have an immediate high priority because they have a long-term payoff. Play for
instance only occurs when other needs are met. Therefore, occurrence of play behavior
or typical signs of satisfaction indicate that the animal is not deprived of
important sources of pleasure and that other needs are being met. That is why such
behaviors are good candidates for welfare indicators (Section 3.4).<component

parasympathetic balance The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is an important efferent
of the limbic system. It is primarily amygdala output, acting via hypothalamic
centers, that influences autonomic brainstem nuclei controlling the activity of
sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The relative level of activity of these two
systems is an indicator of an organism's general physiological state (action or
digestion). Though this relative activity depends on homeostasis, it is also
determined to a great degree by current emotions. Hence, measures of heart rate (HR)
are broadly accepted as a valid index of stress in many vertebrate species as they
give an impression of the activity of - the ANS [110 112]. Interpretations have often
been based on the assumption that HR reflects the activity of the sympathetic branch
of the ANS and therefore can be used as an indicator of the sympatho-adrenomedullary
stress response. However, the heart is also under parasympathetic control, and HR at
every point in time is the result of non-additive effects of the interaction between
the two branches of the ANS [113]. Thereby, the effects of emotional perceptions on
cardiac activity are mediated via direct innervations of the sino-atrial node of the
heart by sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers [114,115]. As a consequence of these
permanent regulatory functions, HR is never constant but varies from beat to beat,
hence the concept of heart rate variability (HRV). HRVis mediated by either an
increase/decrease of sympathetic tone or an increase/decrease of parasympathetic
tone. Hence, analyzing HRV helps to identify which branch of the ANS is actually
mediating heart rate and to assess the sympatho-vagal balance of an organism [116].
The assumption underlying the assessment of HRV is that, as a peripheral measure of
ANS activity, it serves as a proxy for vagal tone, vagal reactivity and
sympatho-vagal balance that otherwise could only be measured by hard-to-perform
invasive techniques [115,117]. A certain degree of HRV is a characteristic of any
healthy vertebrate [118]. In recent years, cardiac vagal tone assessed by
HRV-analysis has received considerable attention as a psychophysiological marker of
emotion regulation, and of certain aspects of psychological adjustment in humans
[reviewed by 119,120]. Most of the work has focused mainly on negative emotions and
emotional disorders, which have been referred to as anger-proneness, irritability,
irritable distress, and negative mood. However, cardiac vagal tone may also be an
indicator of positive emotional states. Fox [121] found a near significant
correlation between infant HRVand positive reactivity during a peek-a-boo procedure
with mothers and strangers. McCraty and colleagues [122,123] reported higher HRV in
human adults after selfinduced positive emotional states. Recently, Lee and
collaborators found higher levels of HRV and reduced HR in humans after the intake of
a traditional herbal remedy [124] and during Qi therapy, a Chinese external therapy
[125]; this effect was correlated with more pleasant and calm emotions compared to
the placebo group. Rainville and collaborators [126] found evidence that distinct
patterns of peripheral physiological activity (e.g. HRV) are associated with
different emotions like sadness or happiness. Recently, patterns of HRV reduction
have - been studied in farm animals in reaction to stressors [127 129], behavioral
disorders [130] and in the context of cognitive appraisal [37]. For a broader
discussion of this topic see also the review on HRV by von Borell and collaborators
in this issue. The potential elements and patterns of autonomic activity have not
been exhaustively examined. Moreover, it is possible that emotions or components of
emotions could be differentiated on the basis of sympathetic and parasympathetic
innervations of the viscera rather than on visceral responses per se [131]. However,
taken together the data indicate that monitoring activity of the autonomic nervous
system, essentially through heart rate and its variability as suggested especially by
human studies, may deliver suitable approaches to assess positive emotions in animals
when combined with behavioral records [36]. 2.4.2. Neuroendocrine activation The
physiological responses of the autonomic nervous and neuroendocrine systems trigger
neuronal processes in the brain that influence the way animals cope with the
situation. For instance, sustained high cortisol levels are associated with a higher
probability of engaging in passive coping (i.e. being reactive), whereas high
catecholamine levels are associated with a higher probability of engaging in active
coping [132]. However, - transient activations of the stress axes i.e. the
adrenocortical axis - (HPA) and the ANS are regularly coincident with any emotionally
triggered activity and cannot be easily differentiated for positive and negative
emotions. They might as readily be activated for actions of defense as for reward.
Accordingly, in a comprehensive study in pigs it has been demonstrated that
individuals with a high success in a dominance intruder test displayed dynamic
peripheral responses of the HPA that were virtually the same as in losers [133].
Roughly the same was revealed in the ANS, however with a tendency toward a more rapid
decrease after fighting in the high success animals. Further, winners tended to have
a higher noradrenalin/adrenalin ratio which, in general, could reflect a less passive
behavioral pattern [134]. Hence, intrinsic processes ( e.g. fluctuations of hormone
concentrations, induced spontaneously or by chronic emotional stress) may cause
changes in mood, while sensory inputs may be able to release emotions. Although
experimental evidence is still scarce concerning changes in physiological parameters
that accompany positive emotional experiences, some recent studies with human
subjects reveal promising leads to follow in animal studies. Taking advantage of
recent developments in salivary assay methods, physiological studies of human saliva
suggest that its protein composition could be used as a monitoring tool for the
assessment of some emotional/mood states. Indeed, while negative - emotions are
associated with a decrease in 20 200 kD proteins, in positive emotions an increase in
these proteins is observed - [135]. It has also been found that salivary alpha
amylase (sAA) levels in humans are increased in response to physiological and
psychological stress [136]. Furthermore, it is suggested that the level of this
enzyme could be considered as an index of soothing effect or relaxation in humans as
sAA levels are significantly decreased by soothing/pleasant video viewing [137]. The
detailed mechanism of the amylase decrease remains unclear. However, developing such
measures in animals could offer a relevant tool to assess positive emotional states
in animals. 2.4.3. Immunological activation An important literature exists regarding
the emotional influences on immune functions, supported by both human and animal
studies. Indeed, not only is there an extensive literature on the complex
interactions between the HPA-axis and the immune system [138], but also emotional
limbic activity has been found to have important effects on immunity [139]. In pigs,
positive and negative psychological experiences affected immune system parameters
antagonistically, depending on the success of coping [140]. Hence, immune status may
be another indicator of long-lasting emotional state (or mood), and immunological
parameters may be indicators of frequent positive (or negative) emotions [141].
However, with the present state of knowledge, they are difficult to interpret since
the various immune factors constitute a multidimensional vector whose components are
mutually interacting and can be easily influenced by non-obvious infections.
Unfortunately, experimental evidence linking positive emotional experiences to the
immune system is lacking. It is therefore risky to infer that positive emotional
stimuli would enhance immune defenses. However, a recent study found that pleasant
stimuli in human (i.e. humoristic story-telling) induced an increase in secretory
immunoglogulin-A (s-IgA) [142]. This confirms results from a pioneering study by
Dillon and collaborators [143] in which the salivary IgA concentration was
specifically increased after subjects viewed a humorous video sequence. Since s-IgA
is considered an indicator of overall immune function, such measures in laboratory
and farm animals could offer new insights for the understanding of emotional
influence over immunity. Conversely with brain-to-immune influences, growing evidence
reveals that the immune system influences brain functions, including structures
involved in emotional processes. In addition to various effects on emotion-related
neurotransmitters (i.e. serotonin or noradrenalin), immune activation is known to
induce HPA activation [138]. When these data are combined with the fact that immune
and stress responses have been argued to share common evolutionary defensive
properties, immune activation is increasingly considered as a stress response by
itself [144]. Moreover, some studies show that immune activation has emotional
effects, such as anxiety- or depression-like behaviors [141,145]. Nevertheless, it
has recently been shown that rats made sick through the peripheral administration of
endotoxin are still able to response positively (i.e. hedonic facial responses) to
palatable taste solutions such as sucrose [146]. However, when subjected to mixed
bittersweet solutions, these rats display more aversive and fewer hedonic responses
than do controls [146]. Therefore, immune activation cannot be considered to induce
anhedonia as had been reported in earlier studies. Rather, these data may illustrate
alliesthesia, i.e. modification of the affective value (i.e. valence) of a specific
stimulus related to the subject's physiological status [147]. In other words, it has
been proposed that instead of causing a negative emotional state, immune activation
would enhance reactivity of subjects to salient negative features of a given
situation, thus motivating their defensive repertoire [148,149]. Inflammatory markers
could therefore be used as possible indicators of a transitory vulnerability of
subjects to external sources of stress, and immune activation could be used as a tool
to evaluate the plasticity of the valence (e.g. from pleasant to aversive) of
specific features of each subject's environment [150]. In conclusion, even if a lot
remains to be done to fully validate their use and relevance, heart rate variability
as well as alphaamylase and immunoglobulin-A levels could be interesting
physiological parameters for assessing positive emotional states in animals, at least
as complements to classical adrenocortical and/or inflammatory measures.<component

of positive emotions, in combination with pressure from society that animals should
have a " " good life and not just a not-so-bad ""life, is leading to a greater
aspiration to apply some of the knowledge described in the first part of this review.
The most likely practical applications fall into four broad areas: i) promoting
positive experiences as a way to give animals a generally better quality of life; ii)
enhancing longterm positive emotional states; iii) highlighting the link between
positive emotional states and improving health, and iv) including criteria of
positive welfare in on-farm monitoring systems. 3.1. Enhancing quality of life by
promoting positive experiences Here we outline new approaches that might be useful in
animal husbandry for inducing positive emotions in animals throughout their lives.
Three approaches can be defined-signaling or predicting a reward in advance, giving a
higher reward than expected, and enabling the animals to cope with or to control the
situation. 3.1.1. Positive anticipation Investigations of what animals find
positively reinforcing and of the animal's behavioral expression during anticipation
or expectation of the rewarding result provide a basis for assessing positive
emotional states in animals [33]. The period between the signal and the arrival of
the reward is the period in which behavioral activity related to dopaminergic
activity can be seen (Section 2.3), i.e. anticipatory behavior. Anticipatory
behaviors are considered to represent biologically significant preparatory behaviors
[151]. When anticipating food rewards, rats [58], mink [152] and pigs [153] show
increased locomotor activity and frequent behavioral transitions, i.e. anticipatory
hyperactivity. More specifically, the behavioral categories reported in rats during
anticipation of sucrose rewards include locomotion, grooming, alertness, arousal,
scanning, attention, exploration and running [58]. In pigs, signaled positive stimuli
such as extra space, food, or straw lead to increased activity due to orientation
toward the place where the reward is offered and frequent behavioral transitions,
most often combined with play markers, i.e. hopping, scampering, pivoting, pawing,
flopping, and head tosssing [153]. During anticipation of feed rewards, farmed mink
showed a general increase in locomotor activity, and they spent more time moving
in/out of the nest box, less time in the "" nest box, more time nose-poking around
the feeding area, and more time standing and scratching at the cage door [152,154].
Farmed silver foxes anticipating a food reward or playing incentive were more active,
had more erect ears and higher body carriage, and spent more time in front of the
cage compared to animals that were anticipating aversive stimuli [155]. The
predictability of the rewarding stimulus plays a role in behavioral expression during
anticipation. Silver foxes anticipating a positive predictable reward (food or play)
had more upright ears, whereas for a positive unpredictable reward the ears were more
backwards rotated and flat [155]. Sensitivity to dopamine is adapted to the impact of
reward and the needs of the animal in the manner that is related to previous
experience. Thus, the threshold of the animal to react to a stimulus reflects the
sensitivity of the system. In addition, the amount of activity is related to the
needs of animals. For instance, if housed in a poor cage environment, rats were more
sensitive to signaled positive rewards compared to rats housed in an enriched
environment [58]. However, there is a risk of misinterpretation here as the absence
of a reaction to a reward may indicate that the animal is in a state either of full
satisfaction or of anhedonism, and these are opposite states in terms of welfare. In
addition, the intensity of reaction to a small reward has to be calibrated for each
species and situation. In silver foxes, anticipatory behavior consisted of high
levels of locomotor stereotypical behaviors such as running back and forth in the
cage environment [155]. Whether stereotypies during positive anticipation are an
expression of enhanced expectation shaped by the environment into repeated movements
or a stereotyped behavior due to previous and/or current frustration [156] remains to
be seen. demonstrating a successive negative contrast (SNC) [reviewed by [157]]. SPC
and SNC can be found for both appetitive and consummatory responses. It is the
difference between the expected value and the actual value that influences a
subject's behavior rather than the exact level of reinforcement. If the animal has a
previous experience of a higher value reinforcer, the reaction to a given level of
reinforcement is much less pronounced. Any contrast effect is often temporary and
disappears over time [e.g. [158]]. The fact that the appearance of an unexpected
reward makes such a difference to the behavior of the animal has led several authors
to suggest that positive contrast corresponds to the emotion elation in humans, while
negative contrast might be related to frustration or disappointment [e.g. [159,160]].
Overall there are more studies showing a negative than a positive contrast. Negative
contrast seems to be a more robust phenomenon and is easier to detect. This is also
possibly due to a ceiling effect; for instance, an animal that is running at top
speed for a reinforcer is unable to increase its speed even if the reinforcement is
increased. Unfortunately this result has meant that the majority of theories of the
contrast effect have focused on explaining the negative contrast effect exclusively.
Although some of the theories involve emotions e.g. elation or disappointment as ' '
described above, most are alternative non-emotional theories such as generalization
decrement [161], incentive averaging [162] or exploration [Elliott, 1928 cited by
[157]]. There are nevertheless a number of more specialized emotional theories that
do not rely on a general emotional drive, e.g. Amsel's frustration theory [163] or
Gray's disinhibition theory [29]. Positive contrast - has been found in few species
of mammals and birds [164 166]. For instance, in his original study, Crespi [159]
reported that rats for which the quantity of reward has just been increased run
faster towards the food reward than do rats having always received the large quantity
of reward. However, the changes in the behavioral responses are generally more
pronounced for the negative than for - the positive contrasts [164 166]. Due to the
relatively small number of studies, further research is needed to confirm the value
of a positive contrast model in the study of potential positive emotions and their
behavioral expressions. 3.1.3. Coping and controllability The possibility of
controlling the environment and coping successfully with challenges may be another
source of positive emotions. Despite some degree of stress being necessary in the
initial state of coping to activate alertness and metabolism [167], successful
actions with a positive outcome make the animal master of the environment. Successful
coping stops the initial stress reactions, independent of the positive or negative
value of the stressor, while uncontrollable and, hence, persistent negative stressful
stimuli lead to the well-known detrimental effects of - chronic stress [84,168 170].
A prerequisite of controllability is predictability, i.e. the environmental reactions
are (mostly) contingent on the subject's actions. If the environment where a species
lives is sufficiently constant during a long period of time, successful behavioral
coping strategies may well be acquired during the process of evolution and, then, are
innate at the individual level. If there is no innate coping behavior, an animal may
try to learn how to deal with a challenge. Success depends on a number of
prerequisites. First, the animal has to have the motor patterns necessary to be able
to deal with the challenge with at least some success; eventually these patterns can
even be shaped to deal with it better. Second, there must be a kind of random action
selector to try out what could be helpful when dealing with the challenge. Third, in
the central nervous system there must be the ability to link the sensory and
perceptual cues that are coincident with successful behaviors and the challenging
context. Fourth, there must be contiguity between the challenge and the behavioral
action [171]. If any of these conditions remain unfulfilled the animal will be unable
to learn how to cope, a failure that will eventually lead to chronic stress. Hence,
inactivity displayed by an animal may be caused by two emotional states: total
equilibrium, when everything is at or close to optimum, or learned helplessness, if
the subject has the experience that there is no possibility to escape the negative
environment [172]. The result is an inactive, depression-like chronic stress state
that is often accompanied, inter alia, by permanently increased levels of the stress
hormone cortisol. Social and physical challenges can be perceived as positive
experiences when exists an adequate coping behavior. Hence, frequent challenges that
can always be successfully mastered and eventually enable the animal to reach a
desired and rewarding goal may be suitable means to regularly evoke positive
emotions. Using an approach of this type, a program of research on the effects of
rewarded cognitive processes has been developed [173]. In the studies conducted thus
far, each animal out of a group of pigs had to learn an individual acoustic signal as
a call to work for food by pressing a button. The demands of this situation were
threefold: The animals had to be attentive for their individual acoustic summons,
they had to localize its source, and they had to respond to a button with their nose
disc in order to be rewarded with a small portion of food. It was shown that the pigs
were willing and quite able to cope with these demands. Using this approach it will
be possible to analyze the physiological and behavioral effects of a complex but
predictable environment presenting positive challenges with which individuals are
able to cope.<component x="311.52" y="267.15" width="251.02" height="128.63" page="9"

The emotional sensitivity or temperament of an animal has an important influence on
its welfare, and so predisposition to some positive emotional states is a good
premise for investigating long-term positive emotional states in animals. The terms
and concepts used for defining long-term emotional states " differ in the degree of
structure they provide, from individual " differences to the concept of personality.
The distinction according to the species and the age of the individual between
temperament (for animals and human infants) and personality (for children and adult
humans) has not been maintained consistently in the literature [174]. Temperament can
be defined as the characteristics of individuals that describe and account for
consistent patterns of feeling and behaving [175]. Whereas dimensions of personality
have generally been discussed in terms of either coping style or fearfulness, there
is currently no method for assessing a propensity to feel and express positive
emotions. However, by identifying long-term positive emotional states we can examine
whether characteristic behavioral patterns could be linked to particular
neuroendocrine states and if they correlate within individuals and over time. From
such studies we might be able to predict responses of an animal in one situation
based upon its responses in another. " There is no universally accepted definition of
individual " " " variation or individual differences . Erhard and Schouten [176]
structured individual variation in animal behavior using the Eysenck [177]
description of personality. This approach orga- nizes the different aspects of
personality into three levels " " " " " " state , trait , and type . The term state
or mood is used for the behavior that an individual performs at a specific moment in
time and in a specific situation. If an individual is repeatedly found to be in
similar states in similar situations, we can make assumptions about the underlying
personality trait (e.g. fearfulness or happiness). Regarding the third level, when
several trait dimensions are linked in such a way that an individual's position on
one dimension predicts its position in another, the individual can be categorized by
their position in a type dimension. This approach brings the study of individual
differences in non-humans closer to what is done in humans [39,176,178]. Different
studies have been carried out to evaluate emotional states in farm animals. For
instance, from a combination of the responses to fear and learning tests, three
emotional states were established in dairy sheep: non emotive ewes (calm, fear
sustainable, reacting adequately in learning tests), emotive ewes (nervous, fear
susceptible, reacting inadequately in learning tests) and intermediate ewes [179]. It
was further established that the emotional state influenced various adaptive
behaviors. The non-emotive ewes revealed a stable maternal care, whereas the anxiety
increased in the emotive ewes on the second and third days postpartum [180].
Furthermore, by contrast to the emotive sheep, non-emotive animals usually
successfully collect different rewards (appetitive and consummatory behaviors)
ensuring successful reproduction and higher production [181]. " " Personality may
have different dimensions . This idea was supported by Kilgour and collaborators
[182] showing different components of personality in cattle and sheep adapted from
human studies: general agitation and avoidance. The hypothesis that calm animals
produce better quality milk than nervous animals was supported by the result for
protein concentration [183]. Merino ewes of calm temperament can provide better
quality milk, indicating that temperament should be considered when selecting dairy
animals. Martin and collaborators [184] propose a strategy aiming to maximize
offspring survival by a combination of management, nutrition and genetic selection
for temperament. From a divergent selection on behavioral reactivity, calm ewes are
found to be better mothers than nervous ewes [185]: they spend more time with their
lambs, have a short flight distance when disturbed and return to their lambs faster
than nervous ewes. In addition to postnatal lamb survival, temperament may influence
other aspects of the reproductive process, all of which might be improved by genetic
selection for calm temperament. These include the length of the estrous cycle [186],
ovulation rate [187], the proportion of ewes mated, and sexual behavior [188].
Finally, temperament seems to affect - other aspects of production such as growth
rate [189 191] immune function [191], milk yield [192] and meat quality [193, 194].
All of these outcomes could be used to improve productivity while giving the industry
an ethical quality [reviewed by [184]]. 3.2.2. Genetic background Large differences
in emotional responses have been reported between breeds in various farm species
[195]. In dairy cattle, sire had a significant effect on the reactivity of cows in
the milking parlor [196]. Similarly, sheep sired by Romney sires were more reactive
when placed in a fearful situation than ewes sired by Suffolk or Columbia rams [197].
Genetic analysis revealed that such emotional responses were due to direct genetic
differences and less to direct maternal influence or to heterosis. The estimates of
heritability of fear in domestic animals seem to be sufficiently high to allow
further selection on fearfulness in attempts to improve herbivore management
[reviewed by [198]]. In addition, the development of marker-assisted selection can be
useful for psychological states such as fearfulness. Identifying quantitative trait
loci for fear has recently been extended to cattle [199] So far, QTL for reactivity
to humans have been identified using linked markers in cattle [200,201]. Such linked
markers may be used for marker-assisted selection within sire families once the
relationship between the marker and the gene has been determined. The interactions
between the genotype of animals and their environment must be seen as a critical
determinant of animal welfare that could reconcile production with ethical concerns
[198]. 3.2.3. Ontogenetic influences Abundant data demonstrate that stimulation
occurring during early life may markedly modulate the development of subsequent
emotion processing in a positive direction. It has been demonstrated that some
postnatal stimulation have opposite effects to those induced by prenatal stress. For
example, adult rats that have received substantial positive stimulation during
infancy, such as environmental enrichment or regular handling, are less emotionally
reactive to various challenging situations - [202 204]. Handling animals during
infancy also leads to improved endocrine reactivity in adulthood. For instance, early
handling alters neuroanatomical development in rats by increasing the number of
hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors or by decreasing CRF mRNA implicated in
endocrine regulations occurring under stress [205,206]. Extensive research on the
influences of early regular handling has been conducted in domestic animals. For
instance, early handled ungulates are generally less fearful of humans than their
non-handled counterparts, a pattern shown in goats [207], horses [208], cattle [209],
sheep [210] and pigs [211]. Experiences that occur during adulthood may also
influence emotional responsiveness, particularly through classical processes of
learning and habituation. The exposure of adult animals to enriched environments or
handling procedures has been shown to decrease subsequent fear, although the reported
effects are generally less marked than those induced by the same treatments occurring
during infancy [212]. Taken together these findings indicate that early stimulation
and later experiences interact with genetic background throughof whether positive
events can be used to offset negative ones over the course of a lifetime can be
raised. Although theoretically justifiable using a preference utilitarian
philosophical approach, we propose that this summing up of earlier positive
experiences is not applicable to animals living mainly in the present as do most farm
animals. Neither should we justify poor long-term housing and management because we
sometimes give animals short-term positive experiences. If we want to maximize
welfare, then the aim must be to give the animals as good quality of life as possible
all the time. Since it has been shown that anticipatory behavior followed by the
consummatory act has beneficial effects compared to the provision of the mere reward
alone, there is the possibility to manage animals in a way which stimulates the
activation of these systems, while at the same time giving as good housing and
management as we can. The caveat is of course that a certain degree of sensitization
is necessary for induction of pleasure but not to the extent that the period of need
for reward outweighs the satisfaction. This balance should be explored further.
Promoting play in young animals and stroking animals (or alternatively promoting
social licking) are also probably feasible methods to promote positive emotions in
practice and so enhance overall quality of life in systems that are usually regarded
as acceptable from an animal welfare point of view. Finally, in "" relation to the
active behavioral expressions of positive emotions (Section 3.4), like play,
allogrooming and exploration, another class of behavioral expressions of positive
emotions should be mentioned here, namely those expressing full comfort and
satiation, i.e. the fulfillment of biological needs.<component x="42.52" y="40.04"

anhedonia [228]. More specifically, signaled rewards counteracted the impairment of
anticipatory behavior in socially stressed rats, further supporting the view that
eliciting positive affective states has beneficial health effects. However, even in
this example the effect is in reducing otherwise negative health effects rather than
inducing positive health effects per se. In any event, understanding these mechanisms
will improve our ability to understand the benefits of positive emotions and also
suggest new clinical treatments based on these behavioral mechanisms. 3.4. Using
positive emotions for assessment and monitoring 1301 of animal welfare 3.4.1.
Assessing and enhancing behavioral expressions of positive emotions 3.4.1.1. Play
behavior. Play behavior includes elements of " " well-defined functional behavior
such as fleeing, fighting, sexual, or predatory behavior as well as specific play
behaviors. " " However, in play the functional elements are exaggerated, repeated,
more variable, and without the corresponding - consummatory act [229 232]. The
function of play behavior has been, and still is, the main focus in the scientific
study of this behavior. In early studies the function of play behavior was thought to
be exclusively long-term benefits. However, studies testing functional hypotheses of
play behavior found little evidence of long-term effects. Thus, current theories
focus more on short-term benefits to the juvenile and less on long-term benefits,
although the two may not be mutually exclusive [232]. Proposed functions of play
behavior are training of the skeletal muscles [229] (later refined to include
permanent modifications in brain and skeletal muscles [233]), self-assessment of
physical and social abilities [234], and training of flexible kinematics and
emotional responses to the unexpected events, a hypothesis that predicts both
immediate and long-term effects of play behavior [235]. The fact that play behavior
may be suppressed in harsh and unfavorable environmental conditions together with the
problems of early studies to prove any long-term function of play behavior suggested
that play behavior was merely a sign of surplus energy without any motivation of its
own. However, there are now several sources of evidence to suggest that play is a
rewarding activity [232]. First, animals actively seek out play partners and solicit
play behavior [229]. Second, the opportunity to play may be used as a reward in place
preference conditioning experiments [236]. Finally, thwarting of play will lead to a
rebound when more favorable conditions occur [237]. Conditions intuitively associated
with bad welfare, e.g. insufficient food supply, suppress play behavior in deer [238]
and domestic pigs [239]. Castration eliminates play behavior in lambs [240] and
domestic pigs in a semi-natural environment did not play during periods of cold
weather [241]. Thus, the presence of the motivation to play may indicate a state of
good welfare, i.e. that the primary needs of the animals are met. In calves the two
most common types of play are social play and locomotor play. Locomotor play emerges
first and is seen as early as a few hours after birth, and the presence of the mother
has been found to stimulate this type of play behavior [242]. Under natural
conditions locomotor play behavior occurs within the first weeks of life [243,244].
Increasing the space allowance for group-housed calves has been found to increase the
occurrence of play behavior [245]. Furthermore, calves kept with little space showed
a large rebound of locomotor play indicating that these calves had built up a larger
motivation during the period of confinement [245,246]. In piglets play behavior
includes both locomotor and social play behavior, although it may be difficult to
distinguish between play fighting and genuine fights [197]. In piglets more locomotor
play behavior was seen in larger farrowing crates compared to smaller ones [247]. In
addition, different types of farrowing crates placed in pens of equal space affected
play behavior [248]. Locomotor play behavior is reduced by mixing of piglets [249]
and by social isolation [250,251]. In mink the additional provision of a water bath
to mink kits stimulated more play behavior, both solitary locomotor play and social
play (e.g. chasing and rough-and-tumble play) [87]. Likewise, the provision of a
wooden block in the home cage of mink stimulated accelerated running, interrupted by
sham attacks of the object [214]. As outlined above play behavior is a good candidate
for an indicator of positive emotions and good welfare. However, caution must be
taken when developing play behavior as a positive welfare indicator since social play
can end in a fight, as in piglets [248]. This problem may be specific for the
juvenile pig, where dominance plays a role from birth, whereas in cattle the tendency
for social play to develop into real fights does not increase until the animals reach
puberty [252]. However, for all species some elements of play behavior may be better
indicators than others, and one way of developing the area further " " could be to
identify and validate so-called play markers as signs of true play in the different
animal species [241]. Such play markers may be play signals, which communicate a
playful mood to potential play partners. Play signals have the advantage that they
are often conspicuous and easy to distinguish. Present evidence on play behavior
applies only to juveniles of mammalian farm animal species. In these species it will
be important to develop and validate measures of play as welfare indicators, both in
animals reared for meat or for replacement (weaned piglets, growing pigs, calves,
lambs, and goats), and in foals. 3.4.1.2. Affiliative behavior. Affiliative behavior
is characterized by maintaining proximity, providing food, protection or allogrooming
between specific individuals. In farm animals, affiliative behavior has been much
less well studied than social competition and it has only rarely been investigated
with regard " " to affective states. However, terms such as affiliative , " " ""
sociopositive or preferential relationships already suggest a beneficial effect for
the animals involved. In general, positive effects of affiliative behavior can be
attributed to improved group cohesion, building or strengthening of bonds between
group mates and reduced aggression [253]. Preferential relationships between group
members have been described for cattle [254], horses [255], poultry [256] and pigs
[257]. Such relationships occur between genetically related [254,258] as well as
unrelated animals [259,260]; the latter has recently been shown for horses, donkeys,
cattle and sheep [261]. Familiarity appears to be one of the main factors in
establishing - cohesion [262 264]. Stress responsiveness is lower in familiar -
animals [265 267] whereas mixing of unfamiliar animals is accompanied by an increase
in agonistic interactions in pigs [268], cattle [269], poultry [270] and horses
[271]. Affiliative behavior may therefore play a major role in achieving a positive
mood in animals. It should however be noted that external threats might increase the
proximity between animals. Therefore, interanimal distance cannot be taken as a
direct measure of positive emotion level without knowing more about the threats
perceived by the animals. Allogrooming plays a key role with regard to so-called
sociopositive interactions. It is common among non-human primates [33]. In farm
animals, allogrooming is seen in cattle, horses, pigs and, rather rarely, in sheep.
Allogrooming seems to serve both hygienic (body care) and social functions. With
regard to the latter, allogrooming is thought to play a major role in reinforcing
social bonds and in reducing tension in groups of animals [100,272]. Such an
arousal-reduction effect suggests that allogrooming may provide long-term benefits.
However, there is also evidence that allogrooming is rewarding in the short term.
Soothing effects in terms of a reduction in heart rate have been demonstrated in
primates [273,274] and cattle [272]. Grooming stimulation produced similar effects in
horses [275,276]. In pigs, heart rate variability was used to assess the effect of
grooming simulation [277]. A short-term increase in vagal tone appeared to be
contradictory to the behavioral reactions of pigs suggesting relaxation, a finding
that was " " interpreted as positive strain ; regular grooming, however, increased
parasympathetic activity. Increased -endorphin &#x3B2; levels have also been found in
primates with intensive grooming relationships [278]. Based on the above-mentioned
findings, affiliative behaviors appear to be promising indicators of long-term
positive affective states in farm animals. Allogrooming should be further
investigated as a key indicator in cattle, horses and pigs. In cattle, social licking
is mainly carried out at the head, neck or shoulder of the animals [252]. It is
performed spontaneously, after solicitation, or following agonistic interactions.
Social licking may also be terminated by agonistic behavior mostly performed by the
licked animal. Solicitation of social licking [279] underlines the rewarding function
of such behavior, at least for the receiver. Whereas the overall benefits for the
receiver are obvious, it is less clear to what extent the actor is positively
influenced. While in horses mostly reciprocal grooming (mainly consisting of biting
and nibbling the group mate's neck) between bonded pairs is observed [280], in cattle
Sato [281] found that all animals were groomed but that only 75% performed grooming.
Reports on the importance of the social position of the groomer are contradictory
[252,282,283]. However, subordinate animals might experience performance of the
behavior as stressful if licking has been initiated by dominant animals, although
they may benefit from a less tense social environment in the long term. The use of
allogrooming as an indicator in welfare assessment protocols may be limited since,
for example, in horses social grooming is influenced by season [260], social
structure [264] and reproductive state [284] and therefore needs further
investigation with regard to reliability issues. In wild boars, regular nose-to-body
contacts [285] suggest that allogrooming forms part of the pig's normal behavior.
Meynhardt [285] also states that the receiver shows relaxation-related behaviors, a
finding that has been confirmed by a grooming simulation study [277]. However, high
levels of allogrooming activity may not necessarily reflect positive states of the
animal. Pigs in barren environments showed more allogrooming than did those in
enriched housing systems that allowed for rooting and exploration [286,287]. On the
one hand, increased allogrooming may disturb the receiver. On the other hand,
redirected abnormal behaviors may develop such as tailor ear-biting [255]. Therefore,
the level of allogrooming indicative of positive affective states in pigs must be
determined before it can be used as a welfare indicator. With regard to animal
species showing little allogrooming activity, such as sheep and goats [288], or
species in which other affiliative behaviors have to be taken into account (poultry),
potential alternative indicators of positive affective states would have to be
identified and validated. With these caveats affiliative behaviors and especially
allogrooming is a promising candidate for a type of behavior indicative of positive
emotions. 3.4.1.3. Self-grooming. Self-grooming is the maintenance of one's own body
surface. In mammals this maintenance is achieved through licking, scratching, and
rubbing of the fur, as well as through wallowing and bathing. In birds it is through
preening and bathing in water or sand. These various forms of self-grooming maintain
the body surface by removal of dirt and ectoparasites as well as by thermoregulation.
However, self-grooming may also occur as a displacement activity with an
arousal-reduction or relaxation effect [100]. In birds, self-grooming increases in
response to a thwarting or a conflict situation [289]. Likewise in mammals,
self-grooming is - elicited in reaction to a novel or stressful situation [290 292].
Self-grooming is also reported to be higher in animals kept in barren environments.
For example, self-grooming occurred less among rabbits kept in cages with a shelter
as compared to rabbits kept in barren cages [293]. Self-grooming in animals kept in
barren or restrictive environments may be reduced either by the provision of hay,
e.g. in rabbits [294], or by increasing the space allowance, e.g. in dogs [295] or in
dairy calves [296,297]. Likewise, the occurrence of self-grooming is de- creased
under group-housed farming, e.g. in calves [298 300] and horses [275]. When kept in
groups the animals engage in allogrooming, and the higher level of self-grooming in
individually housed animals may be due to the lack of allogrooming that may have an
arousal-reducing effect (Section "" 3.4.1 affiliative behaviors ). Thus, as outlined
above, the relation between the performance of self-grooming and positive emotions is
much less clear-cut than it is for allogrooming. The performance of self-grooming may
occur as a displacement activity in stressful situations and barren environments.
However, self-grooming may also be performed to substitute for social grooming; it is
possible that the performance of selfgrooming reduces arousal as has been suggested
for social grooming. If these effects of self-grooming can be demonstrated, it would
be a potential indicator for positive emotions. 3.4.1.4. Vocalizations. Specific
vocalizations could be considered to some extent as direct expressions of positive
immediate experiences in animals. While vocalizations have long been used as markers
of emotions in animals [301], they have usually concerned negative experiences (e.g.
distress, fear, aggression, defeat). However, focusing on data obtained in rats,
Panksepp and Burgdorf [226] have recently argued that some short chirping ultrasonic
vocalizations centered around 50-kHz could signal positive affects. This conclusion
is supported by " " the fact that such vocal signals are produced in positive
contexts, such as sex, winning fights, play, or manual tickling, and are inhibited by
negative situations [226]. Intriguingly, it is proposed that these vocalizations
could reflect a positive state in rats analogous to primitive laughter that
accompanies social play in human infants. Not only does such a proposal offer a
framework to further study evolutionary roots of positive emotions (and especially
laughter) in humans, but it could also be extended to other species (e.g. domestic
species). For example, some vocalizations of domestic cats, such as purring, are
well-known to be produced in situations of positive valence, - such as mother kitten
interactions, contacts with familiar partner, or during tactile stimulation with
inanimate objects as when rolling and rubbing [302]. Therefore, purring can be ""
generally considered as an indicator of pleasure in cats. Similar data could be
obtained in farm animals. Indeed, lowpitched bleating in sheep has been associated
with some positive-valence situations, as they are produced by males as an estrus
female is approaching or by lactating mothers while licking and nursing their lambs
[288]. Such an approach could be highly beneficial for animal welfare as farm
animals' vocalizations could offer easily measurable markers of positive emotions
since they are audible sounds for humans and can be monitored automatically [303].
Overall there are findings supporting the hypothesis that at least play behaviors,
affiliative behaviors, and some vocalizations can be perceived as indicators of
positive affective states in animals. 3.4.1.5. Information gathering. Information
gathering or exploration might be relevant for positive affective states for two
reasons. The first reason is that it is a behavior that most species of animals are
motivated to perform, i.e. they are fulfilling a behavioral need. The second reason
is that exploration is a behavior that is closely related to and affected by fear.
Information gathering is a behavior that seems to be self-reinforcing to some extent.
It doesn't satiate in the same way as many other behaviors do, and this property has
led some authors to suggest that it might actually be a behavior that is continually
on-going and is only interrupted when other, more immediate needs, are present [304].
There are two forms of exploration: the inquisitive exploration in which the animal
is looking for a change and the inspective exploration in which the animal responds
to a change [305]. If the information primacy interpretation is correct, then
exploration, especially inquisitive exploration, can be regarded as both an indicator
of no other immediate needs and a continuous pleasurable activity in itself (since
the animal keeps doing it). The maintenance of a behavior might not in itself warrant
calling it reinforcing, but combining its flexibility with its self-reinforcing
properties makes it hard to avoid that supposition. In inspective exploration, which
typically is investigation in response to a novel object, there is a gradual approach
to the novel object similar to that seen in other approach/avoidance situations
involving, for example, hunger instead of curiosity. In many of the motivational
models of exploration, the response to the novel object is a result of curiosity and
fear. The fear either interacts with curiosity, with exploration being the
behavioural outcome of that interaction [e.g. [306]], or alternatively fear and
exploration are seen as lying along the same axis [e.g. [305,307]]. This close
relationship between exploration and fear is further supported by the finding that
personality research on animals tends to find a negative correlation between the
reaction of the animal in situations that provoke fear and those that measure
exploration [e.g. [308]]. However, some caution is needed when interpreting these
results since in some cases only a few situations have been measured, and these may
make it inevitable that the two motivational systems are intimately linked. 3.4.2.
Developing an on-farm monitoring system to assess animal welfare Consumers are
increasingly concerned with the welfare of animals contributing to the products they
buy, and there have been several initiatives to develop products marketed according
to animal welfare standards. In the main, welfare assessment schemes have consisted
of checks that the resources available to the animal are sufficient and of good
quality. Nevertheless, there is a consensus among researchers that while this
approach is a good way to minimize the risk of poor welfare, the actual assessment of
animal welfare must depend on animal-based measures [309]. Unfortunately, as already
stated earlier in this section, there are as yet no feasible animal-based measures
indicative of good welfare. Instead there are measures of poor welfare, such as
injury, body condition, fear etc., and it does not necessary follow that in the
absence of these indicators an animal's welfare is good. It merely means that we have
no avoidance that welfare is poor. " " Qualitative assessment methods have been
proposed as a way to characterize global expressive affects in animals using a free
choice profiling approach [44,310]. Among the terms chosen by the observers are those
usually associated with pos"" "" " " " " itive states, e.g. relaxed , friendly ,
affectionate , playful , " " and social . There is difficulty though in validating
these potential welfare indicators since new measures are usually validated against
existing measures. On the other hand, we know that play is a likely candidate for
being associated with a positive affective state and, furthermore, play behavior is
probably the indicator of positive emotions that is most easily " " " readable by
non-professional observers (Section 3.4.1 play " behavior ). Another approach to find
animal-based indicators of positive affects is to watch for the occurrence of
affiliative behaviors that an animal will only perform when it is feeling " safe,
such as allogrooming (Section 3.4.1 affiliative behav" ior ). Such an approach may be
related to the identification of " " " " the terms relaxed or affectionate used by
the observers in the Wemelsfelder and collaborators [44] study. Finally, further
studies on vocalizations in farm animals could lead to the identification of reliable
vocal markers of positive states in these " " domestic species (Section 3.4.1
vocalizations ). These markers would represent easy and convenient tools to assess
positive experiences in farm animals. Although only valid measures should be included
in monitoring systems, it may be that these are the most valid measures currently
available to us if we want to include animal-based measures of positive affective
states under commercial conditions.<component x="311.53" y="601.93" width="251.12"

growing interest in positive emotions in neuroscience and psychology has led to the
development of new areas of investigation, both theoretical and experimental.
Successful expression of positive emotions typically requires a temporal sequence: a
rewarding environment, eliciting a cognitive appraisal in the central nervous system
and followed by physiological and behavioral reactions. Repeated or steady positive
emotional experiences commonly lead to, and are " " often referred to, as a global
state of happiness . The concept of happiness has always been considered one of the
greatest philosophical quandaries and this has often detracted from scientific
investigations. However, such a concept would be very valuable for the study of
animal welfare since it could represent the affective background reflecting maximum
wellbeing. Whereas pleasure is generally assessed in the context of sensory
stimulation, such as the hedonic impact of taste, happiness refers to a longer and
less intense internal state of " feeling, which we argue is closer to the concept of
well" " " being or quality of life . Although the concept of happi ness has been
studied very little, there are some theoretical attempts in the evolutionary approach
that integrates this concept [311]. Some recent work suggests that happiness could be
defined as consisting of both positive emotions and positive activities [4,312].
Animal studies have accumulated a large amount of valuable data regarding sensory
pleasure or evaluating the rewarding properties of many agents, but there is a lack
of data concerning more persistent affective states in animals. Hence, we must rely
on theoretical and human studies to provide stimulating clues to the question of
happiness in animals and the developing study of positive emotions must be considered
as a first step in addressing the question of stable and less expressive affective
states (i.e. mood) in animals. Is there such a state as happiness in animals? If so,
how can it be reliably assessed? Under what conditions is it maintained? What are its
relationships with cognitive abilities? Supported by the recent interest of
neuroscience and psychology, further research into the field of positive emotions and
more persistent positive affective states in animals represents a new avenue for
increasing our understanding of animal welfare processes. Such development could
provide new insights in establishing the bases of real positive well-being in
animals. Research in positive affective states in animals is clearly an ambitious
task, but there are promising returns. Promoting positive experiences can be a way to
improve health in animals and more generally to give them a better quality of life.
Likewise, including criteria of positive affective states in farm or laboratory
monitoring schemes can improve welfare assessment beyond the traditional focus on
mere absence of disease and distress.<component x="301.72" y="40.04" width="251.13"

good welfare is not simply the absence of negative experiences, but rather is
primarily the presence of positive experiences such as pleasure. However scientific
investigation of positive emotions has long been neglected. This paper addresses two
main issues: first, it reviews the current state of scientific knowledge that
supports the existence of positive affective states in animals and, second, it
suggests possible applications of this knowledge that may enhance quality of life
under animal management conditions. In the first part of the paper, recent advances
in psychology and neuroscience are reviewed to provide pragmatic frameworks based on
cognitive processes (such as positive anticipation, contrast and controllability) for
further investigations of positive emotions in animals. Thereafter, the
neurobiological bases of positive emotions are highlighted in order to identify
behavioral and physiological expressions of positive experiences in animals.
Monitoring both the autonomic nervous system (via heart rate and its variability) and
the immune system could offer relevant tools to better assess emotional states in
animals, complementary to classical adrenocortical measures. In the second part of
the paper, useful strategies for enhancing positive experiences (such as physical,
social and cognitive enrichment or putative genetic selection) are outlined. Then
this paper emphasizes practical applications for assessing and promoting positive
emotions that may help in providing animals with a better quality of life. Play,
affiliative behaviors and some vocalizations appear to be the most promising
convenient indicators for assessing positive experiences in laboratory and farm
animals under commercial conditions. &#xA9; 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

century, there was a surge of interest in animal sentience. Animal welfare scientists
quickly realized that welfare problems can be better addressed with an understanding
of how animals could feel. It is now widely accepted that animals can feel pain and
suffering, and methods to assess pain and suffering have been developed. However,
there is still no agreement on how to assess positive experiences although these are
suggested to be a core component of good welfare [1,2] Nevertheless, animals that
have successfully obtained commodities such as food or social contact are known to
display signs that are reminiscent of pleasure in humans. Therefore, a central issue
is to be able to assess whether and under what circumstances animals experience
positive emotions. This issue is far more than merely theoretical; it also has
ethical and practical importance for animal welfare. It has been pointed out that
well-being is not simply the absence of negative affects, but also (and even
predominantly) the presence of positive affects [3,4]. That means it is better to
ensure joyful and contented behaviors rather than focusing on behaviors that
represent needs that have to be fulfilled to avoid suffering [5]. In addition, the
absence of signs of pleasure or positive affect may be an indication on its own of a
state of affective discomfort. Indeed anhedonia, which is the inability to experience
pleasure, is one of the core symptoms of depression. Therefore, a new challenge for
animal welfare science is to better understand the link between the ability to
express positive emotions and a more persistent positive affective state, such as
happiness. Moreover, applied ethology deals with a wide range of animal species,
having different emotional repertoires and different behavioral patterns. Another
challenge is thus to describe the range of putative positive emotions in each of the
laboratory and farm animal species. From an evolutionary perspective, emotions are
considered as adaptive programs designed through repeated encounters that are
intended to either direct other physiological programs or to directly solve adaptive
problems faced by a species over time. One of the key factors explaining the
phylogenetic success of emotions is that they would favor adaptive cognition and
action. According to evolutionary psychology, emotions are considered as
super-ordinate mechanisms allowing the whole organism to operate in a homogenous way
when the individual is confronting relevant triggering conditions or situations. They
are adaptations that have arisen in response to the adaptive problem of mechanism
orchestration [6]. Generally speaking, the situations where emotions play a role are
those that recurred ancestrally, those that could not be dealt with without a
governing program, and those in which an error would have resulted in large fitness
costs [7]. However, given the very nature of emotional self-experience, there is
ultimately no way to know if animals experience emotions similar to humans. However,
behavior, structure, and brain chemistry are similar in humans and in a large number
of animal species. It is therefore likely that they feel as we do, including not only
well-studied negative emotions, but also positive ones. Study of emotions in animals
has received a growing interest in the past few decades, as testified by the
emergence of a new discipline referred to as Affective Neuroscience [8]. However,
despite the efforts of pioneering authors such as Colin Allen, Jaak Panksepp, Michel
Cabanac or Kent Berridge, relatively little has been done to further the
understanding of positive emotions by comparison to their negative counterparts such
as fear. Such an imbalance does not seem to be unique to animal studies. Indeed, the
study of emotions in humans suffers the same bias. As in animal studies, the human
psychological study of well-being has long been dominated by stress studies. The
primary reason for this bias is presumably that the expressions of negative
experiences are far more intense than positive affects and therefore easier to study.
These latter experiences are commonly considered as less significant since they are
more labile and their expression is more subtle. Nevertheless, in the last few years,
new disciplines such as Positive Psychology have been growing in order to explore
positive emotions as primary components of subjective well-being [9,10]. The present
paper does not claim to re-equilibrate the balance by itself but to contribute to
promote the promise of studying positive emotions in animals. It addresses two main
issues. It is intended first to review the current state of knowledge regarding the
biological foundations of positive emotions, and second to indicate some possible
applications for improving the quality of life of animals under management
conditions. The presentation of the biological background of positive emotions
successively deals with the cognitive, neurobiological, behavioral, and physiological
aspects that support the existence of positive emotions in animals. Following this
review, the practical applications in animal welfare are outlined. These applications
include useful approaches for enhancing positive experiences and on-going more
persistent affective states, as well as a discussion of the most promising positive
indicators that may be used to monitor animal welfare in both laboratory and farm
animals.<component x="32.71" y="40.04" width="251.06" height="295.98" page="2"

from both biology and psychology on the concept of emotion. Whereas there is not a
general definition, an emotion can be defined as an intense but short-lived affective
response to an event, which is associated with specific body changes [11]. The
duration of an emotion is a much-debated question, but briefness seems widely
accepted. Emotions refer to processes, which are likely to have evolved from basic
mechanisms that gave the animals the ability to avoid harm/punishment or to seek
valuable resources/reward [12,13]. Contemporary approaches to study emotions vary
according to whether they emphasize a classification of the various emotions
(dimensional approaches such as pleasant/ unpleasant valence or weak/strong
excitation), whether they focus on the eliciting mechanisms (neural circuit models
and basic emotion models), or whether they emphasize the different components of an
emotion. In componential approaches, an emotion is classically described as including
a behavioral component (a posture or an activity), an autonomic component (visceral
and endocrine responses) and a subjective component (emotional experience or feeling)

Although it is claimed that animals are sentient creatures, it is paradoxical that
there is no exact knowledge of what their emotional experiences are about. Rollin
[14] calls attention to the paradox that scientists are reluctant to attribute
emotions, such as anxiety or suffering, to animals, while at the same time
considerable experimental work is manifestly being done to stop pain or to relieve
anxiety in animals. Using the term emotion in animals is often considered
unscientific and implicating anthropomorphic assumptions of human-like subjective
experience. " As pointed out by LeDoux [15], a subjective emotional experience, like
the feeling of being afraid, results when we become consciously aware of an emotion
system of the brain, " like the defense system . In other words, to feel afraid it is
necessary to have access to consciousness that allows awareness of the internal
state. Damasio [16] claims that the consciousness of an emotion corresponds to the
knowledge of the ability to experience emotions. Perceptive (or anoetic)
consciousness is usually defined in terms of the capacity to be aware of feelings,
sensations, thoughts and emotions [17]. There is a vigorous debate as to whether
feelings of consciousness are present in non-human animals, and if so in which
species [reviewed by [8,18,19]]. The common assumption is that the more cognitively
complex an animal is, the more likely it is to be conscious. However, why should
increasing cognitive complexity necessarily be linked to the emergence of
consciousness or vice versa? The approach of using complex cognitive capabilities as
potential indicators of the presence of conscious experience in animals has rightly
been criticized [reviewed by [20]]. Recently, Alexandrov and Sams [21] proposed a
unified concept of consciousness and emotions. It is not our purpose to discuss the
links between cognition and consciousness [reviewed by [22]], but we want to stress
the usefulness of cognitive science for research on emotions in animals and thus for
animal welfare. Feelings require some cognitive abilities to establish temporal and
instrumental contingencies. These abilities allow anticipation or prediction of
events whereas emotional responses involve coping with the situation. Learning
temporal contingency refers to the ability to relate the occurrence of one stimulus
to another when the two occur in succession, the first one becoming a predictor for
the second. Learning an instrumental contingency refers to the ability to assess the
consequences of one's response to the sit" " uation. In this context, affects provide
the common currency [23] with which animals can balance conflicting demands of
avoiding bad things and approaching better ones, and can evaluate the priority to be
given to one over the other [24]. 2.1.2. Cognitive components of emotional processing
All the previously reported studies emphasize the relationship between emotions and
cognition. They describe how an emotional system in the brain is operating and the
minimum mental operation it requires. Cognition has to do with information
processing, and refers to the range of processes involved in the acquisition,
storage, and manipulation of information [25]. Whereas the relationship between
emotions and cognition has received little attention in animal studies, it has been
extensively investigated in human psychology. For most psychologists, there cannot be
any emotion without some form of cognition [reviewed by 26], and several theories
stress the generative role of cognition in the expression of emotional states. For
Lazarus [27], an emotional state requires a primary appraisal of the emotional
stimulus, which is responsible for the action planning and execution; the
consequences of this action are then evaluated through a secondary appraisal.
Cognitive theories of emotion contend that the individual's cognitive appraisal of
the stimulating event determines the quality of - emotion [28 31]. Although labeled
as cognitive, the appraisals are not thought to result from complex analytical
reasoning. Instead, they are presumed to be relatively effortless, intuitive and
automatic evaluations that are sensitive to events related to survival (e.g. threat)
and opportunities (e.g. forming attachments). Various forms of evaluative
processings, ranging from rapid to subtle, occur to differentiate the emotional
experiences. Appraisal may be influenced by innate automatic responses that probably
evolved over many generations (e.g. response to a snake), and by learning and memory
of previous encounters with stimuli during the individual's lifetime [15]. A simple
framework based on cognitive evaluation can be employed for the study of emotions in
animals. Events can be appraised according to whether they are rewarding or punishing
[12,32]. Presentation of rewards leads to positive emotions such as pleasure, while
omission of rewards leads to frustration or anger. Likewise, Lazarus [27] suggested
two simple steps of appraisal. The first step appraises whether the current situation
alters the well-being of the individual (if not, there is no emotional arousal). The
second step appraises the meaning of the alteration. When the alteration reduces
well-being, it leads to a negative emotion whereas when the alteration increases
wellbeing, it leads to a positive emotion. The behavioral and physiological profiles
recorded under these conditions could be used as indicators of putative emotional
states. When a specific internal state is the only discriminating stimulus available
to the animal, it can use the said internal state as a cue to select the appropriate
operant response in order to get a reward. One might say the animal perceives the
internal representation of its state within its central nervous system in a way that
contributes to or determines its actions. As a behavioral outcome the animal will
choose what seems most pleasurable [23]. Measures of cognitive processes, such as
anticipation, can provide information about animal emotion. Indeed, anticipatory
behavior measured in a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm has been identified as a
potential indicator of emotion [33]. Recent developments in human psychology of
emotions could help to create a more complete framework for categorizing emotions in
animals. According to Scherer [34], emotions are determined on the basis of a limited
number of elementary evaluative criteria: (i) the novelty of the event, (ii) its
intrinsic pleasantness, (iii) its goal significance, (iv) the coping potential of the
individual, and (v) the relevance to social norms. The novelty of the event, which
breaks down into suddenness, familiarity and predictability, and its intrinsic
pleasantness are used to evaluate the relevance of the event. The goal significance
concerns the consequences of the event relative to the individual's expectations. The
coping potential indicates how well the individual can control and adapt to the
event. Finally the relevance to norms concerns how the response fits the personal and
social norms. Scherer [34] postulates that the type of emotion results from the
particular combination of elementary criteria used to evaluate the eliciting
situation. Scherer's model appears useful for trying to describe in very objective
terms the types of emotion that are accessible to different animals; it makes it
possible to infer an animal's subjective component and to predict responses according
to the evaluation process [35,36]. Most of the elementary criteria defined by Scherer
[34] are likely to be perceived and used by animals, and the range of emotions that
animals can access may be estimated by investigating to what degree they can
distinguish among elementary criteria and respond to them. By presenting animals with
test situations for which one (or several) likely evaluative criterion has been
experimentally manipulated, and at the same time recording their resultant cardiac
and behavioral reactions, direct relationships between presumed appraisal and
measurable emotional outcomes can be established. Using such an approach,
D&#xE9;sir&#xE9; and collaborators [37] have demonstrated that lambs produce
differential emotional responses to suddenness (startle and tachycardia) and
unfamiliarity (behavioral orientation and increase heart rate variability). In
addition, as would be assumed from the dynamic sequential organization of appraisal
in Scherer's model [34], the combination of suddenness and unfamiliarity criteria
enhances behavioral and cardiac responses that are specific to one or the other
criterion [38]. The a priori framework proposed by D&#xE9;sir&#xE9; and collaborators
[36], which directly considers the cognitive component of emotional processes, helps
in mapping behavioral and physiological responses in animals to particular emotional
states, including positive ones. For instance, an event evaluated as being pleasant,
of moderate predictability, and not sudden should trigger a positive emotion.
Whatever the a priori framework, it is now time to integrate theories and techniques
from cognitive science in order to develop new approaches to understanding emotions
in animals. Emotional processing must now be regarded as comprised of not only
behavioral, physiological, and subjective components but also a cognitive component.
2.1.3. Emotion and mood: acute and long-term evaluations As was previously reported,
cognitive processing is involved in determining emotional experience. However, there
is evidence in humans that causal links between emotions and cognition occur in both
directions, with cognitive manipulations influencing felt emotion and emotional
manipulations influencing cognitive processing [39]. For instance, the emotional
state can lead to changes in cognitive functioning such as an increased tendency to
attend to threatening stimuli during fear, or an enhanced memory for an unhappy event
during sadness [40]. Recently, Paul and collaborators [39] reviewed the variety of
alterations of cognitive processing due to emotions in humans. They classify these
cognitive biases into three categories: attention, memory and judgment biases. For
instance, anxiety has been argued to represent an attentional shift towards potential
threats. Likewise, negative emotions are associated with a heightened ability to
memorize negative events. Judgment processes may be affected by current emotions in a
number of ways: emotion may directly alter the judgment or risk assessment process,
or act indirectly through biases in the attention and memory processes that pertain
to it. Such emotional modulations of cognitive processes can be interpreted to have
adaptive value by helping a fearful or anxious individual to attend to, to memorize
and to make judgments about threatening circumstances. The few studies on animals
show that such effects are not restricted to humans. In rodents, the startle response
induced by exposure to a sudden event tends to occur faster and with greater
amplitude under negative emotional states [41]. Rats housed in conditions designed to
induce a persistent negative mood are less ready to respond to an ambiguous stimulus
as signaling the delivery of a good event [42]. Likewise, rats housed under social
stress or " " isolation exhibit a reduced frequency of behavioral transitions between
the presentation of a conditioned stimulus predicting sucrose reward and the arrival
of that reward, indicating a reduced anticipatory behavior due to judgment
difficulties [43]. Developing similar approaches in farm animals could help to
develop new indicators of persistent emotional states (i.e., bad or good moods), such
as an enhanced expectation of positive events [33]. All these studies demonstrate how
cognitive approaches can be used in animals to probe emotions (as short-term
affective experiences) and moods (as persistent affective experiences). 2.1.4. What
are positive emotions? Except for a few approaches, such as the ones developed by
Wemelsfelder and Farish [44] and by Burghardt [45] that emphasize positive as well as
negative states, studies of negative emotions are generally far more numerous than
those of positive emotions. A number of signs can indicate positive - experience in
animals for example, successful coping, reward, and wanting resulting in
goal-directed behavior. Positive emotions can be separated into three temporal
categories: i) past (e.g. post-consummatory satisfaction), ii) present (e.g. pleasant
sensory activity), and iii) future (e.g. positive expectation, anticipatory joy).
Focusing on present positive emotions, three categories of pleasure have been
proposed in humans [4]: sensory pleasures, higher pleasures (i.e. non-homeostatic
sensory experiences), and gratifications (i.e. inner intellectual experiences), with
at least the first and presumably the second categories being candidates for animal
investigations. Hedonism refers in its narrowest sense to pleasure or positive affect
[46]. Hedonism can also have a broader meaning referring to a general affective
disposition, either positive or negative. The presence of behavioral and
physiological signs of pleasure reminiscent of human euphoria has been demonstrated
in animals. Such signs can be induced both as a result of natural rewards and in
models for addiction resulting from treatment with rewarding drugs such as heroin,
other opioids, or dopaminergic drugs [47]. Animals that are about to obtain food or
are engaged in play often have a typical behavioral pattern characterized by short,
abrupt, and quickly changing movements (Section 3.4). The behavioral and
physiological homology between natural rewards and drugs is striking. The brain
mechanisms involved in mediating rewards have been functionally related to
motivational aspects of natural behaviors and behaviors of addiction. Classically
motivated behaviors can be divided into two components: appetitive and consummatory
behaviors. Interestingly, the appetitive component has also been neurobiologically
dissociated from the consummatory aspects. Scientific evidence demonstrates
similarity in underlying mechanisms for rewards provided by addictive substances and
by natural commodities such as foods (Section 2.2). Preventing a behavior that is
mainly motivated by internal causal factors is a proposed cause of poor welfare of
animals kept in captivity - [48 50]. Thus, one might propose an approach to assessing
and improving animal welfare that focuses on signs of pleasure instead of post hoc
signs of displeasure or of other negative emotional states. After having drawn the
neurobiological basis of positive affects, the next sections of this review should
help to better assess positive emotional states in animals by validating behavioral
and physiological expressions of positive emotions. " " 2.2. Neurobiological bases of
positive emotions: the emotional 433 brain 2.2.1. Actions on the reward system There
is now substantial evidence that emotions are based on neural activity in the limbic
forebrain, i.e. the prefrontal, insular and cingulate cortex, the hippocampus, the
amygdala and the septal nuclei. While the cortical areas do not have direct
homologues in non-mammalian vertebrates, the others are ubiquitous in at least all
tetrapods [51]. Two sensory systems have shortcut access to the limbic system: i)
olfactory nuclei projecting directly to the amygdala, and ii) afferents from the
medial geniculate body, the thalamic relay of acoustic signals [52]. In mammals, all
other sensory modalities also reach the limbic centers, including the amygdala, after
being processed in their respective sensory cortical areas [53]. Emotional states are
distributed among limbic centers. Various emotions have been attributed to neural
activity and the action of several neurotransmitters and modulators in these areas in
humans and laboratory animals. Basically, the main players for positive emotional
states, such as reward and appetitive behavioral motivations and actions (Section
2.3), are the amygdala complex and, most important, the nucleus accumbens septi as a
terminal site of the dopaminergic mesolimbic axis originating in the midbrain ventral
tegmental area (VTA) [reviewed by 54,55]. It is noteworthy in this context that
opioids act on the mesolimbic axis either indirectly by stimulating dopaminergic VTA
neurons or directly by increasing dopamine at the level of the nucleus accumbens,
supporting the view that mesolimbic dopamine is closely linked with rewarding
stimulation and action [56,57], including positive anticipatory behavior [33,58].
Berridge [59] has suggested that, at least in the context of feeding behavior, "" the
positive emotional valences wanting (appetite, incentive " " motivation) and liking
(pleasure) can be dissociated, as they are apparently mediated by different
transmitter systems in the brain, that is dopamine and opioids, respectively.
Amygdala activity has been correlated to negative emotions such as fear and anxiety,
where its role is well established [15,60]. In humans the amygdala complex is
involved in the understanding of emotional facial expressions [61] and in the
perception of perceived or expected negative stimuli as revealed by imaging
techniques [62]. However, there is now evidence that the amygdala complex is also
involved in positive emotions. Pleasurable music has been found to activate the
amygdala and the ventral striatum as well as orbitofrontal centers in humans [63],
and it was recently reported that in monkeys single amygdala neurons respond in
anticipation of fruit reward [64]. Hence, it seems that subpopulations of amygdaloid
neurons exist that respond differently to the emotional value of a stimulus. These
findings indicate that this area is likely not a center that mediates judgment of
negative events exclusively. Together with thalamic centers the amygdala has also
been found to be a relay of oxytocin-mediated social recognition and attachment
[65,66]. It now seems evident that, in mammals, brain oxytocin together with
vasopressin plays an important role in positive social bonding, mainly, though not
exclusively, between mates and between mothers and their offspring [67,68]. Besides
acting at amygdaloid sites, oxytocin also acts at the mesolimbic axis, the nucleus
accumbens in particular, where it triggers dopamine release in the context of social
bonding [69]. The main structures, neuromodulators, sites of origin, and actions are
summarized in Table 1. Within the appraisal framework, the hippocampal and
parahippocampal systems have been found to be involved in the detection and
evaluation of new events that are embedded in semantic, temporal or local relations
[80,81]. The detection of novelty requires perceptual identification and attempts to
match actual sensory input to stored items. If this matching attempt remains
unsuccessful, the situation is perceptually new and may demand increased effort.
Consequently, coping with enriched environments requires activity and exercise, and
such environments favor hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity [82,83].
This view is supported by the involvement of the hippocampal system in the mediation
of stress reactions [84], including the startle response [85]. When there is nothing
new and demanding, however, the hippocampus exerts an inhibitory influence on the
stress axis. More and more neurobiological evidence has now become available
indicating that in fact two<component x="311.53" y="87.84" width="251.13"

be distinguished. These aspects relate to the previously mentioned appetitive and
consummatory behaviors, which are in turn linked to wanting and liking respectively.
Combined, these two aspects are involved in a - cost benefit analysis that subjects
make in relation to rewards and may reflect the effort that individuals are willing
to exert to collect rewards [86]. 2.2.2. Dopamine reflects intensity of wanting while
opioids determine what is wanted The meso-accumbens dopamine system is involved in
the "" disposition to act upon previously liked rewards, i.e. in wanting [47].
Behaviorally, wanting is expressed as changes in transitions of goal-directed
behavioral patterns, such as locomotor and investigatory behavior, prior to obtaining
rewards. These patterns are labeled as anticipatory or appetitive behavior [33].
Depending on species and test conditions, behavioral changes either increase or
decrease [rats: [43,58], mink: [87]]. These changes may be related to the role of
dopamine in integrating cue- and contextassociated details of the response to be
displayed or in other words integrating neuronal inputs from the hippocampus and
amygdala in the output of the nucleus accumbens [88]. The meso-accumbens dopamine
system has a high degree of plasticity, which underlies its role in the organization
of the efficacy of behavior. Highly rewarding incentives may sensitize the system,
since it seems adaptive in the long term that what was "" "" once liked to a certain
extent should be wanted in the future to the same extent. A seemingly contradictory
finding is that stressors such as short-lasting social isolation or poor rearing
conditions [58] also increase anticipatory activity for sucrose as a reward due to
the fact that stress sensitizes this system [33,89]. Hence it seems that under
conditions of apparent loss of control animals must increase their appetitive
attempts to improve the perceived affective state. Stimulation of mu-opioid receptors
in the VTA, the origin of the meso-accumbens dopamine system, enhances dopamine
release in the accumbens [reviewed by [90]]. It was shown in rats that the expression
of anticipatory activity to rewards is blocked by the mu-opioid antagonist naloxone
[33, 91]. This point was further demonstrated in mice lacking the mu-opioid receptor
in a schedule-induced food-anticipation behavior paradigm [90]. These data show that
the meso-accumbens dopamine system is under control of the opioid system, and suggest
that the opioid system is important in adjusting the activity of the mesoaccumbens
dopamine system to challenges from the environment. Opioids in a low dose stimulate
the onset of motivated behavior. They elicit feeding [92], social interaction, and
play in young animals [93], depending on the context. By their stimulation of
motivated behavior and simultaneous suppression of pain etc., they allow the animal
to start obtaining commodities. The opioid system is thus related to the
consummatory, liking aspect of motivation, whereas dopamine, which is the interface
between emotion and motion, would be a system mediating motivation for reward in a
broad sense, including relief from stress, rather than reward per se. In contrast to
states of motivation, where reward is sought and eventually gained, very little is
known about the neuronal basis of satisfaction. In mammals this state of fulfilled
needs and cessation of drive for further rewarding sensations seems to be
characterized by reduced activities in a considerable network of forebrain
structures, including the hypothalamus, amygdala, and frontal and insular cortex
[94]. Shedding more light on the neuronal base of this important state of welfare
will be necessary in future in order to have the full picture of
well-being.<component x="301.72" y="637.75" width="251.02" height="80.83" page="6"

aware of the fact that various perspectives on motivation exist, here we follow the
perspective described in behavioral neuroscience, which is strongly supported by
ethological and neurobiological evidence. In the literature on reward, addiction and
affect [47,19], a close link has been made between neuronal structures and the
components of motivation (e.g. appetitive or consummatory) [33]. The function of
reward systems could be to weigh costs versus benefits of obtaining a commodity. The
outweighing of costs by benefits would coincide with the experience of pleasure. A
number of needs are dealt with autonomously, such as temperature, heart rate etc.
However behaviors that need integration in space and time and that use previously
acquired sensory information require focused attention of the highest emotional and
cognitive brain centers. Selection of the most pressing need is executed by reward
systems based on expectations. Ventral tegmental dopamine has been called the
interface between motivation and movement [95] and links the specific requirement of
a particular need with expected satisfaction of that need and activates higher
cognitive processing. At least in humans one might say that the reward appraisal
centers in combination with the nature of the need are experienced as affective
consciousness. Affective consciousness probably occurs in animals as well though it
will depend upon the cognitive capacity of the animal [19]. Two types of behavioral
needs can be distinguished. First, needs that induce behavioral patterns can be
evaluated by their direct physiological consequences for the underlying motivational
system. For instance, hunger requires eating of food, which affects blood glucose,
leptin levels and other parameters representing the metabolic status of the
individual and influencing food regulation centers in the brain. Second, Jensen and
Toates [96] defined a behavioral need as a specific behavioral pattern that the
animal apparently has to perform, irrespective of the environment or of the animal's
physiological needs. In other words, needs that involve the display of typical
behaviors lack direct physiological consequences and thus also lack direct feedback
from regulatory physiological mechanisms. It seems as though the biological relevance
of regular performance of those behaviors lies in their long-term benefits for the
individual animal or its offspring, e.g. behaviors concerning reproduction, foraging
and grooming. The motivation to perform these essential behavioral patterns is
governed by the display itself rather than to meet short-term physiological needs
[48]. The mechanism underlying the regular display can be understood when it is
assumed that the display itself, rather than its immediate effects, has rewarding
properties. Long-term effects are then a probable outcome of the display, but beyond
what can be monitored by the individual animal. The impact of the display on reward
guarantees its regular occurrence. The absence of such rewarding behavior coincides
with the absence of an important source of reward [33]. 2.3.2. How can behavioral
needs induce pleasure and why do they make the animal vulnerable? Appetitive
behaviors with low probability of success or with a long time interval between onset
and eventual consummatory responses would benefit from a regulating mechanism like
that just described for behavioral needs. The animal can never stop looking for food,
safety, and reproductive opportunities, even following unsuccessful attempts; in
other words investing for the future must have direct rewarding consequences.
Behaviors, which serve as an investment for collecting a necessary incentive, e.g.
food or social companionship, may be self-rewarding in order "" to maintain these
types of searching behaviors. Other examples are hunting in predators, exploration in
a number of species, rooting in pigs, etc. Appetitive or seeking behaviors
(motivational states of wanting) have been associated with mesolimbic dopamine,
whereas consummatory behaviors (liking or hedonic motivational states) have been more
associated with opioids [97,19,47,33]. Social behavior [98,19], reproductive behavior
[98], play [99], autogrooming [100] and dust-bathing [101,102] are supposed to have
rewarding properties. To be self-rewarding, a specific behavior should activate the
mesolimbic system, for instance by the release of endorphins, which then exert a
positive feedback on this behavior, resulting in a longer lasting, on-going
behavioral bout. Taking this process into account, one would expect that opioids may
induce such behaviors, while opioid antagonists would counteract their - display. One
would expect self-rewarding behaviors to interact - cross sensitization and cross
tolerance with drugs of addiction or rewarding stimuli such as food. The opportunity
to display may itself act as a reinforcer and can be used as an incentive in
conditioned place preference studies. Being deprived of opportunities to perform
specific behaviours resulting from these behavioral needs produces signs of
withdrawal paralleling those observed in deprivation of an addictive drug
[19,23,47,95,98]. Exploration in rodents, when modeled by wheel-running behavior,
shows such interaction (cross sensitization) with mesolimbic dopamine and cross
tolerance with morphine [103], an interaction similar to those observed for drugs of
addiction. Cross sensitization between food and drugs of abuse has also been shown,
and this phenomenon could be counteracted by an opiate antagonist [104]. Social
behavior, play and self-grooming can be induced by endorphins and counteracted by
naloxone - [98 100]. A drawback of this efficient mechanism regulating the motivation
of those behaviors that represent animals' behavioral needs is that self-rewarding
behaviors may run out of control - when dopaminergic systems are sensitized by stress
[105 107]. If some stressors amplify animals' wanting for rewards when no external
rewards are immediately available, they may instead look for compensation by
performing self-rewarding behavior [108,109]. Thus, depending on the species and
circumstances, stressed individuals may display excessive locomotion, sexual
activity, or self-grooming. Because highly motivated behaviors are so rewarding,
being deprived of them is a severe stressor. At the same time some of them do not
have an immediate high priority because they have a long-term payoff. Play for
instance only occurs when other needs are met. Therefore, occurrence of play behavior
or typical signs of satisfaction indicate that the animal is not deprived of
important sources of pleasure and that other needs are being met. That is why such
behaviors are good candidates for welfare indicators (Section 3.4).<component

parasympathetic balance The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is an important efferent
of the limbic system. It is primarily amygdala output, acting via hypothalamic
centers, that influences autonomic brainstem nuclei controlling the activity of
sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The relative level of activity of these two
systems is an indicator of an organism's general physiological state (action or
digestion). Though this relative activity depends on homeostasis, it is also
determined to a great degree by current emotions. Hence, measures of heart rate (HR)
are broadly accepted as a valid index of stress in many vertebrate species as they
give an impression of the activity of - the ANS [110 112]. Interpretations have often
been based on the assumption that HR reflects the activity of the sympathetic branch
of the ANS and therefore can be used as an indicator of the sympatho-adrenomedullary
stress response. However, the heart is also under parasympathetic control, and HR at
every point in time is the result of non-additive effects of the interaction between
the two branches of the ANS [113]. Thereby, the effects of emotional perceptions on
cardiac activity are mediated via direct innervations of the sino-atrial node of the
heart by sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers [114,115]. As a consequence of these
permanent regulatory functions, HR is never constant but varies from beat to beat,
hence the concept of heart rate variability (HRV). HRVis mediated by either an
increase/decrease of sympathetic tone or an increase/decrease of parasympathetic
tone. Hence, analyzing HRV helps to identify which branch of the ANS is actually
mediating heart rate and to assess the sympatho-vagal balance of an organism [116].
The assumption underlying the assessment of HRV is that, as a peripheral measure of
ANS activity, it serves as a proxy for vagal tone, vagal reactivity and
sympatho-vagal balance that otherwise could only be measured by hard-to-perform
invasive techniques [115,117]. A certain degree of HRV is a characteristic of any
healthy vertebrate [118]. In recent years, cardiac vagal tone assessed by
HRV-analysis has received considerable attention as a psychophysiological marker of
emotion regulation, and of certain aspects of psychological adjustment in humans
[reviewed by 119,120]. Most of the work has focused mainly on negative emotions and
emotional disorders, which have been referred to as anger-proneness, irritability,
irritable distress, and negative mood. However, cardiac vagal tone may also be an
indicator of positive emotional states. Fox [121] found a near significant
correlation between infant HRVand positive reactivity during a peek-a-boo procedure
with mothers and strangers. McCraty and colleagues [122,123] reported higher HRV in
human adults after selfinduced positive emotional states. Recently, Lee and
collaborators found higher levels of HRV and reduced HR in humans after the intake of
a traditional herbal remedy [124] and during Qi therapy, a Chinese external therapy
[125]; this effect was correlated with more pleasant and calm emotions compared to
the placebo group. Rainville and collaborators [126] found evidence that distinct
patterns of peripheral physiological activity (e.g. HRV) are associated with
different emotions like sadness or happiness. Recently, patterns of HRV reduction
have - been studied in farm animals in reaction to stressors [127 129], behavioral
disorders [130] and in the context of cognitive appraisal [37]. For a broader
discussion of this topic see also the review on HRV by von Borell and collaborators
in this issue. The potential elements and patterns of autonomic activity have not
been exhaustively examined. Moreover, it is possible that emotions or components of
emotions could be differentiated on the basis of sympathetic and parasympathetic
innervations of the viscera rather than on visceral responses per se [131]. However,
taken together the data indicate that monitoring activity of the autonomic nervous
system, essentially through heart rate and its variability as suggested especially by
human studies, may deliver suitable approaches to assess positive emotions in animals
when combined with behavioral records [36]. 2.4.2. Neuroendocrine activation The
physiological responses of the autonomic nervous and neuroendocrine systems trigger
neuronal processes in the brain that influence the way animals cope with the
situation. For instance, sustained high cortisol levels are associated with a higher
probability of engaging in passive coping (i.e. being reactive), whereas high
catecholamine levels are associated with a higher probability of engaging in active
coping [132]. However, - transient activations of the stress axes i.e. the
adrenocortical axis - (HPA) and the ANS are regularly coincident with any emotionally
triggered activity and cannot be easily differentiated for positive and negative
emotions. They might as readily be activated for actions of defense as for reward.
Accordingly, in a comprehensive study in pigs it has been demonstrated that
individuals with a high success in a dominance intruder test displayed dynamic
peripheral responses of the HPA that were virtually the same as in losers [133].
Roughly the same was revealed in the ANS, however with a tendency toward a more rapid
decrease after fighting in the high success animals. Further, winners tended to have
a higher noradrenalin/adrenalin ratio which, in general, could reflect a less passive
behavioral pattern [134]. Hence, intrinsic processes ( e.g. fluctuations of hormone
concentrations, induced spontaneously or by chronic emotional stress) may cause
changes in mood, while sensory inputs may be able to release emotions. Although
experimental evidence is still scarce concerning changes in physiological parameters
that accompany positive emotional experiences, some recent studies with human
subjects reveal promising leads to follow in animal studies. Taking advantage of
recent developments in salivary assay methods, physiological studies of human saliva
suggest that its protein composition could be used as a monitoring tool for the
assessment of some emotional/mood states. Indeed, while negative - emotions are
associated with a decrease in 20 200 kD proteins, in positive emotions an increase in
these proteins is observed - [135]. It has also been found that salivary alpha
amylase (sAA) levels in humans are increased in response to physiological and
psychological stress [136]. Furthermore, it is suggested that the level of this
enzyme could be considered as an index of soothing effect or relaxation in humans as
sAA levels are significantly decreased by soothing/pleasant video viewing [137]. The
detailed mechanism of the amylase decrease remains unclear. However, developing such
measures in animals could offer a relevant tool to assess positive emotional states
in animals. 2.4.3. Immunological activation An important literature exists regarding
the emotional influences on immune functions, supported by both human and animal
studies. Indeed, not only is there an extensive literature on the complex
interactions between the HPA-axis and the immune system [138], but also emotional
limbic activity has been found to have important effects on immunity [139]. In pigs,
positive and negative psychological experiences affected immune system parameters
antagonistically, depending on the success of coping [140]. Hence, immune status may
be another indicator of long-lasting emotional state (or mood), and immunological
parameters may be indicators of frequent positive (or negative) emotions [141].
However, with the present state of knowledge, they are difficult to interpret since
the various immune factors constitute a multidimensional vector whose components are
mutually interacting and can be easily influenced by non-obvious infections.
Unfortunately, experimental evidence linking positive emotional experiences to the
immune system is lacking. It is therefore risky to infer that positive emotional
stimuli would enhance immune defenses. However, a recent study found that pleasant
stimuli in human (i.e. humoristic story-telling) induced an increase in secretory
immunoglogulin-A (s-IgA) [142]. This confirms results from a pioneering study by
Dillon and collaborators [143] in which the salivary IgA concentration was
specifically increased after subjects viewed a humorous video sequence. Since s-IgA
is considered an indicator of overall immune function, such measures in laboratory
and farm animals could offer new insights for the understanding of emotional
influence over immunity. Conversely with brain-to-immune influences, growing evidence
reveals that the immune system influences brain functions, including structures
involved in emotional processes. In addition to various effects on emotion-related
neurotransmitters (i.e. serotonin or noradrenalin), immune activation is known to
induce HPA activation [138]. When these data are combined with the fact that immune
and stress responses have been argued to share common evolutionary defensive
properties, immune activation is increasingly considered as a stress response by
itself [144]. Moreover, some studies show that immune activation has emotional
effects, such as anxiety- or depression-like behaviors [141,145]. Nevertheless, it
has recently been shown that rats made sick through the peripheral administration of
endotoxin are still able to response positively (i.e. hedonic facial responses) to
palatable taste solutions such as sucrose [146]. However, when subjected to mixed
bittersweet solutions, these rats display more aversive and fewer hedonic responses
than do controls [146]. Therefore, immune activation cannot be considered to induce
anhedonia as had been reported in earlier studies. Rather, these data may illustrate
alliesthesia, i.e. modification of the affective value (i.e. valence) of a specific
stimulus related to the subject's physiological status [147]. In other words, it has
been proposed that instead of causing a negative emotional state, immune activation
would enhance reactivity of subjects to salient negative features of a given
situation, thus motivating their defensive repertoire [148,149]. Inflammatory markers
could therefore be used as possible indicators of a transitory vulnerability of
subjects to external sources of stress, and immune activation could be used as a tool
to evaluate the plasticity of the valence (e.g. from pleasant to aversive) of
specific features of each subject's environment [150]. In conclusion, even if a lot
remains to be done to fully validate their use and relevance, heart rate variability
as well as alphaamylase and immunoglobulin-A levels could be interesting
physiological parameters for assessing positive emotional states in animals, at least
as complements to classical adrenocortical and/or inflammatory measures.<component

of positive emotions, in combination with pressure from society that animals should
have a " " good life and not just a not-so-bad ""life, is leading to a greater
aspiration to apply some of the knowledge described in the first part of this review.
The most likely practical applications fall into four broad areas: i) promoting
positive experiences as a way to give animals a generally better quality of life; ii)
enhancing longterm positive emotional states; iii) highlighting the link between
positive emotional states and improving health, and iv) including criteria of
positive welfare in on-farm monitoring systems. 3.1. Enhancing quality of life by
promoting positive experiences Here we outline new approaches that might be useful in
animal husbandry for inducing positive emotions in animals throughout their lives.
Three approaches can be defined-signaling or predicting a reward in advance, giving a
higher reward than expected, and enabling the animals to cope with or to control the
situation. 3.1.1. Positive anticipation Investigations of what animals find
positively reinforcing and of the animal's behavioral expression during anticipation
or expectation of the rewarding result provide a basis for assessing positive
emotional states in animals [33]. The period between the signal and the arrival of
the reward is the period in which behavioral activity related to dopaminergic
activity can be seen (Section 2.3), i.e. anticipatory behavior. Anticipatory
behaviors are considered to represent biologically significant preparatory behaviors
[151]. When anticipating food rewards, rats [58], mink [152] and pigs [153] show
increased locomotor activity and frequent behavioral transitions, i.e. anticipatory
hyperactivity. More specifically, the behavioral categories reported in rats during
anticipation of sucrose rewards include locomotion, grooming, alertness, arousal,
scanning, attention, exploration and running [58]. In pigs, signaled positive stimuli
such as extra space, food, or straw lead to increased activity due to orientation
toward the place where the reward is offered and frequent behavioral transitions,
most often combined with play markers, i.e. hopping, scampering, pivoting, pawing,
flopping, and head tosssing [153]. During anticipation of feed rewards, farmed mink
showed a general increase in locomotor activity, and they spent more time moving
in/out of the nest box, less time in the "" nest box, more time nose-poking around
the feeding area, and more time standing and scratching at the cage door [152,154].
Farmed silver foxes anticipating a food reward or playing incentive were more active,
had more erect ears and higher body carriage, and spent more time in front of the
cage compared to animals that were anticipating aversive stimuli [155]. The
predictability of the rewarding stimulus plays a role in behavioral expression during
anticipation. Silver foxes anticipating a positive predictable reward (food or play)
had more upright ears, whereas for a positive unpredictable reward the ears were more
backwards rotated and flat [155]. Sensitivity to dopamine is adapted to the impact of
reward and the needs of the animal in the manner that is related to previous
experience. Thus, the threshold of the animal to react to a stimulus reflects the
sensitivity of the system. In addition, the amount of activity is related to the
needs of animals. For instance, if housed in a poor cage environment, rats were more
sensitive to signaled positive rewards compared to rats housed in an enriched
environment [58]. However, there is a risk of misinterpretation here as the absence
of a reaction to a reward may indicate that the animal is in a state either of full
satisfaction or of anhedonism, and these are opposite states in terms of welfare. In
addition, the intensity of reaction to a small reward has to be calibrated for each
species and situation. In silver foxes, anticipatory behavior consisted of high
levels of locomotor stereotypical behaviors such as running back and forth in the
cage environment [155]. Whether stereotypies during positive anticipation are an
expression of enhanced expectation shaped by the environment into repeated movements
or a stereotyped behavior due to previous and/or current frustration [156] remains to
be seen. demonstrating a successive negative contrast (SNC) [reviewed by [157]]. SPC
and SNC can be found for both appetitive and consummatory responses. It is the
difference between the expected value and the actual value that influences a
subject's behavior rather than the exact level of reinforcement. If the animal has a
previous experience of a higher value reinforcer, the reaction to a given level of
reinforcement is much less pronounced. Any contrast effect is often temporary and
disappears over time [e.g. [158]]. The fact that the appearance of an unexpected
reward makes such a difference to the behavior of the animal has led several authors
to suggest that positive contrast corresponds to the emotion elation in humans, while
negative contrast might be related to frustration or disappointment [e.g. [159,160]].
Overall there are more studies showing a negative than a positive contrast. Negative
contrast seems to be a more robust phenomenon and is easier to detect. This is also
possibly due to a ceiling effect; for instance, an animal that is running at top
speed for a reinforcer is unable to increase its speed even if the reinforcement is
increased. Unfortunately this result has meant that the majority of theories of the
contrast effect have focused on explaining the negative contrast effect exclusively.
Although some of the theories involve emotions e.g. elation or disappointment as ' '
described above, most are alternative non-emotional theories such as generalization
decrement [161], incentive averaging [162] or exploration [Elliott, 1928 cited by
[157]]. There are nevertheless a number of more specialized emotional theories that
do not rely on a general emotional drive, e.g. Amsel's frustration theory [163] or
Gray's disinhibition theory [29]. Positive contrast - has been found in few species
of mammals and birds [164 166]. For instance, in his original study, Crespi [159]
reported that rats for which the quantity of reward has just been increased run
faster towards the food reward than do rats having always received the large quantity
of reward. However, the changes in the behavioral responses are generally more
pronounced for the negative than for - the positive contrasts [164 166]. Due to the
relatively small number of studies, further research is needed to confirm the value
of a positive contrast model in the study of potential positive emotions and their
behavioral expressions. 3.1.3. Coping and controllability The possibility of
controlling the environment and coping successfully with challenges may be another
source of positive emotions. Despite some degree of stress being necessary in the
initial state of coping to activate alertness and metabolism [167], successful
actions with a positive outcome make the animal master of the environment. Successful
coping stops the initial stress reactions, independent of the positive or negative
value of the stressor, while uncontrollable and, hence, persistent negative stressful
stimuli lead to the well-known detrimental effects of - chronic stress [84,168 170].
A prerequisite of controllability is predictability, i.e. the environmental reactions
are (mostly) contingent on the subject's actions. If the environment where a species
lives is sufficiently constant during a long period of time, successful behavioral
coping strategies may well be acquired during the process of evolution and, then, are
innate at the individual level. If there is no innate coping behavior, an animal may
try to learn how to deal with a challenge. Success depends on a number of
prerequisites. First, the animal has to have the motor patterns necessary to be able
to deal with the challenge with at least some success; eventually these patterns can
even be shaped to deal with it better. Second, there must be a kind of random action
selector to try out what could be helpful when dealing with the challenge. Third, in
the central nervous system there must be the ability to link the sensory and
perceptual cues that are coincident with successful behaviors and the challenging
context. Fourth, there must be contiguity between the challenge and the behavioral
action [171]. If any of these conditions remain unfulfilled the animal will be unable
to learn how to cope, a failure that will eventually lead to chronic stress. Hence,
inactivity displayed by an animal may be caused by two emotional states: total
equilibrium, when everything is at or close to optimum, or learned helplessness, if
the subject has the experience that there is no possibility to escape the negative
environment [172]. The result is an inactive, depression-like chronic stress state
that is often accompanied, inter alia, by permanently increased levels of the stress
hormone cortisol. Social and physical challenges can be perceived as positive
experiences when exists an adequate coping behavior. Hence, frequent challenges that
can always be successfully mastered and eventually enable the animal to reach a
desired and rewarding goal may be suitable means to regularly evoke positive
emotions. Using an approach of this type, a program of research on the effects of
rewarded cognitive processes has been developed [173]. In the studies conducted thus
far, each animal out of a group of pigs had to learn an individual acoustic signal as
a call to work for food by pressing a button. The demands of this situation were
threefold: The animals had to be attentive for their individual acoustic summons,
they had to localize its source, and they had to respond to a button with their nose
disc in order to be rewarded with a small portion of food. It was shown that the pigs
were willing and quite able to cope with these demands. Using this approach it will
be possible to analyze the physiological and behavioral effects of a complex but
predictable environment presenting positive challenges with which individuals are
able to cope.<component x="311.52" y="267.15" width="251.02" height="128.63" page="9"

The emotional sensitivity or temperament of an animal has an important influence on
its welfare, and so predisposition to some positive emotional states is a good
premise for investigating long-term positive emotional states in animals. The terms
and concepts used for defining long-term emotional states " differ in the degree of
structure they provide, from individual " differences to the concept of personality.
The distinction according to the species and the age of the individual between
temperament (for animals and human infants) and personality (for children and adult
humans) has not been maintained consistently in the literature [174]. Temperament can
be defined as the characteristics of individuals that describe and account for
consistent patterns of feeling and behaving [175]. Whereas dimensions of personality
have generally been discussed in terms of either coping style or fearfulness, there
is currently no method for assessing a propensity to feel and express positive
emotions. However, by identifying long-term positive emotional states we can examine
whether characteristic behavioral patterns could be linked to particular
neuroendocrine states and if they correlate within individuals and over time. From
such studies we might be able to predict responses of an animal in one situation
based upon its responses in another. " There is no universally accepted definition of
individual " " " variation or individual differences . Erhard and Schouten [176]
structured individual variation in animal behavior using the Eysenck [177]
description of personality. This approach orga- nizes the different aspects of
personality into three levels " " " " " " state , trait , and type . The term state
or mood is used for the behavior that an individual performs at a specific moment in
time and in a specific situation. If an individual is repeatedly found to be in
similar states in similar situations, we can make assumptions about the underlying
personality trait (e.g. fearfulness or happiness). Regarding the third level, when
several trait dimensions are linked in such a way that an individual's position on
one dimension predicts its position in another, the individual can be categorized by
their position in a type dimension. This approach brings the study of individual
differences in non-humans closer to what is done in humans [39,176,178]. Different
studies have been carried out to evaluate emotional states in farm animals. For
instance, from a combination of the responses to fear and learning tests, three
emotional states were established in dairy sheep: non emotive ewes (calm, fear
sustainable, reacting adequately in learning tests), emotive ewes (nervous, fear
susceptible, reacting inadequately in learning tests) and intermediate ewes [179]. It
was further established that the emotional state influenced various adaptive
behaviors. The non-emotive ewes revealed a stable maternal care, whereas the anxiety
increased in the emotive ewes on the second and third days postpartum [180].
Furthermore, by contrast to the emotive sheep, non-emotive animals usually
successfully collect different rewards (appetitive and consummatory behaviors)
ensuring successful reproduction and higher production [181]. " " Personality may
have different dimensions . This idea was supported by Kilgour and collaborators
[182] showing different components of personality in cattle and sheep adapted from
human studies: general agitation and avoidance. The hypothesis that calm animals
produce better quality milk than nervous animals was supported by the result for
protein concentration [183]. Merino ewes of calm temperament can provide better
quality milk, indicating that temperament should be considered when selecting dairy
animals. Martin and collaborators [184] propose a strategy aiming to maximize
offspring survival by a combination of management, nutrition and genetic selection
for temperament. From a divergent selection on behavioral reactivity, calm ewes are
found to be better mothers than nervous ewes [185]: they spend more time with their
lambs, have a short flight distance when disturbed and return to their lambs faster
than nervous ewes. In addition to postnatal lamb survival, temperament may influence
other aspects of the reproductive process, all of which might be improved by genetic
selection for calm temperament. These include the length of the estrous cycle [186],
ovulation rate [187], the proportion of ewes mated, and sexual behavior [188].
Finally, temperament seems to affect - other aspects of production such as growth
rate [189 191] immune function [191], milk yield [192] and meat quality [193, 194].
All of these outcomes could be used to improve productivity while giving the industry
an ethical quality [reviewed by [184]]. 3.2.2. Genetic background Large differences
in emotional responses have been reported between breeds in various farm species
[195]. In dairy cattle, sire had a significant effect on the reactivity of cows in
the milking parlor [196]. Similarly, sheep sired by Romney sires were more reactive
when placed in a fearful situation than ewes sired by Suffolk or Columbia rams [197].
Genetic analysis revealed that such emotional responses were due to direct genetic
differences and less to direct maternal influence or to heterosis. The estimates of
heritability of fear in domestic animals seem to be sufficiently high to allow
further selection on fearfulness in attempts to improve herbivore management
[reviewed by [198]]. In addition, the development of marker-assisted selection can be
useful for psychological states such as fearfulness. Identifying quantitative trait
loci for fear has recently been extended to cattle [199] So far, QTL for reactivity
to humans have been identified using linked markers in cattle [200,201]. Such linked
markers may be used for marker-assisted selection within sire families once the
relationship between the marker and the gene has been determined. The interactions
between the genotype of animals and their environment must be seen as a critical
determinant of animal welfare that could reconcile production with ethical concerns
[198]. 3.2.3. Ontogenetic influences Abundant data demonstrate that stimulation
occurring during early life may markedly modulate the development of subsequent
emotion processing in a positive direction. It has been demonstrated that some
postnatal stimulation have opposite effects to those induced by prenatal stress. For
example, adult rats that have received substantial positive stimulation during
infancy, such as environmental enrichment or regular handling, are less emotionally
reactive to various challenging situations - [202 204]. Handling animals during
infancy also leads to improved endocrine reactivity in adulthood. For instance, early
handling alters neuroanatomical development in rats by increasing the number of
hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors or by decreasing CRF mRNA implicated in
endocrine regulations occurring under stress [205,206]. Extensive research on the
influences of early regular handling has been conducted in domestic animals. For
instance, early handled ungulates are generally less fearful of humans than their
non-handled counterparts, a pattern shown in goats [207], horses [208], cattle [209],
sheep [210] and pigs [211]. Experiences that occur during adulthood may also
influence emotional responsiveness, particularly through classical processes of
learning and habituation. The exposure of adult animals to enriched environments or
handling procedures has been shown to decrease subsequent fear, although the reported
effects are generally less marked than those induced by the same treatments occurring
during infancy [212]. Taken together these findings indicate that early stimulation
and later experiences interact with genetic background throughof whether positive
events can be used to offset negative ones over the course of a lifetime can be
raised. Although theoretically justifiable using a preference utilitarian
philosophical approach, we propose that this summing up of earlier positive
experiences is not applicable to animals living mainly in the present as do most farm
animals. Neither should we justify poor long-term housing and management because we
sometimes give animals short-term positive experiences. If we want to maximize
welfare, then the aim must be to give the animals as good quality of life as possible
all the time. Since it has been shown that anticipatory behavior followed by the
consummatory act has beneficial effects compared to the provision of the mere reward
alone, there is the possibility to manage animals in a way which stimulates the
activation of these systems, while at the same time giving as good housing and
management as we can. The caveat is of course that a certain degree of sensitization
is necessary for induction of pleasure but not to the extent that the period of need
for reward outweighs the satisfaction. This balance should be explored further.
Promoting play in young animals and stroking animals (or alternatively promoting
social licking) are also probably feasible methods to promote positive emotions in
practice and so enhance overall quality of life in systems that are usually regarded
as acceptable from an animal welfare point of view. Finally, in "" relation to the
active behavioral expressions of positive emotions (Section 3.4), like play,
allogrooming and exploration, another class of behavioral expressions of positive
emotions should be mentioned here, namely those expressing full comfort and
satiation, i.e. the fulfillment of biological needs.<component x="42.52" y="40.04"

anhedonia [228]. More specifically, signaled rewards counteracted the impairment of
anticipatory behavior in socially stressed rats, further supporting the view that
eliciting positive affective states has beneficial health effects. However, even in
this example the effect is in reducing otherwise negative health effects rather than
inducing positive health effects per se. In any event, understanding these mechanisms
will improve our ability to understand the benefits of positive emotions and also
suggest new clinical treatments based on these behavioral mechanisms. 3.4. Using
positive emotions for assessment and monitoring 1301 of animal welfare 3.4.1.
Assessing and enhancing behavioral expressions of positive emotions 3.4.1.1. Play
behavior. Play behavior includes elements of " " well-defined functional behavior
such as fleeing, fighting, sexual, or predatory behavior as well as specific play
behaviors. " " However, in play the functional elements are exaggerated, repeated,
more variable, and without the corresponding - consummatory act [229 232]. The
function of play behavior has been, and still is, the main focus in the scientific
study of this behavior. In early studies the function of play behavior was thought to
be exclusively long-term benefits. However, studies testing functional hypotheses of
play behavior found little evidence of long-term effects. Thus, current theories
focus more on short-term benefits to the juvenile and less on long-term benefits,
although the two may not be mutually exclusive [232]. Proposed functions of play
behavior are training of the skeletal muscles [229] (later refined to include
permanent modifications in brain and skeletal muscles [233]), self-assessment of
physical and social abilities [234], and training of flexible kinematics and
emotional responses to the unexpected events, a hypothesis that predicts both
immediate and long-term effects of play behavior [235]. The fact that play behavior
may be suppressed in harsh and unfavorable environmental conditions together with the
problems of early studies to prove any long-term function of play behavior suggested
that play behavior was merely a sign of surplus energy without any motivation of its
own. However, there are now several sources of evidence to suggest that play is a
rewarding activity [232]. First, animals actively seek out play partners and solicit
play behavior [229]. Second, the opportunity to play may be used as a reward in place
preference conditioning experiments [236]. Finally, thwarting of play will lead to a
rebound when more favorable conditions occur [237]. Conditions intuitively associated
with bad welfare, e.g. insufficient food supply, suppress play behavior in deer [238]
and domestic pigs [239]. Castration eliminates play behavior in lambs [240] and
domestic pigs in a semi-natural environment did not play during periods of cold
weather [241]. Thus, the presence of the motivation to play may indicate a state of
good welfare, i.e. that the primary needs of the animals are met. In calves the two
most common types of play are social play and locomotor play. Locomotor play emerges
first and is seen as early as a few hours after birth, and the presence of the mother
has been found to stimulate this type of play behavior [242]. Under natural
conditions locomotor play behavior occurs within the first weeks of life [243,244].
Increasing the space allowance for group-housed calves has been found to increase the
occurrence of play behavior [245]. Furthermore, calves kept with little space showed
a large rebound of locomotor play indicating that these calves had built up a larger
motivation during the period of confinement [245,246]. In piglets play behavior
includes both locomotor and social play behavior, although it may be difficult to
distinguish between play fighting and genuine fights [197]. In piglets more locomotor
play behavior was seen in larger farrowing crates compared to smaller ones [247]. In
addition, different types of farrowing crates placed in pens of equal space affected
play behavior [248]. Locomotor play behavior is reduced by mixing of piglets [249]
and by social isolation [250,251]. In mink the additional provision of a water bath
to mink kits stimulated more play behavior, both solitary locomotor play and social
play (e.g. chasing and rough-and-tumble play) [87]. Likewise, the provision of a
wooden block in the home cage of mink stimulated accelerated running, interrupted by
sham attacks of the object [214]. As outlined above play behavior is a good candidate
for an indicator of positive emotions and good welfare. However, caution must be
taken when developing play behavior as a positive welfare indicator since social play
can end in a fight, as in piglets [248]. This problem may be specific for the
juvenile pig, where dominance plays a role from birth, whereas in cattle the tendency
for social play to develop into real fights does not increase until the animals reach
puberty [252]. However, for all species some elements of play behavior may be better
indicators than others, and one way of developing the area further " " could be to
identify and validate so-called play markers as signs of true play in the different
animal species [241]. Such play markers may be play signals, which communicate a
playful mood to potential play partners. Play signals have the advantage that they
are often conspicuous and easy to distinguish. Present evidence on play behavior
applies only to juveniles of mammalian farm animal species. In these species it will
be important to develop and validate measures of play as welfare indicators, both in
animals reared for meat or for replacement (weaned piglets, growing pigs, calves,
lambs, and goats), and in foals. 3.4.1.2. Affiliative behavior. Affiliative behavior
is characterized by maintaining proximity, providing food, protection or allogrooming
between specific individuals. In farm animals, affiliative behavior has been much
less well studied than social competition and it has only rarely been investigated
with regard " " to affective states. However, terms such as affiliative , " " ""
sociopositive or preferential relationships already suggest a beneficial effect for
the animals involved. In general, positive effects of affiliative behavior can be
attributed to improved group cohesion, building or strengthening of bonds between
group mates and reduced aggression [253]. Preferential relationships between group
members have been described for cattle [254], horses [255], poultry [256] and pigs
[257]. Such relationships occur between genetically related [254,258] as well as
unrelated animals [259,260]; the latter has recently been shown for horses, donkeys,
cattle and sheep [261]. Familiarity appears to be one of the main factors in
establishing - cohesion [262 264]. Stress responsiveness is lower in familiar -
animals [265 267] whereas mixing of unfamiliar animals is accompanied by an increase
in agonistic interactions in pigs [268], cattle [269], poultry [270] and horses
[271]. Affiliative behavior may therefore play a major role in achieving a positive
mood in animals. It should however be noted that external threats might increase the
proximity between animals. Therefore, interanimal distance cannot be taken as a
direct measure of positive emotion level without knowing more about the threats
perceived by the animals. Allogrooming plays a key role with regard to so-called
sociopositive interactions. It is common among non-human primates [33]. In farm
animals, allogrooming is seen in cattle, horses, pigs and, rather rarely, in sheep.
Allogrooming seems to serve both hygienic (body care) and social functions. With
regard to the latter, allogrooming is thought to play a major role in reinforcing
social bonds and in reducing tension in groups of animals [100,272]. Such an
arousal-reduction effect suggests that allogrooming may provide long-term benefits.
However, there is also evidence that allogrooming is rewarding in the short term.
Soothing effects in terms of a reduction in heart rate have been demonstrated in
primates [273,274] and cattle [272]. Grooming stimulation produced similar effects in
horses [275,276]. In pigs, heart rate variability was used to assess the effect of
grooming simulation [277]. A short-term increase in vagal tone appeared to be
contradictory to the behavioral reactions of pigs suggesting relaxation, a finding
that was " " interpreted as positive strain ; regular grooming, however, increased
parasympathetic activity. Increased -endorphin &#x3B2; levels have also been found in
primates with intensive grooming relationships [278]. Based on the above-mentioned
findings, affiliative behaviors appear to be promising indicators of long-term
positive affective states in farm animals. Allogrooming should be further
investigated as a key indicator in cattle, horses and pigs. In cattle, social licking
is mainly carried out at the head, neck or shoulder of the animals [252]. It is
performed spontaneously, after solicitation, or following agonistic interactions.
Social licking may also be terminated by agonistic behavior mostly performed by the
licked animal. Solicitation of social licking [279] underlines the rewarding function
of such behavior, at least for the receiver. Whereas the overall benefits for the
receiver are obvious, it is less clear to what extent the actor is positively
influenced. While in horses mostly reciprocal grooming (mainly consisting of biting
and nibbling the group mate's neck) between bonded pairs is observed [280], in cattle
Sato [281] found that all animals were groomed but that only 75% performed grooming.
Reports on the importance of the social position of the groomer are contradictory
[252,282,283]. However, subordinate animals might experience performance of the
behavior as stressful if licking has been initiated by dominant animals, although
they may benefit from a less tense social environment in the long term. The use of
allogrooming as an indicator in welfare assessment protocols may be limited since,
for example, in horses social grooming is influenced by season [260], social
structure [264] and reproductive state [284] and therefore needs further
investigation with regard to reliability issues. In wild boars, regular nose-to-body
contacts [285] suggest that allogrooming forms part of the pig's normal behavior.
Meynhardt [285] also states that the receiver shows relaxation-related behaviors, a
finding that has been confirmed by a grooming simulation study [277]. However, high
levels of allogrooming activity may not necessarily reflect positive states of the
animal. Pigs in barren environments showed more allogrooming than did those in
enriched housing systems that allowed for rooting and exploration [286,287]. On the
one hand, increased allogrooming may disturb the receiver. On the other hand,
redirected abnormal behaviors may develop such as tailor ear-biting [255]. Therefore,
the level of allogrooming indicative of positive affective states in pigs must be
determined before it can be used as a welfare indicator. With regard to animal
species showing little allogrooming activity, such as sheep and goats [288], or
species in which other affiliative behaviors have to be taken into account (poultry),
potential alternative indicators of positive affective states would have to be
identified and validated. With these caveats affiliative behaviors and especially
allogrooming is a promising candidate for a type of behavior indicative of positive
emotions. 3.4.1.3. Self-grooming. Self-grooming is the maintenance of one's own body
surface. In mammals this maintenance is achieved through licking, scratching, and
rubbing of the fur, as well as through wallowing and bathing. In birds it is through
preening and bathing in water or sand. These various forms of self-grooming maintain
the body surface by removal of dirt and ectoparasites as well as by thermoregulation.
However, self-grooming may also occur as a displacement activity with an
arousal-reduction or relaxation effect [100]. In birds, self-grooming increases in
response to a thwarting or a conflict situation [289]. Likewise in mammals,
self-grooming is - elicited in reaction to a novel or stressful situation [290 292].
Self-grooming is also reported to be higher in animals kept in barren environments.
For example, self-grooming occurred less among rabbits kept in cages with a shelter
as compared to rabbits kept in barren cages [293]. Self-grooming in animals kept in
barren or restrictive environments may be reduced either by the provision of hay,
e.g. in rabbits [294], or by increasing the space allowance, e.g. in dogs [295] or in
dairy calves [296,297]. Likewise, the occurrence of self-grooming is de- creased
under group-housed farming, e.g. in calves [298 300] and horses [275]. When kept in
groups the animals engage in allogrooming, and the higher level of self-grooming in
individually housed animals may be due to the lack of allogrooming that may have an
arousal-reducing effect (Section "" 3.4.1 affiliative behaviors ). Thus, as outlined
above, the relation between the performance of self-grooming and positive emotions is
much less clear-cut than it is for allogrooming. The performance of self-grooming may
occur as a displacement activity in stressful situations and barren environments.
However, self-grooming may also be performed to substitute for social grooming; it is
possible that the performance of selfgrooming reduces arousal as has been suggested
for social grooming. If these effects of self-grooming can be demonstrated, it would
be a potential indicator for positive emotions. 3.4.1.4. Vocalizations. Specific
vocalizations could be considered to some extent as direct expressions of positive
immediate experiences in animals. While vocalizations have long been used as markers
of emotions in animals [301], they have usually concerned negative experiences (e.g.
distress, fear, aggression, defeat). However, focusing on data obtained in rats,
Panksepp and Burgdorf [226] have recently argued that some short chirping ultrasonic
vocalizations centered around 50-kHz could signal positive affects. This conclusion
is supported by " " the fact that such vocal signals are produced in positive
contexts, such as sex, winning fights, play, or manual tickling, and are inhibited by
negative situations [226]. Intriguingly, it is proposed that these vocalizations
could reflect a positive state in rats analogous to primitive laughter that
accompanies social play in human infants. Not only does such a proposal offer a
framework to further study evolutionary roots of positive emotions (and especially
laughter) in humans, but it could also be extended to other species (e.g. domestic
species). For example, some vocalizations of domestic cats, such as purring, are
well-known to be produced in situations of positive valence, - such as mother kitten
interactions, contacts with familiar partner, or during tactile stimulation with
inanimate objects as when rolling and rubbing [302]. Therefore, purring can be ""
generally considered as an indicator of pleasure in cats. Similar data could be
obtained in farm animals. Indeed, lowpitched bleating in sheep has been associated
with some positive-valence situations, as they are produced by males as an estrus
female is approaching or by lactating mothers while licking and nursing their lambs
[288]. Such an approach could be highly beneficial for animal welfare as farm
animals' vocalizations could offer easily measurable markers of positive emotions
since they are audible sounds for humans and can be monitored automatically [303].
Overall there are findings supporting the hypothesis that at least play behaviors,
affiliative behaviors, and some vocalizations can be perceived as indicators of
positive affective states in animals. 3.4.1.5. Information gathering. Information
gathering or exploration might be relevant for positive affective states for two
reasons. The first reason is that it is a behavior that most species of animals are
motivated to perform, i.e. they are fulfilling a behavioral need. The second reason
is that exploration is a behavior that is closely related to and affected by fear.
Information gathering is a behavior that seems to be self-reinforcing to some extent.
It doesn't satiate in the same way as many other behaviors do, and this property has
led some authors to suggest that it might actually be a behavior that is continually
on-going and is only interrupted when other, more immediate needs, are present [304].
There are two forms of exploration: the inquisitive exploration in which the animal
is looking for a change and the inspective exploration in which the animal responds
to a change [305]. If the information primacy interpretation is correct, then
exploration, especially inquisitive exploration, can be regarded as both an indicator
of no other immediate needs and a continuous pleasurable activity in itself (since
the animal keeps doing it). The maintenance of a behavior might not in itself warrant
calling it reinforcing, but combining its flexibility with its self-reinforcing
properties makes it hard to avoid that supposition. In inspective exploration, which
typically is investigation in response to a novel object, there is a gradual approach
to the novel object similar to that seen in other approach/avoidance situations
involving, for example, hunger instead of curiosity. In many of the motivational
models of exploration, the response to the novel object is a result of curiosity and
fear. The fear either interacts with curiosity, with exploration being the
behavioural outcome of that interaction [e.g. [306]], or alternatively fear and
exploration are seen as lying along the same axis [e.g. [305,307]]. This close
relationship between exploration and fear is further supported by the finding that
personality research on animals tends to find a negative correlation between the
reaction of the animal in situations that provoke fear and those that measure
exploration [e.g. [308]]. However, some caution is needed when interpreting these
results since in some cases only a few situations have been measured, and these may
make it inevitable that the two motivational systems are intimately linked. 3.4.2.
Developing an on-farm monitoring system to assess animal welfare Consumers are
increasingly concerned with the welfare of animals contributing to the products they
buy, and there have been several initiatives to develop products marketed according
to animal welfare standards. In the main, welfare assessment schemes have consisted
of checks that the resources available to the animal are sufficient and of good
quality. Nevertheless, there is a consensus among researchers that while this
approach is a good way to minimize the risk of poor welfare, the actual assessment of
animal welfare must depend on animal-based measures [309]. Unfortunately, as already
stated earlier in this section, there are as yet no feasible animal-based measures
indicative of good welfare. Instead there are measures of poor welfare, such as
injury, body condition, fear etc., and it does not necessary follow that in the
absence of these indicators an animal's welfare is good. It merely means that we have
no avoidance that welfare is poor. " " Qualitative assessment methods have been
proposed as a way to characterize global expressive affects in animals using a free
choice profiling approach [44,310]. Among the terms chosen by the observers are those
usually associated with pos"" "" " " " " itive states, e.g. relaxed , friendly ,
affectionate , playful , " " and social . There is difficulty though in validating
these potential welfare indicators since new measures are usually validated against
existing measures. On the other hand, we know that play is a likely candidate for
being associated with a positive affective state and, furthermore, play behavior is
probably the indicator of positive emotions that is most easily " " " readable by
non-professional observers (Section 3.4.1 play " behavior ). Another approach to find
animal-based indicators of positive affects is to watch for the occurrence of
affiliative behaviors that an animal will only perform when it is feeling " safe,
such as allogrooming (Section 3.4.1 affiliative behav" ior ). Such an approach may be
related to the identification of " " " " the terms relaxed or affectionate used by
the observers in the Wemelsfelder and collaborators [44] study. Finally, further
studies on vocalizations in farm animals could lead to the identification of reliable
vocal markers of positive states in these " " domestic species (Section 3.4.1
vocalizations ). These markers would represent easy and convenient tools to assess
positive experiences in farm animals. Although only valid measures should be included
in monitoring systems, it may be that these are the most valid measures currently
available to us if we want to include animal-based measures of positive affective
states under commercial conditions.<component x="311.53" y="601.93" width="251.12"

growing interest in positive emotions in neuroscience and psychology has led to the
development of new areas of investigation, both theoretical and experimental.
Successful expression of positive emotions typically requires a temporal sequence: a
rewarding environment, eliciting a cognitive appraisal in the central nervous system
and followed by physiological and behavioral reactions. Repeated or steady positive
emotional experiences commonly lead to, and are " " often referred to, as a global
state of happiness . The concept of happiness has always been considered one of the
greatest philosophical quandaries and this has often detracted from scientific
investigations. However, such a concept would be very valuable for the study of
animal welfare since it could represent the affective background reflecting maximum
wellbeing. Whereas pleasure is generally assessed in the context of sensory
stimulation, such as the hedonic impact of taste, happiness refers to a longer and
less intense internal state of " feeling, which we argue is closer to the concept of
well" " " being or quality of life . Although the concept of happi ness has been
studied very little, there are some theoretical attempts in the evolutionary approach
that integrates this concept [311]. Some recent work suggests that happiness could be
defined as consisting of both positive emotions and positive activities [4,312].
Animal studies have accumulated a large amount of valuable data regarding sensory
pleasure or evaluating the rewarding properties of many agents, but there is a lack
of data concerning more persistent affective states in animals. Hence, we must rely
on theoretical and human studies to provide stimulating clues to the question of
happiness in animals and the developing study of positive emotions must be considered
as a first step in addressing the question of stable and less expressive affective
states (i.e. mood) in animals. Is there such a state as happiness in animals? If so,
how can it be reliably assessed? Under what conditions is it maintained? What are its
relationships with cognitive abilities? Supported by the recent interest of
neuroscience and psychology, further research into the field of positive emotions and
more persistent positive affective states in animals represents a new avenue for
increasing our understanding of animal welfare processes. Such development could
provide new insights in establishing the bases of real positive well-being in
animals. Research in positive affective states in animals is clearly an ambitious
task, but there are promising returns. Promoting positive experiences can be a way to
improve health in animals and more generally to give them a better quality of life.
Likewise, including criteria of positive affective states in farm or laboratory
monitoring schemes can improve welfare assessment beyond the traditional focus on
mere absence of disease and distress.<component x="301.72" y="40.04" width="251.13"
