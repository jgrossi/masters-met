May 2010 Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus pseudinterRecently,
methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant medius (MRSP) have been
increasingly isolated from veterinarians and companion animals. With a view to
preventing the spread of MRSA and MRSP, we evaluated the occurrence and molecular
characteristics of each in a veterinary college. MRSA and MRSP were isolated from
nasal samples from veterinarians, staff members, and veterinary students affiliated
with a veterinary hospital. Using stepwise logistic regression, we identified two
factors associated with MRSA carriage: (i) contact with an identified animal MRSA
case (odds ratio [OR], 6.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.2 to 21.6) and (ii)
being an employee (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.0 to 19.4). The majority spa of MRSA isolates
obtained from individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital and dog patients
harbored mec mec type t002 and a type II staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC ),
similar to the hospital-acquired MRSA spa mec isolates in Japan. MRSA isolates
harboring type t008 and a type IV SCC were obtained from one veterinarian on three
different sampling occasions and also from dog patients. MRSA carriers can also be a
source of mec MRSA infection in animals. The majority of MRSP isolates (85.2%)
carried hybrid SCC type II-III, and almost mec all the remaining MRSP isolates
(11.1%) carried SCC type V. MRSA and MRSP were also isolated from environmental
samples collected from the veterinary hospital (5.1% and 6.4%, respectively). The
application of certain disinfection procedures is important for the prevention of
nosocomial infection, and MRSA and MRSP Staphylococcus aureus Methicillin-resistant
(MRSA) is an important cause of nosocomial infections in human hospitals. The
prevalence of hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) infection among inpatients in
intensive care units (ICUs) continues to increase steadily in Japan. Recently, cases
of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) have been documented in persons without an
established risk factor for HA-MRSA infection (14, 32, 36, 49). There has also been
an increase in the number of reports of the isolation of MRSA from veterinarians and
companion animals (5, 21, 23-26, 28, 31, 34, 38, 44, 50, 51, 53). Values reported for
the prevalence of MRSA among veterinary staff include 17.9% in the United Kingdom
(21), 10% in Japan (38), 3.9% in Scotland (13), and 3.0% in Denmark (28). Loeffler et
al. reported that the prevalence of MRSA among dog patients and healthy dogs owned by
veterinary staff members was 8.9% (21). In Japan, an MRSA isolate was detected in
only one inpatient dog (3.8%) and could not be detected in any of 31 outpatient dogs
(38). In the United States, MRSA isolates were detected in both dog (0.1%) and cat
(0.1%) patients (31). The prevalence of MRSA among * Corresponding author. Mailing

Methicillin-resistant staphylococci produce penicillin-binding protein 2 , which
reduces their affinity for -lactam antibi( &#x2424; mecA otics. This protein is
encoded by the gene (48), which mec on June 12, 2015 by INSTITUTO FEDERAL DO

a mobile genetic element characterized mec by the combination of the and complexes
(16), and itccr is classified into subtypes according to differences in the junkmec
yard regions (43). SCC typing can be used as a molecular tool (22, 27, 30, 33, 36,

Ethics Committee of the Graduate School of Dairy Science, Rakuno Gakuen University
(RGU). Volunteers were recruited to provide the nasal swabs for the isolation of
MRCPS from staff affiliated with the Department of Veterinary Companion Animals
(DVCA) of the veterinary hospital and with three nonclinical laboratories in the
School of Veterinary Medicine, RGU. Nasal swab samples were collected using BBL
culture swab EZ (Becton Dickinson Japan, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in March and April
2007 from 20 of the 46 veterinarians (43.5%) affiliated with the DVCA, all 21 staff
members (including veterinary technicians) affiliated with the DVCA, and 51 of 60
veterinary students (85%) affiliated with the DVCA. In addition, 5 staff members and
31 veterinary students of the 42 personnel (85.7%) affiliated with nonclinical
laboratories also provided nasal samples. Ten nasal samples from the 31 veterinary
students affiliated with nonclinical laboratories were collected in October 2007. On
a single day, we also collected 75 environmental surface samples (e.g., from floors,
top parts of medical examination stands, and cages) from 30 areas in the veterinary
hospital, including the following areas: waiting area; consulting, procedure, and
operation rooms; dispensary; animal wards; administrative office; and a
veterinarian's office. Sampling areas were selected from areas frequented by
individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital and by animal patients. These
samples were collected using single-use cotton swabs moistened with sterile
physiological saline. In cases where presumptive MRCPS isolates were obtained from
individuals who had companion animals at home, samples of buccal mucosa from the
companion animals were also tested. In the second sampling period from February to
April 2008, the nasal samples were collected from 31 of 50 clinical veterinarians
(62%), all 18 staff members, and 65 of 89 veterinary students (73%) affiliated with
the DCVA of the veterinary hospital. In addition, three veterinarians, one staff
member, and nine veterinary students affiliated with the Department of Large Animal
Clinical Sciences provided nasal samples. Additionally, a total of 81 environmental
surface samples were collected from areas similar to those described above. Eight
presumed MRSA strains from dog patients were also collected for use in this study for
comparison with MRSA isolates from veterinarians, and veterinary students. These
strains were isolated from the affected parts of dog patients during the period from
2007 to 2008. These strains were identified genetically mec and characterized by SCC
and molecular typing in this study. Fact-finding inquiry. In order to establish the
factors associated with MRCPS carriage in humans, information on the following was
gathered from subjects: hospitalization and surgery received within the previous
year, antibiotics taken within the previous month, known contact with MRSA-identified
animal patients, career, affiliations, and the presence of companion animals at home.
During the 2008 investigation, we questioned volunteers about their participation in
the previous investigation in 2007 and their MRSA-positive or -negative status as
determined by the previous test. Human samples and questionnaire answers were coded
to protect anonymity. Isolation of MRCPS. Swabs were directly inoculated onto
CHROMagar MRSA medium (Kanto Kagaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and incubated at
35&#xB0;C for 24 h. For enrichment, the same swabs were inoculated into 5-ml portions
of heart infusion broth (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) containing
7.5% sodium chloride and incubated at 35&#xB0;C for 48 h. Enrichment cultures were
streaked out on CHROMagar MRSA medium and incubated as described above.
Representative colonies colored light purple (presumptive MRSA), blue, or white were
selected from each sample and subcultured on nutrient agar (Nissui Pharmaceutical

listed in Table 1. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We performed MIC
determinations for 14 antimicrobial agents (7). For the isolates obtained in 2007,
MIC tests were conducted using the agar dilution method with Mueller-Hinton agar
(Oxoid Ltd., Hampshire, United Kingdom). The following antimicrobial agents were
tested: oxacillin, ampicillin, cefazolin, kanamycin, gentamicin, erythromycin,
chloramphenicol, minocycline, oxytetracycline, vancomycin, and enrofloxacin (all from
Sigma-Aldrich Japan K. K., Tokyo, Japan); imipenem (Banyu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan); arbekacin (Meiji Seika Ltd., Tokyo, Japan); and teicoplanin (Astellas

agents, 12 of which were the same as those tested for the 2007 isolates. This time,
however, we used tetracycline and ciprofloxacin instead of oxytetracycline and
enrofloxacin. Molecular typing. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis for
MRSA isolates was performed as previously described (2, 15). Briefly, bacterial
cultures were grown overnight in Mueller-Hinton broth (Oxoid Ltd.) and resuspended in
TN buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 M NaCl, pH 8.0). The cultures were mixed with the same
volume of 2% UltraPure low-melting-point (LMP) agarose (Invitrogen Japan Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan), dissolved in TN buffer, and pipetted into a plug mold. After bacterial lysis
in a lysis buffer containing 5 mg/ml lysozyme (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.,
Osaka, Japan) and 20 g/ml lysostaphin (Sigma&#x242E; Aldrich Japan K. K.), genomic
DNA was digested with SmaI (Takara Bio, Ltd.). PFGE was performed using a CHEF-DRIII
system (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.), under the following conditions: switch time of
5.3 to 34.9 s and running time of 20 h for MRSA (15); included angle, 120&#xB0;;
voltage, 6 V/cm; and set temperature, 14&#xB0;C. All MRSA isolates were typed by DNA
sequence analysis of the X region of spa spa the protein A gene ( ) as previously
described (42). The types of MRSA isolates were determined by using Ridom SpaServer
(http://www.spaserver.ridom .de/). Statistical analysis. Categorical comparisons were
performed using Fisher's P exact test. A value of less than 0.05 was considered to be
significant. The associations between MRSA and MRSP carriage and each inquiry shown
in Table 3 were evaluated with a stepwise forward logistic regression using SPSS
15.0J software (SPSS Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Variables with a significance level

Staphylococcus aureus The occurrence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
pseudinterme(MRSA), methicillin-resistant dius Staphylococcus schleif(MRSP), and
methicillin-resistant eri (MRSS) among each sample type are shown in Table 2. MRSA
isolates were obtained from 11 of 92 individuals (12.0%; 95% CI, 6.1% to 20.4%) and
10 of 127 individuals (7.9%; 95% CI, 3.8% to 14.0%) affiliated with the veterinary
hospital in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In addition, MRSA isolates were also
obtained from 2 of 10 MRSA carriers even after they underwent treatment. Analysis of
the environmental surface samples showed that MRSA had contaminated the floors of
rooms used for X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans and administration of anesthetics
and the cat ward, a cat cage in the cat ward room, and the top part of an anesthetics
stand in 2007. The following areas were identified as infected: the floors of rooms
in the cat ward, a preliminary meeting room for veterinary technicians, and an intern
veterinarian's office in 2008. The values for the incidence of MRSP carriage among
individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital were 3.3% (3/92) (95% CI, 0.7% to
9.2%) and 7.9% (10/127) (95% CI, 3.8% to 14.0%) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. MRSP
isolates were obtained from three buccal mucosa samples from five companion animals
owned by methicillin-resistant coagulase-positive staphylococci (MRCPS)-positive
individuals (60%). In 2007, MRSP was found to have contaminated the following areas:

contact with animal patients. Since contact with MRSA-infected animal patients is a
factor considered to be associated with MRSA carriage, it can be inferred that MRSA
carriers may originally have been infected by animal patients. However, a study
conducted on 31 outpatient dogs in Japan reported that MRSA isolates were not
detected in any of the dogs (38); similar previous studies have also reported that
the prevalence of MRSA among dogs and cats was low (5, 31). Manian reported a case in
which MRSA colonization was detected in a dog, which was believed to be the source of
recurrent MRSA infection in its owner, a diabetes patient, and his wife; the dog was
believed to have contracted the infection through contact with the owner (24).
Another previous study reported MRSA colonization in a dog whose owner was a nurse
caring for MRSA patients; it was concluded that the dog contracted the infection from
the nurse, who was found to be a carrier of MRSA infection (50). Thus, human MRSA
carriers can also be a source of MRSA infection in animals encountered in veterinary
medical pracmec tice. In the present study, the MRSA isolate with SCC type<component

spa IV and type t008 was obtained from a dog patient in March 2008 after one
veterinarian was identified to be a carrier of spa MRSA type t008 on three different
sampling occasions. The dog patient had undergone medical examinations in the
clinical department to which the veterinarian belonged. This clone might, therefore,
have spread from the veterinarian to the dog patient by direct contact or through the
medium of contaminated environments. In this study, the frequencies of MRSA infection
among veterinarians and staff members in the veterinary hospital was found to be
19.5% (8/41) and 15.1% (8/53) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. These frequencies are
comparable to the values reported in a previous study in the United Kingdom (17.9%)
(21) and that reported in a study of veterinary personnel attending a veterinary
surgery conference (17.3%) (6); however, these values were higher than those reported
in a Japanese veterinary teaching hospital (10%) (38), in Scotland (3.9%) (13), and
in Denmark (3.0%) (28). Moreover, the frequency of MRSA carriers has been reported to
be only 0.54% among dog owners (5). mec SCC type II was prevalent among the MRSA
isolates obtained from individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital mec and
from dog patients. Most of the MRSA isolates with SCC spa type II also harbored type
t002. A majority of the hospitalacquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) isolates identified in Japan
also mec harbor SCC type II and are derived from the New York/ Japan clone
(multilocus sequence type 5 [ST5]) (17, 22, 36, 54). The MRSA of the Japan clone is
generally known to have type t002 (http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/). MRSA isolates mec
with SCC type II have been isolated from patients without established risk factors
for HA-MRSA (36). Moreover, mec MRSA isolates with SCC type II have also been
isolated from healthy children (14); thus, infection of this MRSA clone has already

study, all mec spa but two MRSA isolates with SCC type II had type t002; spa the
remaining two isolates had type t062 and t1265. Unlike spa spa type t002, the type
t062 has a deletion in the middle spa three repeats (34-17-20) of t002, whereas the
type t1265 has a double repeat of r12 instead of r17. Moreover, the spa MRSA isolates

clone varies in veterinary medical practice or if some clones with a small genetic
diversity have been introduced into the veterinary hospital. The PFGE method can help
divide MRSA isolates into spa more groups than typing, as shown in a previous study
(44). spa Although types depend on the DNA sequence of only spa region X of the gene,
PFGE profiles depend on the numbers and positions of the restriction sites in the DNA
sequence of the entire genome. Therefore, PFGE enables better discrimination between
strains. On the other hand, spatyping enabled comparison of the MRSA isolates
obtained in this spa study with those reported in other studies. In some cases,

was more useful than either method alone in discriminating MRSA isolates. mec MRSA
isolates with SCC type I were obtained only in spa 2008, and these isolates also had
type t1767. Isolates with mec SCC type I are not commonly encountered in human
hospitals; however, they are sometimes isolated from Japanese hospital inpatients at
risk of HA-MRSA infection (36, 54). It mec has been reported that MRSA isolates
harboring SCC type I obtained from inpatients belong to ST 8 or ST 30 strains (36,
54). There is little data regarding multilocus sequence analysis spa of MRSA having
type t1767; however, the only MRSA with spa type t1767, which was isolated in Hong
Kong, belonged to ST8 (http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/). Although the 10 human MRSA
carriers were treated to eradicate colonization, two of these carriers were found to
be harboring MRSA isolates even after 1 month of treatment. Recurrent MRSA infection
in a patient and healthy MRSA carriers has been reported previously (24, 50). The
genotype of mec MRSA from a recurrent carrier changed from SCC type II kdp spa mec
without gene and type t1265 to SCC type II harkdp spa boring the gene and type t002.
Because the latter genotype was more common among the MRSA isolates obtained from
veterinary staff and environmental surfaces, this carrier might be infected from
other MRSA carriers or contaminated environmental surfaces. Treatment of MRSA
carriers should be undertaken simultaneously with the disinfection of the entire
hospital and implementation of hand hygiene practices, which has been reported as a
strong protective factor against MRSA colonization (1). MRSA was not detected in the
five buccal mucosa samples of dogs owned by MRCPS-positive individuals. We chose
buccal swab and not nasal swab, which is the traditional sample for MRSA isolation,
because sampling from dogs was done at home by each owner without enough
immobilization. Loeffler et al. reported that the isolation frequency of MRSA from
the buccal swabs of dogs was as high as that from the nasal swabs (21). However, in
another previous study, the nasal, axillary, and rectal swabs of dogs were tested for
isolation MRSA, and the MRSA isolate was obtained only from the rectum (11).
Combination sampling of the nasal, buccal, and rectal swabs obtained from dogs may
facilitate detection of MRSA carriage. In this investigation, we used the CHROMagar
MRSA medium for the isolation of MRCPS. This medium has been reported to be highly
effective in selecting for MRSA (10, 45). In a previous study describing the
prevalence of MRSP, samples were directly inoculated onto mannitol-salt agar
containing 2 mg/liter oxacillin and after the enrichment of staphylococci in broth
containing 7.5% sodium chloride (11). In other studies, MRSP isolates were selected
from staphylococcal strains by testing their susceptibility to oxacillin (38, 40).
The CHROMagar MRSA medium used in this study contained 6 mg/liter cefoxitin. Although
we did not determine the MICs of cefoxitin for the MRSP isolates obtained in this
study, we found that approximately half of the MRSP isolates were susceptible to
cefazolin. Sasaki et al. also reported that almost all MRSP isolates were susceptible

than MRSA might explain why the colony size of MRSP on the CHROMagar MRSA medium was
considerably smaller than<component x="52.16" y="65.35" width="240.09"

the other hand, even cefazolin-susceptible MRSP isolates could be obtained by using
the CHROMagar MRSA medium in this study. In the present study, the frequency of MRSP
isolated from individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital (5.9%) was similar
to that reported previously (38). Although it was reported that some MRSP isolates
from dog patients had low-level resistance to oxacillin (MIC, 2 to 4 g/ml) (38), all
MRSP isolates obtained in this study &#x242E; showed high-level resistance to
oxacillin (MIC, 16 g/ml). ( &#x242E; The CHROMagar MRSA medium might be unable to
detect MRSP that has low-level resistance to oxacillin. Descloux et al. described
canine MRSP isolates with a new mec S. aureus SCC type II-III, resulting from a
combination of mec Staphylococcus epidermidis mec SCC type III and SCC type mec II
(8). The structure of SCC in 23 MRSP isolates, as confirmed by M-PCR 4 and PCR 3,
matched the DNA sequence mec of SCC type II-III (GenBank accession no. AM904732); mec
therefore, the SCC type of these 23 MRSP isolates was presumed to be type II-III.
There are only a limited number of mec reports pertaining to the SCC type among MRSP
isolates mec (8, 30, 38); accordingly, more data regarding the SCC types among MRSP
isolates are needed in order to understand the reasons for the sudden emergence of
MRSP, although canine S. intermedius S. pseudinisolates, which were presumed to be
termedius in the previous studies (3, 39), have been reported as being susceptible to
-lactam antibiotics in the past (41, 46). &#x2424; Although contact with MRSA animal
patients has also been recognized as a factor associated with MRSP carriage, the
reason for this association is unknown. A previous study has S. intermesuggested the
transmission of multidrug-resistant dius species among dogs affected by deep pyoderma
and their owners (9). Therefore, animal patients could transmit MRSP infection to
humans. Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) isolates are generally susceptible to most
of the antimicrobial agents studied, except -lactam antibiotics (32, 36, 49). Almost
all MRSA and &#x2424; MRSP isolates investigated in this study were multidrug
resistant but susceptible to the antibiotics used for treating MRSA &#xC2;&#x192;

isolates were susceptible to imipenem and minocycline, although most of the MRSA
isolates were resistant to these antibiotics. On the other hand, MRSS was susceptible
to most antibiotics. Hisata et al. reported that MIC to oxacillin and imipenem
differed between mec SCC types or subtypes of MRSA (14). The degree of susmec
ceptibilities to cefazolin and imipenem differed in the SCC types and bacterial
species in this study. It is necessary to obtain information regarding the prevalence
of MRSA infection before implementing strategies for MRSA infection control in
veterinary medical practice. The molecular and epidemiological analyses undertaken in
the present study could provide some information regarding the transmission of MRSA
between humans and companion animals in a veterinary hospital. MRSA carriers can be a
source of MRSA infection in animals. MRSA animal patients may then, in turn, lead to
MRSA infection in other individuals. Moreover, MRSA contamination was detected in the
veterinary hospital environment. MRSA contamination in veterinary hospitals has been
reported in previous studies (13, 21). These observations suggest that there is a

methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant medius (MRSP) have been
increasingly isolated from veterinarians and companion animals. With a view to
preventing the spread of MRSA and MRSP, we evaluated the occurrence and molecular
characteristics of each in a veterinary college. MRSA and MRSP were isolated from
nasal samples from veterinarians, staff members, and veterinary students affiliated
with a veterinary hospital. Using stepwise logistic regression, we identified two
factors associated with MRSA carriage: (i) contact with an identified animal MRSA
case (odds ratio [OR], 6.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.2 to 21.6) and (ii)
being an employee (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.0 to 19.4). The majority spa of MRSA isolates
obtained from individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital and dog patients
harbored mec mec type t002 and a type II staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC ),
similar to the hospital-acquired MRSA spa mec isolates in Japan. MRSA isolates
harboring type t008 and a type IV SCC were obtained from one veterinarian on three
different sampling occasions and also from dog patients. MRSA carriers can also be a
source of mec MRSA infection in animals. The majority of MRSP isolates (85.2%)
carried hybrid SCC type II-III, and almost mec all the remaining MRSP isolates
(11.1%) carried SCC type V. MRSA and MRSP were also isolated from environmental
samples collected from the veterinary hospital (5.1% and 6.4%, respectively). The
application of certain disinfection procedures is important for the prevention of
nosocomial infection, and MRSA and MRSP Staphylococcus aureus Methicillin-resistant
(MRSA) is an important cause of nosocomial infections in human hospitals. The
prevalence of hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) infection among inpatients in
intensive care units (ICUs) continues to increase steadily in Japan. Recently, cases
of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) have been documented in persons without an
established risk factor for HA-MRSA infection (14, 32, 36, 49). There has also been
an increase in the number of reports of the isolation of MRSA from veterinarians and
companion animals (5, 21, 23-26, 28, 31, 34, 38, 44, 50, 51, 53). Values reported for
the prevalence of MRSA among veterinary staff include 17.9% in the United Kingdom
(21), 10% in Japan (38), 3.9% in Scotland (13), and 3.0% in Denmark (28). Loeffler et
al. reported that the prevalence of MRSA among dog patients and healthy dogs owned by
veterinary staff members was 8.9% (21). In Japan, an MRSA isolate was detected in
only one inpatient dog (3.8%) and could not be detected in any of 31 outpatient dogs
(38). In the United States, MRSA isolates were detected in both dog (0.1%) and cat
(0.1%) patients (31). The prevalence of MRSA among * Corresponding author. Mailing

Ethics Committee of the Graduate School of Dairy Science, Rakuno Gakuen University
(RGU). Volunteers were recruited to provide the nasal swabs for the isolation of
MRCPS from staff affiliated with the Department of Veterinary Companion Animals
(DVCA) of the veterinary hospital and with three nonclinical laboratories in the
School of Veterinary Medicine, RGU. Nasal swab samples were collected using BBL
culture swab EZ (Becton Dickinson Japan, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in March and April
2007 from 20 of the 46 veterinarians (43.5%) affiliated with the DVCA, all 21 staff
members (including veterinary technicians) affiliated with the DVCA, and 51 of 60
veterinary students (85%) affiliated with the DVCA. In addition, 5 staff members and
31 veterinary students of the 42 personnel (85.7%) affiliated with nonclinical
laboratories also provided nasal samples. Ten nasal samples from the 31 veterinary
students affiliated with nonclinical laboratories were collected in October 2007. On
a single day, we also collected 75 environmental surface samples (e.g., from floors,
top parts of medical examination stands, and cages) from 30 areas in the veterinary
hospital, including the following areas: waiting area; consulting, procedure, and
operation rooms; dispensary; animal wards; administrative office; and a
veterinarian's office. Sampling areas were selected from areas frequented by
individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital and by animal patients. These
samples were collected using single-use cotton swabs moistened with sterile
physiological saline. In cases where presumptive MRCPS isolates were obtained from
individuals who had companion animals at home, samples of buccal mucosa from the
companion animals were also tested. In the second sampling period from February to
April 2008, the nasal samples were collected from 31 of 50 clinical veterinarians
(62%), all 18 staff members, and 65 of 89 veterinary students (73%) affiliated with
the DCVA of the veterinary hospital. In addition, three veterinarians, one staff
member, and nine veterinary students affiliated with the Department of Large Animal
Clinical Sciences provided nasal samples. Additionally, a total of 81 environmental
surface samples were collected from areas similar to those described above. Eight
presumed MRSA strains from dog patients were also collected for use in this study for
comparison with MRSA isolates from veterinarians, and veterinary students. These
strains were isolated from the affected parts of dog patients during the period from
2007 to 2008. These strains were identified genetically mec and characterized by SCC
and molecular typing in this study. Fact-finding inquiry. In order to establish the
factors associated with MRCPS carriage in humans, information on the following was
gathered from subjects: hospitalization and surgery received within the previous
year, antibiotics taken within the previous month, known contact with MRSA-identified
animal patients, career, affiliations, and the presence of companion animals at home.
During the 2008 investigation, we questioned volunteers about their participation in
the previous investigation in 2007 and their MRSA-positive or -negative status as
determined by the previous test. Human samples and questionnaire answers were coded
to protect anonymity. Isolation of MRCPS. Swabs were directly inoculated onto
CHROMagar MRSA medium (Kanto Kagaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and incubated at
35&#xB0;C for 24 h. For enrichment, the same swabs were inoculated into 5-ml portions
of heart infusion broth (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) containing
7.5% sodium chloride and incubated at 35&#xB0;C for 48 h. Enrichment cultures were
streaked out on CHROMagar MRSA medium and incubated as described above.
Representative colonies colored light purple (presumptive MRSA), blue, or white were
selected from each sample and subcultured on nutrient agar (Nissui Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd.). For testing, we selected one isolate from each sample that was a

agents, 12 of which were the same as those tested for the 2007 isolates. This time,
however, we used tetracycline and ciprofloxacin instead of oxytetracycline and
enrofloxacin. Molecular typing. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis for
MRSA isolates was performed as previously described (2, 15). Briefly, bacterial
cultures were grown overnight in Mueller-Hinton broth (Oxoid Ltd.) and resuspended in
TN buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 M NaCl, pH 8.0). The cultures were mixed with the same
volume of 2% UltraPure low-melting-point (LMP) agarose (Invitrogen Japan Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan), dissolved in TN buffer, and pipetted into a plug mold. After bacterial lysis
in a lysis buffer containing 5 mg/ml lysozyme (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.,
Osaka, Japan) and 20 g/ml lysostaphin (Sigma&#x242E; Aldrich Japan K. K.), genomic
DNA was digested with SmaI (Takara Bio, Ltd.). PFGE was performed using a CHEF-DRIII
system (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.), under the following conditions: switch time of
5.3 to 34.9 s and running time of 20 h for MRSA (15); included angle, 120&#xB0;;

10 of 127 individuals (7.9%; 95% CI, 3.8% to 14.0%) affiliated with the veterinary
hospital in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In addition, MRSA isolates were also
obtained from 2 of 10 MRSA carriers even after they underwent treatment. Analysis of
the environmental surface samples showed that MRSA had contaminated the floors of
rooms used for X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans and administration of anesthetics

and MRSP colonization by assessing the results from individuals who had first
provided samples and answered the questionnaire. Research students and graduate
students were categorized as employees because they diagnosed and treated animal
patients in the capacity of veterinarians. One person failed to answer questions
regarding hospitalization, surgery, and antibiotic intake, whereas an additional two
people failed to answer questions regarding the presence of companion animals in the
home; these individuals were therefore excluded from the analysis. The univariate
analysis results for MRSA and MRSP carriage are shown in Table 3. According to the
stepwise forward logistic regression, both contact with MRSA-identified animal
patients and employment were associated with MRSA carriage. The predictive accuracy

contact with animal patients. Since contact with MRSA-infected animal patients is a
factor considered to be associated with MRSA carriage, it can be inferred that MRSA
carriers may originally have been infected by animal patients. However, a study
conducted on 31 outpatient dogs in Japan reported that MRSA isolates were not
detected in any of the dogs (38); similar previous studies have also reported that
the prevalence of MRSA among dogs and cats was low (5, 31). Manian reported a case in
which MRSA colonization was detected in a dog, which was believed to be the source of
recurrent MRSA infection in its owner, a diabetes patient, and his wife; the dog was
believed to have contracted the infection through contact with the owner (24).
Another previous study reported MRSA colonization in a dog whose owner was a nurse
caring for MRSA patients; it was concluded that the dog contracted the infection from
the nurse, who was found to be a carrier of MRSA infection (50). Thus, human MRSA
carriers can also be a source of MRSA infection in animals encountered in veterinary
medical pracmec tice. In the present study, the MRSA isolate with SCC type<component

spa IV and type t008 was obtained from a dog patient in March 2008 after one
veterinarian was identified to be a carrier of spa MRSA type t008 on three different
sampling occasions. The dog patient had undergone medical examinations in the
clinical department to which the veterinarian belonged. This clone might, therefore,
have spread from the veterinarian to the dog patient by direct contact or through the
medium of contaminated environments. In this study, the frequencies of MRSA infection
among veterinarians and staff members in the veterinary hospital was found to be
19.5% (8/41) and 15.1% (8/53) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. These frequencies are
comparable to the values reported in a previous study in the United Kingdom (17.9%)
(21) and that reported in a study of veterinary personnel attending a veterinary
surgery conference (17.3%) (6); however, these values were higher than those reported
in a Japanese veterinary teaching hospital (10%) (38), in Scotland (3.9%) (13), and
in Denmark (3.0%) (28). Moreover, the frequency of MRSA carriers has been reported to
be only 0.54% among dog owners (5). mec SCC type II was prevalent among the MRSA
isolates obtained from individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital mec and
from dog patients. Most of the MRSA isolates with SCC spa type II also harbored type
t002. A majority of the hospitalacquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) isolates identified in Japan
also mec harbor SCC type II and are derived from the New York/ Japan clone
(multilocus sequence type 5 [ST5]) (17, 22, 36, 54). The MRSA of the Japan clone is
generally known to have type t002 (http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/). MRSA isolates mec
with SCC type II have been isolated from patients without established risk factors
for HA-MRSA (36). Moreover, mec MRSA isolates with SCC type II have also been
isolated from healthy children (14); thus, infection of this MRSA clone has already

and animal patients, in Japan. mec Zaraket et al. reported that a MRSA clone with SCC

study, all mec spa but two MRSA isolates with SCC type II had type t002; spa the
remaining two isolates had type t062 and t1265. Unlike spa spa type t002, the type
t062 has a deletion in the middle spa three repeats (34-17-20) of t002, whereas the
type t1265 has a double repeat of r12 instead of r17. Moreover, the spa MRSA isolates
of type t002 were grouped into seven clusmec ters by PFGE, and the SCC types therein
were classified mec into different subtypes. It is not known whether the SCC type II
clone varies in veterinary medical practice or if some clones with a small genetic
diversity have been introduced into the veterinary hospital. The PFGE method can help
divide MRSA isolates into spa more groups than typing, as shown in a previous study
(44). spa Although types depend on the DNA sequence of only spa region X of the gene,
PFGE profiles depend on the numbers and positions of the restriction sites in the DNA
sequence of the entire genome. Therefore, PFGE enables better discrimination between
strains. On the other hand, spatyping enabled comparison of the MRSA isolates
obtained in this spa study with those reported in other studies. In some cases,

was more useful than either method alone in discriminating MRSA isolates. mec MRSA
isolates with SCC type I were obtained only in spa 2008, and these isolates also had
type t1767. Isolates with mec SCC type I are not commonly encountered in human
hospitals; however, they are sometimes isolated from Japanese hospital inpatients at
risk of HA-MRSA infection (36, 54). It mec has been reported that MRSA isolates
harboring SCC type I obtained from inpatients belong to ST 8 or ST 30 strains (36,
54). There is little data regarding multilocus sequence analysis spa of MRSA having
type t1767; however, the only MRSA with spa type t1767, which was isolated in Hong
Kong, belonged to ST8 (http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/). Although the 10 human MRSA
carriers were treated to eradicate colonization, two of these carriers were found to
be harboring MRSA isolates even after 1 month of treatment. Recurrent MRSA infection
in a patient and healthy MRSA carriers has been reported previously (24, 50). The
genotype of mec MRSA from a recurrent carrier changed from SCC type II kdp spa mec
without gene and type t1265 to SCC type II harkdp spa boring the gene and type t002.
Because the latter genotype was more common among the MRSA isolates obtained from
veterinary staff and environmental surfaces, this carrier might be infected from
other MRSA carriers or contaminated environmental surfaces. Treatment of MRSA
carriers should be undertaken simultaneously with the disinfection of the entire
hospital and implementation of hand hygiene practices, which has been reported as a
strong protective factor against MRSA colonization (1). MRSA was not detected in the
five buccal mucosa samples of dogs owned by MRCPS-positive individuals. We chose
buccal swab and not nasal swab, which is the traditional sample for MRSA isolation,
because sampling from dogs was done at home by each owner without enough
immobilization. Loeffler et al. reported that the isolation frequency of MRSA from
the buccal swabs of dogs was as high as that from the nasal swabs (21). However, in
another previous study, the nasal, axillary, and rectal swabs of dogs were tested for
isolation MRSA, and the MRSA isolate was obtained only from the rectum (11).
Combination sampling of the nasal, buccal, and rectal swabs obtained from dogs may
facilitate detection of MRSA carriage. In this investigation, we used the CHROMagar
MRSA medium for the isolation of MRCPS. This medium has been reported to be highly
effective in selecting for MRSA (10, 45). In a previous study describing the
prevalence of MRSP, samples were directly inoculated onto mannitol-salt agar
containing 2 mg/liter oxacillin and after the enrichment of staphylococci in broth
containing 7.5% sodium chloride (11). In other studies, MRSP isolates were selected
from staphylococcal strains by testing their susceptibility to oxacillin (38, 40).
The CHROMagar MRSA medium used in this study contained 6 mg/liter cefoxitin. Although
we did not determine the MICs of cefoxitin for the MRSP isolates obtained in this
study, we found that approximately half of the MRSP isolates were susceptible to
cefazolin. Sasaki et al. also reported that almost all MRSP isolates were susceptible
to cefazolin and cefotiame (38). The higher susceptibility of MRSP to cephalosporin
than MRSA might explain why the colony size of MRSP on the CHROMagar MRSA medium was
considerably smaller than<component x="52.16" y="65.35" width="240.09"

the other hand, even cefazolin-susceptible MRSP isolates could be obtained by using
the CHROMagar MRSA medium in this study. In the present study, the frequency of MRSP
isolated from individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital (5.9%) was similar
to that reported previously (38). Although it was reported that some MRSP isolates
from dog patients had low-level resistance to oxacillin (MIC, 2 to 4 g/ml) (38), all
MRSP isolates obtained in this study &#x242E; showed high-level resistance to
oxacillin (MIC, 16 g/ml). ( &#x242E; The CHROMagar MRSA medium might be unable to
detect MRSP that has low-level resistance to oxacillin. Descloux et al. described
canine MRSP isolates with a new mec S. aureus SCC type II-III, resulting from a
combination of mec Staphylococcus epidermidis mec SCC type III and SCC type mec II
(8). The structure of SCC in 23 MRSP isolates, as confirmed by M-PCR 4 and PCR 3,
matched the DNA sequence mec of SCC type II-III (GenBank accession no. AM904732); mec
therefore, the SCC type of these 23 MRSP isolates was presumed to be type II-III.
There are only a limited number of mec reports pertaining to the SCC type among MRSP
isolates mec (8, 30, 38); accordingly, more data regarding the SCC types among MRSP
isolates are needed in order to understand the reasons for the sudden emergence of
MRSP, although canine S. intermedius S. pseudinisolates, which were presumed to be
termedius in the previous studies (3, 39), have been reported as being susceptible to
-lactam antibiotics in the past (41, 46). &#x2424; Although contact with MRSA animal
patients has also been recognized as a factor associated with MRSP carriage, the
reason for this association is unknown. A previous study has S. intermesuggested the
transmission of multidrug-resistant dius species among dogs affected by deep pyoderma
and their owners (9). Therefore, animal patients could transmit MRSP infection to
humans. Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) isolates are generally susceptible to most
of the antimicrobial agents studied, except -lactam antibiotics (32, 36, 49). Almost
all MRSA and &#x2424; MRSP isolates investigated in this study were multidrug

differed between mec SCC types or subtypes of MRSA (14). The degree of susmec

the present study could provide some information regarding the transmission of MRSA

MRSA infection in other individuals. Moreover, MRSA contamination was detected in the
veterinary hospital environment. MRSA contamination in veterinary hospitals has been

the factors associated with MRSA and MRSP colonization by assessing the results from
individuals who had first provided samples and answered the questionnaire. Research
students and graduate students were categorized as employees because they diagnosed
and treated animal patients in the capacity of veterinarians. One person failed to
answer questions regarding hospitalization, surgery, and antibiotic intake, whereas
an additional two peo- ple failed to answer questions regarding the presence of com-
panion animals in the home; these individuals were therefore excluded from the
analysis. The univariate analysis results for MRSA and MRSP carriage are shown in
Table 3. According to the stepwise forward logistic regression, both contact with
MRSA-identified animal patients and employ- ment were associated with MRSA carriage.
The predictive accuracy was 91.0%, as determined by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The
incidence of MRSA carriers among those who had had contact with MRSA-identified
animal patients (19.7%) was higher than those who had had no contact (3.8%; OR, P
6.88; 95% CI, 2.20 to 21.57) ( (0.01). The incidence of MRSA carriers among employees
of the veterinary hospital or of nonclinical laboratories (18.5%) was higher than
that among students (4.0%; OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.97 to 19.41). Contact with
MRSA-identified animal patients was also associated with MRSP carriage. The
predictive accuracy was 96.8%, as deter- mined by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The
incidence of MRSP carriers among those who had had contact with MRSA-iden- tified
animal patients (8.2%) was higher than the incidence in those who had had no contact
with MRSA-identified animal patients (0.8%; OR, 11.55; 95% CI, 1.32 to 101.14) (

  <reference>MRSA isolates with SCC type I were obtained only in spa 2008, and these
isolates also had type t1767. Isolates with mec SCC type I are not commonly
encountered in human hos- pitals; however, they are sometimes isolated from Japanese
hospital inpatients at risk of HA-MRSA infection (36, 54). It mec has been reported
that MRSA isolates harboring SCC type I obtained from inpatients belong to ST 8 or ST
30 strains (36, 54). There is little data regarding multilocus sequence analysis spa
of MRSA having type t1767; however, the only MRSA with spa type t1767, which was
isolated in Hong Kong, belonged to ST8 (http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/).</reference>
  <reference>Although the 10 human MRSA carriers were treated to eradicate
colonization, two of these carriers were found to be harboring MRSA isolates even
after 1 month of treatment. Recurrent MRSA infection in a patient and healthy MRSA
carriers has been reported previously (24, 50). The genotype of mec MRSA from a
recurrent carrier changed from SCC type II kdp spa mec without gene and type t1265 to
SCC type II har- kdp spa boring the gene and type t002. Because the latter genotype
was more common among the MRSA isolates ob- tained from veterinary staff and
environmental surfaces, this carrier might be infected from other MRSA carriers or
con- taminated environmental surfaces. Treatment of MRSA carri- ers should be
undertaken simultaneously with the disinfection of the entire hospital and
implementation of hand hygiene practices, which has been reported as a strong
protective factor against MRSA colonization (1).</reference>
  <reference>MRSA was not detected in the five buccal mucosa samples of dogs owned by
MRCPS-positive individuals. We chose buc- cal swab and not nasal swab, which is the
traditional sample for MRSA isolation, because sampling from dogs was done at home by
each owner without enough immobilization. Loeffler et al. reported that the isolation
frequency of MRSA from the buccal swabs of dogs was as high as that from the nasal
swabs (21). However, in another previous study, the nasal, axillary, and rectal swabs
of dogs were tested for isolation MRSA, and the MRSA isolate was obtained only from
the rectum (11). Combination sampling of the nasal, buccal, and rectal swabs obtained
from dogs may facilitate detection of MRSA carriage.</reference>
  <reference>In this investigation, we used the CHROMagar MRSA me- dium for the
isolation of MRCPS. This medium has been reported to be highly effective in selecting
for MRSA (10, 45). In a previous study describing the prevalence of MRSP, sam- ples
were directly inoculated onto mannitol-salt agar contain- ing 2 mg/liter oxacillin
and after the enrichment of staphylo- cocci in broth containing 7.5% sodium chloride
(11). In other studies, MRSP isolates were selected from staphylococcal strains by
testing their susceptibility to oxacillin (38, 40). The CHROMagar MRSA medium used in
this study contained 6 mg/liter cefoxitin. Although we did not determine the MICs of
cefoxitin for the MRSP isolates obtained in this study, we found that approximately
half of the MRSP isolates were sus- ceptible to cefazolin. Sasaki et al. also
reported that almost all MRSP isolates were susceptible to cefazolin and cefotiame
(38). The higher susceptibility of MRSP to cephalosporin than MRSA might explain why
the colony size of MRSP on the CHROMagar MRSA medium was considerably smaller

the factors associated with MRSA and MRSP colonization by assessing the results from
individuals who had first provided samples and answered the questionnaire. Research
students and graduate students were categorized as employees because they diagnosed
and treated animal patients in the capacity of veterinarians. One person failed to
answer questions regarding hospitalization, surgery, and antibiotic intake, whereas
an additional two peo- ple failed to answer questions regarding the presence of com-
panion animals in the home; these individuals were therefore excluded from the
analysis. The univariate analysis results for MRSA and MRSP carriage are shown in
Table 3. According to the stepwise forward logistic regression, both contact with
MRSA-identified animal patients and employ- ment were associated with MRSA carriage.
The predictive accuracy was 91.0%, as determined by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The
incidence of MRSA carriers among those who had had contact with MRSA-identified
animal patients (19.7%) was higher than those who had had no contact (3.8%; OR, P
6.88; 95% CI, 2.20 to 21.57) ( (0.01). The incidence of MRSA carriers among employees
of the veterinary hospital or of nonclinical laboratories (18.5%) was higher than
that among students (4.0%; OR, 6.18; 95% CI, 1.97 to 19.41). Contact with
MRSA-identified animal patients was also associated with MRSP carriage. The
predictive accuracy was 96.8%, as deter- mined by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The
incidence of MRSP carriers among those who had had contact with MRSA-iden- tified
animal patients (8.2%) was higher than the incidence in those who had had no contact
with MRSA-identified animal patients (0.8%; OR, 11.55; 95% CI, 1.32 to 101.14) (

  <reference>MRSA isolates with SCC type I were obtained only in spa 2008, and these
isolates also had type t1767. Isolates with mec SCC type I are not commonly
encountered in human hos- pitals; however, they are sometimes isolated from Japanese
hospital inpatients at risk of HA-MRSA infection (36, 54). It mec has been reported
that MRSA isolates harboring SCC type I obtained from inpatients belong to ST 8 or ST
30 strains (36, 54). There is little data regarding multilocus sequence analysis spa
of MRSA having type t1767; however, the only MRSA with spa type t1767, which was
isolated in Hong Kong, belonged to ST8 (http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/).</reference>
  <reference>Although the 10 human MRSA carriers were treated to eradicate
colonization, two of these carriers were found to be harboring MRSA isolates even
after 1 month of treatment. Recurrent MRSA infection in a patient and healthy MRSA
carriers has been reported previously (24, 50). The genotype of mec MRSA from a
recurrent carrier changed from SCC type II kdp spa mec without gene and type t1265 to
SCC type II har- kdp spa boring the gene and type t002. Because the latter genotype
was more common among the MRSA isolates ob- tained from veterinary staff and
environmental surfaces, this carrier might be infected from other MRSA carriers or
con- taminated environmental surfaces. Treatment of MRSA carri- ers should be
undertaken simultaneously with the disinfection of the entire hospital and
implementation of hand hygiene practices, which has been reported as a strong
protective factor against MRSA colonization (1).</reference>
  <reference>MRSA was not detected in the five buccal mucosa samples of dogs owned by
MRCPS-positive individuals. We chose buc- cal swab and not nasal swab, which is the
traditional sample for MRSA isolation, because sampling from dogs was done at home by
each owner without enough immobilization. Loeffler et al. reported that the isolation
frequency of MRSA from the buccal swabs of dogs was as high as that from the nasal
swabs (21). However, in another previous study, the nasal, axillary, and rectal swabs
of dogs were tested for isolation MRSA, and the MRSA isolate was obtained only from
the rectum (11). Combination sampling of the nasal, buccal, and rectal swabs obtained
from dogs may facilitate detection of MRSA carriage.</reference>
  <reference>In this investigation, we used the CHROMagar MRSA me- dium for the
isolation of MRCPS. This medium has been reported to be highly effective in selecting
for MRSA (10, 45). In a previous study describing the prevalence of MRSP, sam- ples
were directly inoculated onto mannitol-salt agar contain- ing 2 mg/liter oxacillin
and after the enrichment of staphylo- cocci in broth containing 7.5% sodium chloride
(11). In other studies, MRSP isolates were selected from staphylococcal strains by
testing their susceptibility to oxacillin (38, 40). The CHROMagar MRSA medium used in
this study contained 6 mg/liter cefoxitin. Although we did not determine the MICs of
cefoxitin for the MRSP isolates obtained in this study, we found that approximately
half of the MRSP isolates were sus- ceptible to cefazolin. Sasaki et al. also
reported that almost all MRSP isolates were susceptible to cefazolin and cefotiame
(38). The higher susceptibility of MRSP to cephalosporin than MRSA might explain why
the colony size of MRSP on the CHROMagar MRSA medium was considerably smaller

duplication, we undertook an analysis of the factors associated with MRSA and MRSP
colonization by assessing the results from individuals who had first provided samples
and answered the questionnaire. Research students and graduate students were
categorized as employees because they diagnosed and treated animal patients in the
capacity of veterinarians. One person failed to answer questions regarding
hospitalization, surgery, and antibiotic intake, whereas an additional two peo- ple
failed to answer questions regarding the presence of com- panion animals in the home;
these individuals were therefore excluded from the analysis. The univariate analysis
results for MRSA and MRSP carriage are shown in Table 3. According to the stepwise
forward logistic regression, both contact with MRSA-identified animal patients and
employ- ment were associated with MRSA carriage. The predictive accuracy was 91.0%,
as determined by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The incidence of MRSA carriers among those
who had had contact with MRSA-identified animal patients (19.7%) was higher than
those who had had no contact (3.8%; OR, P 6.88; 95% CI, 2.20 to 21.57) ( (0.01). The
incidence of MRSA carriers among employees of the veterinary hospital or of
nonclinical laboratories (18.5%) was higher than that among students (4.0%; OR, 6.18;
95% CI, 1.97 to 19.41). Contact with MRSA-identified animal patients was also
associated with MRSP carriage. The predictive accuracy was 96.8%, as deter- mined by
the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The incidence of MRSP carriers among those who had had
contact with MRSA-iden- tified animal patients (8.2%) was higher than the incidence
in those who had had no contact with MRSA-identified animal patients (0.8%; OR,
11.55; 95% CI, 1.32 to 101.14) ( 0.05). P( Molecular characterization of MRCPS. Two

  <resolved_reference>MRSA isolates with SCC type I were obtained only in spa 2008,
and these isolates also had type t1767. Isolates with mec SCC type I are not commonly
encountered in human hos- pitals; however, they are sometimes isolated from Japanese
hospital inpatients at risk of HA-MRSA infection (36, 54). It mec has been reported
that MRSA isolates harboring SCC type I obtained from inpatients belong to ST 8 or ST
30 strains (36, 54). There is little data regarding multilocus sequence analysis spa
of MRSA having type t1767; however, the only MRSA with spa type t1767, which was
isolated in Hong Kong, belonged to ST8
(http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/).</resolved_reference>
  <resolved_reference>Although the 10 human MRSA carriers were treated to eradicate
colonization, two of these carriers were found to be harboring MRSA isolates even
after 1 month of treatment. Recurrent MRSA infection in a patient and healthy MRSA
carriers has been reported previously (24, 50). The genotype of mec MRSA from a
recurrent carrier changed from SCC type II kdp spa mec without gene and type t1265 to
SCC type II har- kdp spa boring the gene and type t002. Because the latter genotype
was more common among the MRSA isolates ob- tained from veterinary staff and
environmental surfaces, this carrier might be infected from other MRSA carriers or
con- taminated environmental surfaces. Treatment of MRSA carri- ers should be
undertaken simultaneously with the disinfection of the entire hospital and
implementation of hand hygiene practices, which has been reported as a strong
protective factor against MRSA colonization (1).</resolved_reference>
  <resolved_reference>MRSA was not detected in the five buccal mucosa samples of dogs
owned by MRCPS-positive individuals. We chose buc- cal swab and not nasal swab, which
is the traditional sample for MRSA isolation, because sampling from dogs was done at
home by each owner without enough immobilization. Loeffler et al. reported that the
isolation frequency of MRSA from the buccal swabs of dogs was as high as that from
the nasal swabs (21). However, in another previous study, the nasal, axillary, and
rectal swabs of dogs were tested for isolation MRSA, and the MRSA isolate was
obtained only from the rectum (11). Combination sampling of the nasal, buccal, and
rectal swabs obtained from dogs may facilitate detection of MRSA
carriage.</resolved_reference>
  <resolved_reference>In this investigation, we used the CHROMagar MRSA me- dium for
the isolation of MRCPS. This medium has been reported to be highly effective in
selecting for MRSA (10, 45). In a previous study describing the prevalence of MRSP,
sam- ples were directly inoculated onto mannitol-salt agar contain- ing 2 mg/liter
oxacillin and after the enrichment of staphylo- cocci in broth containing 7.5% sodium
chloride (11). In other studies, MRSP isolates were selected from staphylococcal
strains by testing their susceptibility to oxacillin (38, 40). The CHROMagar MRSA
medium used in this study contained 6 mg/liter cefoxitin. Although we did not
determine the MICs of cefoxitin for the MRSP isolates obtained in this study, we
found that approximately half of the MRSP isolates were sus- ceptible to cefazolin.
Sasaki et al. also reported that almost all MRSP isolates were susceptible to
cefazolin and cefotiame (38). The higher susceptibility of MRSP to cephalosporin than
MRSA might explain why the colony size of MRSP on the CHROMagar MRSA medium was
considerably smaller than</resolved_reference>
