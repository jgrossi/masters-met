  <reference>The genetic relationship among the MRSA isolates, based on PFGE, is
shown in Fig. 1. Analysis using the Dice coeffi- cient, followed by the
unweighted-pair group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA), revealed 12 clusters
(clusters A to L) of MRSA. Band position tolerance and optimization mec were both
set at 1.0%. Similarities among the SCC type II kdp isolates that harbored both
pUB110 and were higher than kdp those among isolates that had lost either pUB110 or

t1265, respectively. The remaining 25 MRSA mec spa isolates with SCC type II had
type t002. All eight mec spa MRSA isolates with SCC type IV had type t008. All mec

  <reference>Two type t002 MRSA isolates in cluster G (2007-IM11 [28] and 2008-98
[28]) were isolated from a nasal sample from a veterinarian after treatment for MRSA
carriage in Novem- ber 2007 and in 2008; however, an MRSA isolate from the same
veterinarian before treatment was grouped in cluster J kdp spa and did not harbor .
The three type t008 isolates in cluster B were obtained from the same veterinarian,
before and after treatment (March and November 2007 and February 2008).

  <reference>Twenty-three MRSP isolates carried a class A complex ccr 554 and a type
3 complex. The absence of insertion Tn (loci E and F were negative, according to
M-PCR 4) and pT181 (locus H) was found in 23 MRSP isolates. These MRSP iso- dcs
lates harbored the region and a gene in the J1 region mec present in SCC type III;
the latter was confirmed by PCR mec 3. The SCC structure in these 23 MRSP isolates
matched mec the DNA sequence of SCC type II-III (GenBank accession mec no.
AM904732); therefore, the SCC type of these MRSP isolates was presumed to be type
II-III. Three MRSP isolates mec 554 were classified as SCC type V and harbored Tn in
the chromosomal right junction (locus F was positive). In one ccr mec MRSP isolate,

  <reference>MRSA isolates with SCC type I were obtained only in spa 2008, and these
isolates also had type t1767. Isolates with mec SCC type I are not commonly
encountered in human hos- pitals; however, they are sometimes isolated from Japanese
hospital inpatients at risk of HA-MRSA infection (36, 54). It mec has been reported
that MRSA isolates harboring SCC type I obtained from inpatients belong to ST 8 or
ST 30 strains (36, 54). There is little data regarding multilocus sequence analysis

isolated in Hong Kong, belonged to ST8 (http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/).</reference>
  <reference>Although the 10 human MRSA carriers were treated to eradicate
colonization, two of these carriers were found to be harboring MRSA isolates even
after 1 month of treatment. Recurrent MRSA infection in a patient and healthy MRSA
carriers has been reported previously (24, 50). The genotype of mec MRSA from a
recurrent carrier changed from SCC type II kdp spa mec without gene and type t1265
to SCC type II har- kdp spa boring the gene and type t002. Because the latter
genotype was more common among the MRSA isolates ob- tained from veterinary staff
and environmental surfaces, this carrier might be infected from other MRSA carriers
or con- taminated environmental surfaces. Treatment of MRSA carri- ers should be
undertaken simultaneously with the disinfection of the entire hospital and
implementation of hand hygiene practices, which has been reported as a strong
protective factor against MRSA colonization (1).</reference>
  <reference>MRSA was not detected in the five buccal mucosa samples of dogs owned
by MRCPS-positive individuals. We chose buc- cal swab and not nasal swab, which is
the traditional sample for MRSA isolation, because sampling from dogs was done at
home by each owner without enough immobilization. Loeffler et al. reported that the
isolation frequency of MRSA from the buccal swabs of dogs was as high as that from
the nasal swabs (21). However, in another previous study, the nasal, axillary, and
rectal swabs of dogs were tested for isolation MRSA, and the MRSA isolate was
obtained only from the rectum (11). Combination sampling of the nasal, buccal, and
rectal swabs obtained from dogs may facilitate detection of MRSA
carriage.</reference>
  <reference>In this investigation, we used the CHROMagar MRSA me- dium for the
isolation of MRCPS. This medium has been reported to be highly effective in
selecting for MRSA (10, 45). In a previous study describing the prevalence of MRSP,
sam- ples were directly inoculated onto mannitol-salt agar contain- ing 2 mg/liter
oxacillin and after the enrichment of staphylo- cocci in broth containing 7.5%
sodium chloride (11). In other studies, MRSP isolates were selected from
staphylococcal strains by testing their susceptibility to oxacillin (38, 40). The
CHROMagar MRSA medium used in this study contained 6 mg/liter cefoxitin. Although we
did not determine the MICs of cefoxitin for the MRSP isolates obtained in this
study, we found that approximately half of the MRSP isolates were sus- ceptible to
cefazolin. Sasaki et al. also reported that almost all MRSP isolates were
susceptible to cefazolin and cefotiame (38). The higher susceptibility of MRSP to
cephalosporin than MRSA might explain why the colony size of MRSP on the CHROMagar
MRSA medium was considerably smaller than</reference>
