the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges &#xE024; reported that the
shortage ( 1,500) of public health veterinarians is expected to increase tenfold by
2020. In 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Preventive
Medicine Fellows conducted a pilot project among CDC veterinarians to identify
national veterinary public health workforce concerns and potential policy strategies.
Methods. Fellows surveyed a convenience sample (19/91) of public health veterinarians
at CDC to identify veterinary workforce recruitment and retention problems faced by
federal agencies; responses were categorized into themes. A focus group (20/91) of
staff veterinarians subsequently prioritized the categorized themes from least to
most important. Participants identified activities to address the three recruitment
concerns with the highest combined weight. Results. Participants identified the
following three highest prioritized problems faced by federal agencies when
recruiting veterinarians to public health: (1) lack of awareness of veterinarians'
contributions to public health practice, (2) competitive salaries, and (3) employment
and training opportunities. Similarly, key concerns identified regarding retention of
public health practice veterinarians included: (1) lack of recognition of veterinary
qualifications, (2) competitive salaries, and (3) seamless integration of veterinary
and human public health. Conclusions. Findings identified multiple barriers that can
affect recruitment and retention of veterinarians engaged in public health practice.
Next steps should include replicating project efforts among a national sample of
public health veterinarians. A committed and determined long-term effort might be
required to sustain initiatives and policy proposals to increase U.S. veterinary
public health capacity.<component x="231.0" y="222.17" width="344.43" height="353.15"

require an interdisciplinary approach to public health disease surveillance,
prevention, and control. Given that approximately 75% of emerging human infectious
diseases are 1 zoonosis-related, veterinarians are critical partners when addressing
public health challenges, especially considering emerging pathogens that might have a
zoonotic component (e.g., avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and
Ebola hemorrhagic 2,3 fever). Veterinarians in state, federal, and uniformed services
often fill these roles; in 2006, a total of 3,312 (3.9%) of 84,946 U.S. veterinarians
were employed in public health (i.e., government and uniformed service 4 employees).
Although veterinarians engaged in public health activities traditionally have worked
in a regulatory capacity on animal health problems affecting agriculture, plant and
animal health, human and animal food safety, biologic and homeland security, and
wildlife and 3 zoonotic disease prevention and control, others have sought to work in
applied public health roles usually associated with medical doctors, nurses, and
people trained in epidemiology. In addition, veterinarians in public health careers
have not limited themselves to the zoonotic pathogens and often apply their
population medicine knowledge to other roles of human disease or injury prevention
and control, environmental health, and vaccine-preventable diseases. A 2006 report by
the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC) identified a shortage
of &#xE024;1,500 veterinarians fulfilling public health responsibilities; by 2020,
this shortage is expected to 5 increase tenfold. The 2007-2008 Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) Preventive Medicine Fellows (PMFs) conducted a
veterinary public health workforce focus group project by using the community
mobilization and group facilitation skills learned in the 6 PMF training program. The
objective of this project was to gain insight into key areas of recruitment and
retention that might reduce the national shortage of public health veterinarians.
METHODS The PMFs conducted a focus group by using a struc7,8 Particitured community
intervention technique. pants were recruited for the focus group and a Sur&#x2122;9
veyMonkey questionnaire was disseminated through the 2008 U.S. Public Health Service
(PHS) and civilian CDC veterinary electronic mailing lists. Participants were asked
to complete the survey within two weeks and before the focus group. The survey asked
two open-ended questions about the nation's veterinary public health workforce (i.e.,
veterinarians working in both federal and nonfederal public health roles): ( ) 1 What
specific problems does CDC face when actively developing the veterinary public health
workforce? and ( ) What specific problems does CDC face when 2 supporting
veterinarians engaged in public health practice? Participants could list up to three
problems, which were considered unique responses, for each of the two questions. PMFs
reviewed the survey responses from each of the two questions and classified responses
for each question into themes before conducting the focus group. Focus group
participants prioritized each theme from &#xE035; &#xE035; 1 least important to 5
most important. PMFs used the weighted categorized results to assess national
veterinary public health workforce problems pertaining to recruitment (Question 1)
and retention (Question 2); &#xAE; &#xAE; all analyses were performed using Microsoft
Excel . To address the top three ranked categories for Question 1 (recruitment),
focus group participants were asked to identify activities by using an ecologic model
flow diagram at the individual, agency, veterinary community, and policy levels. The
flow diagram was designed on the basis of the ecologic model framework to identify
action steps during public health community 8,9 intervention processes (Figure).
Activities at each of the higher levels (agency, veterinary community, and policy)
were used to address the intervening concerns at that level that might prevent the
main goal from being achieved. An example of an intervening factor is when an agency
goal is to increase veterinary pay after completion of five years in the workforce,
but a conflicting agency policy prevents the stated pay increase. Because of time
constraints, focus group participants did not fully develop the ecologic model flow
diagram to address priorities identified in response to retention (Question 2);
therefore, these priorities are not described in this article. RESULTS Twenty-six
(29%) of 91 CDC veterinarians participated in the project. Nineteen CDC veterinarians
participated in the survey, 20 participated in the focus group, and 13 participated
in both. For Question 1 (recruitment), we classified the 26 unique responses into one
of eight themes based on participant responses, as follows: awareness of veterinary
contributions to public health, interest in government work, employment and training
opportunities, a clear mechanism to identify jobs, loan programs supporting public
health careers, a career ladder for those employed, career pathways in veterinary
schools, and competitive salaries. In<component x="75.0" y="236.46" width="237.58"

(recruitment), focus group participants identified the top three problems faced when
addressing this question-lack of awareness of the veterinary contribution to public
health, lack of competitive salaries, and lack of employment and training
opportunities (Table 1). Similarly, for Question 2 (retention), we classified the 22
unique responses into one of six themes, as follows: recognition of veterinary
qualifications in public health, seamless integration of veterinary and human public
health, adequate funding for and availability of positions, adequate advanced
training, competitive salaries, and retention of existing federal veterinarians. In
response to Question 2 (retention), focus group participants identified the top three
problems faced when addressing this question-lack of recognition of veterinary
qualifications in public health, lack of competitive salaries, and lack of seamless
integration of veterinary and human public health (Table 1). Related to the top three
identified priorities for Question 1 (recruitment), participants identified
activities at the individual (I), agency (A), veterinary community (VC), and policy
(P) levels. To improve awareness of the veterinary contribution to public health, at
least one key activity was identified at each level above individual, including
increasing opportunities for veterinarians (A); educating veterinarians and other
public health practitioners on veterinary contributions (A, VC); engaging the
veterinary community in educating the public health workforce on the role of
veterinarians (A, VC); and gearing veterinary school programs toward support of
public health careers and activities (VC). To improve employment and training
opportunities, key activities identified included increasing the number of trainees
in existing CDC programs (A), increasing the number of career advancement programs
and guidance for veterinarians (A), identifying public health champions at each of
the veterinary colleges (VC), and identifying more opportunities for veterinarians
(VC). To improve the salaries of veterinarians in public health positions, key
activities identified included obtaining agency support for parity in pay with other
doctors of medicine (A), working across civilian and military personnel systems to
achieve parity in pay for veterinarians (VC), and obtaining support from the U.S.
Congress to increase pay for veterinarians in federal service (P). DISCUSSION Policy
proposals that improve training opportunities for veterinarians in public health,
increase pay, and support integration of human and veterinary public health might
have the greatest impact on reducing the national shortage of public health
veterinarians. Policies that increase the number of veterinarians engaged in existing
or new training programs are needed to expand the veterinary public health workforce.
Federal agencies offer limited public health training for veterinarians, which alone
might not be sufficient to improve the deficiency in the veterinary public health
workforce. For example, veterinarians compete and are selected by CDC to participate
in the CDC Epidemic 6,10 Intelligence Service (EIS) and PMF programs. According to
the CDC EIS Program Director, the EIS program trained an average of seven
veterinarians annually during 1990-2008 (Personal communication, Douglas H. Hamilton,
CDC, September 2010). During that same time frame, after completion of EIS, zero to
three veterinarians were trained each year in the PMF program. Even if the EIS
program trained veterinarians<component x="81.0" y="92.46" width="236.71"

health experience. With veterinary school tuition often higher than medical school
tuition (yearly median tuition was $22,761 and $20,135 for veterinary school tuition
and medical school, respectively, for in-state residents during 2008-2009)
(Unpublished data, AAVMC comparative 12 data report, 2008), and with starting
salaries substantially lower than those of physicians, veterinarians might not be
able to afford to pursue a public health career without added incentives. The average
educational debt among graduates from veterinary medical school 13 was $129,976 in
2009, an 8.5% increase from 2008. Increasing pay can reduce this additional financial
burden and make public health positions more accessible for veterinarians. PHS
veterinary officers are eligible to receive minimal additional pays (i.e., $266-$308
per month for board certification and $100 per month special pay). The special pay
for PHS veterinary officers has not increased since it was established for unified
14,15 service veterinarians in 1949. Even when employed by the same agency and
filling an equivalent position as PHS medical officers (i.e., physicians), PHS
veterinary officers are ineligible for special pays that might be used as a
recruitment and retention tool among veterinarians. These special pays include
variable special pay, incentive special pay, multiyear retention bonuses, 15,16 and
retention special pays. In 2011, considering the maximum of all special pays and
allowances available for a PHS officer board-certified in preventive medicine
(employed in a position not requiring direct patient care) at the O-4 (i.e.,
Lieutenant Commander, which might be comparable to a person holding a GS-12 or GS-13
position) temporary rank with five years of credit based on base pay and creditable
service entry dates, living in Atlanta, Georgia, with dependents, the veterinary
officer earned an annual salary of approximately $90,332 and the medical officer
earned approximately $167,632 (Table&#xA0;2). Similarly, among O-6 (i.e., Captain,
which might be comparable to a person holding a GS-14 or GS-15 position) temporary
ranked preventive medicine board-certified officers with the same duty station and
dependent status who have 10 years of credit based on base pay and creditable service
entry dates, approximate annual salaries were $116,673 for the veterinary officer and
$200,473 for the medical officer (Table 2). In these examples, the pay differentials
between the veterinary and medical officers are primarily attributable to the maximum
variable special pay, incentive special pay, multiyear retention bonus, and retention
special pay for medical officers, which totaled $77,000 for those with five years of
creditable service and $84,000 for those with 10 years of creditable service. PHS pay
for veterinarians is not competitive with other employment opportunities. According
to the American Veterinary Medical Association, in 2007 the median income among
private veterinary practitioners was $91,000; among board-certified veterinary
specialists in private practice, the median income was $167,862; and among
veterinarians in public or cor17 porate practice, the median income was $140,893.
During 2009, starting salaries among public-corporate sector veterinarians decreased
7.3%, compared with a 6.0% increase among veterinarians employed in 13 private
practice. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Defense increased the pay (maximum of
$16,000/ year in additional special pays effective October 2009) 18 for active-duty
veterinary officers. Expanding recognition of veterinarians' c ontribution to public
health can create interest in and improve the number of veterinarians serving in
public health positions. Advocating veterinarians' abilities can raise their profile,
broaden the range of positions open to veterinarians, and change attitudes about what
should be considered appropriate professional work for a veterinarian, expanding
commonly held beliefs. Veterinarians often successfully fill nontraditional public
health roles across local, state, and federal agencies. For example, veterinarians
have served as the state epidemiologist for Georgia and as acting U.S. 3 Surgeon
General. Conversely, veterinarians with the requisite training and experience have
been limited in the types of positions for which they are allowed to apply. For
instance, veterinarians are excluded from applying to federal public health positions
not requiring direct human patient care (e.g., epidemiologist) &#xAE;19 listed on
USAJobs under the General Schedule 600 series (human medical). Focus group
participants recommended advocacy efforts at the national level to ensure that hiring
efforts allow for veterinarian employment in public health positions not requiring
direct patient care. Results from this focus group demonstrate that more appreciation
and understanding of the roles public health veterinarians fill can help expand
veterinary public health capacity. Increasing recognition by prospective veterinary
students that career options exist beyond the traditional confines of private
clinical practice can make a veterinary career more attractive to those who otherwise
might select different professional training. Raising the public profile of
veterinarians can serve dual objectives identified by this focus group, such as
reducing barriers and developing and increasing the veterinary public health
workforce (i.e., the need for recruiting new candidates to address the growing need
for public health veterinarians and concurrently improving the lack of awareness of
the veterinary contribution to public health). state-employed veterinarians might
have resulted in different concerns and additional proposals. On the basis of
anecdotal information from project participants, however, we are confident that this
project identified key problems that can be identified if repeated in another venue.
Third, demographic and experience data were not collected; therefore, we were unable
to stratify concerns identified by number of years and types of experience. However,
project participants represented veterinarians &#xE02C; &#xE02E; with 5 and 15 years
of public health experience, veterinarians with experience working for other federal
agencies (e.g., the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety Inspection Service),
and veterinarians employed by the PHS and civil service. CONCLUSIONS The goal of this
pilot project was to identify concerns and potential policy strategies to address the
U.S. veterinary public health capacity shortage. Despite the limited number of
participants and the need for additional studies with a broader audience, this
project identified key problems that are likely to be voiced by veterinarians at all
levels of public health employment (e.g., local, state, and federal). Results from
this project can serve as a platform for change and a base on which future projects
and initiatives can be built; engaging the general public, policy makers, and
government management officials will be required to address the identified concerns.
For example, this article might help influence policy makers to increase pay for
public health veterinarians by using mechanisms that have been established for the
U.S. Department of 18 Defense or to establish mechanisms to recruit and retain
veterinarians in the PHS similar to what has 16 been established for physicians. A
committed and determined long-term effort will be required to sustain initiatives and
policy proposals needed to increase the U.S. veterinary public health
capacity.<component x="333.0" y="90.28" width="237.47" height="107.78" page="4"

the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges &#xE024; reported that the
shortage ( 1,500) of public health veterinarians is expected to increase tenfold by
2020. In 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Preventive
Medicine Fellows conducted a pilot project among CDC veterinarians to identify
national veterinary public health workforce concerns and potential policy strategies.
Methods. Fellows surveyed a convenience sample (19/91) of public health veterinarians
at CDC to identify veterinary workforce recruitment and retention problems faced by
federal agencies; responses were categorized into themes. A focus group (20/91) of
staff veterinarians subsequently prioritized the categorized themes from least to
most important. Participants identified activities to address the three recruitment
concerns with the highest combined weight. Results. Participants identified the
following three highest prioritized problems faced by federal agencies when
recruiting veterinarians to public health: (1) lack of awareness of veterinarians'
contributions to public health practice, (2) competitive salaries, and (3) employment
and training opportunities. Similarly, key concerns identified regarding retention of
public health practice veterinarians included: (1) lack of recognition of veterinary
qualifications, (2) competitive salaries, and (3) seamless integration of veterinary
and human public health. Conclusions. Findings identified multiple barriers that can
affect recruitment and retention of veterinarians engaged in public health practice.
Next steps should include replicating project efforts among a national sample of
public health veterinarians. A committed and determined long-term effort might be
required to sustain initiatives and policy proposals to increase U.S. veterinary
public health capacity.<component x="231.0" y="222.17" width="344.43" height="353.15"

lateness="0.2857142857142857" reference_score="9.5">Effective public health systems
require an interdisciplinary approach to public health disease surveillance,
prevention, and control. Given that approximately 75% of emerging human infectious
diseases are 1 zoonosis-related, veterinarians are critical partners when addressing
public health challenges, especially considering emerging pathogens that might have a
zoonotic component (e.g., avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and
Ebola hemorrhagic 2,3 fever). Veterinarians in state, federal, and uniformed services
often fill these roles; in 2006, a total of 3,312 (3.9%) of 84,946 U.S. veterinarians
were employed in public health (i.e., government and uniformed service 4 employees).
Although veterinarians engaged in public health activities traditionally have worked
in a regulatory capacity on animal health problems affecting agriculture, plant and
animal health, human and animal food safety, biologic and homeland security, and
wildlife and 3 zoonotic disease prevention and control, others have sought to work in
applied public health roles usually associated with medical doctors, nurses, and
people trained in epidemiology. In addition, veterinarians in public health careers
have not limited themselves to the zoonotic pathogens and often apply their
population medicine knowledge to other roles of human disease or injury prevention
and control, environmental health, and vaccine-preventable diseases. A 2006 report by
the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC) identified a shortage
of &#xE024;1,500 veterinarians fulfilling public health responsibilities; by 2020,
this shortage is expected to 5 increase tenfold. The 2007-2008 Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) Preventive Medicine Fellows (PMFs) conducted a
veterinary public health workforce focus group project by using the community
mobilization and group facilitation skills learned in the 6 PMF training program. The
objective of this project was to gain insight into key areas of recruitment and
retention that might reduce the national shortage of public health veterinarians.
METHODS The PMFs conducted a focus group by using a struc7,8 Particitured community
intervention technique. pants were recruited for the focus group and a Sur&#x2122;9
veyMonkey questionnaire was disseminated through the 2008 U.S. Public Health Service
(PHS) and civilian CDC veterinary electronic mailing lists. Participants were asked
to complete the survey within two weeks and before the focus group. The survey asked
two open-ended questions about the nation's veterinary public health workforce (i.e.,
veterinarians working in both federal and nonfederal public health roles): ( ) 1 What
specific problems does CDC face when actively developing the veterinary public health
workforce? and ( ) What specific problems does CDC face when 2 supporting
veterinarians engaged in public health practice? Participants could list up to three
problems, which were considered unique responses, for each of the two questions. PMFs
reviewed the survey responses from each of the two questions and classified responses
for each question into themes before conducting the focus group. Focus group
participants prioritized each theme from &#xE035; &#xE035; 1 least important to 5
most important. PMFs used the weighted categorized results to assess national
veterinary public health workforce problems pertaining to recruitment (Question 1)
and retention (Question 2); &#xAE; &#xAE; all analyses were performed using Microsoft
Excel . To address the top three ranked categories for Question 1 (recruitment),
focus group participants were asked to identify activities by using an ecologic model
flow diagram at the individual, agency, veterinary community, and policy levels. The
flow diagram was designed on the basis of the ecologic model framework to identify
action steps during public health community 8,9 intervention processes (Figure).
Activities at each of the higher levels (agency, veterinary community, and policy)
were used to address the intervening concerns at that level that might prevent the
main goal from being achieved. An example of an intervening factor is when an agency
goal is to increase veterinary pay after completion of five years in the workforce,
but a conflicting agency policy prevents the stated pay increase. Because of time
constraints, focus group participants did not fully develop the ecologic model flow
diagram to address priorities identified in response to retention (Question 2);
therefore, these priorities are not described in this article. RESULTS Twenty-six
(29%) of 91 CDC veterinarians participated in the project. Nineteen CDC veterinarians
participated in the survey, 20 participated in the focus group, and 13 participated
in both. For Question 1 (recruitment), we classified the 26 unique responses into one
of eight themes based on participant responses, as follows: awareness of veterinary
contributions to public health, interest in government work, employment and training
opportunities, a clear mechanism to identify jobs, loan programs supporting public
health careers, a career ladder for those employed, career pathways in veterinary
schools, and competitive salaries. In<component x="75.0" y="236.46" width="237.58"

(recruitment), focus group participants identified the top three problems faced when
addressing this question-lack of awareness of the veterinary contribution to public
health, lack of competitive salaries, and lack of employment and training
opportunities (Table 1). Similarly, for Question 2 (retention), we classified the 22
unique responses into one of six themes, as follows: recognition of veterinary
qualifications in public health, seamless integration of veterinary and human public
health, adequate funding for and availability of positions, adequate advanced
training, competitive salaries, and retention of existing federal veterinarians. In
response to Question 2 (retention), focus group participants identified the top three
problems faced when addressing this question-lack of recognition of veterinary
qualifications in public health, lack of competitive salaries, and lack of seamless
integration of veterinary and human public health (Table 1). Related to the top three
identified priorities for Question 1 (recruitment), participants identified
activities at the individual (I), agency (A), veterinary community (VC), and policy
(P) levels. To improve awareness of the veterinary contribution to public health, at
least one key activity was identified at each level above individual, including
increasing opportunities for veterinarians (A); educating veterinarians and other
public health practitioners on veterinary contributions (A, VC); engaging the
veterinary community in educating the public health workforce on the role of
veterinarians (A, VC); and gearing veterinary school programs toward support of
public health careers and activities (VC). To improve employment and training
opportunities, key activities identified included increasing the number of trainees
in existing CDC programs (A), increasing the number of career advancement programs
and guidance for veterinarians (A), identifying public health champions at each of
the veterinary colleges (VC), and identifying more opportunities for veterinarians
(VC). To improve the salaries of veterinarians in public health positions, key
activities identified included obtaining agency support for parity in pay with other
doctors of medicine (A), working across civilian and military personnel systems to
achieve parity in pay for veterinarians (VC), and obtaining support from the U.S.
Congress to increase pay for veterinarians in federal service (P). DISCUSSION Policy
proposals that improve training opportunities for veterinarians in public health,
increase pay, and support integration of human and veterinary public health might
have the greatest impact on reducing the national shortage of public health
veterinarians. Policies that increase the number of veterinarians engaged in existing
or new training programs are needed to expand the veterinary public health workforce.
Federal agencies offer limited public health training for veterinarians, which alone
might not be sufficient to improve the deficiency in the veterinary public health
workforce. For example, veterinarians compete and are selected by CDC to participate
in the CDC Epidemic 6,10 Intelligence Service (EIS) and PMF programs. According to
the CDC EIS Program Director, the EIS program trained an average of seven
veterinarians annually during 1990-2008 (Personal communication, Douglas H. Hamilton,
CDC, September 2010). During that same time frame, after completion of EIS, zero to
three veterinarians were trained each year in the PMF program. Even if the EIS
program trained veterinarians<component x="81.0" y="92.46" width="236.71"

health experience. With veterinary school tuition often higher than medical school
tuition (yearly median tuition was $22,761 and $20,135 for veterinary school tuition
and medical school, respectively, for in-state residents during 2008-2009)
(Unpublished data, AAVMC comparative 12 data report, 2008), and with starting
salaries substantially lower than those of physicians, veterinarians might not be
able to afford to pursue a public health career without added incentives. The average
educational debt among graduates from veterinary medical school 13 was $129,976 in
2009, an 8.5% increase from 2008. Increasing pay can reduce this additional financial
burden and make public health positions more accessible for veterinarians. PHS
veterinary officers are eligible to receive minimal additional pays (i.e., $266-$308
per month for board certification and $100 per month special pay). The special pay
for PHS veterinary officers has not increased since it was established for unified
14,15 service veterinarians in 1949. Even when employed by the same agency and
filling an equivalent position as PHS medical officers (i.e., physicians), PHS
veterinary officers are ineligible for special pays that might be used as a
recruitment and retention tool among veterinarians. These special pays include
variable special pay, incentive special pay, multiyear retention bonuses, 15,16 and
retention special pays. In 2011, considering the maximum of all special pays and
allowances available for a PHS officer board-certified in preventive medicine
(employed in a position not requiring direct patient care) at the O-4 (i.e.,
Lieutenant Commander, which might be comparable to a person holding a GS-12 or GS-13
position) temporary rank with five years of credit based on base pay and creditable
service entry dates, living in Atlanta, Georgia, with dependents, the veterinary
officer earned an annual salary of approximately $90,332 and the medical officer
earned approximately $167,632 (Table&#xA0;2). Similarly, among O-6 (i.e., Captain,
which might be comparable to a person holding a GS-14 or GS-15 position) temporary
ranked preventive medicine board-certified officers with the same duty station and
dependent status who have 10 years of credit based on base pay and creditable service
entry dates, approximate annual salaries were $116,673 for the veterinary officer and
$200,473 for the medical officer (Table 2). In these examples, the pay differentials
between the veterinary and medical officers are primarily attributable to the maximum
variable special pay, incentive special pay, multiyear retention bonus, and retention
special pay for medical officers, which totaled $77,000 for those with five years of
creditable service and $84,000 for those with 10 years of creditable service. PHS pay
for veterinarians is not competitive with other employment opportunities. According
to the American Veterinary Medical Association, in 2007 the median income among
private veterinary practitioners was $91,000; among board-certified veterinary
specialists in private practice, the median income was $167,862; and among
veterinarians in public or cor17 porate practice, the median income was $140,893.
During 2009, starting salaries among public-corporate sector veterinarians decreased
7.3%, compared with a 6.0% increase among veterinarians employed in 13 private
practice. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Defense increased the pay (maximum of
$16,000/ year in additional special pays effective October 2009) 18 for active-duty
veterinary officers. Expanding recognition of veterinarians' c ontribution to public
health can create interest in and improve the number of veterinarians serving in
public health positions. Advocating veterinarians' abilities can raise their profile,
broaden the range of positions open to veterinarians, and change attitudes about what
should be considered appropriate professional work for a veterinarian, expanding
commonly held beliefs. Veterinarians often successfully fill nontraditional public
health roles across local, state, and federal agencies. For example, veterinarians
have served as the state epidemiologist for Georgia and as acting U.S. 3 Surgeon
General. Conversely, veterinarians with the requisite training and experience have
been limited in the types of positions for which they are allowed to apply. For
instance, veterinarians are excluded from applying to federal public health positions
not requiring direct human patient care (e.g., epidemiologist) &#xAE;19 listed on
USAJobs under the General Schedule 600 series (human medical). Focus group
participants recommended advocacy efforts at the national level to ensure that hiring
efforts allow for veterinarian employment in public health positions not requiring
direct patient care. Results from this focus group demonstrate that more appreciation
and understanding of the roles public health veterinarians fill can help expand
veterinary public health capacity. Increasing recognition by prospective veterinary
students that career options exist beyond the traditional confines of private
clinical practice can make a veterinary career more attractive to those who otherwise
might select different professional training. Raising the public profile of
veterinarians can serve dual objectives identified by this focus group, such as
reducing barriers and developing and increasing the veterinary public health
workforce (i.e., the need for recruiting new candidates to address the growing need
for public health veterinarians and concurrently improving the lack of awareness of
the veterinary contribution to public health). state-employed veterinarians might
have resulted in different concerns and additional proposals. On the basis of
anecdotal information from project participants, however, we are confident that this
project identified key problems that can be identified if repeated in another venue.
Third, demographic and experience data were not collected; therefore, we were unable
to stratify concerns identified by number of years and types of experience. However,
project participants represented veterinarians &#xE02C; &#xE02E; with 5 and 15 years
of public health experience, veterinarians with experience working for other federal
agencies (e.g., the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety Inspection Service),
and veterinarians employed by the PHS and civil service. CONCLUSIONS The goal of this
pilot project was to identify concerns and potential policy strategies to address the
U.S. veterinary public health capacity shortage. Despite the limited number of
participants and the need for additional studies with a broader audience, this
project identified key problems that are likely to be voiced by veterinarians at all
levels of public health employment (e.g., local, state, and federal). Results from
this project can serve as a platform for change and a base on which future projects
and initiatives can be built; engaging the general public, policy makers, and
government management officials will be required to address the identified concerns.
For example, this article might help influence policy makers to increase pay for
public health veterinarians by using mechanisms that have been established for the
U.S. Department of 18 Defense or to establish mechanisms to recruit and retain
veterinarians in the PHS similar to what has 16 been established for physicians. A
committed and determined long-term effort will be required to sustain initiatives and
policy proposals needed to increase the U.S. veterinary public health
capacity.<component x="333.0" y="90.28" width="237.47" height="107.78" page="4"
