ABSTRACT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992791884615385">
Objectives. In 2006, the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges
reported that the shortage (1,500) of public health veterinarians is expected
to increase tenfold by 2020. In 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) Preventive Medicine Fellows conducted a pilot project
among CDC veterinarians to identify national veterinary public health workforce
concerns and potential policy strategies.
Methods. Fellows surveyed a convenience sample (19/91) of public health
veterinarians at CDC to identify veterinary workforce recruitment and retention
problems faced by federal agencies; responses were categorized into themes.
A focus group (20/91) of staff veterinarians subsequently prioritized the categorized themes from least to most important. Participants identified activities to
address the three recruitment concerns with the highest combined weight.
Results. Participants identified the following three highest prioritized problems
faced by federal agencies when recruiting veterinarians to public health: (1)
lack of awareness of veterinarians’ contributions to public health practice,
(2) competitive salaries, and (3) employment and training opportunities.
Similarly, key concerns identified regarding retention of public health practice
veterinarians included: (1) lack of recognition of veterinary qualifications, (2)
competitive salaries, and (3) seamless integration of veterinary and human
public health.
Conclusions. Findings identified multiple barriers that can affect recruitment
and retention of veterinarians engaged in public health practice. Next steps
should include replicating project efforts among a national sample of public
health veterinarians. A committed and determined long-term effort might be
required to sustain initiatives and policy proposals to increase U.S. veterinary
public health capacity.

prevention, and control. Given that approximately
75% of emerging human infectious diseases are
zoonosis-related,1 veterinarians are critical partners
when addressing public health challenges, especially
considering emerging pathogens that might have a
zoonotic component (e.g., avian influenza, severe
acute respiratory syndrome, and Ebola hemorrhagic
fever).2,3 Veterinarians in state, federal, and uniformed
services often fill these roles; in 2006, a total of 3,312
(3.9%) of 84,946 U.S. veterinarians were employed in
public health (i.e., government and uniformed service
employees).4
Although veterinarians engaged in public health
activities traditionally have worked in a regulatory
capacity on animal health problems affecting agriculture, plant and animal health, human and animal food
safety, biologic and homeland security, and wildlife and
zoonotic disease prevention and control,3 others have
sought to work in applied public health roles usually
associated with medical doctors, nurses, and people
trained in epidemiology. In addition, veterinarians in
public health careers have not limited themselves to the
zoonotic pathogens and often apply their population
medicine knowledge to other roles of human disease or
injury prevention and control, environmental health,
and vaccine-preventable diseases.
A 2006 report by the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC) identified a shortage of 1,500 veterinarians fulfilling public health
responsibilities; by 2020, this shortage is expected to
increase tenfold.5 The 2007–2008 Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) Preventive Medicine
Fellows (PMFs) conducted a veterinary public health
workforce focus group project by using the community
mobilization and group facilitation skills learned in the
PMF training program.6 The objective of this project
was to gain insight into key areas of recruitment and
retention that might reduce the national shortage of
public health veterinarians.

METHODS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999702571428571">
The PMFs conducted a focus group by using a structured community intervention technique.7,8 Participants were recruited for the focus group and a SurveyMonkey™9 questionnaire was disseminated through
the 2008 U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) and civilian
CDC veterinary electronic mailing lists. Participants
were asked to complete the survey within two weeks
and before the focus group. The survey asked two
open-ended questions about the nation’s veterinary
public health workforce (i.e., veterinarians working in
both federal and nonfederal public health roles): (1)
What specific problems does CDC face when actively
developing the veterinary public health workforce?
and (2) What specific problems does CDC face when
supporting veterinarians engaged in public health
practice? Participants could list up to three problems,
which were considered unique responses, for each of
the two questions.
PMFs reviewed the survey responses from each of the
two questions and classified responses for each question into themes before conducting the focus group.
Focus group participants prioritized each theme from
1least important to 5most important. PMFs used
the weighted categorized results to assess national veterinary public health workforce problems pertaining to
recruitment (Question 1) and retention (Question 2);
all analyses were performed using Microsoft® Excel®.
To address the top three ranked categories for
Question 1 (recruitment), focus group participants
were asked to identify activities by using an ecologic
model flow diagram at the individual, agency, veterinary
community, and policy levels. The flow diagram was
designed on the basis of the ecologic model framework
to identify action steps during public health community
intervention processes (Figure).8,9 Activities at each of
the higher levels (agency, veterinary community, and
policy) were used to address the intervening concerns
at that level that might prevent the main goal from
being achieved. An example of an intervening factor
is when an agency goal is to increase veterinary pay
after completion of five years in the workforce, but
a conflicting agency policy prevents the stated pay
increase. Because of time constraints, focus group
participants did not fully develop the ecologic model
flow diagram to address priorities identified in response
to retention (Question 2); therefore, these priorities
are not described in this article.

Twenty-six (29%) of 91 CDC veterinarians participated

13 participated in both. For Question 1 (recruitment),

eight themes based on participant responses, as follows: awareness of veterinary contributions to public

response to Question 1 (recruitment), focus group
participants identified the top three problems faced
when addressing this question—lack of awareness of
the veterinary contribution to public health, lack of
competitive salaries, and lack of employment and
training opportunities (Table 1).
Similarly, for Question 2 (retention), we classified
the 22 unique responses into one of six themes, as follows: recognition of veterinary qualifications in public
health, seamless integration of veterinary and human
public health, adequate funding for and availability
of positions, adequate advanced training, competitive
salaries, and retention of existing federal veterinarians.
In response to Question 2 (retention), focus group
participants identified the top three problems faced
when addressing this question—lack of recognition
of veterinary qualifications in public health, lack of
competitive salaries, and lack of seamless integration
of veterinary and human public health (Table 1).
Related to the top three identified priorities for
Question 1 (recruitment), participants identified
activities at the individual (I), agency (A), veterinary
community (VC), and policy (P) levels. To improve
awareness of the veterinary contribution to public
health, at least one key activity was identified at each
level above individual, including increasing opportunities for veterinarians (A); educating veterinarians and
other public health practitioners on veterinary contributions (A, VC); engaging the veterinary community
in educating the public health workforce on the role
of veterinarians (A, VC); and gearing veterinary school
programs toward support of public health careers and
activities (VC).
To improve employment and training opportunities,
key activities identified included increasing the number
of trainees in existing CDC programs (A), increasing
the number of career advancement programs and guidance for veterinarians (A), identifying public health
champions at each of the veterinary colleges (VC),
and identifying more opportunities for veterinarians
(VC). To improve the salaries of veterinarians in public health positions, key activities identified included
obtaining agency support for parity in pay with other
doctors of medicine (A), working across civilian and
military personnel systems to achieve parity in pay
for veterinarians (VC), and obtaining support from
the U.S. Congress to increase pay for veterinarians in
federal service (P).

DISCUSSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989836">
Policy proposals that improve training opportunities
for veterinarians in public health, increase pay, and
support integration of human and veterinary public
health might have the greatest impact on reducing the
national shortage of public health veterinarians. Policies that increase the number of veterinarians engaged
in existing or new training programs are needed to
expand the veterinary public health workforce.
Federal agencies offer limited public health training
for veterinarians, which alone might not be sufficient to
improve the deficiency in the veterinary public health
workforce. For example, veterinarians compete and are
selected by CDC to participate in the CDC Epidemic
Intelligence Service (EIS) and PMF programs. 6,10
According to the CDC EIS Program Director, the EIS
program trained an average of seven veterinarians
annually during 1990–2008 (Personal communication,
Douglas H. Hamilton, CDC, September 2010). During
that same time frame, after completion of EIS, zero to
three veterinarians were trained each year in the PMF
program. Even if the EIS program trained veterinarians

exclusively (i.e., 80 veterinarians per year), the number
would be insufficient to address the country’s ongoing
and anticipated veterinary public health needs.7
Veterinarians might also be required to obtain additional education at substantial expense before being
considered for a federal public health position. For
example, before applying to the CDC EIS program,
veterinarians are required to hold either a master
of public health degree or an equivalent degree, or
demonstrate prior public health experience.10,11 With
veterinary school tuition often higher than medical
school tuition (yearly median tuition was $22,761
and $20,135 for veterinary school tuition and medical school, respectively, for in-state residents during
2008–2009) (Unpublished data, AAVMC comparative
data report, 2008),12 and with starting salaries substantially lower than those of physicians, veterinarians might
not be able to afford to pursue a public health career

without added incentives. The average educational
debt among graduates from veterinary medical school
was $129,976 in 2009, an 8.5% increase from 2008.13
Increasing pay can reduce this additional financial
burden and make public health positions more accessible for veterinarians. PHS veterinary officers are eligible to receive minimal additional pays (i.e., $266–$308
per month for board certification and $100 per month
special pay). The special pay for PHS veterinary officers
has not increased since it was established for unified
service veterinarians in 1949.14,15 Even when employed
by the same agency and filling an equivalent position as
PHS medical officers (i.e., physicians), PHS veterinary
officers are ineligible for special pays that might be
used as a recruitment and retention tool among veterinarians. These special pays include variable special
pay, incentive special pay, multiyear retention bonuses,
and retention special pays.15,16 In 2011, considering the
maximum of all special pays and allowances available
for a PHS officer board-certified in preventive medicine
(employed in a position not requiring direct patient
care) at the O-4 (i.e., Lieutenant Commander, which
might be comparable to a person holding a GS-12 or
GS-13 position) temporary rank with five years of credit
based on base pay and creditable service entry dates,
living in Atlanta, Georgia, with dependents, the veterinary officer earned an annual salary of approximately
$90,332 and the medical officer earned approximately
$167,632 (Table 2). Similarly, among O-6 (i.e., Captain,
which might be comparable to a person holding a
GS-14 or GS-15 position) temporary ranked preventive
medicine board-certified officers with the same duty
station and dependent status who have 10 years of
credit based on base pay and creditable service entry
dates, approximate annual salaries were $116,673 for
the veterinary officer and $200,473 for the medical
officer (Table 2). In these examples, the pay differentials between the veterinary and medical officers are
primarily attributable to the maximum variable special
pay, incentive special pay, multiyear retention bonus,
and retention special pay for medical officers, which
totaled $77,000 for those with five years of creditable
service and $84,000 for those with 10 years of creditable service.
PHS pay for veterinarians is not competitive with
other employment opportunities. According to the
American Veterinary Medical Association, in 2007 the
median income among private veterinary practitioners was $91,000; among board-certified veterinary
specialists in private practice, the median income was
$167,862; and among veterinarians in public or corporate practice, the median income was $140,893.17
During 2009, starting salaries among public-corporate
sector veterinarians decreased 7.3%, compared with
a 6.0% increase among veterinarians employed in
private practice.13 Furthermore, the U.S. Department
of Defense increased the pay (maximum of $16,000/
year in additional special pays effective October 2009)
for active-duty veterinary officers.18

to public health can create interest in and improve
the number of veterinarians serving in public health
positions. Advocating veterinarians’ abilities can raise
their profile, broaden the range of positions open
to veterinarians, and change attitudes about what
should be considered appropriate professional work
for a veterinarian, expanding commonly held beliefs.
Veterinarians often successfully fill nontraditional
public health roles across local, state, and federal
agencies. For example, veterinarians have served as
the state epidemiologist for Georgia and as acting U.S.
Surgeon General.3 Conversely, veterinarians with the
requisite training and experience have been limited
in the types of positions for which they are allowed to
apply. For instance, veterinarians are excluded from
applying to federal public health positions not requiring direct human patient care (e.g., epidemiologist)
listed on USAJobs®19 under the General Schedule 600
series (human medical). Focus group participants
recommended advocacy efforts at the national level
to ensure that hiring efforts allow for veterinarian
employment in public health positions not requiring
direct patient care.
Results from this focus group demonstrate that
more appreciation and understanding of the roles
public health veterinarians fill can help expand veterinary public health capacity. Increasing recognition
by prospective veterinary students that career options
exist beyond the traditional confines of private clinical
practice can make a veterinary career more attractive
to those who otherwise might select different professional training. Raising the public profile of veterinarians can serve dual objectives identified by this focus
group, such as reducing barriers and developing and
increasing the veterinary public health workforce (i.e.,
the need for recruiting new candidates to address
the growing need for public health veterinarians and
concurrently improving the lack of awareness of the
veterinary contribution to public health).
Limitations
There were three main limitations in this study. First,
we were unable to fully develop the ecologic models
because the focus group activities were limited to one
2.5-hour session. Despite this constraint, we believe
that this project identified key problems that have been
voiced anecdotally by other veterinarians employed in
public health.
Second, this project was conducted only among a
limited number of veterinarians living in Atlanta who
were employed by CDC. Feedback from additional CDC
veterinarians, veterinarians at other federal agencies,
federal veterinarians who are assigned to states, and
state-employed veterinarians might have resulted in different concerns and additional proposals. On the basis
of anecdotal information from project participants,
however, we are confident that this project identified
key problems that can be identified if repeated in
another venue.
Third, demographic and experience data were not
collected; therefore, we were unable to stratify concerns
identified by number of years and types of experience.
However, project participants represented veterinarians
with 5 and 15 years of public health experience,
veterinarians with experience working for other federal
agencies (e.g., the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food
Safety Inspection Service), and veterinarians employed
by the PHS and civil service.

CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982575541666667">
The goal of this pilot project was to identify concerns
and potential policy strategies to address the U.S.
veterinary public health capacity shortage. Despite
the limited number of participants and the need
for additional studies with a broader audience, this
project identified key problems that are likely to be
voiced by veterinarians at all levels of public health
employment (e.g., local, state, and federal). Results
from this project can serve as a platform for change
and a base on which future projects and initiatives can
be built; engaging the general public, policy makers,
and government management officials will be required
to address the identified concerns. For example, this
article might help influence policy makers to increase
pay for public health veterinarians by using mechanisms
that have been established for the U.S. Department of
Defense18 or to establish mechanisms to recruit and
retain veterinarians in the PHS similar to what has
been established for physicians.16 A committed and
determined long-term effort will be required to sustain
initiatives and policy proposals needed to increase the
U.S. veterinary public health capacity.

A focus group (20/91) of staff veterinarians subsequently prioritized the categorized themes from least to most important. Participants identified activities to address the three recruitment concerns with the highest combined weight. Results. Participants identified the following three highest prioritized problems faced by federal agencies when recruiting veterinarians to public health: (1) lack of awareness of veterinarians’ contributions to public health practice, (2) competitive salaries, and (3) employment and training opportunities. Similarly, key concerns identified regarding retention of public health practice veterinarians included: (1) lack of recognition of veterinary qualifications, (2) competitive salaries, and (3) seamless integration of veterinary and human public health.

METHODS The PMFs conducted a focus group by using a structured community intervention technique.7,8 Participants were recruited for the focus group and a SurveyMonkey™9 questionnaire was disseminated through the 2008 U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) and civilian CDC veterinary electronic mailing lists. Participants were asked to complete the survey within two weeks and before the focus group. The survey asked two open-ended questions about the nation’s veterinary public health workforce (i.e., veterinarians working in both federal and nonfederal public health roles): (1) What specific problems does CDC face when actively developing the veterinary public health workforce? and (2) What specific problems does CDC face when supporting veterinarians engaged in public health practice? Participants could list up to three problems, which were considered unique responses, for each of the two questions. PMFs reviewed the survey responses from each of the two questions and classified responses for each question into themes before conducting the focus group.
