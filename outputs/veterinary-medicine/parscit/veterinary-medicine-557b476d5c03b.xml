Received 16 September 2010; returned 26 October 2010; revised 22 December 2010; accepted 23 December 2010
Objectives: To describe the use of antimicrobials in a veterinary teaching hospital for companion animals in
Italy, with particular regard to the agreement with recommendations of prudent use
Methods: The study was conducted with a retrospective, cross-sectional design. The population under investigation included 18905 cats and dogs that were referred to the hospital between 2000 and 2007. Two different
samples of the clinical paper forms were randomly selected to estimate the prevalence of animals receiving an
antimicrobial prescription and to describe the pattern of antimicrobials used in relation to the condition being
treated. The proportion of antimicrobials prescribed accomplishing recommendations of prudent use was also
estimated, as well as the level of agreement with specific, diagnosis-based guidelines for antimicrobial use.
Results: Broad-spectrum antimicrobials, including penicillins with b-lactamase inhibitors, first-generation
cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, were the most frequently prescribed compounds. Antimicrobials prescribed with the support of microbiological analyses and susceptibility testing were less than 5%. Among
the recommendation of prudent use, the availability of information from laboratory testing had the poorest
degree of agreement, while the other evaluated items were accomplished in most of the cases.
Conclusions: Our results highlight the need to improve the procedures of antimicrobial prescription in the study
setting. This can be achieved by supporting the guidance for antimicrobial use at the local level, with the adoption of specific guidelines, and at the national level with a further implementation of the policies of prudent
prescriptions.

Introduction
Over the last several decades antimicrobial resistance has been
considered one of the most relevant issues in public health due
to its dramatic increase worldwide in both pathogenic and commensal bacteria. The relatively scarce availability in recent years
of new antimicrobial drugs has also contributed to increase the
concern.1 The adoption of common and harmonized actions
between countries and between human and animal health has
been claimed, since 1998, as the most effective approach in
facing this global problem.2 In particular, the adoption of policies
of prudent use such as those recommended by the European
Union (EU) in human medicine,3 as well as regulatory actions,
including limiting the use of certain antimicrobials in food
animals, have been seen as effective tools to preserve the efficacy of antimicrobials.
The threat for human health posed by antimicrobial use in
animals arises from the risk of transferring resistant bacteria or
resistance genetic determinants to humans.4 The role of companion animals as potential reservoirs of resistant and multiresistant pathogens for humans has recently received increasing
attention.4 – 7 Companion animals live in close contact with
humans and share with them the environment and exposures
to many sources of pathogens, thus making easy the exchange
of resistant bacteria.4 – 6 Moreover, the uses of antimicrobials in
companion animals and human beings are essentially identical,7
and antimicrobial preparations licensed for human use as well as
compounds of primary importance in the treatment of human
infection are also utilized in dogs and cats.5
The prudent use of antimicrobials has been defined as the
process of reducing the development and spread of antimicrobial

Use of antimicrobials in companion animals in Italy
Methods
Description of the hospital
The University of Pisa (central Italy) hosts one of the 14 schools of
Veterinary Medicine present in Italy (5 in the north, 3 in the centre and
6 in the south, including the islands of Sicily and Sardinia), as well as a
3 year postgraduate school in small animal pathology and clinics. The
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999401440000001">
mean annual number of students who graduate in the school in Pisa is
76, representing 6% of all new graduated veterinarians in Italy.19
The school is organized into three departments and includes a veterinary teaching hospital for companion animals. Activities carried out in
the hospital include all diagnostic, clinical and preventive practices,
including veterinary primary healthcare activities. Twelve practitioners
usually participate in the clinical activities, which also involve the students, who compulsorily perform a training period of 6 months in the
hospital before their graduation. The catchment area of the hospital
includes mainly central Italy, and the hospital serves as the reference
point for other practitioners working nearby. During the study period, a
mean of 2350 dogs and cats per year were newly admitted to the
hospital.
Study design, population under study and sampling
The study was conducted with a retrospective, cross-sectional design.
The population under study included 18905 clinical forms of cats and
dogs that were referred to the hospital between 2000 and 2007.
All the data used in the study were obtained by reviewing the individual standardized clinical paper charts. These were filled in at the time of
the first admittance of the animal to the hospital and included follow-up
information and the results of any other examinations performed in the
hospital. Each clinical chart was progressively identified by a unique
identification code (year –number); the complete list was available in
an electronic archive. In our study, only the information relative to the
examination performed at the first admittance to the hospital was
considered.
Two different samples were randomly selected from the population
using randomly generated numbers: one for the estimation of the proportion of animals with an antimicrobial prescription (prevalence of prescription) and the other to more precisely describe the pattern of
antimicrobials used and to evaluate how they had been prescribed
according to the prudent use recommendations.
An antimicrobial prescription was defined as a unique prescription of
one or more antimicrobial medicinal products issued on the same day by
the veterinarian to treat the condition specified by the diagnosis.
To estimate the prevalence of prescriptions, a sample not smaller
than 897 clinical forms was calculated (expected prevalence, 30%;
maximum allowable error, 3%; confidence level, 95%).
The pattern of use of antimicrobials and how they had been prescribed with respect to the prudent use recommendations were
studied only for the antimicrobials for systemic administration, with
the exclusion of those prescribed in relation to a surgical procedure.
The latter, mainly prescribed for prophylactic purposes, were excluded
from the analysis because they were considered poorly informative
with respect to the criteria adopted in our study for the evaluation
of prudent use. Evaluation of the appropriateness focused, particularly,
on drugs prescribed to treat gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections
(UTIs), respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and pyoderma. The sample
size was, therefore, calculated starting from the minimum required
number of clinical charts with the prescription of systemic antimicrobials for the treatment of gastroenteritis, UTIs, RTIs and pyoderma.
Because these charts accounted for 4.6% of the total clinical paper
charts, as estimated in the first sample, the number needed for this
purpose was 276 (expected proportion of appropriate use, 50%;
maximum allowable error, 5%; confidence level, 95%), leading to a
total sample size of 5804 charts. This would have yielded an expected
number of 871 clinical charts with a prescription of systemic antimicrobials for the treatment of any condition, based on the estimate
obtained in the first sample (15%).
Antimicrobials were described according to the class, the route of
administration and the condition treated. They were categorized based
on the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system,20
implemented in 1976 by the WHO, or the ATC classification system for
veterinary medicinal products,21 and were also ranked by importance
in human medicine according to the FAO/WHO/OIE categorization of Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine.22
Compliance with prudent use recommendations was evaluated for
each antimicrobial using the items included in the guidelines issued by
the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe.9 These were availability of a
diagnosis; availability of microbiological and susceptibility testing; use
of a product approved for the species; respect of the dosage regimen
and duration of treatment; avoidance of the empirical combination of
two or more antimicrobials; and limitation, as much as possible, of the
use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. In particular, for evaluation of
the intake daily dose and the duration of treatment, the criteria were
considered satisfied if the intake daily dose respected the labelled dose
range recommended by the manufacturer (+20%) in the package
leaflet and if the duration of treatment was longer than 5 days. The
intake daily dose was computed in mg/kg by multiplying the quantity
of active compound prescribed times the daily number of administrations, divided by the weight of the animal.
Since the use of antimicrobials should not be evaluated without
taking into account the specific condition being treated, the pharmacological properties of the antimicrobials and the characteristics of the
animals, the diagnosis-based guidelines for antimicrobial use in companion animals, published by Guardabassi et al. 15 in 2008, were used to
evaluate the appropriateness of the compounds prescribed for the treatment of gastroenteritis, UTIs, RTIs and pyoderma. Antimicrobials were,

resistance through the optimal selection of drugs, dosage and
duration of treatment.8 In companion animals, general recommendations of prudent use issued by international scientific
bodies have been only partially implemented in specific regulatory acts, while different guidelines for prudent use in dogs and
cats are available. Most of these are aimed at addressing educational purposes,9 – 13 while others are more practically applicable in field conditions, guiding veterinarians in the treatment
of specific conditions in pets.14 – 16 In Italy, no specific guidelines
for prudent use in companion animals are available and professional guidance for the responsible use of antimicrobials
relies on the best practices addressed by general recommendations of prudent use issued by the Ministry of Health.17
Antimicrobials are prescription-only drugs,18 and although
the regulations in force in both veterinary and human medicine
assign the responsibility of the use of antimicrobials to
prescribing veterinarians or physicians, the general regulatory
framework of prudent use is low and no coordinated national
action plans have been implemented in recent years in veterinary
or human medicine.
Herein we present the results of a retrospective survey on the
use of antimicrobials in dogs and cats in a university teaching
hospital. The aim of the survey was to describe the pattern of
use of antimicrobials with regard to the clinical condition to
treat and evaluate how recommendations of prudent use have
been applied.

therefore, categorized as first choice (could be used empirically, without
the indication of a microbiological examination or susceptibility testing),
second choice (could be used based on a microbiological examination)
and last resort (could be used based on susceptibility testing and only
if no other antimicrobials of the first or second choice could be used).
The use of an antimicrobial was defined as appropriate whenever
all the specific requirements for the class of choice were met and only
if the antimicrobial was not prescribed in an empirical combination
with other antimicrobials. The use of antimicrobials under any other
conditions was considered inappropriate.

Prevalence of antimicrobial prescriptions
The prevalence of antimicrobial prescriptions, as estimated
from the 854 sampled clinical paper charts eventually collected (688 concerning dogs and 166 cats), was 30.6% (95%
CI 27.5% –33.8%). A significantly higher prevalence of prescriptions was found in cats (44.0%, 95% CI 36.3% –51.9%) compared with dogs (27.3%, 95% CI 24.0% – 30.8%). Two
hundred and ninety-three antimicrobials were recorded from
the 261 animals with a prescription. Thirty-one prescriptions
(11.9%) included only topical drugs, 222 prescriptions
(85.1%) included only drugs to be administered systemically
and 8 prescriptions (3.1%) included both. Animals receiving
an antimicrobial prescription in relation to a surgical procedure
were 122 (46.7% of all the prescriptions). These accounted for
the 86.2% of total surgical cases recorded in the sample. The
most frequently prescribed drugs in surgical patients were
amoxicillin/clavulanate (n ¼89) and the association benzylpenicillin/streptomycin (n¼ 15).
Pattern of prescriptions of systemic antimicrobials not
related to surgical procedures
One thousand and two clinical paper charts (747 concerning
dogs and 255 cats) with a prescription of at least a systemic antimicrobial not in relation to a surgical procedure were retrieved
from the 5804 clinical forms sampled to study the pattern of
use of antimicrobials. The total number of antimicrobials
included in the prescriptions was 1071. For 68 animals, a prescription of two or more antimicrobials in an empirical combination was found.

Data entry and data management were carried out using EpiInfo 3.3.2
(CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA). The dataset was validated by checking the
values for consistency, plausibility and coherence. Incorrect values were
classified as ‘missing’.
Categorical variables were described using counts and percentages
with the relative 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Differences in
proportions were assessed for statistical significance by the x2 or
Fisher’s exact test, when needed. The existence of trends in the use of
the antimicrobial classes over the study period was tested by the
Cochrane–Armitage test for linear trend against the null hypothesis
that no association between proportions of antimicrobials used and
years exists. P values ,0.05 were considered statistical significant. All
the statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Thirty-nine different antimicrobials, belonging to 12 pharmacological subgroups, were recorded. Three of these subgroups,
in particular, included the majority of the prescribed antimicrobials: penicillins (n¼ 327); cephalosporins (n¼ 258); and quinolones (n¼ 219). Among the penicillins, penicillins with
b-lactamase inhibitors (n¼ 287) prevailed over extendedspectrum penicillins (n¼ 39). Among cephalosporins, the
first-generation compounds (n¼ 219) were prescribed most
frequently, while fluoroquinolones (n¼ 218) accounted for
almost all the quinolones subgroup.
No significant time trends in the usage of the antimicrobial
pharmacological subgroups were observed over the study
period (Table 1), except for the rarely prescribed intestinal antiinfectives group.
Similarly, no significant differences in the use of the pharmacological subgroups were observed between the two animal
species, with the exception of the first-generation cephalosporins, scarcely employed in cats and frequently used in dogs, and
the spiramycin/metronidazole combination, more frequently
employed in cats (Figure 1).
As far as the clinical conditions were concerned, most antimicrobials were prescribed to treat infections affecting the skin
(23.2%) and the gastrointestinal tract (19.0%), followed by genitourinary (14.0%) and respiratory (13.6%) tract diseases. The
distribution of antimicrobial compounds used for the treatment
of conditions affecting the different systems is reported in

Penicillins were prescribed in similar proportions (over the
20% of cases) for the treatment of all the conditions, but
did not seem to represent the elective compounds for the
treatment of any of them. Conversely, the treatment of skin
and genitourinary tract infections was performed using elective
compounds; first-generation cephalosporins for the treatment
of skin infections and fluoroquinolones for the genitourinary
infections. The treatment of gastrointestinal tract infections
involved 14 pharmaceutical classes, with the three most frequently used antimicrobials (penicillins with b-lactamase
inhibitors, spiramycin/metronidazole and fluoroquinolones) not
exceeding, overall, the 59% of all compounds used to treat
these conditions. It is remarkable that a non-negligible proportion of the antimicrobials used for the treatment of RTIs
(9.7%) were third-generation cephalosporins, an antimicrobial
group considered of highly critical importance in human
medicine. In this respect, of the 1060 antimicrobials that
could be classified according to the FAO/WHO/OIE classification,22 689 and 340 were critically important and highly
important antimicrobials, respectively. Among the critically
important group, 38.3% included compounds of the highest
priority, namely fluoroquinolones (n¼ 218), third-generation
cephalosporins (n¼ 36) and macrolides (n¼9). The use of
critically important antimicrobials predominated in all the
conditions, except in those affecting the skin and the eye
(Figure 2).
Information on the route of administration, available for 802
antimicrobials, showed that the use of products for oral administration (n¼ 690) prevailed over those for parenteral administration (n¼112), and accounted for 90% of the total
antimicrobials prescribed in dogs and 73% of the total antimicrobials prescribed in cats (P,0.001).

classification.
Compliance with prudent use principles
The compliance of the prescriptions with the prudent use recommendations was evaluated for each antimicrobial and the
results are reported in Table 3.
Information on the diagnosis was available for almost all the
antimicrobials, while a high proportion of compounds were prescribed without the support of microbiological analyses or susceptibility tests. Off-label use, with regard to the species, was
reported for a relevant proportion of antimicrobials (23.8%).
Almost all of them were products labelled for human use
(n¼ 234), including first- and second-generation cephalosporins
(n¼ 117), third-generation cephalosporins (n¼ 32) and nitroimidazole derivatives (n¼ 24).
The daily intake dose could be calculated for only 311 of the
1071 antimicrobials (29.0%) due to a lack of information on the
weight of the animal (n¼ 428), strength of the drug (n¼ 461),
number of daily administrations (n¼ 471) and dosage (n¼ 450).
Antimicrobials prescribed in accordance with the dosage indicated by the manufacturer (+20%) were 166 (53.4%).
Information about the duration of the treatment, available for
only 398 antimicrobials, showed that the minimum length of
5 days of treatment was respected in most cases (n¼ 386).
Broad-spectrum antimicrobials were 996, while those with a
restricted or intermediate spectrum of activity accounted for
69 and 1, respectively.
Use of antimicrobials in UTIs, gastroenteritis, pyoderma
and RTIs
A total of 269 antimicrobials were prescribed for the treatment
of UTIs, gastroenteritis, pyoderma and RTIs. Of these, 76
(28.2%) were classified as first choice, 33 (12.2%) as second
choice and 39 (14.5%) as last resort (Table 4). In 121 cases
(45.0%) the prescribed antimicrobial was not listed in any of
the classes of choice provided by the guidelines for the given
species and for the specific condition to treat. Only one and
three of the second-choice and last-resort antimicrobials,
respectively, were supported by laboratory investigations.

This is the first study conducted in Italy aimed at investigating
the use of antimicrobials in companion animals under field conditions and with particular regard to prudent use recommendations. The availability of similar studies in the literature is
limited because either the public health relevance of the antimicrobial resistance in companion animals is often neglected or
proper information enabling a detailed description of the use
of antimicrobials in practice conditions is often missing.
Our study was performed in a university clinical setting, not
only because of the easy availability of clinical information, but

also because we considered it important to evaluate the prescription behaviours of those practitioners who are contributing
to the prescription behaviours of future practitioners. On the
other hand, focusing on such a specific setting implies important
constraints in terms of the representativeness of the study, limiting the possibility of providing a broader picture of antimicrobial
prescription practices in companion animals and in Italy.
Whether our results reflect the behaviours of companion
animal practitioners in prescribing antimicrobials, at the local
or national level, cannot be assessed due to the lack of availability of other information sources, such as quantitative and
qualitative data on antimicrobials consumption.
However, our findings are in agreement with the results of a
nationwide telephone sampling survey performed in Italy in
2006, with the aim to describe, on a self-reported basis, the
behaviours of small animal practitioners in prescribing antimicrobials.23 In particular, both studies highlighted the frequent attitude of veterinarians in using antimicrobials belonging to the
last-generation classes as first-line antimicrobials, in contrast
with the indications of all the available guidelines. From a

public health perspective, this is a critical behaviour, potentially
enabling the emergence and transmission to humans of bacterial clones resistant to the antimicrobials that are considered
of greatest importance in human medicine.
In our study, critically important antimicrobials were the most
frequently prescribed drugs. It is necessary to highlight, however,
that this class includes antimicrobials very commonly used in
companion animal practice, such as penicillins or first-generation
cephalosporins, which are frequently indicated by prescription
guidelines for companion animals as first-line antimicrobials.8,15,16 Penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins were
prescribed in proportions similar to those reported in other
countries.8,24 – 26 Conversely, the use of fluoroquinolones was
much more common than in any other study available in the literature, accounting for 20.4% of total prescriptions. In two
different studies carried out in Finland,24,25 fluoroquinolones represented 3% and 5% of the antimicrobials prescribed in dogs and
cats, respectively. These antimicrobials represented 4.8% of the
compounds used in both these species in a veterinary hospital
in Canada,8 and 1.6% and 3.2% of the antimicrobials administered to dogs and cats, respectively, in a recent survey carried
out in Switzerland.26 Concerns about the extensive use of fluoroquinolones and other critically important drugs, such as thirdgeneration cephalosporins, in companion animals were also
raised by Heuer et al.,27 who underlined the lack of proper policies for antimicrobial use in companion animals compared
with food-producing animals.
In the present study, the frequent use of last-resort and/or
broad-spectrum antimicrobials was associated with a very low
rate of laboratory testing support. As an example, prescriptions
of fluoroquinolones were guided by susceptibility testing in only
3.7% of cases, a proportion not significantly higher compared
with the other antimicrobial groups. Similarly, the recommendation to prescribe last-resort antimicrobials based on susceptibility testing was followed in a very low proportion of cases
with pyoderma, UTIs, gastroenteritis and RTIs. Similar results
had already been reported in Italy by Sala et al.,23 who found
that the attitude of practitioners in not performing susceptibility
testing was associated with a high use of last-resort antimicrobials. It is unclear whether the availability of such molecules,
whose efficacy is expected a priori to be the highest, discourages
practitioners from performing laboratory testing, or rather, the
lack of information on the susceptibility to antimicrobials drives
practitioners to consider the use of such compounds the best

Despite the frequent lack of information on antimicrobial susceptibility testing, in this study, most of the cases of pyoderma
were treated with properly chosen antimicrobials, mainly due
to the frequent use of drugs that fit the guideline requirements.
Conversely, appropriate antimicrobials represented only a small
proportion of those administered in gastroenteritis and RTIs, primarily due to the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in selflimiting infections that rarely require antimicrobial treatment.14
In such cases, the lack of a proper diagnostic approach could
have led to excess use of antimicrobials, which represents a critical issue not only from a public health point of view, but also for
animal welfare.
The frequent use of antimicrobials licensed for human use
represents another critical point of the prescription behaviours
observed in our study, since off-label use of human medicinal
products in animals is one of the most clearly regulated issues
of prudent use. In Italy, as in the EU, the use of antimicrobials
in companion animals is strictly limited to those products
properly authorized to treat specific conditions in the target
species, while the off-label use of products licensed for other
animal species or for the treatment of other conditions in
the same species, or for human use, is only allowed whenever
no authorized products or alternative antimicrobials for veterinary use are available, by way of exception and under the
direct personal responsibility of the prescribing veterinarian.18,28,29 Unfortunately no information on the reasons why
human antimicrobials were so frequently prescribed was available in our study. However, it cannot be excluded that, for the
same antimicrobial compound, the lower cost of products for
human use compared with those for veterinary use may
have played a role.
In conclusion, the need to strengthen the professional
guidance of prudent prescription is clearly pointed out by the
results of our study. At the local level, the development of
hospital guidelines for the stewardship of antimicrobials has
been reported to be effective,8 especially in supporting the
choice of antimicrobials for empirical use. In any case, the
adoption of a full diagnostic approach, including laboratory
testing, represents a crucial step that will help in preventing
excess use or facilitate the use of specific guidelines for
prudent prescription. Further support for prudent use, even at
the local level, would arise from the implementation of stronger policies governing antimicrobial use at the national level,
considering the current poor regulatory framework in force in
Italy and the lack of specific strategies supporting the
prudent use of antimicrobials in both companion animals
and human medicine.
