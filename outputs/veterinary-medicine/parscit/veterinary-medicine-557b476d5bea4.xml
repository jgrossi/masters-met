Sexual selection research has always been a subject for debate. Much of the criticism has concerned the
imposition of conventional sex roles based on an anthropomorphic view of animals imposed by the
researcher. This conventional view may have hampered research, for example from acknowledging male
mate choice. Sexual conﬂict theory is a fast-growing research ﬁeld, which initially stems from sexual
selection research. We investigated how the sexes are described in sexual conﬂict research and what
characteristics they are assigned. We assessed these topics with literature studies of (1) the terminology
used and (2) what parameters are incorporated in sexual conﬂict models. We found that males and
females are consequently described with different words, which have different connotations regarding
activity in the conﬂict. Furthermore, theoretical models mainly investigate conﬂict costs for females,
although costs for both sexes are necessary for coevolutionary dynamics. We argue that sexual conﬂict
research uses stereotypic characterizations of the sexes, where males are active and females reactive.
Thus, previous discussions on the use of anthropomorphic terms in sexual selection seem not to have had
any impact on sexual conﬂict research, which is why the topic of stereotyping the sexes is still of current
importance. We suggest that scientiﬁc gains can be made by eliminating a sex-stereotyped perspective.

Sexual selection research has contributed to important insights
in evolutionary research, but has also been subjected to controversy and debate since Darwin (1871). Much of the debate has been
devoted to the relative importance and degree of sexual selection in
the two sexes (Brown Blackwell 1875 cited in Fausto-Sterling 1997;
Gowaty 1997; Clutton-Brock 2007), of which much may stem from
the fact that we, as researchers, have a preconceived view of how
the sexes should act. In recent years, several authors have pointed
at weaknesses and misinterpretations in the theory of sexual
selection (Clutton-Brock 2007; Snyder &amp; Gowaty 2007; Kokko &amp;
Jennions 2008; Roughgarden &amp; Akçay 2010), mainly concerning
the use of sex roles and how they are assigned. Well-known
examples include the common extrapolation from anisogamy to
sex roles stemming from Trivers (1972) (Gowaty 1997; TangMartinez 1997), the overreliance on Bateman’s principle as an

(OSR) rather than both OSR and adult sex ratio (ASR) when determining sex roles (Kokko &amp; Jennions 2008). Other authors have

criticized sexual selection theory from other viewpoints, namely
the language used, both for stereotypic description of the sexes, for
example coy females (Hrdy 1986; Martin 1991; Fox Keller 2004),
and for using anthropomorphic terms with provocative connotations, for example rape (Gowaty 1982).
Accumulated evidence from different taxa shows a more diverse
nature of the sexes than traditionally thought, through male mate
choice (reviewed in Bonduriansky 2001; Hill 1993; Amundsen et al.
1997; Gowaty et al. 2003; Bel-Venner et al. 2008; Härdling et al.
2008; Bonduriansky 2009), female competition (e.g. Kempenaers
1994; Slagsvold &amp; Lifjeld 1994; Sandell &amp; Smith 1996; Rosvall
2008; Rillich et al. 2009) and species with mutual mate choice
(Jones &amp; Hunter 1993; Gowaty et al. 2002; Forsgren et al. 2004;
modelled in Bergstrom &amp; Real 2000). For example, which sex is
predominantly competitive does not determine whether that sex
discriminates between mates, as both sexes can be simultaneously
competitive and choosy (Berglund et al. 2005). The use of
conventional sex roles and anthropomorphic interpretations may
in fact have affected sexual selection research by delaying the
realization and acceptance of female cryptic choice (Birkhead &amp;
Pizzari 2002). In international workshops it has therefore been
suggested to look beyond conventional sex roles (Cunningham &amp;
Birkhead 1997; Kvarnemo et al. 2009), and proposals have been
made on how to overcome the biased research tradition (e.g.
Gowaty &amp; Hubbell 2005; Kokko &amp; Jennions 2008). However, the
debate has not yet addressed sexual conﬂict studies, although

sexual conﬂict theory emerged from sexual selection (reviewed in
Bonduriansky 2009).
The novelty in sexual conﬂict theory lies within the sexually
antagonistic selection (Parker 1979) rather than selection through
mutual beneﬁts as in classic sexual selection theory (Darwin 1871;
Andersson 1994). That is, in a sexual conﬂict the sexes’ selection
gradients are opposing. This means that a given trait may be
selected for in one direction for males and in another for females.
Previously, the focus of sexual selection research was on how
variance in male reproductive success is generated (Shuster &amp;
Wade 2003), via both male competition and female choice. With
the advent of sexual conﬂict research, the focus has shifted towards
female costs of reproduction and how both sexes strive to reach
their ﬁtness interests.
In this review, we explore sexual conﬂict in the frame of the
insights of stereotyping in sexual selection research. Ideas on what
sex roles encompass may have the capacity to affect how research is
carried out; thus a continued use of conventional sex roles may
hamper research by limiting the potential research questions. This
is the ﬁrst study to address how sexual conﬂict theory has been
conceptualized with regard to sex roles. To identify whether and to
what extent sexual conﬂict research reﬂects conventional sex roles,
and whether this affects research, we performed two literature
searches. In the ﬁrst, we focused on the terminology describing
sexually antagonistic traits. This allowed us to contrast differences
in how the sexes are described. If the previous discussion of
stereotyped terminology in sexual selection research is acknowledged, we would expect to ﬁnd neutral or nonsex-speciﬁc terms. In
the second literature search, we explored which parameters are
taken into account in sexual conﬂict models, because only the
parameters that are included will be considered as important for
the conﬂict’s outcome. If sexual conﬂict research makes use of
stereotyped sex roles we would expect to ﬁnd a consistent pattern
throughout both terminology and theoretical models where
distinct words and characters are assigned to the sexes, and where
these words and characters imply active males and passive females.

Sexual Conﬂict Terminology: Methods and Results
Sexual conﬂict researchers have utilized several terms illustrating how males and females respond to each other during
a sexual conﬂict (e.g. ‘arms race’, ‘battle of the sexes’, ‘tug of war’),
and have also coined terms describing the sexually antagonistic
traits. By examining the 30 most cited studies that included the
keyword ‘sexual conﬂict’ in Web of Science (28 May 2009, including
reviews, empirical and theoretical studies), we assessed which
terms are most used (see Appendix for references). The citation
range for the 30 studies was 90e390. Of the 30 studies, 23 used
terms describing sexually antagonistic traits and altogether we
found 17 different terms for males and 11 for females (Fig. 1). The
empirical studies used fewer terms (nine in a total of 10 articles)
compared to the reviews (21 in a total of 12 articles) and the model
papers (16 in a total of eight articles). The terms describing sexually
antagonistic traits were highly sex speciﬁc. Some examples are, for
males, harassment, manipulation, coercion, persistence and adaptation, and, for females, resistance, avoidance, counteradaptation,
reluctance and reduction (see Fig. 1). By categorizing each trait as
active, as reactive or as neutral we could quantify the difference (see
Fig. 1 for categorization of terms). By ‘reactive’ we mean that the
trait is a response to another act, and that the response trait itself
does not fuel reactions by the opposite sex. We let two independent
people categorize the traits, listed alphabetically, without any
information on whether the terms stemmed from males or females.
The terms classiﬁed differently by the two persons were excluded
from the analysis. These excluded terms were words that may be
difﬁcult to categorize because they either fall into a different part of
speech or are ambiguous. For example, persistence is one of the
most common terms used for describing male antagonistic traits,
but it could also be understood in the sense of species persistence.
We investigated whether there was a difference between how the
sexes were described. We found that males were described as active
and females as reactive (c22 ¼ 187.39, P &amp;lt; 0.0001). These terms may
imply three things: (1) it is the male that has the upper hand (the
male adapts while the female counteradapts; Parker 1979), (2)
males seem to have more diverse and aggressive ways of safeguarding their interests while females most often ‘resist’ and (3) the
terminology partially reﬂects sex-stereotypic notions.
Parameters Included in Sexual Conﬂict Models: Methods and Results
We surveyed all theoretical models obtained under the keyword
‘sexual conﬂict’ in BIOSIS (performed 4 March 2009, N ¼ 26); both
verbal and mathematical models were included but not reviews
(see Table 1 for references). Models for which it was impossible to
assess the conﬂict parameters (e.g. where the main focus is outside
the conﬂict or where costs are not incorporated at all) were
excluded. By ‘cost’, we here mean cost arising from mating, parental
investment or antagonistic interactions, but not the cost of
producing antagonistic traits. Thus only costs that are inﬂicted by
the opposite sex and not the costs that an individual bears from its
own adaptations are considered. When cost for trait production is
incorporated in models it is most often accounted for in both sexes
and included besides the actual mating or parental investment cost,
which we have here deﬁned as conﬂict cost (see e.g. Parker 1979;
Lankinen et al. 2006). Our aim was not to question the mathematical correctness of the models, but rather to examine how
extensive they are and how much variation exists between them,
with regard to sex roles. From this literature study, it is evident that
female cost is what has mainly been investigated in sexual conﬂict
research (Table 1). Fourteen articles include only female conﬂict
costs or ﬁtness reduction in their model while none considers a cost
for the male only (Table 1). The number of articles that include both
a male and a female cost is very high; 12 papers consider conﬂict
costs for both sexes (Table 1). Among the articles that include both
male and female conﬂict costs, six model conﬂicts over parental
care. Models over mating rate are represented only in the group
with exclusively female conﬂict costs. Thus, there is a clear difference in what kinds of costs are incorporated, depending on the
particular conﬂict. It is also worth noting that in some cases it is
assumed that males are always much more powerful than females
(Clutton-Brock &amp; Parker 1995), that males are allowed to choose
their conﬂict strategy before females (Barta et al. 2002), and that
male ﬁtness never decreases with mating rate (Haygood 2004). To
investigate whether the trend found in the theoretical models is
valid for the wider sexual conﬂict ﬁeld, we performed an additional
search on male cost and female cost found in abstracts in BIOSIS
(two searches: (1) female* cost* sexual* conﬂict*, (2) female* cost*
sexual* conﬂict* NOT male* cost* sexual* conﬂict*, 25 May 2010).
Of 284 abstracts, 145 included sexual conﬂict and costs. This search
conﬁrmed the previous pattern: 106 abstracts considered female
costs while 30 took both sexes into account and only nine considered male costs (Fig. 2).

effects continuously. Below, we discuss the implications for sexual
conﬂict research and suggest future directions for more objective
research and further progress.
On the Use of Sex-stereotyped Terminology
The terminology used in the most cited sexual conﬂict studies
implies that males are offensive, that is, they are the ones ﬁrst
acquiring an antagonistic adaptation, which females then react to.
In true coevolution it is not possible to disentangle who acts ﬁrst;
the idea that males take the ﬁrst step may thus be caused by a sexstereotypic preconception. It may of course be argued that, for
purely physiological reasons, males would need to take an active
step to penetrate the female. But would this mean that all (or most)
female (re-)actions do not mediate further (re-)actions in males?
One could also compare this situation with other situations in
coevolution, such as hosteparasite or predatoreprey systems,
where similar phrasing may be used with active terms for the
parasite and predator and defensive terms for the host and prey.
Still, there is one difference: in maleefemale coevolution both males
and females need something from their partner (in contrast to the
prey, which does not need anything from the predator) and it is in
both sexes’ interest to reproduce. They just differ in when, how often
and with whom. The current characterization of sex roles in sexual
conﬂict research can be compared to how females were described in
more passive terms, for example as coy, in traditional sexual
selection. Thus, males are described with active and females with
reactive phrasing (Fig. 1), although both actively affect each other.
In the hermaphroditic garden snail Helix aspersa, sperm is
digested by the recipient, and it has been suggested that sperm
digestion could indeed be a direct cost to the male sexual function
(see e.g. Rogers &amp; Chase 2001; Arnqvist &amp; Rowe 2005). In these
snails the male part inserts a so-called love dart in the female
genitalia, which seals the entrance and allows sperm to escape
digestion. The love dart could be explained as a resistance adaptation to the (our note: manipulative) sperm digestion performed
by the female sexual function. However, the love dart may be
inserted to manipulate the recipient’s sperm digestion (Rogers &amp;
Chase 2001). It is clearly the male that would suffer a cost, but
still the response is not described with a reactive term but with an
active one (manipulation). Why are different words used for
describing antagonistic traits depending on whether it is a male or
a female that is imposing a cost on the partner? Could it be that the
antagonistic terms are based on a traditional view of conventional
sex roles, that is, that in western human society males are traditionally considered as active and females as passive?
Our concern is not that the traits and behaviours are described
with different words in the two sexes per se. It is rather the different
connotations that are present throughout the terminology, and, in
turn, how these will affect us as researchers that are our concern.
The image of reactive females implied by the terminology may affect
the research carried out; for example the male’s response to female
antagonism and the subsequent negative effects in males may not
be investigated. Indeed, it should be possible to use the neutral term
‘sexually antagonistic trait’ for both males and females, and if
necessary describe the trait further. Also, in both males and females
a sexually antagonistic trait can be considered as a manipulation
rather than differentiating between ‘manipulation’ and ‘resistance’.
The anthropomorphic terminology used for describing behaviour and traits could further have affected the choice of study
species. So far, only a few studies have investigated sexual conﬂicts
in organisms beyond bisexual animal species (Bedhomme et al.
2009). Active actions, such as force, may be difﬁcult to envisage in
plants and in animals with very primitive mental resources, and the
stereotypic terminology may limit research to only separate-sexed
animals. That is, sex-stereotypic terms such as ‘harass’ and ‘resist’
will certainly give a picture of a male and a female engaged in
reproduction and other sexual systems may not be associated with
such terms. Also, the captivating words describing the sexes’ interactions (‘battle’, ‘war’ etc.) may be problematic in this respect. This
may be relevant for other ﬁelds of evolutionary biology, in particular
sexual selection theory, where anthropomorphic description makes
it seemingly difﬁcult to apply the theory, for example to plants.
On the Bias in Theoretical Models
Some authors have stressed the importance of deﬁning and
measuring net costs and beneﬁts of each sex when investigating
sexual conﬂict (Chapman et al. 2003; Fricke et al. 2009). However,
we found that most sexual conﬂict models focus on costs only for
the female (Table 1). This was particularly evident in modelled
conﬂict over mating rate. The potential costs that males in nature
may suffer from female antagonistic actions (i.e. the costs for not
reaching the male optimum) in conﬂict over mating are not
explored. Models of sexual conﬂict over parental care seem to have
a more neutral approach to assessing the sexes’ costs and beneﬁts
in the conﬂict, taking both males’ and females’ ﬁtness interests into
account. This may be a consequence of the fact that which is the
care-giving sex varies between different groups of organisms,
opening our eyes to the idea that care may be a maternal, paternal
or biparental task. In such conﬂicts both sexes may have similar
choices of staying or deserting, and face the same consequential
costs and beneﬁts. In conﬂict over mating rate, however, the sexes
may have very different choices and face different consequences. Of
course, no model could address all possible parameters but there
may be a bias in what factors are incorporated. Although mathematically correct, the models leave out the possibility of negative
effects on males from female antagonistic actions. How accurately
does such a theoretical approach reﬂect how sexual conﬂict operates in nature? Parker (1979) divided the costs of mating into
‘power’ (relative contest costs, i.e. cost of enforcing victory, the
average rates of expenditure of contest costs and the ability to
inﬂict damage) and ‘value of winning’ (relative ﬁtness difference
between mating and not mating). The cost of power could be
equally big for a male or a female, while the value of winning is
thought to be smaller for females (Parker 1979). This idea comes
from the assumption that sexual selection operates more intensely
on males than on females, because the reproductive potential of
males is often greater (Parker 1979). The assumption that female
ﬁtness decreases at higher mating rates is present already in
Parker’s (1979) paper, the ﬁrst on sexual conﬂict theory. This view
may stem from Bateman (1948) and has been criticized elsewhere
(Tang-Martinez &amp; Ryder 2005; Snyder &amp; Gowaty 2007; Brown et al.
2009). There is support for the idea that females gain directly from
polyandry in terms of increased lifetime offspring production
(Arnqvist &amp; Nilsson 2000). For both males and females, several
different relationships between fecundity and mating success are
possible (Arnold 1994). However, in models of sexual conﬂict, male
ﬁtness is mainly viewed as linearly increasing with number of
matings (e.g. Gavrilets et al. 2001), while female ﬁtness is optimal
at an intermediate mating rate. If mating rate is too high, female
ﬁtness decreases and females suffer a ﬁtness cost. Similarly, if
mating rate is decreased (from female antagonistic adaptations)
male ﬁtness will be lower (than it could potentially be with a higher
mating rate): will a male not suffer a ﬁtness cost similar to females?
Or are females always supposed to be harmed, which gives an
additional cost besides a lower than optimal ﬁtness?
Even if lowered male mating rates actually give the same outcome
as if male costs were explicitly incorporated, there may be a problem
with not acknowledging the decrease as costs. This view may imply
K. Karlsson Green, J. A. Madjidian / Animal Behaviour 81 (2011) 901e907
that it is primarily sexual selection that is operating in males (i.e.
decreased ﬁtness as lost opportunity of mating in comparison with
other males) and sexual conﬂict, with its important feature of direct
costs, is mainly operating on females (i.e. decreased ﬁtness caused by
conﬂict cost from male actions). An interesting parallel is what
Clutton-Brock (2007) wrote concerning sexual selection in females:
that despite Darwin’s (1871) broad deﬁnition of sexual selection in
both sexes, intrasexual competitive ability of individuals is thought
to contribute to sexual selection if it occurs in males but not in
females (e.g. competition for food to offspring). Maybe such narrowing of the research ﬁeld is reﬂected in sexual conﬂict if female
costs are attributed to the conﬂict, while male costs of missed
opportunity of reproduction are considered as sexual selection. This
is despite the possibility that it might be a female adaptation that
prevents the male from reaching his optimum mating rate. Perhaps
a clear division between ‘harm costs’ and ‘lost opportunity costs’
would make it easier to acknowledge costs for males.
The scientiﬁc language used could be an important factor
involved in shaping the gender skew in consideration of costs. As it
is, costs are imposed by active traits (of males) on an individual
(female) with conﬂict traits or behaviours that have a more
vulnerable resonance (e.g. resistance). Thus, only active terminology implies that a trait infers costs. In turn, this could strongly
affect which experiments are conducted and thus which research
results we will get. As a result, stereotyping may have limited the
research questions and therefore not have provided an accurate
picture of sexual conﬂicts in nature.
Male Costs and Interpretation of Behaviour in Empirical Studies
Both models and the terms describing sexually antagonistic
traits imply that there are no costs inﬂicted on males. It is possible
that the costs inﬂicted on males are implicitly there, for example
through lost opportunity costs of mating if females develop higher
resistance towards males. If so, this assumption should be made
explicit and preferably empirically investigated, which until now
has not been done (Fig. 2). In fact, it is possible to study costs of both
sexes within the same experiment. An example is Holland &amp; Rice’s
(1999) study in which imposed monogamy resulted in less antagonism from both sexes and higher population ﬁtness. Incorporating
costs of both sexes could have been done in several other studies. In
Rice (1996), for instance, the experimental arrest of female but not
male evolution resulted in reduced female survivorship. It would be
both interesting and possible to arrest male evolution to infer how
male ﬁtness components change when evolution of female antagonistic traits is allowed.
Where would one then expect to ﬁnd male costs? The empirical
evidence is scarce, but some examples are already present: survival
during mating in isopods (Benesh et al. 2007) and cannibalism in
spiders (cf. Arnqvist &amp; Rowe 2005). The traits that male spiders
possess to avoid being cannibalized (such as long legs, agility and
vigilance) are said to represent sexually antagonistic adaptations,
not resistance or counteradaptations! There are other cases where
a male cost could be discussed, for example self-mutilation in
spiders to insert a mating plug in females (in some species this selfmutilation is so extensive that the males become castrated;
Kuntner et al. 2009a, b), or when females metabolize and neutralize
potentially harmful substances in the sperm ejaculate (Arnqvist &amp;
Nilsson 2000). The reduction in relative mating success following
neutralization of sperm toxins will be comparable to that in other
males in sperm competition, but the actual cost comes from the
female antagonistic trait (toxin neutralization; cf. femaleefemale
competition: Clutton-Brock 2007). Although the costs to females of
toxic accessory gland proteins in the ejaculate have been much
discussed, the potential costs a male incurs from female

manipulation of his ejaculates are, to our knowledge, not
mentioned. Another example of a potential male cost is the sucking
behaviour (digesting or removing seminal components) of recipients of the hermaphroditic marine worm Macrostomum sp.
(Schärer et al. 2004). All these examples call for increased attention
and a less constrained view of male costs in sexual conﬂict research
(see Fricke et al. 2009).
Potential Causes of Bias and Directions for the Future
The pattern we see from our literature surveys may arise from
factors other than gender bias, that is, a preconceived view of sex
roles. For example, theory and research may have sprung from what
is most elaborate and conspicuous in nature. Thus, arms races and
the more severe ‘battle of the sexes’ may be what attract scientists
in the ﬁrst place. It may be that, since sexual conﬂict theory
emerged from sexual selection, research has continued on the path
of sexual selection where males are attributed most variation and
action. It could also be that as science changes with time, we may
eventually reach a state where more features of sexual conﬂict are
studied in both sexes. However, whatever the reason is for the
stereotypic pattern we discern, it may be worth asking what this
bias is due to and how it will affect research.
As sexual selection research now suggests that the sex roles are
less distinct than previously thought, and because important
insights may be gained by looking outside the conventional sex
roles (Cunningham &amp; Birkhead 1998), it should be beneﬁcial for
sexual conﬂict theory to deal with the roles the sexes are assigned.
Indeed, stereotyped theories may constrain rather than broaden
our views and approaches. As another parallel from sexual selection theory, the importance of incorporating mutual choice in mate
choice models, not using the traditional approach with only one sex
that chooses, has been highlighted (Bergstrom &amp; Real 2000). We
suggest that the characterization of males and females as active and
reactive (and bearing costs), respectively, may hamper the future
development of sexual conﬂict research. For example, female
adaptations and male costs may be overlooked and conﬂict
dynamics may not be fully understood.
If there is a potential problem with the use of stereotypic sex
roles in sexual conﬂict research, what should we do to overcome
this bias? Even though we ourselves ponder these questions, we
also fall into the same traps when designing experiments and when
writing articles. One reason is that it is easiest to do ‘what others do’
and when communicating research it is convenient to use the
common terminology to be best understood. However, if theory
should be general it is worth being careful with terminology,
striving to develop broad models (see Gowaty &amp; Hubbell 2005,
2009) and designing empirical studies in which the same conﬂict
features are studied in both sexes. For example, in cases with
hermaphrodites, where evidence is now accumulating for the
occurrence of sexual conﬂicts (Koene 2006; Lankinen &amp; Kiboi 2007;
Bedhomme et al. 2009; Madjidian &amp; Lankinen 2009), conventional
thinking about sex roles may be difﬁcult or even useless.
Conclusions
Following Kuhn, objectivity in research may be an unattainable
goal as scientists’ perceptions are inﬂuenced by the paradigm they
work within (Kuhn 1962; discussed with regard to sexual selection
in Fausto-Sterling 1981; Fox Keller 1982). We believe that
researchers in sexual selection can develop a more accurate picture
of the sexual conﬂict process by becoming aware of and acknowledging their biases and daring to take a step further. Good examples
of how this has paved the way for new research are that male mate
choice is becoming a ‘hot topic’ (e.g. Bonduriansky 2009) and that

female harassment of males (Bro-Jorgensen 2007) has recently
been considered. Of course, we are not diminishing the importance
of previous sexual conﬂict research, through which important
insights into conﬂict dynamics have been obtained. However,
whenever a new research ﬁeld is established it may be wise to learn
from the past and not fall into old traps. We hope that these
reﬂections will encourage fruitful discussions that will help
researchers consider their potential biases, gain new insights into
their study systems or rediscover some overlooked aspects of the
theory. Ultimately, objective research is a scientiﬁc goal, and normfree thinking, here in terms of gender, may be a ﬁrst step towards
a more objective sexual conﬂict research ﬁeld.

Much of the debate has been devoted to the relative importance and degree of sexual selection in the two sexes (Brown Blackwell 1875 cited in Fausto-Sterling 1997; Gowaty 1997; Clutton-Brock 2007), of which much may stem from the fact that we, as researchers, have a preconceived view of how the sexes should act. In recent years, several authors have pointed at weaknesses and misinterpretations in the theory of sexual selection (Clutton-Brock 2007; Snyder &amp; Gowaty 2007; Kokko &amp; Jennions 2008; Roughgarden &amp; Akçay 2010), mainly concerning the use of sex roles and how they are assigned. Well-known examples include the common extrapolation from anisogamy to sex roles stemming from Trivers (1972) (Gowaty 1997; TangMartinez 1997), the overreliance on Bateman’s principle as an explanation of mating system differences between species (Bateman 1948; Tang-Martinez &amp; Ryder 2005; Snyder &amp; Gowaty 2007; Brown et al. 2009) and the use of operational sex ratio (OSR) rather than both OSR and adult sex ratio (ASR) when determining sex roles (Kokko &amp; Jennions 2008).

Well-known examples include the common extrapolation from anisogamy to sex roles stemming from Trivers (1972) (Gowaty 1997; TangMartinez 1997), the overreliance on Bateman’s principle as an explanation of mating system differences between species (Bateman 1948; Tang-Martinez &amp; Ryder 2005; Snyder &amp; Gowaty 2007; Brown et al. 2009) and the use of operational sex ratio (OSR) rather than both OSR and adult sex ratio (ASR) when determining sex roles (Kokko &amp; Jennions 2008).
