			<abstract>
				<p>It is now widely accepted that good welfare is not simply the absence of negative experiences, but rather is primarily the presence of positive experiences such as pleasure. However scientific investigation of positive emotions has long been neglected. This paper addresses two main issues: first, it reviews the current state of scientific knowledge that supports the existence of positive affective states in animals and, second, it suggests possible applications of this knowledge that may enhance quality of life under animal management conditions. In the first part of the paper, recent advances in psychology and neuroscience are reviewed to provide pragmatic frameworks based on cognitive processes (such as positive anticipation, contrast and controllability) for further investigations of positive emotions in animals. Thereafter, the neurobiological bases of positive emotions are highlighted in order to identify behavioral and physiological expressions of positive experiences in animals. Monitoring both the autonomic nervous system (via heart rate and its variability) and the immune system could offer relevant tools to better assess emotional states in animals, complementary to classical adrenocortical measures. In the second part of the paper, useful strategies for enhancing positive experiences (such as physical, social and cognitive enrichment or putative genetic selection) are outlined. Then this paper emphasizes practical applications for assessing and promoting positive emotions that may help in providing animals with a better quality of life. Play, affiliative behaviors and some vocalizations appear to be the most promising convenient indicators for assessing positive experiences in laboratory and farm animals under commercial conditions.</p>

A number of signs can indicate positive experience in animals—for example, successful coping, reward, and wanting resulting in goal-directed behavior. Positive emotions can be separated into three temporal categories: i) past (e.g. post-consummatory satisfaction), ii) present (e.g. pleasant sensory activity), and iii) future (e.g. positive expectation, anticipatory joy). Focusing on present positive emotions, three categories of pleasure have been proposed in humans [4]: sensory pleasures, higher pleasures (i.e. non-homeostatic sensory experiences), and gratifications (i.e. inner intellectual experiences), with at least the first and presumably the second categories being candidates for animal investigations. Hedonism refers in its narrowest sense to pleasure or positive affect [46]. Hedonism can also have a broader meaning referring to a general affective disposition, either positive or negative. The presence of behavioral and physiological signs of pleasure reminiscent of human euphoria has been demonstrated in anA. Boissy et al. / Physiologyimals. Such si</context>

Whereas pleasure is generally assessed in the context of sensory stimulation, such as the hedonic impact of taste, happiness refers to a longer and less intense internal state of feeling, which we argue is closer to the concept of “wellbeing” or “quality of life”. Although the concept of happi ness has been studied very little, there are some theoretical attempts in the evolutionary approach that integrates this concept [311]. Some recent work suggests that happiness could be defined as consisting of both positive emotions and positive activities [4,312]. Animal studies have accumulated a large amount of valuable data regarding sensory pleasure or evaluating the rewarding properties of many agents, but there is a lack of data concerning more persistent affective states in animals. Hence, we must rely on theoretical and human studies to provide stimulating clues to the question of happiness in animals and the developing study of positive emotions must be considered as a first step in addressing the question of stable and less expressive affective states (i.e.mood) in animals. Is there such a state as happiness in animals? If so, how can it be </context>

In other words, to feel afraid it is necessary to have access to consciousness that allows awareness of the internal state. Damasio [16] claims that the consciousness of an emotion corresponds to the knowledge of the ability to experience emotions. Perceptive (or anoetic) consciousness is usually defined in terms of the capacity to be aware of feelings, sensations, thoughts and emotions [17]. There is a vigorous debate as to whether feelings of consciousness are present in non-human animals, and if so in which species [reviewed by [8,18,19]]. The common assumption is that the more cognitively complex an animal is, the more likely it is to be conscious. However, why should increasing cognitive complexity necessarily be linked to the emergence of consciousness or vice versa? The approach of using complex cognitive capabilities as potential indicators of the presence of conscious experience in animals has rightly been criticized [reviewed by [20]].

The common assumption is that the more cognitively complex an animal is, the more likely it is to be conscious. However, why should increasing cognitive complexity necessarily be linked to the emergence of consciousness or vice versa? The approach of using complex cognitive capabilities as potential indicators of the presence of conscious experience in animals has rightly been criticized [reviewed by [20]]. Recently, Alexandrov and Sams [21] proposed a unified concept of consciousness and emotions. It is not our purpose to discuss the links between cognition and consciousness [reviewed by [22]], but we want to stress the usefulness of cognitive science for research on emotions in animals and thus for animal welfare. Feelings require some cognitive abilities to establish temporal and instrumental contingencies. These abilities allow anticipation or prediction of events whereas emotional responses involve copingwith the situation. Learning temporal contingency refers to the ability to relate the occurrence of one stimulus to another when the two occur in succession, the first one becoming a predictor for the second. Learning an instrumental contingency refers to the ability to assess</context>

The behavioral and physiological profiles recorded under these conditions could be used as indicators of putative emotional states. When a specific internal state is the only discriminating stimulus available to the animal, it can use the said internal state as a cue to select the appropriate operant response in order to get a reward. One might say the animal perceives the internal representation of its state within its central nervous system in a way that contributes to or determines its actions. As a behavioral outcome the animal will choose what seemsmost pleasurable [23].Measures of cognitive processes, such as anticipation, can provide information about animal emotion. Indeed, anticipatory behavior measured in a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm has been identified as a potential indicator of emotion [33]. Recent developments in human psychology of emotions could help to create a more complete framework for categorizing emo378 A. Boissy et al. / Physiologytions in animals. According to Scherer [34], emotions are determined on the basis of a limited number of elementary evaluative criteria: (i) the novelty of the event, (ii) its intrinsic pleasantness,(iii) its</context>

One would expect self-rewarding behaviors to interact – cross sensitization and cross tolerance – with drugs of addiction or rewarding stimuli such as food. The opportunity to display may itself act as a reinforcer and can be used as an incentive in conditioned place preference studies. Being deprived of opportunities to perform specific behaviours resulting from these behavioral needs produces signs of withdrawal paralleling those observed in deprivation of an addictive drug [19,23,47,95,98]. Exploration in rodents, when modeled by wheel-running behavior, shows such interaction (cross sensitization) with mesolimbic dopamine and cross tolerance with morphine [103], an interaction similar to those observed for drugs of addiction. Cross sensitization between food and drugs of abuse has also been shown, and this phenomenon could be counteracted by an opiate antagonist [104]. Social behavior, play and self-grooming can be induced by endorphins and counteracted by naloxone [98–100].

For Lazarus [27], an emotional state requires a primary appraisal of the emotional stimulus, which is responsible for the action planning and execution; the consequences of this action are then evaluated through a secondary appraisal. Cognitive theories of emotion contend that the individual&amp;apos;s cognitive appraisal of the stimulating event determines the quality of emotion [28–31]. Although labeled as cognitive, the appraisals are not thought to result from complex analytical reasoning. Instead, they are presumed to be relatively effortless, intuitive and automatic evaluations that are sensitive to events relat</context>

Appraisal may be influenced by innate automatic responses that probably evolved over many generations (e.g. response to a snake), and by learning and memory of previous encounters with stimuli during the individual&amp;apos;s lifetime [15]. A simple framework based on cognitive evaluation can be employed for the study of emotions in animals. Events can be appraised according to whether they are rewarding or punishing [12,32]. Presentation of rewards leads to positive emotions such as pleasure, while omission of rewards leads to frustration or anger. Likewise, Lazarus [27] suggested two simple steps of appraisal. The first step appraises whether the current situation alters the well-being of the individual (if not, there is no emotional arousal). The second step appraises the meaning of the alteration. When the alteration reduces well-being, it leads to a negative emotion whereas when the alteration increases wellbeing, it leads to a positive emotion. The behavioral and physiological profiles recorded under these conditions could be used as indicators of putative emotional states.

There are nevertheless a number of more specialized emotional theories that do not rely on a general emotional drive, e.g. Amsel&amp;apos;s frustration theory [163] or Gray&amp;apos;s disinhibition theory [29]. Positive contrast has been found in few species of mammals and birds [164–166]. For instance, in his original study, Crespi [159] reported that rats for which the quantity of reward has just been increased run faster towards the food reward than do rats having always received the large quantity of reward. However, the changes in the behavioral responses are generally more pronounced for the negative than for the positive contrasts [164–166]. Due to the relatively small number of studies, further research is needed to confirm the value of a positive contrast model in the study of potential po</context>

These changes may be related to the role of dopamine in integrating cue- and contextassociated details of the response to be displayed or in other words integrating neuronal inputs from the hippocampus and amygdala in the output of the nucleus accumbens [88]. The meso-accumbens dopamine system has a high degree of plasticity, which underlies its role in the organization of the efficacy of behavior. Highly rewarding incentives may sensitize the system, since it seems adaptive in the long term that what was once “liked” to a certain extent should be “wanted” in the future to the same extent. </context>

In piglets more locomotor play behavior was seen in larger farrowing crates compared to smaller ones [247]. In addition, different types of farrowing crates placed in pens of equal space affected play behavior [248]. Locomotor play behavior is reduced by mixing of piglets [249] and by social isolation [250,251]. In mink the additional provision of a water bath to mink kits stimulated more play behavior, both solitary locomotor play and social play (e.g. chasing and rough-and-tumble play) [87]. Likewise, the provision of a wooden block in the home cage of mink stimulated accelerated running, interrupted by sham attacks of the object [214]. As outlined above play behavior is a good candidate for an indicator of positive emotions and good welfare. However, caution must be taken when developing play behavior as a positive welfare indicator since social play can end in a fight, as in piglets [248]. This problemmay be specific for the juvenile pig, where dominance plays a role from birth, whereas in cattle the tendency for social play to develop into real fights does not increase until </context>

Affective consciousness probably occurs in animals as well though it will depend upon the cognitive capacity of the animal [19]. Two types of behavioral needs can be distinguished. First, needs that induce behavioral patterns can be evaluated by their direct physiological consequences for the underlying motivational system. For instance, hunger requires eating of food, which affects blood glucose, leptin levels and other parameters representing the metabolic status of the individual and influencing food regulation centers in the brain. Second, Jensen and Toates [96] defined a behavioral need as a specific behavioral pattern that the animal apparently has to perform, irrespective of the environment or of the animal&amp;apos;s physiological needs. In other words, needs that involve the display of typical behaviors lack direct physiological consequences and thus also lack direct feedback from regulatory physiological mechanisms. It seems as though the biological relevance of regular performance of those behaviors lies in their long-term benefits for the individual animal or its offspring, e.g. behaviors concerning reproduction, foraging and grooming.

Allogrooming plays a key role with regard to so-called sociopositive interactions. It is common among non-human primates [33]. In farm animals, allogrooming is seen in cattle, horses, pigs and, rather rarely, in sheep. Allogrooming seems to serve both hygienic (body care) and social functions. With regard to the latter, allogrooming is thought to play a major role in reinforcing social bonds and in reducing tension in groups of animals [100,272]. Such an arousal-reduction effect suggests that allogrooming may provide long-term benefits. However, there is also evidence that allogrooming is rewarding in the short term. Soothing effects in terms of a reduction in heart rate have been demonstrated in primates [273,274] and cattle [272]. Grooming stimulation produced similar effects in horses [275,276]. In pigs, heart rate variability was used to assess the effect of grooming simulation [277].

Self-grooming is the maintenance of one&amp;apos;s own body surface. In mammals this maintenance is achieved through licking, scratching, and rubbing of the fur, as well as through wallowing and bathing. In birds it is through preening and bathing in water or sand. These various forms of self-grooming maintain the body surface by removal of dirt and ectoparasites as well as by thermoregulation. However, self-grooming may also occur as a displacement activity with an arousal-reduction or relaxation effect [100]. In birds, self-grooming increases in response to a thwarting or a conflict situation [289]. Likewise in mammals, self-grooming is elicited in reaction to a novel or stressful situation [290–292]. Self-grooming is also reported to be higher in animals kept in barren environments. For example, self-grooming occurred less among rabbits kept in cages with a shelter as compared to rabbits kept in barren cages [293]. Self-grooming in animals kept in barren or restrictive environments may be reduced either by the provision of hay, e.g. in rabbits [294], or by increasing the space allowance, e.g. in</context>

The opportunity to display may itself act as a reinforcer and can be used as an incentive in conditioned place preference studies. Being deprived of opportunities to perform specific behaviours resulting from these behavioral needs produces signs of withdrawal paralleling those observed in deprivation of an addictive drug [19,23,47,95,98].

Hence, measures of heart rate (HR) are broadly accepted as a valid index of stress in many vertebrate species as they give an impression of the activity of the ANS [110–112]. Interpretations have often been based on the assumption that HR reflects the activity of the sympathetic branch of the ANS and therefore can be used as an indicator of the sympatho-adrenomedullary stress response. However, the heart is also under parasympathetic control, and HR at every point in time is the result of non-additive effects of the interaction between the two branches of the ANS [113]. Thereby, the effects of emotional perceptions on cardiac activity are mediated via direct innervations of the sino-atrial node of the heart by sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers [114,115]. As a consequence of these permanent regulatory functions, HR is never constant but varies from beat to beat, hence the concept of heart rate variability (HRV).

For instance, sustained high cortisol levels are associated with a higher probability of engaging in passive coping (i.e. being reactive), whereas high catecholamine levels are associated with a higher probability of engaging in active coping [132]. However, transient activations of the stress axes–i.e. the adrenocortical axis (HPA) and the ANS–are regularly coincident with any emotionally triggered activity and cannot be easily differentiated for positive and negative emotions.

Since s-IgA is considered an indicator of overall immune function, such measures in laboratory and farm animals could offer new insights for the understanding of emotional influence over immunity. Conversely with brain-to-immune influences, growing evidence reveals that the immune system influences brain functions, including structures involved in emotional processes. In addition to various effects on emotion-related neurotransmitters (i.e. serotonin or noradrenalin), immune activation is known to induce HPA activation [138]. When these data are combined with the fact that immune and stress responses have been argued to share common evolutionary defensive properties, immune activation is increasingly considered as a stress response by itself [144]. Moreover, some studies show that immune activation has emotional effects, such as anxiety- or depression-like A. Boissy et al. / Physiologybehaviors [141,145].

Since s-IgA is considered an indicator of overall immune function, such measures in laboratory and farm animals could offer new insights for the understanding of emotional influence over immunity. Conversely with brain-to-immune influences, growing evidence reveals that the immune system influences brain functions, including structures involved in emotional processes.

When these data are combined with the fact that immune and stress responses have been argued to share common evolutionary defensive properties, immune activation is increasingly considered as a stress response by itself [144]. Moreover, some studies show that immune activation has emotional effects, such as anxiety- or depression-like A. Boissy et al. / Physiologybehaviors [141,145].

Thus, the threshold of the animal to react to a stimulus reflects the sensitivity of the system. In addition, the amount of activity is related to the needs of an</context>

However, there is a risk of misinterpretation here as the absence of a reaction to a reward may indicate that the animal is in a state either of full satisfaction or of anhedonism, and these are opposite states in terms of welfare. In addition, the intensity of reaction to a small reward has to be calibrated for each species and situation. In silver foxes, anticipatory behavior consisted of high levels of locomotor stereotypical behaviors such as running back and forth in the cage environment [155]. Whether stereotypies during positive anticipation are an expression of enhanced expectation shaped by the environment into repeated movements or a stereotyped behavior due to previous and/or current frustration [156] remains to be seen. 3.1.2. Positive contrast In a typical positive contrast experiment an animal is first trained to perform a task by giving it a reinforcer of a certain size.

This enhanced quality of life could be achieved by physically enriching an already varied environment with new resources or by cognitive means. The methods for achieving such enrichment are presented throughout this review, i.e. by creating a situation where there is anticipation of a positive reward, by offering more space to promote play, and by providing opportunities for positive contrast situations, for improving coping abilities, and for information gathering. Some concrete examples of where these methods have been tried are given byMoe and collaborators [155] and Ernst and collaborators [173], and other examples include the work by Wood-Gush andVestergaard on seeking novelty and its relation to play [218], problem solving in cattle [219] and stroking animals [220]. Nevertheless, in all cases it is necessary to confirm that the enrichment is having the desired effect, which is not as easy as might be proposed. At present, the enhancing effect is usually taken to be an increase in those behavior patterns scientists think are positive.

This is also possibly due to a ceiling effect; for instance, an animal that is running at top speed for a reinforcer is unable to increase its speed even if the reinforcement is increased. Unfortunately this result has meant that the majority of theories of the contrast effect have focused on explaining the negative contrast effect exclusively.Althoughsome of the theories involve emotions e.g. elation or disappointment as described above, most are alternative ‘non-emotional’ theories such as generalization decrement [161], incentive averaging [162] or exploration [Elliott, 1928 cited by [157]]. There are nevertheless a number of more specialized emotional theories that do not rely on a general emotional drive, e.g. Amsel&amp;apos;s frustration theory [163] or Gray&amp;apos;s disinhibition theory [29]. Positive contrast has been found in few species of mammals and birds [164–166]. For instance, in his original study, Crespi [159] reported that rats for which the quantity of reward has just been increased run faster towards the food reward than do rats having always received the large quantity of reward.

Coping and controllability The possibility of controlling the environment and coping successfully with challenges may be another source of positive emotions. Despite some degree of stress being necessary in the initial state of coping to activate alertness and metabolism [167], successful actions with a positive outcome make the animal master of the environment. Successful coping stops the initial stress reactions, independent of the positive or negative value of the stressor, while uncontrollable and, hence, persistent negative stressful stimuli lead to the well-known detrimental effects of chronic stress [84,168–170]. A prerequisite of controllability is predictability, i.e. the environmental reactions are (mostly) contingent on the subject&amp;apos;s actions.

Fourth, there must be contiguity between the challenge and the behavioral action [171]. If any of these conditions remain unfulfilled the animal will be unable to learn how to cope, a failure that will eventually lead to chronic stress. Hence, inactivity displayed by an animal may be caused by two emotional states: total equilibrium, when everything is at or close to optimum, or learned helplessness, if the subject has the experience that there is no possibility to escape the negative environment [172]. The result is an inactive, depression-like chronic stress state that is often accompanied, inter alia, by permanently increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Social and physical challenges can be perceived as positive experiences when exists an adequate coping behavior. Hence, frequent challenges that can always be successfully mastered and eventually enable the animal to reach a desired and rewarding goal may be suitable means to regularly evoke positive emotions.

Using an approach of this type, a program of research on the effects of rewarded cognitive processes has been developed [173]. In the studies conducted thus far, each animal out of a group of pigs had to learn an individual acoustic signal as a call to work for food by pressing a button. The demands of this situation were threefold: The animals had to be attentive for their individual acoustic summons, they had to localize its source, and they had to respond to a button with their nose disc in order to be rewarded with a small portion of food. It was shown that the pigs were willing and quite able to cope with these demands. Using this approach it will be possible to analyze the physiological and behavioral effects </context>

The methods for achieving such enrichment are presented throughout this review, i.e. by creating a situation where there is anticipation of a positive reward, by offering more space to promote play, and by providing opportunities for positive contrast situations, for improving coping abilities, and for information gathering. Some concrete examples of where these methods have been tried are given byMoe and collaborators [155] and Ernst and collaborators [173], and other examples include the work by Wood-Gush andVestergaard on seeking novelty and its relation to play [218], problem solving in cattle [219] and stroking animals [220]. Nevertheless, in all cases it is necessary to confirm that the enrichment is having the desired effect, which is not as easy as might be proposed. At present, the enhancing effect is usually taken to be an increase in those behavior patterns scientists think are positive.

Taken together these findings indicate that early stimulation and later experiences interact with genetic background through-out the life of the individual to continually modulate emotional reactivity by shaping tendencies to feel secure. Although not all aspects of personality in animals are clear, we can state that emotional traits do exist in animals since emotional reactivity was found to be consistent across time and situation [176,213]. Although most of the studies have been done to reduce negative emotions, the study of emotional traits may also provide good tools to better enhance long-term positive emotional experiences. For instance, social play behavior was more often seen in mink selected for low fearfulness than in those selected for high fearfulness [214]. 3.2.4.

Under natural conditions locomotor play behavior occurs within the first weeks of life [243,244]. Increasing the space allowance for group-housed calves has been found to increase the occurrence of play behavior [245]. Furthermore, calves kept with little space showed a large rebound of locomotor play indicating that these calves had built up a larger motivation during the period of confinement [245,246]. In piglets play behavior includes both locomotor and social play behavior, although it may be difficult to distinguish between play fighting and genuine fights [197]. In piglets more locomotor play behavior was seen in larger farrowing crates compared to smaller ones [247]. In addition, different types of farrowing crates placed in pens of equal space affected play behavior [248]. Locomotor play behavior is reduced by mixing of piglets [249] and by social isolation [250,251]. In mink the additional provision of a water bath to mink kits stimulated more play behavior, both solitary locomotor play and social play (e.g. chasing and rough-and-tumble play) [87]. Likewise, the provision of a wooden block in the home cage of mink stimulated accelerated running, </context>

Unfortunately, most studies on environmental enrichment are actually only adding resources or features to an impoverished setting [215], suggesting the term “housing supplementation” might be better for such practices [216].

In addition, different types of farrowing crates placed in pens of equal space affected play behavior [248]. Locomotor play behavior is reduced by mixing of piglets [249] and by social isolation [250,251]. In mink the additional provision of a water bath to mink kits stimulated more play behavior, both solitary locomotor play and social play (e.g. chasing and rough-and-tumble play) [87]. Likewise, the provision of a wooden block in the home cage of mink stimulated accelerated running, interrupted by sham attacks of the object [214]. As outlined above play behavior is a good candidate for an indicator of positive emotions and good welfare. However, caution must be taken when developing play behavior as a positive welfare indicator since social play can end in a fight, as in piglets [248]. This problemmay be specific for the juvenile pig, where dominance plays a role from birth, whereas in cattle the tendency for social play to develop into real fights does not increase until the animals reach puberty [252]. However, for all species some elements of play behavior may be better indicators than others, and one way of develo</context>

Unfortunately, most studies on environmental enrichment are actually only adding resources or features to an impoverished setting [215], suggesting the term “housing supplementation” might be better for such practices [216]. The beneficial effects of supplementation are usually represented by a reduction in the indicators of poor welfare (e.g. fewer stereotypies, less aggression) rather than an increase in indicators of good welfare. It is argued that the term “enrichment” should be reserved for environments that are truly enriched beyond basic needs [217], and it is this meaning of the term that is adopted here. This enhanced quality of life could be achieved by physically enriching an already varied environment with new resources or by cognitive means. The methods for achieving such enrichment are presented th</context>

If these effects of self-grooming can be demonstrated, it would be a potential indicator for positive emotions. 3.4.1.4. Vocalizations. Specific vocalizations could be considered to some extent as direct expressions of positive immediate experiences in animals. While vocalizations have long been used as markers of emotions in animals [301], they have usually concerned negative experiences (e.g. distress, fear, aggression, defeat). However, focusing on data obtained in rats, Panksepp and Burgdorf [226] have recently argued that some short chirping ultrasonic vocalizations centered around 50-kHz could signal positive affects. This conclusion is supported by the fact that such vocal signals are produced in “positive” contexts, such as sex, winning fights, play, or manual tickling, and are inhibited by negative situations [226]. Intriguingly, it is proposed that these vocalizations could reflect a positive state in rats analogous to primitive laughter that accompanies social play in human infants.

The fact that play behavior may be suppressed in harsh and unfavorable environmental conditions together with the problems of early studies to prove any long-term function of play behavior suggested that play behavior was merely a sign of surplus energy without any motivation of its own. However, there are now several sources of evidence to suggest that play is a rewarding activity [232]. First, animals actively seek out play partners and solicit play behavior [229]. Second, the opportunity to play may be used as a reward in place preference conditioning experiments [236]. Finally, thwarting</context>

This problemmay be specific for the juvenile pig, where dominance plays a role from birth, whereas in cattle the tendency for social play to develop into real fights does not increase until the animals reach puberty [252]. However, for all species some elements of play behavior may be better indicators than others, and one way of developing the area further could be to identify and validate so-called “play markers” as signs of true play in the different animal species [241]. Such play markers may be play signals, which communicate a playful mood to potential play partners. Play signals have the advantage that they are often conspicuous and easy to distinguish. Present evidence on play behavior applies only to juveniles ofmammalian farm animal species. In these species it will be important to develop and validate measures of play as welfare indicators, both in animals reared for meat or for replacement (weaned piglets, growing pigs, calves, lambs, and goats), and in foals. 3.4.1.2.

As outlined above play behavior is a good candidate for an indicator of positive emotions and good welfare. However, caution must be taken when developing play behavior as a positive welfare indicator since social play can end in a fight, as in piglets [248]. This problemmay be specific for the juvenile pig, where dominance plays a role from birth, whereas in cattle the tendency for social play to develop into real fights does not increase until the animals reach puberty [252]. However, for all species some elements of play behavior may be better indicators than others, and one way of developing the area further could be to identify and validate so-called “play markers” as signs of true play in the different animal species [241]. Such play markers may be play signals, which communicate a playful mood to potential play partners. Play signals have the advantage that they are often conspicuous and easy to distinguish. Present evidence on play behavior applies only to juveniles ofmammalian farm animal species. In these species it will be important to develop and valida</context>

Increased β-endorphin levels have also been found in primates with intensive grooming relationships [278]. Based on the above-mentioned findings, affiliative behaviors appear to be promising indicators of long-term positive affective states in farm animals. Allogrooming should be further investigated as a key indicator in cattle, horses and pigs. In cattle, social licking is mainly carried out at the head, neck or shoulder of the animals [252]. It is performed spontaneously, after solicitation, or following agonistic interactions. Social licking may also be terminated by agonistic behavior mostly performed by the licked animal. Solicitation of social licking [279] underlines the rewarding function of such behavior, at least for the receiver. Whereas the overall benefits for the receiver are obvious, it is less clear to what extent the actor is positively influenced. While in horses mostly reciprocal grooming (mainly consisting of biting and nibbling the group mate&amp;apos;s neck) between bonded pairs is observed [280], in cattle Sato [281]</context>

Meynhardt [285] also states that the receiver shows relaxation-related behaviors, a finding that has been confirmed by a grooming simulation study [277]. However, high levels of allogrooming activity may not necessarily reflect positive states of the animal. Pigs in barren environments showed more allogrooming than did those in enriched housing systems that allowed for rooting and exploration [286,287]. On the one hand, increased allogrooming may disturb the receiver. On the other hand, redirected abnormal behaviors may develop such as tailor ear-biting [255]. Therefore, the level of allogrooming indicative of positive affective states in pigs must be determined before it can be used as a welfare indicator. With regard to animal species showing little allogrooming activity, such as sheep and goats [288], or species in which other affiliative behaviors have to be taken into account (poultry), potential alternative indicators of positive affective states would have to be identified and validated. With these caveats affiliative behaviors and especially allogrooming is a promising candidate for a type of behavior indicative of positive emotions. 3.4.1</context>

Self-grooming is also reported to be higher in animals kept in barren environments. For example, self-grooming occurred less among rabbits kept in cages with a shelter as compared to rabbits kept in barren cages [293]. Self-grooming in animals kept in barren or restrictive environments may be reduced either by the provision of hay, e.g. in rabbits [294], or by increasing the space allowance, e.g. in dogs [295] or in dairy calves [296,297]. Likewise, the occurrence of self-grooming is decreased under group-housed farming, e.g. in calves [298–300] and horses [275]. When kept in groups the animals engage in allogrooming, and the higher level of self-grooming in individually housed animals may be due to the lack of allogrooming that may have an arousal-reducing effect (Section 3.4.1 “affiliative behaviors”). Thus, as outlined above, the relation between the performance of self-grooming and positive emotions is much less clear-cut than it is for allogrooming. The performance of self-grooming may occur as a displacement A. Boissy et al. / Physiologyactivity in stressful situations and barren environments.

Pigs in barren environments showed more allogrooming than did those in enriched housing systems that allowed for rooting and exploration [286,287]. On the one hand, increased allogrooming may disturb the receiver. On the other hand, redirected abnormal behaviors may develop such as tailor ear-biting [255].

However, self-grooming may also be performed to substitute for social grooming; it is possible that the performance of self-grooming reduces arousal as has been suggested for social grooming. If these effects of self-grooming can be demonstrated, it would be a potential indicator for positive emotions. 3.4.1.4. Vocalizations. Specific vocalizations could be considered to some extent as direct expressions of positive immediate experiences in animals. While vocalizations have long been used as markers of emotions in animals [301], they have usually concerned negative experiences (e.g. distress, fear, aggression, defeat). However, focusing on data obtained in rats, Panksepp and Burgdorf [226] have recently argued that some short chirping ultrasonic vocalizations centered around 50-kHz could signal positive affects. This conclusion is supported by the fact that such vocal signals are produced in “positive” contexts, such as sex, winning fights, play, or manual tickling, and are inhibited by negative situations [226]. Intriguingly, it is proposed that these vocalizations could reflect a positive state in rats analogous t</context>

Not only does such a proposal offer a framework to further study evolutionary roots of positive emotions (and especially laughter) in humans, but it could also be extended to other species (e.g. domestic species). For example, some vocalizations of domestic cats, such as purring, are well-known to be produced in situations of positive valence, such as mother–kitten interactions, contacts with familiar partner, or during tactile stimulation with inanimate objects as when rolling and rubbing [302]. Therefore, purring can be generally considered as an indicator of “pleasure” in cats. Similar data could be obtained in farm animals.

It doesn&amp;apos;t satiate in the same way as many other behaviors do, and this property has led some authors to suggest that it might actually be a behavior that is continually on-going and is only interrupted when other, more immediate needs, are present [304]. There are two forms of exploration: the inquisitive exploration in which the animal is 389ehavior 92 (2007) 375–397looking for a change and the inspective exploration in which the animal responds to a change [305].

In inspective exploration, which typically is investigation in response to a novel object, there is a gradual approach to the novel object similar to that seen in other approach/avoidance situations involving, for example, hunger instead of curiosity. In many of the motivational models of exploration, the response to the novel object is a result of curiosity and fear. The fear either interacts with curiosity, with exploration being the behavioural outcome of that interaction [e.g. [306]], or alternatively fear and exploration are seen as lying along the same axis [e.g. [305,307]]. This close relationship between exploration and fear is further supported by the finding that personality research on animals tends to find a negative correlation between the reaction of the animal in situations that provoke fear and those that measure exploration [e.g. [308]].

In the main, welfare assessment schemes have consisted of checks that the resources available to the animal are sufficient and of good quality. Nevertheless, there is a consensus among researchers that while this approach is a good way to minimize the risk of poor welfare, the actual assessment of animal welfare must depend on animal-based measures [309]. Unfortunately, as already stated earlier in this section, there are as yet no feasible animal-based measures indicative of good welfare. Instead there aremeasures of poorwelfare, such as injury, body condition, fear etc., and it does not necessary follow that in the absence of these indicators an animal&amp;apos;s welfare is good. It merely means that we have no avoidance that welfare is poor. “Qualitative” assessment methods have been proposed as a way to characterize global expressive affects in animals using a free choice profiling approach [44,310].

Among the terms chosen by the observers are those usually associated with positive states, e.g. “relaxed”, “friendly”, “affectionate”, “playful”, and “social”. There is difficulty though in validating these potential welfare indicators since new measures are usually validated against existing measures. On the other hand, we know that play is a likely candidate for being associated with a positive affective state and, furthermore, play behavior is probably the indicator of positive emotions that is most easily “readable” by non-professional observers (Section 3.4.1 “play 390 A.
