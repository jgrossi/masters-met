			<abstract>
				<p>Recently, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudinter-medius (MRSP) have been increasingly isolated from veterinarians and companion animals. With a view to preventing the spread of MRSA and MRSP, we evaluated the occurrence and molecular characteristics of each in a veterinary college. MRSA and MRSP were isolated from nasal samples from veterinarians, staff members, and veterinary students affiliated with a veterinary hospital. Using stepwise logistic regression, we identified two factors associated with MRSA carriage: (i) contact with an identified animal MRSA case (odds ratio [OR], 6.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.2 to 21.6) and (ii) being an employee (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.0 to 19.4). The majority of MRSA isolates obtained from individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital and dog patients harbored spa type t002 and a type II staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), similar to the hospital-acquired MRSA isolates in Japan. MRSA isolates harboring spa type t008 and a type IV SCCmec were obtained from one veterinarian on three different sampling occasions and also from dog patients. MRSA carriers can also be a source of MRSA infection in animals. The majority of MRSP isolates (85.2%) carried hybrid SCCmec type II-III, and almost all the remaining MRSP isolates (11.1%) carried SCCmec type V. MRSA and MRSP were also isolated from environmental samples collected from the veterinary hospital (5.1% and 6.4%, respectively). The application of certain disinfection procedures is important for the prevention of nosocomial infection, and MRSA and MRSP infection control strategies should be adopted in veterinary medical practice.</p>

The frequencies of MRSP resistance to kanamycin and gentamicin were higher than those for MRSA and MRSS. DISCUSSION Our study revealed that two factors were independently associated with MRSA carriage: (i) contact with an identified animal MRSA case, and (ii) being an employee of a veterinary hospital or a nonclinical laboratory (versus being a student). It is suggested that animal patients spread MRSA infection among human individuals in veterinary hospitals. Contact with MRSA-infected animals has previously been identified as a risk factor among equine veterinarians (1); however, it has never been identified among companion-animal veterinarians and personnel attending a veterinary surgery conference (6, 12, 28). The higher risk of MRSA carriage among employees might be attributed to their frequency of contact with each animal patient, their closeness of contact during treatment, and the duration of their experience in terms of contact with animal patients. Since contact with MRSA-infected animal patients is a factor considered to be associated with MRSA carriage, it can be inferred that MRSA carriers may originally have been infected by animal patients.

Because the latter genotype was more common among the MRSA isolates obtained from veterinary staff and environmental surfaces, this carrier might be infected from other MRSA carriers or contaminated environmental surfaces. Treatment of MRSA carriers should be undertaken simultaneously with the disinfection of the entire hospital and implementation of hand hygiene practices, which has been reported as a strong protective factor against MRSA colonization (1). MRSA was not detected in the five buccal mucosa samples of dogs owned by MRCPS-positive individuals. We chose buccal swab and not nasal swab, which is the traditional sample for MRSA isolation, because sampling from dogs was done at home by each owner without enough immobilization. Loeffler et al. reported that the isolation frequency of MRSA from the buccal swabs of dogs was as high as that from the nasal swabs (21). However, in another previous study, the nasal, axillary, and rectal swabs of dogs were tested for isolation MRSA, and the MRSA isolate was obtained only from the rectum (11). C</context>

AM904732); therefore, the SCCmec type of these 23 MRSP isolates was presumed to be type II-III. There are only a limited number of reports pertaining to the SCCmec type among MRSP isolates (8, 30, 38); accordingly, more data regarding the SCCmec types among MRSP isolates are needed in order to understand the reasons for the sudden emergence of MRSP, although canine S. intermedius isolates, which were presumed to be S. pseudintermedius in the previous studies (3, 39), have been reported as being susceptible to -lactam antibiotics in the past (41, 46). Although contact with MRSA animal patients has also been recognized as a factor associated with MRSP carriage, the reason for this association is unknown. A previous study has suggested the transmission of multidrug-resistant S. intermedius species among dogs affected by deep pyoderma and their owners (9). Therefore, animal patients could transmit MRSP infection to humans. Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) isolates are generally susceptible to most of the antimicrobial agents studied, except -lactam antibi</context>

To identify the species of isolates other than S. aureus, direct sequencing of the sodA and hsp60 genes was performed as previously described (19, 37, 39). Sequencing reactions were performed using a Big Dye Terminator version 1.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Additionally, restriction patterns produced by MboI (Takara Bio, Ltd., Shiga, Japan) digestion of PCR 1-amplified pta were also analyzed for the identification of S. pseudintermedius by the method of Bannoehr et al. (4). SCCmec typing was performed by amplification of the mec regions (classes A, B, and C) and the ccr regions (types 1, 2, 3, and 5). The class of mec complex was determined by M-PCR 2 (18). The type of ccr complex was determined by M-PCR 3 (which detects types 1, 2, and 3) (16) or PCR 2 (which detects type 5). Moreover, M-PCR 4 was performed to determine the structure of SCCmec using the strategy of Oliveira and de Lencastre (33) with Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes).

Another previous study reported MRSA colonization in a dog whose owner was a nurse caring for MRSA patients; it was concluded that the dog contracted the infection from the nurse, who was found to be a carrier of MRSA infection (50).

Although it was reported that some MRSP isolates from dog patients had low-level resistance to oxacillin (MIC, 2 to 4 g/ml) (38), all MRSP isolates obtained in this study showed high-level resistance to oxacillin (MIC, 16 g/ml). The CHROMagar MRSA medium might be unable to detect MRSP that has low-level resistance to oxacillin. Descloux et al. described canine MRSP isolates with a new SCCmec type II-III, resulting from a combination of S. aureus SCCmec type III and Staphylococcus epidermidis SCCmec type II (8). The structure of SCCmec in 23 MRSP isolates, as confirmed by M-PCR 4 and PCR 3, matched the DNA sequence of SCCmec type II-III (GenBank accession no. AM904732); therefore, the SCCmec type of these 23 MRSP isolates was presumed to be type II-III. There are only a limited number of reports pertaining to the SCCmec type among MRSP isolates (8, 30, 38); accordingly, more data regarding the SCCmec types among MRSP isolates are needed in order to understand the reasons for the sudden emergence of MRSP, although canine S. intermedius isolates, which were presumed to be S. pseudintermedius in the pr</context>

Although contact with MRSA animal patients has also been recognized as a factor associated with MRSP carriage, the reason for this association is unknown. A previous study has suggested the transmission of multidrug-resistant S. intermedius species among dogs affected by deep pyoderma and their owners (9). Therefore, animal patients could transmit MRSP infection to humans. Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) isolates are generally susceptible to most of the antimicrobial agents studied, except -lactam antibiotics (32, 36, 49). Almost all MRSA and MRSP isolates investigated in this study were multidrug resistant but susceptible to the antibiotics used for treating MRSA infection in medical practice. All of the MRSP isolates were susceptible to imipenem and minocycline, although most of the MRSA isolates were resistant to these antibiotics.

It is suggested that animal patients spread MRSA infection among human individuals in veterinary hospitals. Contact with MRSA-infected animals has previously been identified as a risk factor among equine veterinarians (1); however, it has never been identified among companion-animal veterinarians and personnel attending a veterinary surgery conference (6, 12, 28). The higher risk of MRSA carriage among employees might be attributed to their frequency of contact with each animal patient, their closeness of contact during treatment, and the duration of their experience in terms of contact with animal patients. Since contact with MRSA-infected animal patients is a factor considered to be associated with MRSA carriage, it can be inferred that MRSA carriers may originally have been infected by animal patients. However, a study conducted on 31 outpatient dogs in Japan reported that MRSA isolates were not detected in any of the dogs (38); similar previous st</context>

The prevalence of hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) infection among inpatients in intensive care units (ICUs) continues to increase steadily in Japan. Recently, cases of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) have been documented in persons without an established risk factor for HA-MRSA infection (14, 32, 36, 49). There has also been an increase in the number of reports of the isolation of MRSA from veterinarians and companion animals (5, 21, 23â€“26, 28, 31, 34, 38, 44, 50, 51, 53). Values reported for the prevalence of MRSA among veterinary staff include 17.9% in the United Kingdom (21), 10% in Japan (38), 3.9% in Scotland (13), and 3.0% in Denmark (28). Loeffler et al. reported that the prevalence of MRSA among dog patients and healthy dogs owned by veterinary staff members was 8.9% (21). In Japan, an MRSA isolate was detected in only one inpatient dog (3.8%) and could not be detected in any of 31 outpatient dogs (38). In the United States, MRSA isolates were detected in both dog (0.1%) and cat (0.1%) patients (31). The prevalence of MRSA among healthy dogs has been reported to be 0.7% (5).

The dog patient had undergone medical examinations in the clinical department to which the veterinarian belonged. This clone might, therefore, have spread from the veterinarian to the dog patient by direct contact or through the medium of contaminated environments. In this study, the frequencies of MRSA infection among veterinarians and staff members in the veterinary hospital was found to be 19.5% (8/41) and 15.1% (8/53) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. These frequencies are comparable to the values reported in a previous study in the United Kingdom (17.9%) (21) and that reported in a study of veterinary personnel attending a veterinary surgery conference (17.3%) (6); however, these values were higher than those reported in a Japanese veterinary teaching hospital (10%) (38), in Scotland (3.9%) (13), and in Denmark (3.0%) (28). Moreover, the frequency of MRSA carriers has been reported to be only 0.54% among dog owners (5).

MRSA was not detected in the five buccal mucosa samples of dogs owned by MRCPS-positive individuals. We chose buccal swab and not nasal swab, which is the traditional sample for MRSA isolation, because sampling from dogs was done at home by each owner without enough immobilization. Loeffler et al. reported that the isolation frequency of MRSA from the buccal swabs of dogs was as high as that from the nasal swabs (21). However, in another previous study, the nasal, axillary, and rectal swabs of dogs were tested for isolation MRSA, and the MRSA isolate was obtained only from the rectum (11). Combination sampling of the nasal, buccal, and rectal swabs obtained from dogs may facilitate detection of MRSA carriage. In this investigation, we used the CHROMagar MRSA medium for the isolation of MRCPS. This medium has been reported to be highly effective in selecting for MRSA (10, 45).

The molecular and epidemiological analyses undertaken in the present study could provide some information regarding the transmission of MRSA between humans and companion animals in a veterinary hospital. MRSA carriers can be a source of MRSA infection in animals. MRSA animal patients may then, in turn, lead to MRSA infection in other individuals. Moreover, MRSA contamination was detected in the veterinary hospital environment. MRSA contamination in veterinary hospitals has been reported in previous studies (13, 21).

However, a study conducted on 31 outpatient dogs in Japan reported that MRSA isolates were not detected in any of the dogs (38); similar previous studies have also reported that the prevalence of MRSA among dogs and cats was low (5, 31). Manian reported a case in which MRSA colonization was detected in a dog, which was believed to be the source of recurrent MRSA infection in its owner, a diabetes patient, and his wife; the dog was believed to have contracted the infection through contact with the owner (24). Another previous study reported MRSA colonization in a dog whose owner was a nurse caring for MRSA patients; it was concluded that the dog contracted the infection from the nurse, who was found to be a carrier of MRSA infection (50). Thus, human MRSA carriers can also be a source of MRSA infection in animals encountered in veterinary medical practice. In the present study, the MRSA isolate with SCCmec type FIG. 1.

There is little data regarding multilocus sequence analysis of MRSA having spa type t1767; however, the only MRSA with spa type t1767, which was isolated in Hong Kong, belonged to ST8 (http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/). Although the 10 human MRSA carriers were treated to eradicate colonization, two of these carriers were found to be harboring MRSA isolates even after 1 month of treatment. Recurrent MRSA infection in a patient and healthy MRSA carriers has been reported previously (24, 50). The genotype of MRSA from a recurrent carrier changed from SCCmec type II without kdp gene and spa type t1265 to SCCmec type II harboring the kdp gene and spa type t002. Because the latter genotype was more common among the MRSA isolates obtained from veterinary staff and environmental surfaces, this carrier might be infected from other MRSA carriers or contaminated environmental surfaces. Treatment of MRSA carriers should be undertaken simultaneously with the disinfection of the entire hospital and implementation of hand hygiene practices, which has been reported as a strong protective fact</context>

Descloux et al. described canine MRSP isolates with a new SCCmec type II-III, resulting from a combination of S. aureus SCCmec type III and Staphylococcus epidermidis SCCmec type II (8). The structure of SCCmec in 23 MRSP isolates, as confirmed by M-PCR 4 and PCR 3, matched the DNA sequence of SCCmec type II-III (GenBank accession no. AM904732); therefore, the SCCmec type of these 23 MRSP isolates was presumed to be type II-III. There are only a limited number of reports pertaining to the SCCmec type among MRSP isolates (8, 30, 38); accordingly, more data regarding the SCCmec types among MRSP isolates are needed in order to understand the reasons for the sudden emergence of MRSP, although canine S. intermedius isolates, which were presumed to be S. pseudintermedius in the previous studies (3, 39), have been reported as being susceptible to -lactam antibiotics in the past (41, 46). Although contact with MRSA animal patients has also been recognized as a factor associated with MRSP carriage, the reason for this association is unknown.

Loeffler et al. reported that the prevalence of MRSA among dog patients and healthy dogs owned by veterinary staff members was 8.9% (21). In Japan, an MRSA isolate was detected in only one inpatient dog (3.8%) and could not be detected in any of 31 outpatient dogs (38). In the United States, MRSA isolates were detected in both dog (0.1%) and cat (0.1%) patients (31). The prevalence of MRSA among healthy dogs has been reported to be 0.7% (5). Hanselman et al. suggested that MRSA colonization may be an occupational risk for large-animal veterinarians (12). Recently, Burstiner et al. reported that the frequency of MRSA colonization among companion-animal veterinary personnel was equal to the frequency among large-animal veterinary personnel (6).

Since contact with MRSA-infected animal patients is a factor considered to be associated with MRSA carriage, it can be inferred that MRSA carriers may originally have been infected by animal patients. However, a study conducted on 31 outpatient dogs in Japan reported that MRSA isolates were not detected in any of the dogs (38); similar previous studies have also reported that the prevalence of MRSA among dogs and cats was low (5, 31). Manian reported a case in which MRSA colonization was detected in a dog, which was believed to be the source of recurrent MRSA infection in its owner, a diabetes patient, and his wife; the dog was believed to have contracted the infection through contact with the owner (24). Another previous study reported MRSA colonization in a dog whose owner was a nurse caring for MRSA patients; it was concluded that the dog contracted the infection from the nurse, who was found to be a carrier of MRSA infection (50). Thus, human MRSA carriers can also be a source of MRSA infection in animals encountered </context>

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important cause of nosocomial infections in human hospitals. The prevalence of hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) infection among inpatients in intensive care units (ICUs) continues to increase steadily in Japan. Recently, cases of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) have been documented in persons without an established risk factor for HA-MRSA infection (14, 32, 36, 49). There has also been an increase in the number of reports of the isolation of MRSA from veterinarians and companion animals (5, 21, 23â€“26, 28, 31, 34, 38, 44, 50, 51, 53).

Although contact with MRSA animal patients has also been recognized as a factor associated with MRSP carriage, the reason for this association is unknown. A previous study has suggested the transmission of multidrug-resistant S. intermedius species among dogs affected by deep pyoderma and their owners (9). Therefore, animal patients could transmit MRSP infection to humans. Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) isolates are generally susceptible to most of the antimicrobial agents studied, except -lactam antibiotics (32, 36, 49). Almost all MRSA and MRSP isolates investigated in this study were multidrug resistant but susceptible to the antibiotics used for treating MRSA infection in medical practice. All of the MRSP isolates were susceptible to imipenem and minocycline, although most of the MRSA isolates were resistant to these antibiotics. On the other hand, MRSS was susceptible to most antibiotics. Hisata et al. reported that MIC to oxacillin and imipenem differed between SCCmec types or subtypes of MRSA (14).

Moreover, the frequency of MRSA carriers has been reported to be only 0.54% among dog owners (5). SCCmec type II was prevalent among the MRSA isolates obtained from individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital and from dog patients. Most of the MRSA isolates with SCCmec type II also harbored spa type t002. A majority of the hospitalacquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) isolates identified in Japan also harbor SCCmec type II and are derived from the New York/ Japan clone (multilocus sequence type 5 [ST5]) (17, 22, 36, 54). The MRSA of the Japan clone is generally known to have spa type t002 (http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/). MRSA isolates with SCCmec type II have been isolated from patients without established risk factors for HA-MRSA (36). Moreover, MRSA isolates with SCCmec type II have also been isolated from healthy children (14); thus, infection of this MRSA clone has already spread from hospital environments to a wider community, including veterinary staff and animal patients, in Japan.

A combination of PFGE and spa typing was more useful than either method alone in discriminating MRSA isolates. MRSA isolates with SCCmec type I were obtained only in 2008, and these isolates also had spa type t1767. Isolates with SCCmec type I are not commonly encountered in human hospitals; however, they are sometimes isolated from Japanese hospital inpatients at risk of HA-MRSA infection (36, 54). It has been reported that MRSA isolates harboring SCCmec type I obtained from inpatients belong to ST 8 or ST 30 strains (36, 54). There is little data regarding multilocus sequence analysis of MRSA having spa type t1767; however, the only MRSA with spa type t1767, which was isolated in Hong Kong, belonged to ST8 (http://www.spaserver.ridom.de/). Although the 10 human MRSA carriers were treated to eradicate colonization, two of these carriers were found to be harboring MRSA isolates even after 1 month of treatment.

Although contact with MRSA animal patients has also been recognized as a factor associated with MRSP carriage, the reason for this association is unknown. A previous study has suggested the transmission of multidrug-resistant S. intermedius species among dogs affected by deep pyoderma and their owners (9). Therefore, animal patients could transmit MRSP infection to humans. Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) isolates are generally susceptible to most of the antimicrobial agents studied, except -lactam antibiotics (32, 36, 49). Almost all MRSA and MRSP isolates investigated in this study were multidrug resistant but susceptible to the antibiotics used for treating MRSA infection in medical practice. All of the MRSP isolates were susceptible to imipenem and minocycline, although most of the MRSA isolates were resistant to these antibiotics. On the other hand, MRSS was susceptible to most antibiotics. Hisata et al. reported that MIC to oxacillin and imipenem differed between SCCmec types or subtypes of MRSA (14).

Recently, cases of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) have been documented in persons without an established risk factor for HA-MRSA infection (14, 32, 36, 49). There has also been an increase in the number of reports of the isolation of MRSA from veterinarians and companion animals (5, 21, 23â€“26, 28, 31, 34, 38, 44, 50, 51, 53). Values reported for the prevalence of MRSA among veterinary staff include 17.9% in the United Kingdom (21), 10% in Japan (38), 3.9% in Scotland (13), and 3.0% in Denmark (28). Loeffler et al. reported that the prevalence of MRSA among dog patients and healthy dogs owned by veterinary staff members was 8.9% (21). In Japan, an MRSA isolate was detected in only one inpatient dog (3.8%) and could not be detected in any of 31 outpatient dogs (38). In the United States, MRSA isolates were detected in both dog (0.1%) and cat (0.1%) patients (31). The prevalence of MRSA among healthy dogs has been reported to be 0.7% (5).

In addition, other methicillin-resistant coagulase-positive staphylococci (MRCPS), such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus schleiferi (MRSS), isolated from dogs, cats, and a veterinarian have been reported (11, 31, 38, 40, 52). MRSP isolates have also been detected among inpatient dogs (46.2%) and outpatient dogs (19.4%) in a Japanese veterinary teaching hospital (38). In Canada, however, MRSP and MRSS isolates were detected in only 2.1% and 0.5% of dog patients, respectively (11).

The higher risk of MRSA carriage among employees might be attributed to their frequency of contact with each animal patient, their closeness of contact during treatment, and the duration of their experience in terms of contact with animal patients. Since contact with MRSA-infected animal patients is a factor considered to be associated with MRSA carriage, it can be inferred that MRSA carriers may originally have been infected by animal patients. However, a study conducted on 31 outpatient dogs in Japan reported that MRSA isolates were not detected in any of the dogs (38); similar previous studies have also reported that the prevalence of MRSA among dogs and cats was low (5, 31). Manian reported a case in which MRSA colonization was detected in a dog, which was believed to be the source of recurrent MRSA infection in its owner, a diabetes patient, and his wife; the dog was believed to have contracted the infection through contact with the owner (24). Another previous study reported MRSA colonization in a dog whose owner was a nurse caring for MRSA patients; it was concluded that the dog contracted the infection from the nurse, who was found to be a carrier of </context>

In this study, the frequencies of MRSA infection among veterinarians and staff members in the veterinary hospital was found to be 19.5% (8/41) and 15.1% (8/53) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. These frequencies are comparable to the values reported in a previous study in the United Kingdom (17.9%) (21) and that reported in a study of veterinary personnel attending a veterinary surgery conference (17.3%) (6); however, these values were higher than those reported in a Japanese veterinary teaching hospital (10%) (38), in Scotland (3.9%) (13), and in Denmark (3.0%) (28).

In this investigation, we used the CHROMagar MRSA medium for the isolation of MRCPS. This medium has been reported to be highly effective in selecting for MRSA (10, 45). In a previous study describing the prevalence of MRSP, samples were directly inoculated onto mannitol-salt agar containing 2 mg/liter oxacillin and after the enrichment of staphylococci in broth containing 7.5% sodium chloride (11). In other studies, MRSP isolates were selected from staphylococcal strains by testing their susceptibility to oxacillin (38, 40). The CHROMagar MRSA medium used in this study contained 6 mg/liter cefoxitin. Although we did not determine the MICs of cefoxitin for the MRSP isolates obtained in this study, we found that approximately half of the MRSP isolates were susceptible to cefazolin. Sasaki et al. also reported that almost all MRSP isolates were susceptible to cefazolin and cefotiame (38). The higher susceptibility of MRSP to cephalosporin than MRSA might explain why the colony size of MRSP on the CHROMagar MRSA medium was considerably smaller than that of MRSA.

Descloux et al. described canine MRSP isolates with a new SCCmec type II-III, resulting from a combination of S. aureus SCCmec type III and Staphylococcus epidermidis SCCmec type II (8). The structure of SCCmec in 23 MRSP isolates, as confirmed by M-PCR 4 and PCR 3, matched the DNA sequence of SCCmec type II-III (GenBank accession no.

Moreover, the MRSA isolates of spa type t002 were grouped into seven clusters by PFGE, and the SCCmec types therein were classified into different subtypes. It is not known whether the SCCmec type II clone varies in veterinary medical practice or if some clones with a small genetic diversity have been introduced into the veterinary hospital. The PFGE method can help divide MRSA isolates into more groups than spa typing, as shown in a previous study (44). Although spa types depend on the DNA sequence of only region X of the spa gene, PFGE profiles depend on the numbers and positions of the restriction sites in the DNA sequence of the entire genome. Therefore, PFGE enables better discrimination between strains. On the other hand, spa typing enabled comparison of the MRSA isolates obtained in this study with those reported in other studies.

Combination sampling of the nasal, buccal, and rectal swabs obtained from dogs may facilitate detection of MRSA carriage. In this investigation, we used the CHROMagar MRSA medium for the isolation of MRCPS. This medium has been reported to be highly effective in selecting for MRSA (10, 45). In a previous study describing the prevalence of MRSP, samples were directly inoculated onto mannitol-salt agar containing 2 mg/liter oxacillin and after the enrichment of staphylococci in broth containing 7.5% sodium chloride (11). In other studies, MRSP isolates were selected from staphylococcal strains by testing their susceptibility to oxacillin (38, 40).

There are only a limited number of reports pertaining to the SCCmec type among MRSP isolates (8, 30, 38); accordingly, more data regarding the SCCmec types among MRSP isolates are needed in order to understand the reasons for the sudden emergence of MRSP, although canine S. intermedius isolates, which were presumed to be S. pseudintermedius in the previous studies (3, 39), have been reported as being susceptible to -lactam antibiotics in the past (41, 46). Although contact with MRSA animal patients has also been recognized as a factor associated with MRSP carriage, the reason for this association is unknown. A previous study has suggested the transmission of multidrug-resistant S. intermedius species among dogs affected by deep pyoderma and their owners (9).

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important cause of nosocomial infections in human hospitals. The prevalence of hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) infection among inpatients in intensive care units (ICUs) continues to increase steadily in Japan. Recently, cases of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) have been documented in persons without an established risk factor for HA-MRSA infection (14, 32, 36, 49). There has also been an increase in the number of reports of the isolation of MRSA from veterinarians and companion animals (5, 21, 23â€“26, 28, 31, 34, 38, 44, 50, 51, 53). Values reported for the prevalence of MRSA among veterinary staff include 17.9% in the United Kingdom (21), 10% in Japan (38), 3.9% in Scotland (13), and 3.0% in Denmark (28). Loeffler et al. reported that the prevalence of MRSA among dog patients and healthy dogs owned by veterinary staff members was 8.9% (21).

Manian reported a case in which MRSA colonization was detected in a dog, which was believed to be the source of recurrent MRSA infection in its owner, a diabetes patient, and his wife; the dog was believed to have contracted the infection through contact with the owner (24). Another previous study reported MRSA colonization in a dog whose owner was a nurse caring for MRSA patients; it was concluded that the dog contracted the infection from the nurse, who was found to be a carrier of MRSA infection (50).

Because the latter genotype was more common among the MRSA isolates obtained from veterinary staff and environmental surfaces, this carrier might be infected from other MRSA carriers or contaminated environmental surfaces.
