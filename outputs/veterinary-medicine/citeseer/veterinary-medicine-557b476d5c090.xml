			<abstract>
				<p>A fast and generic method has been developed for the simultaneous monitoring of &gt;250 pesticides and veterinary drugs (VDs) in animal feed. A 'dilute-and-shoot' extraction with water and acetonitrile (1 % formic acid) followed by a clean-up step with Florisil cartridges was applied. The extracts were analysed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid analyser quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry using both positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The detection of the residues was accomplished by retention time and accurate mass using an in-house database. The identification of the detected compounds was carried out by searching of fragment ions for each compound and isotopic pattern. The optimised method was validated and recoveries ranged from 60 % to 120 % at three concentrations (10, 50 and 100 μg kg −1) for 30 %, 68 % and 80 % of compounds, respectively, included in the database (364) in chicken feed. Document SANCO 12495/2011 and Directive 2002/657/CE were used as guidelines for method validation. Intra-day and inter-day precisions, expressed as relative standard deviations, were lower than 20 % for more than 90 % of compounds. The limits of quantification ranged from 4 to 200 μg kg −1 for most analytes, which are sufficient to verify compliance of products with legal tolerances. The applicability of the procedure was further tested on different types of feed (chicken, hen, rabbit and horse feed), evaluating recoveries and repeatability. Finally, the method was applied to the analysis of 18 feed samples, detecting some VDs (sulfadia-zine, trimethoprim, robenidin and monensin Na) and only one pesticide (chlorpyrifos).</p>

This could be due to the high volume of acetonitrile employed, which is not efficient to extract polar analytes like tetracyclines and penicillins because of co-precipitation of some analytes with the proteins. However, the chromatograms obtained after UHPLC–QqTOF–MS analysis showed 6546 M.M. Aguilera-Luiz et al. numerous background interference peaks for some compounds (Fig. 1a). This can be explained because of the complexity of this matrix, which contains cereals, sugars/fruits, fats, roots/tubers, leguminous/oleaginous plants, amino acids and/or minerals [7]. Therefore, the high complexity of the matrix makes the clean-up of the extracts almost mandatory to obtain reliable results, except in cases where the sensitivity of the method is high enough to offer the option of simply diluting the extracts. Hence, clean-up is an important step when extracts are analysed with TOF, which has showed lower sensitivity than other HRMS analyser, such as Orbitrap, in certain food applications [38]. Bearing in mind this and the results obtained in the first experiment, an additional clean-up stage was checked. In this way, three fast clean-up procedures were eva</context>

This can be explained bearing in mind the acquisition mode of the fragments based on the MSE procedure. Despite its aforementioned advantages, the success of the MSE approach can be limited by the quality of the spectrum [31]. The low sensitivity or strongly interfered spectra make difficult the identification of compounds using fragments at low concentrations. As aforementioned, many analytical methods have been developed for the determination of compounds belonging to one family of pesticides or VDs in feed [7, 14, 23, 39, 40]. Nevertheless, the number of multi-class or wide-scope multiclass methods is scarce. In consequence, it is important to highlight the ability of the proposed method to analyse a high variety of pesticides and VDs in different feed samples. If the proposed method is compared with the published multi-class methods developed for the determination of VDs [22, 24, 41] and pesticides [15, 17] in feed, it can be indicated that the combination of a generic extraction method with UHPLC–QqTOF–MS analysis is simpler and faster than previous methods.

Furthermore, these products have been completely banned on December 2012 [11]. Thus, VDs should be strictly applied for the prevention or treatment of diseases. In this way, these regulated limits require the determination of an extremely high number of VD and pesticide residues in feed with the aim of ensuring their use in a rational and safe way. Therefore, sensitive and reliable methodologies have been developed for the analysis of each group of residues separately. The determination of pesticides in feed has been based on Soxhlet [12–14], pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) [15], matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) [16] or QuEChERS [17].

The low sensitivity or strongly interfered spectra make difficult the identification of compounds using fragments at low concentrations.

Concerning the performance characteristics, the developed method allowed the extraction and quantification of a high number of VDs and pesticides at low levels (10 μg kg−1). These results are better than those obtained in a previous multi-class method developed for the determination of 122 pesticides [17], where some pesticides were validated at a higher concentration, 50 μg kg−1 (for example atrazine, carbaryl or metalaxyl). In another study, 100 μg kg−1 was the lowest level at which antibacterial compounds were determined [22]. In contrast to this, a multi-class method developed for the analysis of 33 VDs [41] showed good recoveries at low levels (&amp;lt;10 μg kg−1). Regarding LOQs, the obtained values in the proposed method (ranged from 4 to 200 μg kg−1 in sample) were lower than those obtained in two previous works [17, 22]. The first one determined pesticides in wheat grain (7– 400 μg kg−1) [17] and the second one measured VDs in pig and poultry compound feed (100–169 μg kg−1) [22].

Despite the higher levels of LOQ obtained for some compounds, many of them were lower than MRLs established by the legislation for some specific compounds, as it can be seen in Table 2. In general, it can be observed that the obtained LOQs were relatively high. This can be explained bearing in mind the acquisition mode of the fragments based on the MSE procedure. Despite its aforementioned advantages, the success of the MSE approach can be limited by the quality of the spectrum [31]. The low sensitivity or strongly interfered spectra make difficult the identification of compounds using fragments at low concentrations. As aforementioned, many analytical methods have been developed for the determination of compounds belonging to one family of pesticides or VDs in feed [7, 14, 23, 39, 40]. Nevertheless, the number of multi-class or wide-scope multiclass methods is scarce. In consequence, it is important to highlight the ability of the proposed method to analyse a high variety of pesticides and VDs in different feed samples.

In this way, the combination of ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) with TOF, QqTOF or Orbitrap analysers has demonstrated to be an excellent tool for the analysis of different classes of residues and contaminants in food and environmental samples [30–32]. However, the number of applications in feed matrices is quite limited [28, 33, 34], where a group of pesticides, VDs, mycotoxins and plant toxins are determined in horse feed [28, 33] and coccidiostats in animal feed [34]. Therefore, the aim of this work is the development of a reliable and sensitive methodology based on the use of advanced UHPLC–QqTOF–MS technique for the quantitative determination and reliable identification of more than 250 pesticides and VDs in different types of feed matrices using generic methods.

Moreover, accurate mass errors must be &amp;lt;5 ppm, as well as the isotopic pattern of the fragment ion must be similar to the theoretically profile of the empirical formulae. Optimisation of the extraction method The generic extraction method developed by Mol et al. [33] allowed the extraction of a wide set of pesticides, VDs and other contaminants in feed. A slight modification of this method has already been employed for the simultaneous determination of pesticides and VDs in other matrices such as honey in our laboratory [35], and it was selected as the starting point herein. Initially, the experiments were carried out employing blank chicken feed samples spiked at 100 μg kg−1.

Moreover, these methods were developed for a limited number of compounds. One of the main disadvantages of the proposed method is that it was not able to extract and quantify some families of compounds, such as tetracyclines, quinolones or penicillins, which were analysed in other works [24, 41] with good recoveries, and therefore, current work is focused on this. If it is compared with the two wide-scope multi-class methods previously developed for analysis of VDs and pesticides in feed samples (horse feed and cereal-based product, respectively) [33, 42], some advantages can be mentioned. Firstly, the generic extraction method was developed from Mol et al. [33], which is similar to the method proposed in this work, with a slight modification by the addition of a simple clean-up step. Secondly, the generic extraction method is faster than the method developed by van der Lee et al. [42], where the extraction time was 18 h and it required a clean-up procedure by gel permeation chromatography and SPE. Furthermore, the number of pesticides and VDs validated with our method was higher or similar than the number of compounds of both works, 106 compo</context>

Feed samples Different types of feed samples were purchased from several markets in Almería, Granada, Murcia (Spain) and local farms located in Almería. All samples were grinded and stored at room temperature in the dark. A chicken feed sample was used for optimisation and validation purposes, after checking that it was free of the selected compounds. Sample extraction Pesticides and VDs were extracted from feed using an extraction method based on the procedure previously described by Gómez-Pérez et al. [35]. Briefly, 2.5 g of feed was weighed into a 50-mL propylene tube and 2.5 mL of water (LC–MS grade) was added. The mixture was shaken in a vortex. Then 7.5 mL of acetonitrile (1 % formic acid, v/v) was added, and the sample was put into a rotary agitator and extracted by endover-end shaking for 1 h at 50 rpm. After that, the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 4,500 rpm (2,264×g), and 1 mL of the supernatant was passed through a Florisil cartridge.

To this aim, a solventbased standard at 250 μg L−1 was injected into the system, in positive and negative mode, and different parameters of the source and the analyser (scan time, inter-scan time and collision energy of the acquisition functions of LE and HE employed in the MSE mode) were optimised in order to improve absolute sensitivity of the characteristic ions, observing that the conditions indicated in the previous section provided suitable results. Secondly, in relation to the chromatographic conditions, generic chromatographic conditions reported in a previous study [35] were used. The overall analysis time was 14 min, and the retention time ranged from 0.9 (cyromazine) to 9.4 min (narasin and salinomycin). In order to develop a database for the detection of the target compounds, the analytes were characterised and the essential information includes retention time (RT), ionisation mode (polarity), characteristic ions and possible adducts (i.e. with Na+ or NH4 +).

Therefore, the generic approach using a SPE clean-up step was chosen and tested at lower concentrations in the further validation: 10 μg kg−1 and 50 μg kg−1. Validation Ion suppression or matrix enhancement is an important parameter that must be evaluated during method validation. To study matrix effect, two calibration sets (from 1 to 150 μg kg−1) were compared: solvent and matrix-matched standard calibration, using chicken feed. Matrix effect was calculated as described elsewhere [35]. It can be noticed that matrix effect was observed for 86 % of the compounds: 49 % of the analytes showed ion suppression and 37 % of the compounds matrix enhancement. On the other hand, only 14 % of the compounds showed a slight ion suppression (7 %) or ion enhancement (7 %). Consequently, matrix-matched standard calibration was used for quantification purposes. Linearity was then evaluated in the range from 1 to 150 μg kg−1.

Therefore, the high complexity of the matrix makes the clean-up of the extracts almost mandatory to obtain reliable results, except in cases where the sensitivity of the method is high enough to offer the option of simply diluting the extracts. Hence, clean-up is an important step when extracts are analysed with TOF, which has showed lower sensitivity than other HRMS analyser, such as Orbitrap, in certain food applications [38]. Bearing in mind this and the results obtained in the first experiment, an additional clean-up stage was checked. In this way, three fast clean-up procedures were evaluated: (1) d-SPE with Florisil, (2) d-SPEwith C18 and (3) SPE employing Florisil cartridges. For d-SPE clean-ups, 1 mL of sample extract was taken to an Eppendorf tube containing 100 mg of Florisil or C18 dispersive phase.

These results are better than those obtained in a previous multi-class method developed for the determination of 122 pesticides [17], where some pesticides were validated at a higher concentration, 50 μg kg−1 (for example atrazine, carbaryl or metalaxyl). In another study, 100 μg kg−1 was the lowest level at which antibacterial compounds were determined [22]. In contrast to this, a multi-class method developed for the analysis of 33 VDs [41] showed good recoveries at low levels (&amp;lt;10 μg kg−1). Regarding LOQs, the obtained values in the proposed method (ranged from 4 to 200 μg kg−1 in sample) were lower than those obtained in two previous works [17, 22]. The first one determined pesticides in wheat grain (7– 400 μg kg−1) [17] and the second one measured VDs in pig and poultry compound feed (100–169 μg kg−1) [22]. However, other works showed better LOQs, such as those Table 2 Comparison of MRL established for some VDs and pesticides in animal feed with LOQs obtained with the proposed method Compound Animal feed MRL (μg kg−1) LOQ (μg</context>

[41] (LOQs ranging from 3.8 to 65 μg kg−1 in sample, piglet feed) and by Kantiani et al. [24] (instrumental LOQs from 0.57 to 2.92 μg kg−1). These low LOQ values can be explained due to the fact that both works employed QqQ as analyser, which showed better sensitivity than QqTOF using MSE. Moreover, these methods were developed for a limited number of compounds. One of the main disadvantages of the proposed method is that it was not able to extract and quantify some families of compounds, such as tetracyclines, quinolones or penicillins, which were analysed in other works [24, 41] with good recoveries, and therefore, current work is focused on this. If it is compared with the two wide-scope multi-class methods previously developed for analysis of VDs and pesticides in feed samples (horse feed and cereal-based product, respectively) [33, 42], some advantages can be mentioned. Firstly, the generic extraction method was developed from Mol et al. [33], which is similar to the method proposed in this work, with a slight modification by the addition of a simple clean-up step. Secondly, the generic extraction method is faster than the method developed by van der Lee et al. [4</context>

The coccidiostat monensin sodium was detected in five feed samples: rabbit (two), pig (one), lamb (one) and horse (one) feed (Table 3). This coccidiostat is used as additive in feed to protect animals against coccidiosis in animal husbandry, which can explain its occurrence.

An important result concerns that only one pesticide was found, chlorpyrifos, which was detected in four samples at concentrations higher than the MRL (Table 3) in all cases. Its occurrence can be explained as a consequence of its wide application in agriculture and, thus, in the cereals used to produce feed. Besides, this pesticide is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as ‘one of the most widely used organophosphate insecticides’ [46]. Conclusions As aforementioned, the development of wide-scope multiresidue methods able to cover the analysis of pesticide and VD residues in feed is a current need due to the gap that exists in this area of feed safety. Consequently, in this work, an UHPLC–QqTOF–MS method has been developed for simultaneous determination of a huge number of target pesticides and VD residues in feed. A generic sample procedure followed by a simple clean-up step by Florisil cartridges was selected as the most appropriate for the analysis of the wide range of compounds in feed in terms of recovery yields and ma</context>
