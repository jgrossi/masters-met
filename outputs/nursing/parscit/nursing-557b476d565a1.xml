<bodyText confidence="0.975234394736842">
The professional literature predicts worldwide perioperative nursing shortages.
Compounding this is the absence of perioperative curricula in most nursing programs,
which reduces new graduate interest in and awareness of employment opportunities
in the OR environment. Educators at a university and a large hospital system formed
an innovative partnership to create a pilot undergraduate nursing course to better
prepare nurses for the surgical setting. The course was offered in a condensedsemester format and included online activities, simulation experiences, classroom
discussions, and clinical experiences in a small group setting. Two of the four nursing
students in the course were hired directly into the perioperative setting after graduation, decreasing hospital costs related to recruitment and orientation. The success of
the course led to its integration into the undergraduate curriculum, thus providing
a valuable elective option for junior and senior nursing students, as well as
achieving a new model for perioperative nursing education. AORN J 101 (January

T
here is a critical shortage of perioperative
nurses,1-5 and the demand for perioperative
nurses in the United States is growing steadily
by 1% to 2% each year.4,6-8 Only a small percentage
of all nurses practice in the perioperative arena, and
it is estimated that nearly 20% of those currently
employed in this specialty area will retire in the
next five years.4 As a result, many health care
environments are beginning to experience the
effects of this long-anticipated perioperative
nursing shortage.4
The shortages in perioperative nursing can be
summarized as the result of many trends that
are intensifying in the workplace today. These
include
n decreased exposure to perioperative nursing
in both the classroom setting and the clinical
environment,1,4

EFFECTS OF CLINICAL NURSING
EDUCATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982029985507246">
Surgical nursing requires specialized training and
skills that are not routinely offered as part of the
curricula in most nursing schools. Instead, the
extent of many nursing students’ exposure to
perioperative nursing is limited to the occasional
observation assignment, which prevents them from
comprehending the role of circulating, scrubbing,
or first assisting during surgical procedures. This
creates a knowledge gap in clinical nursing education. As a result, nurse graduates are not aware of
the full scope of the perioperative specialty and
therefore do not apply for perioperative positions.
The limited number of nursing school faculty
members with perioperative experience also contributes to the lack of perioperative nursing education in academia. In addition, even nurses who
have been in practice for several years often are
unaware of what perioperative nursing practice
entails as a result of the limited exposure to perioperative practices.
Many OR managers have encouraged new nurse
graduates interested in working in the OR to gain
one to two years of medical-surgical unit experience before applying for a position in the surgical
environment (D. Doyle, MS, RN, CNOR, NE-BC,
administrative director of surgery and anesthesia,
Grant Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio; in-person
communication; December 12, 2013). The rationale
for recommending medical-surgical experience is
that it helps the novice nurse develop critical thinking
skills. However, as the new nurse becomes part of
the culture on the medical-surgical unit, the probability of transfer to the OR decreases, thus contributing to the already existing perioperative nursing
shortage. When nurses lack perioperative knowledge
and skills and have limited exposure to this environment, even after gaining medical-surgical unit
experience, they can be uninterested in practicing
perioperative nursing. Furthermore, if these nurses
116 j AORN Journal
BALLeDOYLEeOOCUMMA
are hired into the OR, they may have unrealistic
expectations that can lead to dissatisfaction and
disappointment about the perioperative nurse’s role
and the reality of perioperative nursing.10
Another factor to consider is that nurses with no
previous exposure to perioperative nursing may
decide to quit midway through an intensive orientation program. This in turn creates a financial
burden on the health care facility because orienting
a nurse to the perioperative environment can cost
upward from $59,000 (D. Doyle, MS, RN, CNOR,
NE-BC; in-person communication; December 12,
2013).4 Thus, nurses who quit during an orientation
program can be a tremendous loss for a facility, not
only in dollars but also in human resources (as
discussed more in depth later in this article).
Results from a survey of OR leaders, which was
conducted at a 2012 perioperative nurse leader conference, confirmed the potential for a future shortage
of perioperative nurse leaders.5 Respondents (73.4%)
reported that they are current OR nurses who are
older than 50 years of age, 76% of respondents reported 20 or more years of nursing experience, and
approximately 65% of respondents reported that they
plan to retire in 10 years or less. These results suggest that the anticipated demand for nurse leaders
aligns with other nursing research related to the
perioperative nursing shortage.1,4,6,7,9
Changes in curricula standards for nursing education amplify concerns about the perioperative
nursing shortage.1,11,12 Because programs for an
associate degree in nursing (ADN) and a bachelor
of science in nursing (BSN) contain vast amounts
of professional and clinical information, educational institutions offer fewer courses in clinical
specialty areas.9 Rotations for clinical observation
experiences in the perioperative environment have
been eliminated from many BSN programs, and in
most cases, undergraduate nursing students are not
exposed to perioperative nursing at all during their
clinical or practicum experiences.1,4,9,11 Many individuals being oriented into specialty nursing
practice are recent graduates, and hospital administrators experience difficulty successfully filling

CREATING A PERIOPERATIVE NURSING
PROGRAM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994852255319149">
In 2012, the director of surgery at a Midwestern
hospital system attended a presentation at the
annual AORN Congress about the recruitment of
nursing students into the perioperative specialty
through a partnership with an academic nursing
program. In response to this presentation, this director of surgery recognized the need to create a
pool of potential perioperative nurses to fill staffing
needs and saw an opportunity to address the growing
perioperative nursing shortage in her hospital system. She approached the dean of nursing at a local
university and suggested a partnership between
her hospital system and the university to pilot a
simulation-based elective course to increase interest, knowledge, and skills in perioperative nursing
among senior students. The dean then contacted
one of the university faculty members who is a
perioperative nurse to lead this initiative.
A partnership between the hospital system and
university had previously existed with the creation
of a nurse anesthesia program. That program was
so successful that faculty at the university expected
a partnership for the proposed perioperative nursing
course to be a resounding success. The university
involved in this partnership is located in a residential community of approximately 36,000 residents and is highly acclaimed, ranking 14th among
146 peers in the “UniversitieseMasters (Midwest)”
category of the 2012 edition of America’s Best
Colleges by U.S. News &amp; World Report.15 Annual
student enrollment at the university is more than
3,000 students, who have a choice of 73 majors and
44 minors along with individualized courses of
study. The university offers programs for students
to earn bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees
in nursing. Approximately 60 to 70 students graduate each year from the undergraduate program
for nursing.
The hospital system is a not-for-profit charitable
health care organization that Fortune magazine has
recognized as one of the “100 Best Companies to
Work For.”16 As one of the top five largest health
118 j AORN Journal
systems in America, it comprises a network of 11
hospitals, more than 50 ambulatory sites, hospice
and home-health services, medical equipment
supply, and other health services that span a diverse
rural, urban, suburban, and Appalachian 40-county
area across the state.16,17 With more than 22,000
employees, this hospital system has several facilities that range in size from 100 beds to more than
1,000 beds. Each hospital and several satellite care
sites in this system offer surgical services in their
facilities.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.614878">
Determining the Stakeholders
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992851862068966">
Administrators at both facilities approved the
partnership between the university and the hospital
system. The first step of this collaborative effort
involved determining the stakeholders who would
be directly involved with the creation of the course.
The OR director and the university perioperative
faculty member chose staff members to join them
at the planning table. Selected staff members included four perioperative educators from three of
the hospital facilities, one OR manager, and one
simulation laboratory expert. Although there was
only one faculty member at the university with
perioperative experience, other faculty members
volunteered to help with the course as needed.
These initial stakeholders determined the major
steps in the process of creating and conducting
the perioperative educational experience. These
included
n
establishing the course description and goals,
n developing a curriculum and schedule,
n implementing the course, and
n evaluating the success of the program.
They developed a pilot perioperative elective
course and offered it during a condensed semester,
referred to as a J-term because it was held in
January 2013. The J-term consisted of an intensive three-week learning experience that offered
three credit hours, which is the same number of
credit hours offered by courses that are conducted
during a full semester.

Although the collaborative relationship among
these specific stakeholders was new to all, they
formed an immediate bond. The success of this
close partnership would demonstrate the need, opportunity, and quality of future cross-disciplinary
joint ventures for both the university and the hospital system. The planning committee hoped that
the pilot course would increase academic opportunities in specialty nursing courses offered by the
university and that it would help address staffing
needs within the hospital. For example, the success
of this collaborative partnership could not only
ensure future staffing for the ORs, but also serve as
a model to provide staffing and reduce orientation
time for other specialty nursing areas.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.641857">
Planning Meeting Initiatives
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996563911764706">
The university faculty member created a description of the perioperative course to market it to
senior nursing students. Included in the course
description was the following statement:
This perioperative nursing course will introduce
perioperative nursing, including aseptic technique principles, equipment used in the OR,
perioperative patient care considerations, and
other critical surgical topics. A strong foundation of perioperative knowledge and skills will
be provided in classroom, simulation, Internet,
and clinical experiences. At the end of this
course, the student will realize if perioperative
nursing is a specialty area that is attractive to
the student for future employment.
The planning team reviewed the course description
and determined the following goals for this collaborative effort:
n
Integrate experiential learning and simulation
into the learning/training environment for perioperative nursing students.
n Develop a course that enhances the recruitment
of nurses into the perioperative environment.
An anticipated indirect outcome of this course was
to shorten the overall OR orientation process for
www.aornjournal.org
newly hired graduate nurses who participated in
this perioperative elective.
The university faculty member also introduced
a comprehensive list of course objectives for the
planning team to review. The six course objectives
(Table 1) aligned with the nursing accreditation
standards (ie, Essentials)18 and AORN perioperative standards19 and established a framework to
direct lecture, simulation, and clinical experiences.
After review and approval of the course description
and objectives, the next detail for committee
members to address was determining teaching
methodology for the course.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.88973">
Teaching Methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998881136363636">
Traditional approaches to nursing education, including classroom lectures, laboratory return demonstrations, and basic memorization, often lead to
technical mastery but may not promote critical
thinking.20 Because critical thinking acquisition is
related to structured practice, the design of teaching
and learning strategies needs to promote active
rather than passive learning. According to Kolb,21
learning is a continuous process, and the way a
person thinks and behaves can be changed by
imprinting experiences into existing intellectual
frameworks. Although Kolb’s theory is not recognized as a specific nursing theory, it can be used
as a firm foundation for the creation and implementation of a perioperative nursing course.
Research shows that undergraduate nursing
curricula should prepare students in the skills
required to function effectively on medical teams.22
Therefore, members of the committee chose a
collaborative, experiential, group learning environment to present a valuable teaching atmosphere
and enhance the learning of perioperative knowledge and skills. Committee members hoped that
this type of learning environment would increase
the students’ understanding of group processes,
roles, communication skills, and self-awareness
in a manner conducive to professional growth.
Because teamwork is the foundation of perioperative practice, students’ exposure to collaborative

Critical thinking. Critical thinking is a core skill
in perioperative nursing and can be practiced
through the use of simulation and the application of
adult learning theory.23 Simulation experiences can
help novice students understand specific patient
care situations that may change the manner in
which nursing care is delivered. The student can
feel an increased sense of self-efficacy and confidence in the clinical practice setting when simulation experiences are provided.22,24,25 Being able

providing simulation opportunities in nursing
education, students are able to practice skills and
apply nursing care theoretical principles in a safe
environment.24,25 Advances in technology during
the past decade have generated opportunities to
create realistic simulations during which nursing
students can develop and demonstrate skills and
clinical judgment without endangering real patients.1
Simulation. Although ultimate clinical proficiency was not an objective of this course, planning

Challenges
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.984717923076923">
Committee members identified and discussed
the challenges of this new perioperative course
at the planning meetings. These challenges
included
n
marketing a new elective course to senior
nursing students who have other options for
their between-semester break,
n J-term time limits and the unpredictability of
weather because the course would be conducted
during a winter month,
n limiting the number of students who could be
accommodated while identifying suitable clinical experiences, and
n creating perioperative preceptor criteria.
J-term. The J-term is an intensive experience for
students that is offered each year during the month
of January, which is strategically placed between
the fall and spring semesters. As an optional enrollment opportunity, many innovative electives
that the university offered during J-term (eg, study
abroad, service-type courses) could be seen as
competition for the new course. The planning team
knew that marketing of the new course and J-term
time and enrollment limits could make it difficult
to attract students. Additionally, participating in a
J-term course reduces time off between semesters
from six to two weeks. Students often use this time
off to work, travel home, or take vacations, and
it represents the last academic break for senior
students. Intense marketing for the perioperative
J-term course to address these challenges included
describing the details and benefits of this exciting
new course at some of the fall senior nursing
classes, conducting individual meetings with
students by the perioperative faculty member to
determine interest, and answering e-mail questions
posed by potential students. The passion displayed
by the faculty member for perioperative nursing
was evident to the students and created an enthusiasm
for this course that was demonstrated when it immediately filled to capacity.

Weather. The next challenge involved the unpredictability of weather during the month of
January in this midwestern state. Any course
offered during the winter has the potential for being
adversely affected by the weather. Even though
the course schedule was very intense to allow it to
be completed in three weeks, the planning team
identified, published, and reserved alternate dates
for students to attend backup classes if any were
missed because of inclement weather. If the university had to close because of weather, the simulation or clinical day also would be cancelled. In
the event of a cancelled class due to inclement
weather, students bore the responsibility of contacting their assigned preceptors so that rescheduling could be accomplished.
Enrollment limits. The planning team spent
considerable time discussing the limitations created
by the number of students who could be accommodated and the clinical experiences they would
have. Hospital-site restrictions for staffing and the
space necessary to accommodate the students were
also considered. Across the United States, student
access to perioperative clinical rotations has been
prevented by the high volume of surgical procedures
being performed, limitations on the number of
professionals allowed to be present during specific
procedures, the need for extra scrub attire to clothe
students, and the number of nurses already being
oriented who have priority for experience in surgical
rooms.1 This course represented the first time that
students were allowed to have a clinical experience
in the OR within this hospital system’s campuses.
Therefore, ensuring that personnel in the various
perioperative areas were accepting of the students
was extremely important. The planning team worked
to help ensure that the students had a positive learning
experience, but they also worked hard to see that OR
personnel were supportive of these experiences, saw
them as valuable, and were minimally burdened by
the students’ presence. The planning team used
education and change management strategies to
discuss student presence in the OR and to identify

the advantages of this new elective in various
meetings with OR personnel and surgeons throughout
the planning phase of the course. The planning committee published articles in the hospital newsletter to
communicate progress of planning for this course
within the department. The committee’s decision to
maintain a low enrollment, with a maximum of four
students, was to minimize disruption to OR personnel
and enable a smooth transition to a new learning
model.
Preceptor criteria. The inclusion of students
in the perioperative areas for their clinical experiences was new for the hospital system; therefore,
the planning team had to review the academic and
hospital campus preceptor requirements. The university requires that preceptors have an unencumbered professional nursing license (ie, no violations,
no restrictions on practice) and at least two years
of perioperative experience with a demonstrated
competence in this area of clinical practice. Additionally, the OR managers at the hospital campuses
would need to provide these staff member preceptors during the student’s scheduled clinical days.
The ongoing challenges of nursing shortages in the
OR, the limited number of nurses willing to serve as
preceptors, and the need to provide a consistent
learning experience for the students presented
barriers that had to be addressed before the start
of the course. To address these issues, the course
educators met with each potential preceptor to
discuss the role of the preceptor, student assignments and skills laboratory experiences, and other
expectations to provide a consistent and effective
clinical experience.

The university faculty member along with a team
of OR nurse educators and the simulation laboratory expert led the entire curriculum, as outlined in detail in Table 3. A variety of teaching
methods were used during the course, including
lecture, discussion, case studies, group presentations,
Internet assignments, audiovisuals, demonstration,
simulations, observation, and clinical experiences.

Because each segment of the course was built on
the previous segment (eg, the assignments using the
AORN Periop 101 online modules prepared the
student for the classroom presentations), the classroom presentations reinforced this new information
and allowed students to discuss the material and ask
questions. By the time students entered the simulation laboratory to practice a specific skill, they
had the foundational information to demonstrate
their understanding of the concepts presented in
class. The simulation laboratory also provided a
safe setting for practice without the negative consequences of performing a skill incorrectly in the
clinical setting. The skills could be practiced over
and over until the student felt comfortable and
exhibited competence. Finally, the student entered
the clinical environment to perform the newly
learned perioperative skills in the real setting with
real surgical patients. The students’ clinical time
also allowed them to expand their knowledge of
perioperative nursing by experiencing the sequences of events during the actual care of a surgical patient, which cannot be learned in the
simulation laboratory.
During the course’s first day of class, university
faculty introduced students to various settings in
the perioperative environment and the role of the
perioperative nurse. Perioperative practices are
evidence based; therefore, instructors explained
how to use the AORN Perioperative Standards and
Recommended Practices20 as a valuable resource
and also discussed ethics, professionalism, and
other expectations of a perioperative nurse. Other
topics covered were surgical attire, traffic patterns,
patient flow, responding to emergencies, and perioperative assessment. The students visited the
simulation laboratory to review zones within the
OR and identify routine surgical furniture and
equipment. The hospital educators enacted a simulated exercise portraying the different roles within
the surgical suite, along with how each professional
functions during a procedure. The students were
taught what is sterile and what is not sterile and
how to move within a surgical suite. Later in the

again returned to the laboratory to observe the
setup of a carbon dioxide laser and then to practice
using this energy by writing their names on wet
tongue blades. They also compared the action of the
laser beam on the tissue with the electrosurgical
energy. Instructors discussed other energies used in
surgery, including ultrasonic and thermal (heat and
cryotherapy) energies. Next, the director of the
nurse anesthetist program along with a senior student nurse anesthetist presented a session about
airway maintenance and discussed how the perioperative nurse can best assist an anesthesia professional during induction. The students were then
shown the basics of intubation and were allowed to
try to intubate a simulation manikin to help understand how to best help an anesthesia professional during intubation. At the end of the class, the
students were able to use a laparoscopic simulator
while trying to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The students quickly realized the difficulty maneuvering instruments during laparoscopic
simulation.
During the J-term, the students were able to use
their perioperative knowledge and skills in the
surgical setting. The preceptors managed the students as they circulated and scrubbed for a variety
of different procedures. During the last week of the
course, the students took the final examination,
which was simulated. The four educators set up a
surgical scene portraying the roles of circulating
nurse, scrub nurse, surgeon, and anesthesia professional, with a simulator manikin as the patient.
The students were instructed to write down every
infraction noted (eg, attire, sterile technique,
sterile environment, communication) and were expected to find at least 15 errors during this scenario.
Some of the errors included

At the end of the session, after each student had
completed the quiz, instructors held a debriefing
session to discuss each infraction. This experience
not only provided a great learning experience, but
the students stated that they really had fun with this
type of learning.
In the afternoon of the fourth class session, each
student delivered a presentation on a surgical patient he or she followed during a clinical experience. The students were instructed to pick a
patient during one of their clinical days and visit
with the patient preoperatively to learn about the
patient’s physical, emotional, and mental states and
discuss the surgery to be performed. The student
was expected to accompany the patient into the
surgery suite and assist with the circulating duties.
The student then accompanied the patient to the
postanesthesia care unit area and observed the patient’s experience in this area until discharge. After
obtaining the patient’s permission and referring
only to the patient as “my patient,” the student
prepared and presented the case study to the other
students, educators, OR director, and university
faculty members in the audience. The student also
reflected on this perioperative experience and how
it affected him or her.

mandatory. If a student missed any class or clinical
experience, a make-up plan had to be implemented
to ensure that the student gained the required skills

The university faculty member, OR educators,
and preceptors were able to work very closely with
the students because there were only four students
in this pilot class. The individualized attention was
critical in the careful instruction and assessment
of each perioperative skill needed to successfully
complete the course. Reflections shared by the
students also were extremely valuable to faculty to
help promote positive student attitudes and also

Although a larger number of students completing
this pilot course would offer increased validity of the
identified outcomes, the positive effects of this
partnership are evident. The most notable outcome
for the hospital system was the increased interest in
perioperative nursing that led to two of the four
senior nursing students who completed the course
being hired by two of the hospital campuses. Hiring
these graduating nursing students reduced the
human resource costs of recruiting and hiring nurses
for the perioperative area. Orientation time for new
perioperative nurses can be extensive. Although the
nurse staffing numbers and vacancies may be lower
than within other hospital departments, the orientation length in the perioperative environment is
often five to six times longer (eg, the average orientation time usually reported in this hospital system for perioperative nurses is approximately six
to 12 months because of the intensity of skills required; D. Doyle, MS, RN, CNOR, NE-BC; in
person communication; December 12, 2013). Following the course experiences and interactions with
perioperative leaders and staff members, the orientation time for these two newly hired nurses was
determined to be four to eight months. The reduced
orientation time resulted in the newly hired nurse
becoming functional much sooner, which resulted
in improved productivity for both the preceptor and
the new nurse. Additionally, because the course
also eliminated the talent search process and reduced the application process, the hospital system
also realized a reduced cost in human resource
efforts. The exact dollar figure is undetermined, but
includes human resource and OR manager staffing
time for recruitment, interviewing, and the application process. The two students who did not
chose perioperative nursing went into other
areas. One went into intensive care nursing while
the other student is currently pursuing ministry
with plans that include also working as a perioperative nurse in the future.
Additional outcomes of this perioperative nursing
course included opportunities to offer senior
practicum and nursing electives in various specialty

<bodyText confidence="0.962647848484848">
The shortage of nurses is critical in all practice settings, but especially in perioperative practice.
Approximately 75% of perioperative nurses are 50 years of age or older, and 65% will retire within the
next 10 years.1 Experts anticipate a perioperative nursing shortage if some type of clinical education is
not introduced to nursing students. Ball et al2 have described a program to address these issues.
Current education models do not offer an adequate amount of perioperative clinical experience
to nursing students. This lack of clinical exposure (eg, two days of observation versus four to six
weeks of clinical training for other specialties) combined with the limited resources and busy
schedules of managers in ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) lead to new or inexperienced nurses
not being qualified for perioperative positions. Solutions are needed to address this issue of staffing
ORs with qualified perioperative nurses, but especially in the ASC setting.
One approach to recruiting nurses to a particular specialty practice area is to expose student nurses to the
specialty to gain skills and evaluate whether the specialty interests them. Many hospitals have started
offering specialty practice apprentice programs to student nurses during summer break to introduce them
to a specialty area. In a perioperative apprenticeship program, students undergo four weeks of didactic
learning on sterile technique, OR hazards, and basic OR skills. The students are then assigned to
participate, with supervision, in surgical procedures. Graduates of these programs often apply for positions
in the OR at which they apprenticed. Personnel in ASCs can implement programs like these to expand their
pool of nurses to recruit. Although these graduate nurses would need further clinical orientation after being
hired, they would have knowledge of the specialty and some practical skills, thus reducing the amount of
time required for their orientation. Another approach to recruiting ambulatory nurses is for ASCs to partner
with nursing schools to provide students with clinical opportunities in the ambulatory setting. Students
could elect to participate in these programs during their last six weeks of clinical experiences.
Ambulatory surgery centers often have less training and orientation resources available compared with
hospitals (eg, hiring outside educators, paying for staff members to attend conferences or programs) and
therefore must find economical yet effective solutions for orienting new staff members. A perfect resource is
AORN’s Periop 101: A Core CurriculumTM.3 The training modules in this education program can serve as a
didactic resource for ASC personnel to use together with mentoring from experienced nurses in providing
new nurses with the cross-training needed to work in an ASC. In this manner, ASCs can participate in
educating students to the OR and also be proactive in responding to the perioperative nursing shortage.

areas within the hospital system and improved
communication among and within perioperative
areas across the participating hospital campuses.
The improved communication included exciting
discussions regarding a systems approach to perioperative orientation, ongoing training, hiring, and
on-boarding practices.
Another opportunity arose as a result of the
J-term perioperative nursing course. During the
spring semester (which is the final semester before
graduation), the OR director allowed one senior
student who had not taken the J-term perioperative
course to take a senior practicum rotation in surgery. This practicum is fifteen weeks in length
because it extends across the entire spring semester.
This is different from the abbreviated three-week
J-term elective course; it offers more clinical experiences and the student has an assigned preceptor
and attends orientation sessions at the hospital facility to learn perioperative skills. The OR director,
who saw the value in the J-term course along with
the participating students’ excitement about perioperative nursing, allowed this senior practicum to
occur. As with the students who took the J-term
pilot course, the senior practicum student was also
offered a position in the OR on graduation and has
been assigned to the reduced orientation program.
This resulted in an additional savings because the
new nurse becomes a functioning member of the
team sooner.
The nursing students, university faculty, and
hospital system staff members all evaluated the
J-term perioperative course positively. Pre- and
posttest results of a survey given to the students
indicated increased confidence levels associated
with performing the perioperative skills introduced
during the course. Those skills involved basic OR
preparation, including gloving, gowning, and room
setup. Competent skill demonstration aligned with
the reported increase in confidence for OR roles,
equipment use, and patient positioning. Preceptors
and educators indicated increased student knowledge and abilities throughout the three-week term
for the course participants. Surgical educators and
134 j AORN Journal
BALLeDOYLEeOOCUMMA
preceptors indicated reduced personal anxiety related to hiring new graduates. The students consistently
reported that the relationships developed with the
preceptors and the OR educators contributed to
their increased confidence and their plans to seek
employment in a perioperative environment. Different from other perioperative courses, the application of Kolb’s experiential learning theory to
simulated course experiences may have fostered the
students’ higher level of thinking and reflection and
therefore may have affected the faculty and staff
member’s positive observations and feedback.
The students also rated each of the AORN
Periop 101 modules they reviewed. Analysis of the
data showed that all modules received ratings from
3.25 to 4 on a 4-point Likert scale, with 4 being the
highest. The highest-rated module was Perioperative Assessment, and the lowest-rated modules
(even though these ratings were still very positive)
were Positioning the Surgical Patient and Surgical
Instruments. The students suggested that videos be
used to help understand the positioning practices
and devices in more detail. The students rated the
simulation experiences as the best learning activities in the course. They also rated the quiz that
challenged their knowledge to pick faulty practices
very highly and settings in the simulated intraoperative scene as contributing to the students’
sense of a surgical conscience. One student, who
delivered the university’s 2013 student commencement address, proclaimed his experience as “exceptional.” Another student remarked, “The course
brings in a breath of new, fresh air as we never were
given the opportunity to be fully exposed to the OR
in other courses.” Yet another commented, “I
would greatly recommend this course to other
students.” The students also rated the clinical experiences very high and stated that they provided
valuable learning opportunities about the role of
the perioperative nurse. Students also gave the final
examination high ratings. They said that they much
preferred simulated testing compared with completing a written test. Faculty members are using
these comments along with face-to-face interviews

with the students completing the course to refine
future perioperative courses that will be offered at
the university.
Faculty identified two unforeseen outcomes
during the course implementation and evaluation
n
opportunities to offer a senior practicum and
nursing electives in various other specialty areas
within the hospital system, and
n ways to improve communication among perioperative areas across the participating hospital
campuses.
Other specialty areas within the hospital system
also are experiencing nursing shortages, and faculty
are exploring and conducting preliminary discussions to offer senior practicums and/or nursing
electives in these areas that follow the model of the
perioperative nursing course. These added courses
and experiences may assist in elevating the students’ interest in other nursing specialty areas that
are experiencing shortages.
The OR director and clinical educators also reported improved communication among their
various surgical areas. This collaboration expanded
across three hospital systems and four surgical
departments that were used to implement this
perioperative nursing course. Because of the regular and open communication, the OR educators
found commonalities among the different hospital
clinical sites, but more important, they found unexpected differences in practices and policies. In an
attempt to standardize across all hospital campuses,
the educators are collaboratively striving to create
consistency. This, in turn, could save the hospital
system money, time, and energy by reducing inconsistencies and redundancies in practice. In
addition, this unique collaboration can creatively
help to meet staffing needs in the OR for all campuses within the hospital system, even those not
directly involved with the course.

CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985823238095238">
Members of the course planning committee added
advanced simulation technology to the perioperative
nursing coursework to create realistic perioperative
www.aornjournal.org
scenarios, and the nursing students involved with
this elective perioperative J-term course were able
to develop and demonstrate clinical judgment
without endangering real patients. The perioperative skill simulations appeared to contribute to the
students’ improved self-efficacy and confidence
levels which, in turn, was a factor for these students
in selecting perioperative nursing as a career focus.
If the university offers more courses that incorporate experiential learning theory methods and simulation that align with clinical experiences, positive
outcomes could affect the current and anticipated
nursing shortages in this specialty area and others.
This pilot course enabled the OR director to identify and hire nurses more quickly and move
them from new graduate status to full employment status in a shorter time. Partnerships between academia and hospital systems together
with innovative methods of teaching and learning
can help solve the major challenge of staffing ORs
in the future.
