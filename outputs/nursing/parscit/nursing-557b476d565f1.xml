nd-of-life care (EoLC) is a key public health
challenge (Davies and Higginson, 2004;
Froggatt and Payne, 2006; Department of
Health (DH), 2008). Much of the world’s population is living longer (Gomes and Higginson, 2008;
Hall et al, 2011a) with complex health and socialcare needs (Hughes-Hallett et al, 2011). With
increasing frailty and complex medical problems,
many older people are faced with the need to
move to a long-term care facility such as a nursing
care home (NCH) (Froggatt and Payne, 2006).
Approximately 80 000 people die in care homes
(those providing nursing as well as personal care)
in England each year (DH, 2008). It is incumbent
upon all care homes to deliver high-quality EoLC
for older people (DH, 2008; Waldrop and
Kirkendall, 2009; British Geriatrics Society, 2011).
One quality improvement programme for EoLC
is the Gold Standards Framework (National Gold
Standards Framework Centre, 2010), which is
used in a variety of care settings including care
homes. The Gold Standards Framework for Care
Homes (GSFCH) programme aims to enable the
provision of high-quality EoLC for residents and
their families/significant others (National Gold
Standards Framework Centre, 2010). The framework focuses on communication, coordination,
control of symptoms, continuity of care, continued
learning, carer support, and care of the dying.
Care homes pay a fee to undertake the GSFCH
training programme which includes having a designated training facilitator, learning resources, and
training workshops. Care homes are assessed
against 20 standards of best practice to achieve
the GSF accreditation quality hallmark award.
Re-appraisal occurs annually and re-accreditation
every 3 years.
Studies of the GSFCH programme have examined care provision, pre- and post-commencement
of the programme. Key findings are that the GSF
enhances communication within and outside of
the care facility (Ashton et al, 2009; Badger et al,
2009, 2012; Hewison et al, 2009; Hockley et al,
2010; Watson et al, 2010), enhances nurse confidence to assess physical and emotional needs of

Aim: To explore the views and experiences of nurses and health-care
support staff about the use of the Gold Standards Framework (GSF)
for end-of-life care (EoLC) for older people in nursing care homes
(NCHs) with GSF accreditation. Methods: A qualitative descriptive
study was conducted with three purposively selected NCHs in
London. Individual interviews were conducted with NCH managers
(n=3) and in each NCH, a focus group was conducted with registered
nurses (RNs) and health-care assistants (HCAs): focus group 1, n=2
RN, n=2 HCA; focus group 2, n=2 RN, n=3 HCA; focus group 3, n=3
RN, n=3 HCA. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and
analysed using framework analysis. Findings: Three core themes were
identified: (i) a positive regard for the GSF for care homes (GSFCH);
(ii) challenges around EoLC for older people; and (iii) difficulties in
using the GSFCH. Conclusions: RNs, HCAs and managers regarded
the training and support afforded by the GSFCH programme to inform
EoLC for older residents positively. The framework has the potential
to promote a coordinated approach to EoLC for older people. In the
post accreditation period, there is a need for ongoing support and
development to help embed the key tenets of the GSFCH in the
culture of caring.

Hewison et al, 2009; Hockley et al, 2010; Watson
et al, 2010). Nursing care home staff are better
equipped to discuss ‘do not attempt resuscitation’
(DNAR) orders with residents and families following implementation of the GSFCH programme,
and there is improved documentation of DNAR
orders (Badger et al, 2009; Hockley et al, 2010;
Watson et al, 2010). There is also a reduced need
for hospital admissions when residents are dying
(Watson et al, 2010). To date, little published
research has investigated EoLC in NCHs in the
post-accreditation period (Finucane et al, 2013).
Understanding the views and experiences of staff
using the GSF in NCHs that have achieved GSF
accreditation is needed to inform ongoing review

The aim of the study was to investigate the views
and experiences of RNs and HCAs using the
Gold Standards Framework in NCHs post-GSF
accreditation. Specific objectives were to explore:
●●Their experiences of using the GSFCH for
EoLC for older adults
●●The benefits and challenges of using the
GSFCH.

<bodyText confidence="0.999651523809524">
This was a qualitative descriptive study
(Sandelowski, 2000). Three NCHs were purposively sampled from 19 in south-east London
that, at the time of the study, had GSF accreditation and registration to care for older adults; this
information was sourced from the local GSFCH
facilitators. To maximise the opportunity to gain
insight about participants’ views and experiences,
homes that had been using the framework for at
least 6 months post-accreditation were targeted.
The NCHs included in the study were local specialist community palliative care teams with
access to a common service of support for palliative care. The NCHs varied in size from small (37
beds), to medium (51 beds) and large (93 beds).
The managers of the three NCHs were
recruited to the study. With a view to recruiting
four to six staff in each NCH to participate in a
focus group, a sampling frame of all RNs and
HCAs in each NCH was compiled. Potential participants were identified by the NCH managers
working at the time when the researcher was
meeting staff to explain research participation.
The principal researcher (and first author on this
article, AN) then met with each potential participant to explain the study. Potential participants
had 5 days to make an informed decision and all

agreed to participate. RNs and HCAs were
recruited in order to capture the perspectives and
experiences of those caring for older people in
NCHs on a daily basis. Table 1 presents a profile
of each NCH and the participants of the study.
RNs and HCAs in each NCH took part in a
focus group interview: focus group 1, n=2 RN,
n=2 HCA; focus group 2, n=2 RN, n=3 HCA;
focus group 3, n=3 RN, n=3 HCA. The manager
of each NCH was interviewed individually (n
=3) to enable full and frank conversations and
reduce the potential influence of any perceived
hierarchies. An observer, a palliative care clinical
nurse specialist, was present at the focus groups
to make field notes about the topics discussed
and the group dynamics. The principal
researcher also has past experience as a palliative community nurse specialist and engagement
with NCHs using the GSFCH, which may have
unknowingly influenced the researcher. It was
impossible to remove this portfolio of experience, knowledge, assumptions and potential
biases from the research process, but the
authors were able to acknowledge this and
make the research more sensitive to aid a full
understanding of the issues discussed (van
Manen, 1990). The principal researcher maintained a diary, with field notes recorded following all visits to the research sites and after each
interview to assist in gaining a full narrative
about the views and experiences of the staff.
The researcher and the observer were not
known to the research sites and participants.
Data collection
Questions posed in the interviews focused on:
●●What are staff experiences of caring for residents in the NCH near to the end of life?
●●What are the challenges of caring for these
residents?

provide consistently good EoLC for older adults.
Research
●●What has been helpful about the GSFCH programme for EoLC for older residents?
●●What has been challenging or difficult when
implementing the GSFCH?
●●What could improve use of the GSFCH?
The interview questions were reviewed by four
palliative care clinical nurse specialists, who
advised that no refinements were required. All
interviews were conducted by the principle
researcher in the NCHs.
Ethical considerations
Ethical approval for the study was obtained via
the National Research Ethics Service Committee
South Central – Berkshire in May 2011 (REC reference 11/SC/0132). The principles of informed
consent, protection from harm, confidentiality,
anonymity and information management were
adhered to throughout the research process.
Data analysis
The interviews were transcribed verbatim and rechecked by the principle researcher listening to
each interview. The data were analysed using
framework analysis (Ritchie and Spencer, 1994),
and shown in Figure 1. This method comprises
five stages: (i) familiarisation, (ii) identifying a thematic framework, (iii) indexing, (iv) charting and
(v) mapping and interpretation. The researcher
was immersed in all interview transcripts along
with the observation notes and the researcher’s
diary to help develop a narrative about the experiences of research participants. Data analysis activities were discussed and verified in a series of
one-to-one meetings between the researchers. A
limitation of the analysis process was that the
study time scale did not permit validation of the
core themes that emerged following data anaylsis
by the participants. Analysis identified three core
themes, which are presented below.
Findings
There was synergy in the findings for RNs, HCAs
and managers in the three NCHs with regards to
their views on the GSFCH.

Positive experiences of the GSFCH in
EoLC for older residents
Positive experiences of RNs and HCAs focused on
five key areas: confidence in managing EoLC;
improved communication skills and knowledge;
advance care planning; recognising end of life and
managing the dying process; and symptom control.
Participants spoke of being more confident and
expressed positive feelings in caring for residents
at the end of life. These were described as
‘increased confidence’, ‘a good experience’ and
International Journal of Palliative Nursing 2015, Vol 21, No 1
‘doing their best’. They spoke of a more holistic
approach to their care of residents and families,
with attention to physical, psychological and
spiritual care and support:
‘When you do the training you can give moral
support, communication, bereavement, there’s a
lot of difference...’ (Manager)
Participants in NCHs 1 and 2 spoke of caring
for residents as ‘caring for their own family’.
There were descriptions of how the NCH had
become the residents’ home and they were now
part of their family:
‘I say to staff… look after this woman as you
would your grandmother [or] mother’

Being more confident and having greater
knowledge about EoLC was discussed by participants, specifically about their communication
skills, involvement in advance care planning, recognition of dying and management of the dying
process, and symptom control. Participants spoke
of how the GSFCH programme, and specifically
staff training, had enhanced their communication
skills. This included improved completion of
NCH records, out-of-hours forms and advance
care plans as well as their communications with
residents, families and health professionals external to the NCHs.
Advance care planning was regarded positively,
with participants discussing how they valued having clear records about residents’ resuscitation status, preferred place of death and arrangements
post-death. Discussions on this topic included staff
feeling more able to communicate about EoLC
issues, and engaging earlier with planning that
involved residents, families and the multiprofessional care team. Participants also reported being
able to talk more easily with clinicians, relatives
and residents about EoLC and care planning as
well as offering bereavement support:
‘We are confident now to involve the family;
again we can take the discussion and can
involve the family and the GP’ (RN)
‘...involving the family in the end care and...
making the decision even as much earlier as we
can... in their care and treatment and involving
and keeping family and other health care professionals... it’s more easy for us now’ (RN)

Better symptom control was discussed by participants in NCHs 2 and 3; for other participants achieving symptom control was identified
as an ongoing challenge. Pain was the main
symptom that participants reported having
gained most confidence in being able to assess
and manage:

health professional who assisted most with management of residents’ acute symptoms.
Challenges of caring for older residents
at the end of life
While participants all reported positive views and
experiences of the GSFCH programme, they also
shared some challenges in caring for residents at
the end of life. These centred around how to enable a ‘good death’, communication with residents
and relatives, symptom control, and co-ordinat-

rating and dying, and in managing the care
process. They shared that reflecting on residents’
care and changes to their condition was facilitated by regular in-house meetings and use of the
GSF coding system:
</bodyText>

ing care at the end of life.
Participants spoke of their commitment to
facilitating a ‘good death’ for residents.
Challenges for some staff included being able to
recognise deterioration and how to define ‘end of
life’. Communication was a key challenge that
participants also spoke about. In the individual
and focus group interviews, communicating with
relatives about EoLC planning and residents’
deterioration were the most commonly discussed
challenges. This was particularly the case when
family members disagreed with each other and/or
the resident regarding care and decisions about
care. Participants spoke specifically of the challenge arising when family members were ‘not
ready’, ‘not accepting’, or ‘not understanding’
about approaching death:
‘One thing that I find the great challenge is with
relatives, and it’s about accepting the change of
the resident. You do find some family members
that are in denial basically.’ (HCA)
© 2015 MA Healthcare Ltd
‘We had problems like relatives challenging
their [the patient’s] decision… before the worst
happens you have to explain...’ (RN)
Communicating with residents about advance
care planning was discussed as a challenge for the
focus group participants in NCH 3; nurses discussed concerns that if planning for the end of life
was discussed with residents, residents would ‘give
up’. Another issue discussed was how best to communicate with residents about EoLC when there is
reduced mental capacity e.g. due to dementia.
Coordinating care within the multidisciplinary
team to support residents at the end of life was
described as a challenge on occasions for some
participants in NCHs 1 and 2. For example,
when residents do not have full mental capacity,
so their wishes are not known. In one account
from NCH 1, a resident was transferred to hospital where they died; the NCH staff knew that the
resident wished to be buried and spoke of feeling
sad that the resident had died in hospital but
happy that they were able to talk with the social
worker about the resident’s wish to be buried.
In all three NCHs, participants communicated
that a ‘good relationship’ with their team, and in
particular with GPs, were pivotal to managing
their roles. Participants described how they were
able to contact GPs to discuss communication
difficulties with relatives and all had access to
GPs outside their regular visits to the NCHs. It
was also evident during the interviews that NCH
managers play a key role in leading and managing challenges around EoLC.
International Journal of Palliative Nursing 2015, Vol 21, No 1
Continuing to use the GSFCH and
sustainability in the NCHs
For NCHs 1 and 3, staff felt that continuing to use
the GSFCH presented no problems. Participants in
NCH 2 spoke of the amount of time required to
complete the paperwork associated with the
GSFCH; this was particularly the case when the
NCH was working towards accreditation.
Knowing when to commence and review documentation used to care for residents in the last
days of life was reported as a difficulty for some
nursing staff. This was particularly pertinent in
situations where residents were dying from a
non-malignant illness. Another debate in two of
the focus groups centred on what they called the
‘legality’ of the GSF paperwork and advance care
planning tools. For example, one focus group
debated the usefulness of the framework as they
were unclear what documentation could be used
to ensure that families understood when a
patient’s wish was not to be sent to hospital
when nearing death.
The principle researcher noted in the reflective
diary that during the period of data collection all
three NCHs were working on documentation to
maintain GSFCH accreditation. Staff noted that
the ‘paperwork is now less’ complared to when
the NCHs were working towards becoming
accredited. Continuing education and support
from community palliative care teams, and in
particular GSFCH facilitators, were regarded
positively by participants in the three NCHs. All
three NCHs were engaged with regular staff
training about palliative and EoLC and continued input from the GSFCH facilitator was well
received. NCH 3 described their ongoing working with their GSFCH facilitator whom they valued and who continued to assist with staff
updates in addition to providing support to staff
experiencing difficulties around EoLC issues. No
one spoke of wanting to discontinue use of the
GSFCH; indeed all three NCHs were working
towards their annual GSFCH accreditation.

In this study, RNs, HCAs and managers were generally positive about the GSFCH and the continued use of this framework to help achieve good
EoLC for residents. Participants were of the opinion that the programme had increased staff confidence to communicate about and manage EoLC
for older residents. This finding concurs with the
survey of UK NCHs by Badger et al (2009) and
the interviews with NCH staff and relatives by
Hall et al (2011b). In the study reported in this
paper, staff described how the GSFCH training
had helped develop their skills in communicating

with residents about their care and their preferred
place of death, which helped avoid unnecessary
hospital admissions. An evaluation of the GSFCH
by Hockley et al (2010) reported an apparent
reduction in unnecessary hospital admissions.
There is a need for further research to investigate
the impact of the GSFCH programme on outcomes for residents, families, staff and NCHs.
Support from and effective communication with
hospital and primary health-care professionals
emerged as significant for EoLC for residents.
Participants spoke of how hospital teams had
assisted residents to remain in the NCH rather
than return to hospital to die when this was feasible and the preferred choice of residents; this was
facilitated by clear communication about prognosis and DNAR discussions with residents’ GPs.
The key role of the GP in EoLC planning with residents and their families was also highlighted; an
example given was GPs leading discussions about
EoLC DNAR. Two of the NCHs notably had telephone support from their GPs out of the normal
visiting sessions to the homes and this was particularly helpful when residents deteriorated. The
importance of collaborative working with GPs for
good EoLC for older people in NCHs has been
reported in other research (Hall et al, 2011b;
Seymour et al, 2011; Badger et al, 2012). A review
of interventions for improving palliative care for
older people living in NCHs by Hall et al (2011a)
argues that development of multidisciplinary
teams in addition to staff training is essential.
In the present study, the support of NCH mangers was described by staff as essential to help
them address challenges encountered in providing
EoLC. Published literature about the GSFCH and
other quality improvement frameworks has highlighted a stable and effective management structure and sound leadership as requirements for
successful implementation (Hewison et al, 2009;
Watson et al, 2010; Hockley et al, 2010; Seymour
et al, 2011; Finucane et al, 2013). The nurse managers in turn spoke highly of the training they had
received when undertaking the GSFCH programme and the support of their local community
palliative care teams and the GSFCH facilitators.
When focusing on the challenges of using the
GSFCH, the amount of time required for documentation was raised. King et al (2005) and Hall
et al (2011b) also highlighted how staff identified
problems with an increased workload when
implementing the GSF. Earlier research (King et al,
2005; Mahmood-Yousuf et al, 2008) investigating
the introduction of the GSF in GP practices found
that administration time was an important factor
for the successful implementation of the GSF. On a
positive note, participants in this study were of the
view that completion of paperwork had become
easier post-accreditation. The legality of advance
care plans and who is responsible for DNAR decision-making was discussed by some participants.
Before implementation of the GSF it was reported
that DNAR decision-making did not take place
consistently, resulting in some dying residents
being sent to hospital although this may not have
been the residents’ preferred choice.
The difficulty of recognising deterioration, the
palliative care status of residents, and estimating
the survival time of residents was discussed by
some participants. Further development of staff
skills and knowledge to assess and manage symptoms such as pain was also flagged, which concurs with research by Goddard et al (2011). The
complexity of chronic disease management of
older people is also acknowledged as a challenge
for health professionals (DH, 2010).
Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon NCHs to
have a nursing workforce that is able to ‘identify,
assess and plan care for residents who are
approaching the end of life’ (DH, 2008: 160).
Further consideration of how best to achieve and
sustain this is required. A systematic review by
Coventry et al (2005) aimed to identify tools and
predict variables that might aid clinicians to estimate survival and assess palliative care status in
non-cancer patients. They concluded that it was
not possible to identify a specific tool that could
be used meaningfully for a non-cancer population, due to the unpredictability of illness progression and deterioration. Coventry et al (2005)
discussed the need for the development of a simple, well-evaluated prognosis model that could
provide clinicians with an objective measure. In
this regard, evaluating the effectiveness of the
GSFCH coding tool which is used by nursing
staff to assess residents’ palliative care status
warrants further investigation.
Limitations
This study sought to capture participants’ views
and experiences. It is limited by a small sample
size and a sampling approach that was not able to
include residents and their families/significant others and other members of the multidisciplinary
team. It is acknowledged that there are limitations
to framework analysis; however, it was a successful method for the novice principal researcher of
this study to analyse the data systematically and
with transparency and rigour. Use of framework
analysis has also been defended in other studies
(Stewart et al, 2011; Ward et al, 2013). The
authors acknowledge that not all positive views
about EoLC in the participating NCHs can be

<bodyText confidence="0.977486928571429">
At the time of this study, limited research had
focused specifically on the views and experiences
of staff using the GSFCH in NCHs post-accreditation. Some research to investigate sustainability of
the GSFCH in NCHs has since been reported
(Finucane et al, 2013) and further work is needed.
In this study RNs, HCAs and managers were supportive of the GSF and what it has to offer to help
provide high-quality EoLC for older NCH residents. The study identified that the GSFCH programme helped staff to care for residents at the end
of life and helped facilitate a ‘good death’.
Challenges were also identified, which highlight the
importance of ongoing support for NCHs postaccreditation if good EoLC is to become embedded
in the culture and daily practice of NCHs. This
support should address areas such as recognising
end of life, communication skills with residents
and families about advance care planning, managing EoLC for residents with dementia, and symptom assessment and management. Research on the
introduction of the GSFCH in NCHs (Hockley et
al, 2010) highlighted the need for local authorities
and NCH management to invest in support and
development to ensure the programme is properly
embedded within the NCH culture. This paper
contributes to the discussions on EoLC in ageing
societies and discussions about the future implementation of the GSFCH. To make a sustainable
contribution to EoLC for older adults in NCHs,
education, training and ongoing review and evaluation of the GSFCH must be embedded in the culture of these facilities.

Care homes pay a fee to undertake the GSFCH training programme which includes having a designated training facilitator, learning resources, and training workshops. Care homes are assessed against 20 standards of best practice to achieve the GSF accreditation quality hallmark award. Re-appraisal occurs annually and re-accreditation every 3 years. Studies of the GSFCH programme have examined care provision, pre- and post-commencement of the programme. Key findings are that the GSF enhances communication within and outside of the care facility (Ashton et al, 2009; Badger et al, 2009, 2012; Hewison et al, 2009; Hockley et al, 2010; Watson et al, 2010), enhances nurse confidence to assess physical and emotional needs of International Journal of Palliative Nursing 2015, Vol 21, No 1 Abstract Aim: To explore the views and experiences of nurses and health-care support staff about the use of the Gold Standards Framework (GSF) for end-of-life care (EoLC) for older people in nursing care homes (NCHs) with GSF accreditation.

The framework has the potential to promote a coordinated approach to EoLC for older people. In the post accreditation period, there is a need for ongoing support and development to help embed the key tenets of the GSFCH in the culture of caring.

Nursing care home staff are better equipped to discuss ‘do not attempt resuscitation’ (DNAR) orders with residents and families following implementation of the GSFCH programme, and there is improved documentation of DNAR orders (Badger et al, 2009; Hockley et al, 2010; Watson et al, 2010). There is also a reduced need for hospital admissions when residents are dying (Watson et al, 2010). To date, little published research has investigated EoLC in NCHs in the post-accreditation period (Finucane et al, 2013). Understanding the views and experiences of </context>

A review of interventions for improving palliative care for older people living in NCHs by Hall et al (2011a) argues that development of multidisciplinary teams in addition to staff training is essential. In the present study, the support of NCH mangers was described by staff as essential to help them address challenges encountered in providing EoLC. Published literature about the GSFCH and other quality improvement frameworks has highlighted a stable and effective management structure and sound leadership as requirements for successful implementation (Hewison et al, 2009; Watson et al, 2010; Hockley et al, 2010; Seymour et al, 2011; Finucane et al, 2013). The nurse managers in turn spoke highly of the training they had received when undertaking the GSFCH programme and the support of their local community palliative care teams and the GSFCH facilitators. When focusing on the challenges of using the GSFCH, the amount of time required for documentation was raised. King et al (2005) and Hall et al (2011b) also highlighted how staff identified problems with an increased workload when implementing the GSF.

Specific objectives were to explore: ●●Their experiences of using the GSFCH for EoLC for older adults ●●The benefits and challenges of using the GSFCH.

Three NCHs were purposively sampled from 19 in south-east London that, at the time of the study, had GSF accreditation and registration to care for older adults; this information was sourced from the local GSFCH facilitators. To maximise the opportunity to gain insight about participants’ views and experiences, homes that had been using the framework for at least 6 months post-accreditation were targeted. The NCHs included in the study were local specialist community palliative care teams with access to a common service of support for palliative care. The NCHs varied in size from small (37 b</context>
