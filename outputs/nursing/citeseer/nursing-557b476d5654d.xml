				<p>Purpose: To report on approaches that were used to assist with implementation of family systems nursing (FSN) at a university hospital level in Northern Europe. Design and Methods: A quasi-experimental research design was used for the first phase of the study. For the second phase, a cross-sectional research design was used. Data were collected in the first phase of the study from 457 nurses in all except one of the divisions of the hospital regarding their attitudes towards involving families into their care before and after having participated in the education and training intervention (ETI) program in FSN. Furthermore , in the second phase, data were collected from 812 nurses, after FSN had been implemented in all divisions at Landspitali University Hospital, regarding the nurses' knowledge of FSN and their evaluation of the quality of the ETI program (i.e., theoretical lectures on FSN as well as the benefit of the skill lab training regarding applying FSN into their clinical practices). Graham and colleagues' Knowledge to Action framework was used as the conceptual framework for the research. Results: Nurses who had taken a course in FSN reported a significantly more positive attitude towards involving families in their care after the ETI program compared to those who had not taken such a course. Furthermore, a majority of the nurses who participated in the ETI program reported that the program was a favorable experience and indicated readiness for applying FSN in clinical practice. Conclusions: Further research is needed regarding the benefits of offering FSN at an institutional level, but focusing international attention on effective strategies to implement FSN into nursing practice may result in better health care for individuals and families around the globe. Clinical Relevance: Providing clinically meaningful education and training in family nursing through programs such as the ETI program for practicing</p>

The reason is that stronger evidence is being reported in the literature regarding the benefits of involving families in healthcare services, both for patients and family members. Furthermore, recommendations put forward by the International Council of Nursing (2002) and World Health Organization (WHO; 2006) on the importance of involving families in health care, and numerous research findings on improved health outcomes following interventions for families dealing with chronic and acute illnesses, are promising (Bell &amp; Wright, 2011; Chesla, 2010; Leahey &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2009; Svavarsdottir, Sigurdardottir, &amp; Tryggvadottir, 2014; Sveinbjarnardottir, Svavarsdottir, &amp; Wright, 2012). In addition, because of findings from evidence-based research that supports benefits of psychosocial interventions in clinical practice (Svavarsdottir &amp; Sigurdardottir, 2013; Warner et al., 2011), clinical guidelines are increasingly recommending effective family nursing involvement in health care to strengthen both the patient and the family (Registered Nurses Association of Ontario, Canada, 2006). Based on the increased evidence in the litera</context>

One indicator for evaluating the quality of the relationship between healthcare professionals and family members is to evaluate healthcare professionals’ attitudes towards involving families in their care, and to evaluate family members’ feelings of receiving friendly, pleasant, and connected communications or behaviors versus unfriendly, hostile, or distanced behaviors or attitudes from healthcare professionals (Bell &amp; Wright, 2011; Benzein, Johansson, Arestedt, Berg, &amp; Saveman, 2008; Saveman, Benzein, Engstrom, &amp; Arestedt, 2011; Simpson &amp; Tarrant, 2006; Wright &amp; Bell, 2009). Families who are supporting their loved one at a hospital are often dealing with a very complex health situation. Wright and Bell (2009) have emphasized that behaviors of family members cannot be considered in isolation, but rather in the context of the family situation. Therefore, families who experience high-quality relationships with healthcare professionals are less likely to experience feelings of isolation or being vulnerable or uncertain i</context>

The attitudes of nurses are believed to influence the quality of clinical practice among family nurses. When establishing therapeutic relationships and offering families therapeutic conversations, where the goal is to offer support, facilitate change, and/or maintain or enhance family functioning and well-being, positive attitudes of nurses towards families are essential. According to nurse scientists who have conceptualized these beliefs in their models, such as in the Beliefs and Illness Model (Bell &amp; Wright, 2011; Wright &amp; Bell, 2009) and in the Calgary Family Assessment and Intervention Models (CFAM/CFIM) (Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009), nurses’ attitudes or beliefs towards involving families in their care are seen to be fundamental to the possibility of creating therapeutic change, leading to healing, and to decrease suffering among family members. In these models, while embracing change, it is important to identify constraining and facilitating beliefs when establishing involvement in therapeutic 6 Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 2015; 47:1, 5–15.

Such training can facilitate integration of new and needed information in clinical practice. Family systems nursing (FSN) is a phenomenon that is getting increased attention among administrators, and scientists in general, as well as advanced nurse practitioners. The reason is that stronger evidence is being reported in the literature regarding the benefits of involving families in healthcare services, both for patients and family members. Furthermore, recommendations put forward by the International Council of Nursing (2002) and World Health Organization (WHO; 2006) on the importance of involving families in health care, and numerous research findings on improved health outcomes following interventions for families dealing with chronic and acute illnesses, are promising (Bell &amp; Wright, 2011; Chesla, 2010; Leahey &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2009; Svavarsdottir, Sigurdardottir, &amp; Tryggvadottir, 2014; Sveinbjarnardottir, Svavarsdottir, &amp; Wright, 2012).

The Family Importance in Nursing CareNurses’ Attitude Questionnaire. The FINC-NA questionnaire is a 26-item scale (Benzein et al., 2008) that was originally developed in a sample of Swedish nurses, but has been translated and pilot-tested with a sample of Icelandic nurses. The psychometric properties of the Icelandic version were similar to those reported by the authors (Skuladottir, Konraðsdottir, &amp; Agustsdottir, 2010). The scaling of the instrument is a 4-point Likert scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. For the whole instrument, the scoring range was 26 to 104. The higher the score, the more positive the attitude towards families reported by the nurses. Cronbach’s α for internal consistency is 0.88 for the total scale. The FINCNA instrument is composed of four factors: (a) family as a resource in nursing (α = 0.805; e.g., the presence of family members eases my workload; it is important to spend time with families); (b) as a conversational partner (α = 0.785; e.g., I invite family memb</context>

In order to improve the health of a population, both the WHO (2005) and Canadian Institute of Health Research (2005) have emphasized the importance of knowledge translation (KT) into clinical practice, where evidencebased information is incorporated into healthcare services (e.g., interactions among researchers and users) in such a way that it effects optimal healthcare outcomes and strengthens healthcare systems. The process of translating new knowledge into clinical practice has been conceptualized in the Knowledge to Action framework by Graham and colleagues (2006) and Straus, Tetroe, and Graham (2011). In this model, KT is seen as occurring in two interactive phases—the knowledge creation phase and the action phase—with fluid boundaries between the creation and the action components of the model. As knowledge is sorted out or refined, the resulting knowledge becomes more developed and useful to the users. In the action phase, knowledge can be implemented simultaneously, and the knowledge phase can influence the action phase at several points in the model.

One indicator for evaluating the quality of the relationship between healthcare professionals and family members is to evaluate healthcare professionals’ attitudes towards involving families in their care, and to evaluate family members’ feelings of receiving friendly, pleasant, and connected communications or behaviors versus unfriendly, hostile, or distanced behaviors or attitudes from healthcare professionals (Bell &amp; Wright, 2011; Benzein, Johansson, Arestedt, Berg, &amp; Saveman, 2008; Saveman, Benzein, Engstrom, &amp; Arestedt, 2011; Simpson &amp; Tarrant, 2006; Wright &amp; Bell, 2009).

Discussion In order to facilitate implementation of FSN into nursing practice at LUH, the nurses’ attitudes towards involving families in their care was evaluated. This evaluation was conducted on all divisions except the emergency division at the hospital, because of specific situations in the emergency division at the time. In the Calgary models (Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009) and in the Illness Belief model (Wright &amp; Bell, 2009), emphasis is placed on the fundamental assumption that a positive attitude of nurses towards involving families in health care is essential to facilitating a therapeutic change, leading to healing and decreasing suffering in families. Knowing the nurses’ attitudes towards the importance of involving families in their care is therefore critical, because nurses’ attitudes towards FSN can determine the quality of the therapeutic conversations with families and determine the level of involvement that the nurse can create in harmony with families in the therapeutic process. Interestingly, however,</context>

These nurses reported a significantly lower burden towards involving families in their care compared to the nurses who had not taken such a course. These findings emphasize that education in FSN had an influence on the nurses’ attitudes towards evaluating families that they cared for at LUH (i.e., families were viewed as significantly less burdensome). In addition, these findings are in harmony with the theoretical underpinnings in the Calgary and the Illness Beliefs models (Wright &amp; Bell, 2009; Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009), where nurses’ attitudes are believed to have an impact on 12 Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 2015; 47:1, 5–15.
