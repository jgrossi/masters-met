				<p>Aim: To explore the views and experiences of nurses and health-care support staff about the use of the Gold Standards Framework (GSF) for end-of-life care (EoLC) for older people in nursing care homes (NCHs) with GSF accreditation. Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted with three purposively selected NCHs in London. Individual interviews were conducted with NCH managers (n=3) and in each NCH, a focus group was conducted with registered nurses (RNs) and health-care assistants (HCAs): focus group 1, n=2 RN, n=2 HCA; focus group 2, n=2 RN, n=3 HCA; focus group 3, n=3 RN, n=3 HCA. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using framework analysis. Findings: Three core themes were identified: (i) a positive regard for the GSF for care homes (GSFCH); (ii) challenges around EoLC for older people; and (iii) difficulties in using the GSFCH. Conclusions: RNs, HCAs and managers regarded the training and support afforded by the GSFCH programme to inform EoLC for older residents positively. The framework has the potential to promote a coordinated approach to EoLC for older people. In the post accreditation period, there is a need for ongoing support and development to help embed the key tenets of the GSFCH in the culture of caring.</p>

Care homes pay a fee to undertake the GSFCH training programme which includes having a designated training facilitator, learning resources, and training workshops. Care homes are assessed against 20 standards of best practice to achieve the GSF accreditation quality hallmark award. Re-appraisal occurs annually and re-accreditation every 3 years. Studies of the GSFCH programme have examined care provision, pre- and post-commencement of the programme. Key findings are that the GSF enhances communication within and outside of the care facility (Ashton et al, 2009; Badger et al, 2009, 2012; Hewison et al, 2009; Hockley et al, 2010; Watson et al, 2010), enhances nurse confidence to assess physical and emotional needs of residents, and helps achieve better symptom control (Ashton et al, 2009; Badger et al, 2009; Hewison et al, 2009; Hockley et al, 2010; Watson et al, 2010). Nursing care home staff are better equipped to discuss ‘do not attempt resuscitation’ (DNAR) orders with residents and families following implementation of the GSFCH programme, and there is improved documentation of DNAR orders (Badger et al, 2009; Hockley et al, 2010; Watson et al, 2</context>

A review of interventions for improving palliative care for older people living in NCHs by Hall et al (2011a) argues that development of multidisciplinary teams in addition to staff training is essential. In the present study, the support of NCH mangers was described by staff as essential to help them address challenges encountered in providing EoLC. Published literature about the GSFCH and other quality improvement frameworks has highlighted a stable and effective management structure and sound leadership as requirements for successful implementation (Hewison et al, 2009; Watson et al, 2010; Hockley et al, 2010; Seymour et al, 2011; Finucane et al, 2013). The nurse managers in turn spoke highly of the training they had received when undertaking the GSFCH programme and the support of their local community palliative care teams and the GSFCH facilitators. When focusing on the challenges of using the GSFCH, the amount of time required for documentation was raised. King et al (2005) and Hall et al (2011b) also highlighted how staff identified problems with an increased workload when implementing the GSF.

Aim and objectives The aim of the study was to investigate the views and experiences of RNs and HCAs using the Gold Standards Framework in NCHs post-GSF accreditation. Specific objectives were to explore: ●Their experiences of using the GSFCH for EoLC for older adults ●The benefits and challenges of using the GSFCH. Method This was a qualitative descriptive study (Sandelowski, 2000). Three NCHs were purposively sampled from 19 in south-east London that, at the time of the study, had GSF accreditation and registration to care for older adults; this information was sourced from the local GSFCH facilitators. To maximise the opportunity to gain insight about participants’ views and experiences, homes that had been using the framework for at least 6 months post-accreditation were targeted. The NCHs included in the study were local specialist community palliative care teams with access to a common service of support for palliative care. The NCHs varied in size from small (37 b</context>
