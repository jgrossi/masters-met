Research indicates there is evidence linking student satisfaction evaluations with increased student engagement and retention in higher education (Noel-Levitz, 2005- 2006). The inclusion of student satisfaction measures in a comprehensive program evaluation may provide insights into the total educational experience for students and an understanding of student expectations for program development and enhancement (Appleton-Knapp &amp; Krentler, 2006; Brown &amp; Marshall, 2008). To our knowledge, no national studies have comprehensively investigated student satisfaction with the associate of science in nursing (ASN) or associate degree in nursing (ADN) programs in the United States. The aim of this study was to provide evidence of ASN or ADN program satisfaction among nursing students using a standardized measurement in order to identify areas needed for improvement in general. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a national survey to describe the level of ASN or ADN student satisfaction with the nursing program and to identify whi</context>

In other studies (Hendricks, Wallace, Narwold, Guy, &amp; Wallace, 2013; Jokelainen, Turunen, Tossavainen, Jamookeeah, &amp; Coco, 2011; Shelton, 2003), students who viewed faculty as providing direct help and facilitating learning as well as providing the caring atmosphere of a mentoring relationship were more likely to be satisfied with a program and to be successful academically. Evidence over the past decade has shown the need for evaluating students’ perceptions and expectations regarding their education for greater program accountability (Appleton-Knapp &amp; Krentler, 2006; Brown &amp; Marshall, 2008; Story et al., 2010). However, within the United States, no nationwide studies have been conducted regarding ASN student satisfaction with the nursing program as a whole in the areas of curriculum, faculty, social interaction, and environment. Most schools have conducted internal evaluations of student satisfaction with their nursing programs using independently developed tools. These studies may have focused on evaluating needs specific to the program.

After a program had obtained permission to participate, a numerically coded questionnaire packet including the NSSS, a self-addressed and stamped return envelope, and a cover letter were mailed to the chair. Questionnaires were answered anonymously one time during a regularly scheduled nursing class. The chair was responsible for returning all completed questionnaires by mail without identifying the students. Instrument The NSSS, developed by Chen et al. (2012), was used to identify the extent to which nursing students were satisfied with the nursing program.

It consists of four subscales based on the CSFE model: Curriculum (9 items), Faculty (8 items), Social Interaction (6 items), and Learning Environment (7 items).

Technology-driven and learner-centered curricula can enhance students’ professional practice (Floyd, Lewis, &amp; Walker, 2010; Fountain &amp; Alfred, 2009), and students are more satisfied with courses incorporating web-enhanced teaching strategies to facilitate their learning (Salyers, 2005).

Students feel more satisfied with the program when the aesthetic aspects of the physical infrastructure are considered (Wiers-Jenssen, Stensaker, &amp; Grogaard, 2002). Clinical experiences for nursing students are central and significant to the learning of professionalism. The social context of the clinical practice and the professional interaction among nursing students, faculty, and staff nurses impact the student learning process (Zafrir &amp; Nissim, 2011). Spiritual health has been identified as associated with clinical practice stress in nursing students (Gibbons, Dempster, &amp; Moutray, 2011; Hsiao, Chien, Wu, Chiang, &amp; Huang, 2010).

The findings suggested that participants with a diploma in nursing had higher satisfaction levels than the participants with a baccalaureate degree in nursing (BSN). In addition, the older participants had higher satisfaction levels than the traditional students who were less than 21 years old. Student evaluations of curriculum design and teaching effectiveness have been viewed as a major source of information for faculty development and for promoting positive changes in learning outcomes (Hessler &amp; Humphreys, 2008; Salamonson, Halcomb, Andrew, Peters, &amp; Jackson, 2010). Technology-driven and learner-centered curricula can enhance students’ professional practice (Floyd, Lewis, &amp; Walker, 2010; Fountain &amp; Alfred, 2009), and students are more satisfied with courses incorporating web-enhanced teaching strategies to facilitate their learning (Salyers, 2005).

Both the SEEQ and the CEQ were developed for a general student population and may not measure elements related to clinical practice that are critical for satisfaction among nursing students. Liegler (1997) developed a path model consisting of the factors of external influences, college facilities and services, academic integration, and social integration to predict nursing students’ overall satisfaction levels. The tool used to test the causal model was developed based on two instruments, the Social Integration with Peers Scale and the Social Integration with Faculty Scale, developed by Pascarella and Terenzini (1980). These two instruments, originally developed in the late 1970s, may not accurately measure satisfaction in today’s nursing students. While instruments have been utilized to assess students’ satisfaction with a particular course, there was little evidence of methods for evaluating students’ experience of the program as a whole (Richardson, 2005).

The rationale for using the hierarchical multiple regression was the consideration of variation among schools’ organizational characteristics and students’ background. The organizational and demographic variables were grouped as separate units in order to examine their effect on student satisfaction levels. By entering variables as units in a sequential way, the optimal unit of predictors could be determined and the change in predictability associated with the four subscales could be identified (Petrocelli, 2003). An alpha level of .05 was set for statistical tests. ResuLts Demographic Characteristics Fifty-six ASN or ADN programs from 31 US states completed this study. Three follow-up emails sent to inform the chair of the department about the deadline for completing the questionnaires contributed to the average 76 percent response rate for this study. Most of the 2,020 participating students were white and non-Hispanic (n = 1,590, 79.1 percent); 88.8 percent (n = 1,791) were females.

Students perceive a learning environment to be effective when faculty develop and promote a climate of mutual respect and trust, collaboration, positive affect, and supportiveness (Ojeda, Flores, &amp; Navarro, 2011; Rowbotham, 2010). Students feel more satisfied with the program when the aesthetic aspects of the physical infrastructure are considered (Wiers-Jenssen, Stensaker, &amp; Grogaard, 2002). Clinical experiences for nursing students are central and significant to the learning of professionalism. The social context of the clinical practice and the professional interaction among nursing students, faculty, and staff nurses impact the student learning process (Zafrir &amp; Nissim, 2011). Spiritual health has been identified as associated with clinical practice stress in nursing students (Gibbons, Dempster, &amp; Moutray, 2011; Hsiao, Chien, Wu, Chiang, &amp; Huang, 2010). Three studies (Espeland &amp; Indrehus, 2003; Happell, 2008a, 2008b) had limited recruitment of student participants from three</context>

The essential element for nursing student satisfaction is the nursing faculty. The nursing faculty subscale explained 61.4 percent out of the total 65.5 percent variation in student satisfaction. This result is consistent with previous studies (Hessler &amp; Humphreys, 2008; Rowbotham, 2010) that found the best predictors of overall student satisfaction to be faculty, effective teaching, academic development, and social interaction. The findings in our study are also supported by Hendricks et al. (2013), Jokelainen et al. (2011), and Wiers-Jenssen et al. (2002) in holding that the academic and pedagogic quality of the teaching and mentoring are crucial determinants of student satisfaction. It is recommended that nursing programs evaluate their teaching efficiency and have qualified faculty knowledgeable in their fields in order to build a safe, caring, trusting, and respectful learning environment for students. CONCLusiON This study provides a detailed evaluation of curriculum, faculty, social interaction, and environment offered by an ASN or ADN program and identifies which areas students were most and least satisfied with in programs in the United</context>
