staffing levels in community settings challenges commissioners and providers of
services to find rigorous methods of capturing workforce evidence that can be
systematically used to shape effective services and skill mix for the future. This
article presents a brief review of current approaches and challenges to measuring
community nursing workload activity in England. Specifically, it shows phase&#xA0;1
pilot results using the Cassandra Matrix activity tool and review of ongoing
developments and progress to demonstrate scalability for national implementation. As
part of a much larger practice development project to develop community nursing, the
pilot used mixed methods to collect 10&#xA0;days of workload activity data from a
self-selected sample of band 5-7 nurses working in general and specialist community
nursing roles in three community organisations, and to evaluate their experiences of
using the tool via an electronic survey. The findings indicate that the tool has
significant potential for capturing the complexity and multiple dimensions of nursing
work in community contexts, and phase&#xA0;2 work has led to a community version of
the tool being piloted on a larger scale across six community organisations. KEY

complex (Hall, 1964; Leary et al, 2008; Warren et al, 2012); however, when portrayed
in terms of supply and demand, nursing work in the inpatient, specialist or community
setting is often represented as a linear series of tasks that are deterministic in
nature. These assumptions have led to nursing work being subjected to reductionist
research methods using activity analysis that are quite simplistic (e.g.&#xA0; time
and motion studies), but such methods do not capture complex work well (De Leon,
1993; Raiborn, 2004). In the research undertaken by Leary (2011) with specialist
nurses in oncology settings, for example, a nursing act has eight dimensions,
including intervention, context, time, emotional effort and other factors (Breast
Cancer Care, 2008; Leary et al, 2008; RCN, 2010a; 2010b; Oliver and Leary, 2012).
These aspects are rarely accounted for in any kind of time and motion or
work-sampling study, particularly the application of vigilance in order to rescue
patients from adverse consequences of disease or treatment (Oliver and Leary, 2012).

(Appendix&#xA0;1). The total sample size for the pilot was 24 self-selected
participants. Data were captured by each individual participant over a period of 10
working days. Using the paper-based tool, an activity was ticked every time it
occurred against an inventory of predetermined interventions. Each participant was
responsible for completing daily record sheets and then adding up the total number of
activities for each day. Once 10&#xA0; days' data capture had been completed, the
data sheets were returned to the research team and inputted into a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet. This provided an instant analysis of key activities, generating an
individual report of workload activity as well as an organisational-level report of
the spread of workload across the bands participating in the pilot. A Bristol Online
Survey (BOS) (BOS, 2013) was launched to provide an opportunity for participants to
capture their evaluation in a pre-test/post-test design format. Using a claims,
concerns and issues framework derived from fourth-generation evaluation (Lincoln and
Guba, 1985), the survey asked what positive statements participants would like to
make about using the tool, what concerns they had and what questions they would like
to be addressed. This information was taken with a simple cognitive mapping tool
asking participants to make a judgment regarding how effective they were at measuring
what they did both pre- and post-pilot. This enabled comparison before and after the
workload activity data collection. Ethical approval for the study Ethical approval
for the study was provided by the University Ethics Committee. Anonymity for
community nurse participants was clarified in a participant information sheet and
consent was informed by self-selected participant uptake. Participants received a
letter of thanks following their participation to enable them to request a copy of
their personalised Cassandra Matrix work profile data for their own records and
interest and to determine whether they wished to receive a full copy of the report.
Individual participant data was not readily identifiable in the organisational
analysis provided for each community organisation in the data analysis charts
provided. It was made clear to employers of the participant organisations that
individual community nurses' Cassandra activity profiles were confidential to the
participants to avoid individuals being readily identifiable. Results Phase 1 pilot
findings Some 24 out of 26 participants returned 10&#xA0;days of complete data,
providing a 92% response rate. Individual reports were produced for each participant
showing their overall intervention totals by the context in which they were carrying
them out. The organisational charts provided an opportunity to see the profile for a
whole set of employees' activity, and for some inferences to be made from observation
of an organisation's profile. This enabled comparison between activities and ratios
relating to employment bands at an organisational level. The pilot also generated a
crossorganisational analysis report that showed the consolidated interventions for
the whole cohort of participants according to the context in which the care took
place. This offered the opportunity to understand where the concentration of care
activity lies, both in terms of interventions made and context. It also enabled the
identification of some work overlap and repetition between band&#xA0;5 and
band&#xA0;7 practitioners. The data demonstrated that participating community nurses
were involved in significantly more procedural and holistic assessment work over and
above anything else, followed by (in order of significance): care planning and
evaluation, caseload management, symptom control and advice, promoting
self-management, reassessment of needs, handovers, and administration. The largest
spike in the data identified that a significant amount of travelling was done in
order to manage caseloads, with the majority of travel being scheduled as opposed to
unscheduled. The majority of care activity took place in domiciliary settings, and
although there was evidence of some telephone and clinical activity, the minority of
activity occurred within a multiprofessional context. The data also indicated that
practitioners engaged less (although still significantly) in providing health
education, risk assessment and reviews, hospital avoidance, coordinating care,
clinical risk assessment, and the chasing up of referrals and results. A less
significant part of the overall work consisted of rescue work, carer support, dealing
with distress, anxiety management, anxiety rescue, social assessment, safeguarding
the vulnerable, mediation of relationships, social advice, psychological assessments,
advocacy, communicating significant news, and joint assessments. In summary, the data
from this small pilot demonstrated that community nurses are required to draw on a
broad spectrum of skills; however, the emphasis upon which of those skills is put
into action differs according to the working environment. User responses to the tool
The survey indicated overwhelmingly that participants felt that the tool would make
visible the contribution of community nurses and is useful for both peer review and
benchmarking care standards. One participant stated:<component x="113.39" y="433.57"

staffing levels in community settings challenges commissioners and providers of
services to find rigorous methods of capturing workforce evidence that can be
systematically used to shape effective services and skill mix for the future. This
article presents a brief review of current approaches and challenges to measuring
community nursing workload activity in England. Specifically, it shows phase&#xA0;1
pilot results using the Cassandra Matrix activity tool and review of ongoing
developments and progress to demonstrate scalability for national implementation. As
part of a much larger practice development project to develop community nursing, the
pilot used mixed methods to collect 10&#xA0;days of workload activity data from a
self-selected sample of band 5-7 nurses working in general and specialist community
nursing roles in three community organisations, and to evaluate their experiences of
using the tool via an electronic survey. The findings indicate that the tool has
significant potential for capturing the complexity and multiple dimensions of nursing
work in community contexts, and phase&#xA0;2 work has led to a community version of
the tool being piloted on a larger scale across six community organisations. KEY

complex (Hall, 1964; Leary et al, 2008; Warren et al, 2012); however, when portrayed
in terms of supply and demand, nursing work in the inpatient, specialist or community
setting is often represented as a linear series of tasks that are deterministic in
nature. These assumptions have led to nursing work being subjected to reductionist
research methods using activity analysis that are quite simplistic (e.g.&#xA0; time
and motion studies), but such methods do not capture complex work well (De Leon,
1993; Raiborn, 2004). In the research undertaken by Leary (2011) with specialist
nurses in oncology settings, for example, a nursing act has eight dimensions,
including intervention, context, time, emotional effort and other factors (Breast
Cancer Care, 2008; Leary et al, 2008; RCN, 2010a; 2010b; Oliver and Leary, 2012).
These aspects are rarely accounted for in any kind of time and motion or
work-sampling study, particularly the application of vigilance in order to rescue
patients from adverse consequences of disease or treatment (Oliver and Leary, 2012).

(Appendix&#xA0;1). The total sample size for the pilot was 24 self-selected
participants. Data were captured by each individual participant over a period of 10
working days. Using the paper-based tool, an activity was ticked every time it
occurred against an inventory of predetermined interventions. Each participant was
responsible for completing daily record sheets and then adding up the total number of
activities for each day. Once 10&#xA0; days' data capture had been completed, the
data sheets were returned to the research team and inputted into a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet. This provided an instant analysis of key activities, generating an
individual report of workload activity as well as an organisational-level report of
the spread of workload across the bands participating in the pilot. A Bristol Online
Survey (BOS) (BOS, 2013) was launched to provide an opportunity for participants to
capture their evaluation in a pre-test/post-test design format. Using a claims,
concerns and issues framework derived from fourth-generation evaluation (Lincoln and
Guba, 1985), the survey asked what positive statements participants would like to
make about using the tool, what concerns they had and what questions they would like
to be addressed. This information was taken with a simple cognitive mapping tool
asking participants to make a judgment regarding how effective they were at measuring
what they did both pre- and post-pilot. This enabled comparison before and after the
workload activity data collection. Ethical approval for the study Ethical approval
for the study was provided by the University Ethics Committee. Anonymity for
community nurse participants was clarified in a participant information sheet and
consent was informed by self-selected participant uptake. Participants received a
letter of thanks following their participation to enable them to request a copy of
their personalised Cassandra Matrix work profile data for their own records and
interest and to determine whether they wished to receive a full copy of the report.
Individual participant data was not readily identifiable in the organisational
analysis provided for each community organisation in the data analysis charts
provided. It was made clear to employers of the participant organisations that
individual community nurses' Cassandra activity profiles were confidential to the
participants to avoid individuals being readily identifiable. Results Phase 1 pilot
findings Some 24 out of 26 participants returned 10&#xA0;days of complete data,
providing a 92% response rate. Individual reports were produced for each participant
showing their overall intervention totals by the context in which they were carrying
them out. The organisational charts provided an opportunity to see the profile for a
whole set of employees' activity, and for some inferences to be made from observation
of an organisation's profile. This enabled comparison between activities and ratios
relating to employment bands at an organisational level. The pilot also generated a
crossorganisational analysis report that showed the consolidated interventions for
the whole cohort of participants according to the context in which the care took
place. This offered the opportunity to understand where the concentration of care
activity lies, both in terms of interventions made and context. It also enabled the
identification of some work overlap and repetition between band&#xA0;5 and
band&#xA0;7 practitioners. The data demonstrated that participating community nurses
were involved in significantly more procedural and holistic assessment work over and
above anything else, followed by (in order of significance): care planning and
evaluation, caseload management, symptom control and advice, promoting
self-management, reassessment of needs, handovers, and administration. The largest
spike in the data identified that a significant amount of travelling was done in
order to manage caseloads, with the majority of travel being scheduled as opposed to
unscheduled. The majority of care activity took place in domiciliary settings, and
although there was evidence of some telephone and clinical activity, the minority of
activity occurred within a multiprofessional context. The data also indicated that
practitioners engaged less (although still significantly) in providing health
education, risk assessment and reviews, hospital avoidance, coordinating care,
clinical risk assessment, and the chasing up of referrals and results. A less
significant part of the overall work consisted of rescue work, carer support, dealing
with distress, anxiety management, anxiety rescue, social assessment, safeguarding
the vulnerable, mediation of relationships, social advice, psychological assessments,
advocacy, communicating significant news, and joint assessments. In summary, the data
from this small pilot demonstrated that community nurses are required to draw on a
broad spectrum of skills; however, the emphasis upon which of those skills is put
into action differs according to the working environment. User responses to the tool
The survey indicated overwhelmingly that participants felt that the tool would make
visible the contribution of community nurses and is useful for both peer review and
benchmarking care standards. One participant stated:<component x="113.39" y="433.57"
