managers have faced different challenges resulting from changes in health care
organizations and service structure reform. One of these changes involves the
changing role of first-line nursing managers (i.e., nurse managers and assistant
nurse managers). For the first-line nurse manager, this means new and additional
tasks, increased responsibilities and 1 larger staff groups. Competent professional
nurses do not need to be managed. Rather, the health care environment needs to be
managed so that nurses can better 2 work with patients. Thus, by managing the
environment, the nurse managers exert influence on the achievement of the goals and
outcomes of wards and 3,4 nursing groups. During the last few years, researchers have
studied nursing management from the point of view of hospitals' Magnet factors and
first-line nurse managers' compe5,6 tency. First-line nurse managers need
competencies, knowledge and skills in the essentials of power and influ7 ence to lead
nursing groups to achieve their goals. However, whether first-line nurse managers
have the power to lead nurses, and the type of power they possess, has not been
investigated. 1 8 In studies by Skytt and Brown et al., first-line nurse managers
described the difficulties they face every day, such as staffing, nursing shortages
and economics. These managers are responsible for issues such as the<component

first-line nurse managers are provided with additional support, resources and access
to information, they could use the resulting power to more effectively influence 10
ward, staff and patient outcomes. Nursing group power, as a concept, has been
minimally 11 defined in public health care services in Finland, although nursing
power has been identified as an essential pre-requisite if a nursing group is to
achieve its goals. Although traditional work environment factors have drawn the
attention of nursing researchers, nursing group power (as a work environment factor)
has received minimal attention. This study examined the relationship of first-line
nurse managers' power to the power of the nursing group.<component x="310.39"

managers' power as the knowledge and skills of a manager in relation to the
achievement of nursing group goals. Several types of nurse manager power have been
identified in the nursing literature: legitimate, 14 15,16 expert, referent,
positional and personal. Based on these types, we examined nurse managers' power in
relation to their role, position and resources. First-line nurse managers were
defined as nurse managers and assistant nurse managers, as these individuals work as
the manager of units or wards. 16 Hersey et al. stated that managers who understand
and know how to use power in their role, are more effective than those who do not.
Managers who feel they have the power in their role to implement change also report
higher 17 job satisfaction. In addition, nurse managers who feel more efficacious in
their nursing manager roles not only report more access to power for themselves but
they also 18 provide more access to power for their staff. The literature shows that
not all levels of nursing management have equal access to the same sources of power.
17 The findings of Manojlovich showed that the sources of power available to a nurse
manager depended on the manager's position in the organizational hierarchy.
Positional power has been associated with nursing knowledge and management.
Organizational cultures have clearly identified behaviours associated with nurse
managers' positions, 16 delegated responsibilities and the authority to work
independently. Nursing group power 2 Sieloff defined nursing group power as 'the
capacity of a group to achieve its goals' (p. 54). This definition is based on
Sieloff's theory of the group power within organizations, that power is composed of
eight components: controlling the effects of environmental forces, nursing position,
nursing resources, nursing role, communication The study Aim and the research
questions The aim of this study was to answer the following research questions: 1)
What is the level of power perceived by firstline nurse managers in public health
care services? 2) What is the relationship between first-line nurse managers' power
and nursing group power in the public health care services? The hypotheses designed
to address the above research questions were: 1) Nurse managers' overall levels of
power are positively correlated with an individual nurse manager's instrument scores.
2) Nurse managers' power is positively correlated with nursing group power, as
measured by the SKAGPO . &#xDF; Design A cross-sectional descriptive correlation
survey design was used. Information was obtained from first-line nurse managers in
three specific divisions in eleven public health care hospitals in Finland. research,
there were 1,960 nurse managers and 1,390 assistant nurse managers working in Finnish
hospitals. All firstline nurse managers in the three designated divisions of the
selected hospitals were invited to participate in the survey. The nursing directors
informed respondents about the study and data collection. The first-line managers who
responded to this study &#xBC; n ( 264) represented about 8% of the population. In
addition to a bachelor degree in nursing, Finnish first-line nurse managers may have
additional management education or university degrees. Data collection Data was
collected from February to May 2010 using a questionnaire that consisted of three
parts: 1) a background questionnaire, 2) the Nursing Managers' Power instrument, 3)
the Sieloff-King Assessment of Nursing Group Power within Organizations (SKAGPO)
instru&#xDF; ment. The instruments were both pre-tested by a group of n first-line
managers ( &#xBC;27) to confirm the content validity and language clarity of the
instruments in Finnish. Based on the outcomes, only linguistic revisions were
required. The demographic data collected Background variables. included: age, gender,
length of work experiences in nursing (both as a nursing manager and in their present
position), present title, and education level. The data collected on the
organizations and divisions included: the type of organization, total number of
health care staff in the organization, and the title of the first-line nurse
manager's supervisor, total number of wards managed by the first-line nurse manager
and the nursing professionals on those wards. In addition, managers were asked to
assess their own overall level of power and responsibility as a first-line nurse
manager using a Visual Analogue Scale of 0-10 (zero indicating the lowest and 10 the
highest level). These were used as additional background variables. The Nurse
Managers' Nurse Managers' Power instrument. Power instrument included 31 items with
three subscales: 12 7 12 role position and resources. Power was measured for each of
the subscales by asking whether managers perceived that they had power, what made
power possible for them, and also the source of that power. Items were &#xBC;
measured on a 5-point Likert-scale (1 Strongly agree to &#xBC; 5 Strongly disagree).
Consistent with the ranges associated with Sieloff's instrument: 1-2.3 indicated a
high level of power; 3.6-2.4 indicated a moderate level of power, and 3.7-5 indicated
a low level of power. The internal consistency of the scale was measured by
Cronbach's &#xBC; &#xBC; alpha (overall a 0.847; role subscale, a 0.632; position
&#xBC; &#xBC; subscale a 0.599; resources subscale a 0.697). These were at the
satisfactory level, if a coefficient alpha of 0.70 is acceptable for new scales. The
overall split-half reliability, tested by the Equal-Length Spearman- Brown Formula
was 0.77. The Sieloff-King Nursing Group Power Instrument. Assessment of Group Power
within Organizations &#xDF; (SKAGPO) is a 36-item questionnaire that estimates
nursing group power and includes eight subscales: controlling 7 4 nursing position,
nurthe effects of environmental forces, 3 6 sing role, nursing resources,
communication compe3 4 tency, goals/outcome competency, group manager's 4 5 power,
and power perspective. The items were measured, and cut-off (mean) scores indicated
as above. The instrument has previously been psychometrically evaluated in three
studies and its reliability and validity has been con27,28,29 sistently demonstrated.
In this study, for the Finnish version of the instrument, the internal consistency of
the overall scale was 0.87 and the Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the eight
subscales were at satisfactory level ranged from 0.49 to 0.75. The overall split-half
reliability (Spearman- Brown Formula) was 0.86. Ethical considerations Permission to
conduct the study was obtained from each target organization, however further
permissions from associated ethical committees were not required. Written permission
to use the survey instrument was obtained from the authors. The participants were
informed about the opportunity to participate in the study by their own supervisor by
the cover letter. In that had been told about length of the instrument and
possibility to interrupt their completion of the questionnaires without cause. No one
took advantage of this option. Each respondent consented to were completed

questionnaires anonymously. Data analysis The data was analysed using SPSS 18.0
statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Descriptive statistics (mean, range,
and standard deviation) were analysed for all variables and demographic data. The
distribution of the variables and sum scores were analysed with tests of skewness and
kurtosis. The mean scores for the subscales were derived by calculating the scores of
the individual items and then dividing them by the number of items in the subscale.
Differences between groups were examined t using the independent samples test and
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Pearson Product-moment correlations were used
to analyse the relationship between the nurse managers' and nursing group's power.
The relationship between the overall level of power and responsibility as a constant

manager (mean 2.43, range 1-5), and lowest in regard to their resources (mean 2.58,

and the overall level of responsibility as nurse manager p &lt; p &lt; (position 0.05

Scale, respondents who perceived their overall level of power or responsibility as
low (i.e., between 0 and 4), also assessed the other subscales of role, position and
resources of the Nurse Managers' Power instrument at the low levels. Comparing the
first-line nurse managers' perceptions of their overall level of power and
responsibility; based on the manager's work areas there were not significant
differences. Respondents from the surgical division perceived their overall level of
power to be the lowest, and of the three divisions, the psychiatric division
first-line managers reported the lowest levels of responsibility. Hypothesis 1 (Table

power is a general concept within organizational and social theory, there is a
paucity of literature addressing the power of nurse managers or nursing. Therefore,
it is difficult to compare the results of this study with previous research. In
addition, it was the first time the Nursing Managers' Power and SKAGPO instruments
had been used in Finland, although the Nursing Managers' Power instrument
demonstrated reliability in this study and the SKAGPO instrument had previously
demonstrated reliability and validity in the United 12,29,30,32 States. Despite the
translation issues related to SKAGPO, there may also have been different cultural
interpretations of items by the respondents and this may have affected their
responses. There may be differences in interpretation between the use of the SKAGPO
in different countries and when using differ&#xDF; ent languages. Consequently, these
differences may present some limitations to the generalizability of related findings.
However, the generalizability of findings within the Finnish public health care
system is possible as the sample was representative of ten of the twenty public
hospitals in Finland.<component x="310.39" y="388.78" width="249.46" height="221.45"

processes. Conclusion When first-line nurse managers do not have sufficient power,
they cannot effectively foster the development of nursing practice, or ensure that
their units achieve their operational goals. The positive relationships between a
manager's perceived power and the power perceived by their nursing group should be
viewed as important at unit and organizational levels, as these relationships could
subsequently have a significant impact on the attainment of patient goals and
outcomes related to safety and quality of care. The results of this study suggest
that nurse managers perceive that their power base lies with their supervisor and
colleagues, rather than their own nursing group. In order for nurse managers to
further increase their power and decrease their oppressed group behaviours, it is
critical that they look to alliances within their nursing group rather than to
external parties. Due to changing health care environments, particular attention
should be paid to the first-line nurse manager's role, position and resources, in
order to enable them to safeguard the operations of their unit or ward and ensure
successful change management. Author contributions SV, PA and TS were responsible for

moderately related to each other ( 0.468, p &lt; 0.01). This positive relationship is
consistent with findings from previous studies, since a nurse manager's role is to
provide leadership in their ward and support nursing 3,4,12 groups to achieve defined
outcomes and goals When nurse managers perceive themselves to be powerful in relation
to their role, this perception should also contribute to the nursing group's view of
the importance of their role within the organization. According to the respondents'
perceptions of their power of position, they have power and legitimacy that 16 occur
specifically through the nursing context. The results concerning the overall level of
power and the firstline nursing managers' power of position support this. However,
the correlation between first-line nursing managers' position and the nursing group's
position subscale r&#xBC; was weak ( 0.292). Both positional powers could be
influenced by organizational culture factors not explained by this study, however,
the respondents' assessments of the power of first-line nursing managers' position in
the different divisions did not differ significantly. Even if first-line nurse
managers perceive that they have power associated with their position, the level of
power seems to depend on the manager's supervisor and colleagues, and depends less on
the nursing group. In addition, respondents described the organization's statutes as
facilitating this positional power. This perception seems logical as the position of
first-line nurse managers is defined by the organization's policies, and these
policies and guidelines also play a role in the nursing group's 3 power. In contrast,
previous research has found that the organization's past and current statutes also
could limit 16 first-line nurse managers' power through the organization's culture.
Over half of the first-line nurse managers experienced personal power. Personal power
was previously described as the ability and opportunity to get things done in
advance, and is also seen to influence cooperation and 16 32 communication. Upenieks
stated that personal power increases through the development of trust in relation to
others. Therefore, personal power is an important resource and proposed to be linked
to informal power.<component x="35.43" y="66.03" width="511.66" height="702.59"

managers have faced different challenges resulting from changes in health care
organizations and service structure reform. One of these changes involves the
changing role of first-line nursing managers (i.e., nurse managers and assistant
nurse managers). For the first-line nurse manager, this means new and additional
tasks, increased responsibilities and 1 larger staff groups. Competent professional
nurses do not need to be managed. Rather, the health care environment needs to be
managed so that nurses can better 2 work with patients. Thus, by managing the
environment, the nurse managers exert influence on the achievement of the goals and
outcomes of wards and 3,4 nursing groups. During the last few years, researchers have
studied nursing management from the point of view of hospitals' Magnet factors and
first-line nurse managers' compe5,6 tency. First-line nurse managers need
competencies, knowledge and skills in the essentials of power and influ7 ence to lead
nursing groups to achieve their goals. However, whether first-line nurse managers
have the power to lead nurses, and the type of power they possess, has not been
investigated. 1 8 In studies by Skytt and Brown et al., first-line nurse managers
described the difficulties they face every day, such as staffing, nursing shortages
and economics. These managers are responsible for issues such as the<component

first-line nurse managers are provided with additional support, resources and access

ward, staff and patient outcomes. Nursing group power, as a concept, has been
minimally 11 defined in public health care services in Finland, although nursing
power has been identified as an essential pre-requisite if a nursing group is to
achieve its goals. Although traditional work environment factors have drawn the
attention of nursing researchers, nursing group power (as a work environment factor)
has received minimal attention. This study examined the relationship of first-line

managers' power as the knowledge and skills of a manager in relation to the
achievement of nursing group goals. Several types of nurse manager power have been
identified in the nursing literature: legitimate, 14 15,16 expert, referent,
positional and personal. Based on these types, we examined nurse managers' power in
relation to their role, position and resources. First-line nurse managers were
defined as nurse managers and assistant nurse managers, as these individuals work as
the manager of units or wards. 16 Hersey et al. stated that managers who understand
and know how to use power in their role, are more effective than those who do not.
Managers who feel they have the power in their role to implement change also report
higher 17 job satisfaction. In addition, nurse managers who feel more efficacious in
their nursing manager roles not only report more access to power for themselves but
they also 18 provide more access to power for their staff. The literature shows that
not all levels of nursing management have equal access to the same sources of power.
17 The findings of Manojlovich showed that the sources of power available to a nurse
manager depended on the manager's position in the organizational hierarchy.
Positional power has been associated with nursing knowledge and management.
Organizational cultures have clearly identified behaviours associated with nurse
managers' positions, 16 delegated responsibilities and the authority to work
independently. Nursing group power 2 Sieloff defined nursing group power as 'the
capacity of a group to achieve its goals' (p. 54). This definition is based on
Sieloff's theory of the group power within organizations, that power is composed of
eight components: controlling the effects of environmental forces, nursing position,
nursing resources, nursing role, communication The study Aim and the research
questions The aim of this study was to answer the following research questions: 1)
What is the level of power perceived by firstline nurse managers in public health
care services? 2) What is the relationship between first-line nurse managers' power
and nursing group power in the public health care services? The hypotheses designed
to address the above research questions were: 1) Nurse managers' overall levels of
power are positively correlated with an individual nurse manager's instrument scores.
2) Nurse managers' power is positively correlated with nursing group power, as
measured by the SKAGPO . &#xDF; Design A cross-sectional descriptive correlation
survey design was used. Information was obtained from first-line nurse managers in
three specific divisions in eleven public health care hospitals in Finland. research,
there were 1,960 nurse managers and 1,390 assistant nurse managers working in Finnish
hospitals. All firstline nurse managers in the three designated divisions of the
selected hospitals were invited to participate in the survey. The nursing directors
informed respondents about the study and data collection. The first-line managers who
responded to this study &#xBC; n ( 264) represented about 8% of the population. In
addition to a bachelor degree in nursing, Finnish first-line nurse managers may have
additional management education or university degrees. Data collection Data was
collected from February to May 2010 using a questionnaire that consisted of three
parts: 1) a background questionnaire, 2) the Nursing Managers' Power instrument, 3)
the Sieloff-King Assessment of Nursing Group Power within Organizations (SKAGPO)
instru&#xDF; ment. The instruments were both pre-tested by a group of n first-line
managers ( &#xBC;27) to confirm the content validity and language clarity of the
instruments in Finnish. Based on the outcomes, only linguistic revisions were
required. The demographic data collected Background variables. included: age, gender,
length of work experiences in nursing (both as a nursing manager and in their present
position), present title, and education level. The data collected on the
organizations and divisions included: the type of organization, total number of
health care staff in the organization, and the title of the first-line nurse
manager's supervisor, total number of wards managed by the first-line nurse manager
and the nursing professionals on those wards. In addition, managers were asked to
assess their own overall level of power and responsibility as a first-line nurse
manager using a Visual Analogue Scale of 0-10 (zero indicating the lowest and 10 the
highest level). These were used as additional background variables. The Nurse
Managers' Nurse Managers' Power instrument. Power instrument included 31 items with
three subscales: 12 7 12 role position and resources. Power was measured for each of
the subscales by asking whether managers perceived that they had power, what made
power possible for them, and also the source of that power. Items were &#xBC;
measured on a 5-point Likert-scale (1 Strongly agree to &#xBC; 5 Strongly disagree).
Consistent with the ranges associated with Sieloff's instrument: 1-2.3 indicated a
high level of power; 3.6-2.4 indicated a moderate level of power, and 3.7-5 indicated
a low level of power. The internal consistency of the scale was measured by
Cronbach's &#xBC; &#xBC; alpha (overall a 0.847; role subscale, a 0.632; position
&#xBC; &#xBC; subscale a 0.599; resources subscale a 0.697). These were at the
satisfactory level, if a coefficient alpha of 0.70 is acceptable for new scales. The
overall split-half reliability, tested by the Equal-Length Spearman- Brown Formula
was 0.77. The Sieloff-King Nursing Group Power Instrument. Assessment of Group Power
within Organizations &#xDF; (SKAGPO) is a 36-item questionnaire that estimates
nursing group power and includes eight subscales: controlling 7 4 nursing position,
nurthe effects of environmental forces, 3 6 sing role, nursing resources,
communication compe3 4 tency, goals/outcome competency, group manager's 4 5 power,
and power perspective. The items were measured, and cut-off (mean) scores indicated
as above. The instrument has previously been psychometrically evaluated in three
studies and its reliability and validity has been con27,28,29 sistently demonstrated.
In this study, for the Finnish version of the instrument, the internal consistency of
the overall scale was 0.87 and the Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the eight
subscales were at satisfactory level ranged from 0.49 to 0.75. The overall split-half
reliability (Spearman- Brown Formula) was 0.86. Ethical considerations Permission to
conduct the study was obtained from each target organization, however further
permissions from associated ethical committees were not required. Written permission
to use the survey instrument was obtained from the authors. The participants were
informed about the opportunity to participate in the study by their own supervisor by
the cover letter. In that had been told about length of the instrument and
possibility to interrupt their completion of the questionnaires without cause. No one
took advantage of this option. Each respondent consented to were completed

statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Descriptive statistics (mean, range,
and standard deviation) were analysed for all variables and demographic data. The
distribution of the variables and sum scores were analysed with tests of skewness and
kurtosis. The mean scores for the subscales were derived by calculating the scores of
the individual items and then dividing them by the number of items in the subscale.
Differences between groups were examined t using the independent samples test and
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Pearson Product-moment correlations were used
to analyse the relationship between the nurse managers' and nursing group's power.
The relationship between the overall level of power and responsibility as a constant

power is a general concept within organizational and social theory, there is a
paucity of literature addressing the power of nurse managers or nursing. Therefore,
it is difficult to compare the results of this study with previous research. In
addition, it was the first time the Nursing Managers' Power and SKAGPO instruments
had been used in Finland, although the Nursing Managers' Power instrument
demonstrated reliability in this study and the SKAGPO instrument had previously
demonstrated reliability and validity in the United 12,29,30,32 States. Despite the
translation issues related to SKAGPO, there may also have been different cultural
interpretations of items by the respondents and this may have affected their
responses. There may be differences in interpretation between the use of the SKAGPO
in different countries and when using differ&#xDF; ent languages. Consequently, these
differences may present some limitations to the generalizability of related findings.
However, the generalizability of findings within the Finnish public health care
system is possible as the sample was representative of ten of the twenty public
hospitals in Finland.<component x="310.39" y="388.78" width="249.46" height="221.45"

processes. Conclusion When first-line nurse managers do not have sufficient power,
they cannot effectively foster the development of nursing practice, or ensure that
their units achieve their operational goals. The positive relationships between a
manager's perceived power and the power perceived by their nursing group should be
viewed as important at unit and organizational levels, as these relationships could
subsequently have a significant impact on the attainment of patient goals and
outcomes related to safety and quality of care. The results of this study suggest
that nurse managers perceive that their power base lies with their supervisor and
colleagues, rather than their own nursing group. In order for nurse managers to
further increase their power and decrease their oppressed group behaviours, it is
critical that they look to alliances within their nursing group rather than to
external parties. Due to changing health care environments, particular attention
should be paid to the first-line nurse manager's role, position and resources, in
order to enable them to safeguard the operations of their unit or ward and ensure
successful change management. Author contributions SV, PA and TS were responsible for

moderately related to each other ( 0.468, p &lt; 0.01). This positive relationship is
consistent with findings from previous studies, since a nurse manager's role is to
provide leadership in their ward and support nursing 3,4,12 groups to achieve defined
outcomes and goals When nurse managers perceive themselves to be powerful in relation
to their role, this perception should also contribute to the nursing group's view of
the importance of their role within the organization. According to the respondents'
perceptions of their power of position, they have power and legitimacy that 16 occur
specifically through the nursing context. The results concerning the overall level of
power and the firstline nursing managers' power of position support this. However,
the correlation between first-line nursing managers' position and the nursing group's
position subscale r&#xBC; was weak ( 0.292). Both positional powers could be
influenced by organizational culture factors not explained by this study, however,
the respondents' assessments of the power of first-line nursing managers' position in
the different divisions did not differ significantly. Even if first-line nurse
managers perceive that they have power associated with their position, the level of
power seems to depend on the manager's supervisor and colleagues, and depends less on
the nursing group. In addition, respondents described the organization's statutes as
facilitating this positional power. This perception seems logical as the position of
first-line nurse managers is defined by the organization's policies, and these
policies and guidelines also play a role in the nursing group's 3 power. In contrast,
previous research has found that the organization's past and current statutes also
could limit 16 first-line nurse managers' power through the organization's culture.
Over half of the first-line nurse managers experienced personal power. Personal power
was previously described as the ability and opportunity to get things done in
advance, and is also seen to influence cooperation and 16 32 communication. Upenieks
stated that personal power increases through the development of trust in relation to
others. Therefore, personal power is an important resource and proposed to be linked
to informal power.<component x="35.43" y="66.03" width="511.66" height="702.59"
