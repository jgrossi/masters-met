approaches that were used to assist with implementation of family systems nursing
(FSN) at a university hospital level in Northern Europe. Design and Methods: A
quasi-experimental research design was used for the first phase of the study. For the
second phase, a cross-sectional research design was used. Data were collected in the
first phase of the study from 457 nurses in all except one of the divisions of the
hospital regarding their attitudes towards involving families into their care before
and after having participated in the education and training intervention (ETI)
program in FSN. Furthermore, in the second phase, data were collected from 812
nurses, after FSN had been implemented in all divisions at Landspitali University
Hospital, regarding the nurses' knowledge of FSN and their evaluation of the quality
of the ETI program (i.e., theoretical lectures on FSN as well as the benefit of the
skill lab training regarding applying FSN into their clinical practices). Graham and
colleagues' Knowledge to Action framework was used as the conceptual framework for
the research. Results: Nurses who had taken a course in FSN reported a significantly
more positive attitude towards involving families in their care after the ETI program
compared to those who had not taken such a course. Furthermore, a majority of the
nurses who participated in the ETI program reported that the program was a favorable
experience and indicated readiness for applying FSN in clinical practice.
Conclusions: Further research is needed regarding the benefits of offering FSN at an
institutional level, but focusing international attention on effective strategies to
implement FSN into nursing practice may result in better health care for individuals
and families around the globe. Clinical Relevance: Providing clinically meaningful
education and training in family nursing through programs such as the ETI program for

a phenomenon that is getting increased attention among administrators, and scientists
in general, as well as advanced nurse practitioners. The reason is that stronger
evidence is being reported in the literature regarding the benefits of involving
families in healthcare services, both for patients and family members. Furthermore,
recommendations put forward by the International Council of Nursing (2002) and World
Health Organization (WHO; 2006) on the importance of involving families in health
care, and numerous research findings on improved health outcomes following
interventions for families dealing with chronic and acute illnesses, are promising
(Bell &amp; Wright, 2011; Chesla, 2010; Leahey &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2009;
Svavarsdottir, Sigurdardottir, &amp; Tryggvadottir, 2014; Sveinbjarnardottir,
Svavarsdottir, &amp; Wright, 2012). In addition, because of findings from
evidence-based research that supports benefits of psychosocial interventions in
clinical practice (Svavarsdottir &amp; Sigurdardottir, 2013; Warner et al., 2011),
clinical guidelines are increasingly recommending effective family nursing
involvement in health care to strengthen both the patient and the family (Registered
Nurses Association of Ontario, Canada, 2006). Based on the increased evidence in the
literature on positive outcomes of involving families in healthcare services, the
Landspitali University Hospital Family Nursing Implementation Project was established
in 2007 and was actively applied over a 4-year time period, until the end of 2011.
The purpose of this research was to evaluate strategies that were used to facilitate
implementation of FSN in general practices as well as advanced nursing practices at
Landspitali University Hospital (LUH) in 2007-2011.<component x="54.78" y="239.72"

lateness="0.25" reference_score="7.59">Recently, circularity between knowledge
transfer and clinical practice has received attention from scientists and healthcare
leaders worldwide. Among those who are responsible for knowledge translation at an
institutional level, however, little is known about what strategies have been used
when moving evidence into practice. Therefore, in today's societies, it is vital to
understand the importance of relational practices between healthcare professionals
and families. The quality of the relationship between healthcare professionals and
family members is important in order to understand how relational practices or
actions can be used to be of the most benefit to patients' health and wellbeing. One
indicator for evaluating the quality of the relationship between healthcare
professionals and family members is to evaluate healthcare professionals' attitudes
towards involving families in their care, and to evaluate family members' feelings of
receiving friendly, pleasant, and connected communications or behaviors versus
unfriendly, hostile, or distanced behaviors or attitudes from healthcare
professionals (Bell &amp; Wright, 2011; Benzein, Johansson, Arestedt, Berg, &#xA8;
&amp; Saveman, 2008; Saveman, Benzein, Engstrom, &amp; &#x2DA; Arestedt, 2011;
Simpson &amp; Tarrant, 2006; Wright &amp; Bell, 2009). Families who are supporting
their loved one at a hospital are often dealing with a very complex health situation.
Wright and Bell (2009) have emphasized that behaviors of family members cannot be
considered in isolation, but rather in the context of the family situation.
Therefore, families who experience high-quality relationships with healthcare
professionals are less likely to experience feelings of isolation or being vulnerable
or uncertain in their caregiving role. Nurses' attitudes towards involving families
in their care has been studied by nurses in Western societies (Saveman et al., 2011;
Sveinbjarnardottir, Svavarsdottir, &amp; Saveman, 2011). The attitudes of nurses are
believed to influence the quality of clinical practice among family nurses. When
establishing therapeutic relationships and offering families therapeutic
conversations, where the goal is to offer support, facilitate change, and/or maintain
or enhance family functioning and well-being, positive attitudes of nurses towards
families are essential. According to nurse scientists who have conceptualized these
beliefs in their models, such as in the Beliefs and Illness Model (Bell &amp; Wright,
2011; Wright &amp; Bell, 2009) and in the Calgary Family Assessment and Intervention
Models (CFAM/CFIM) (Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009), nurses' attitudes or beliefs towards
involving families in their care are seen to be fundamental to the possibility of
creating therapeutic change, leading to healing, and to decrease suffering among
family members. In these models, while embracing change, it is important to identify
constraining and facilitating beliefs when establishing involvement in therapeutic
relationships that nurses create in collaboration with the family. Strong research
evidence is now available of the importance of involving families in health care,
where families have been found to be of importance both to the acute and chronically
ill patient (Halldorsdottir &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2012; Kamban &amp; Svavarsdottir,
2013; Knafl, Deatrick, &amp; Havill, 2012; Konradsdottir &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2011;
McClement, Fallis, &amp; Pereira, 2009; Nelms &amp; Eggenberger, 2010;
Sigurdardottir, Svavarsdottir, Rayens, &amp; Adkins, 2013; Svavarsdottir et al.,
2014), as well as to general and advanced nurses who provide the care (McClement et
al., 2009; Schulman-Green et al., 2012). According to Benzein and colleagues (2008)
and Wright and Leahey (2009), when the needs of families are addressed and their
suffering is acknowledged, the time for patient care is actually maximized and more
efficient. This evidence must be of great value to the nursing profession, where time
constraints in clinical practice are now of more concern than ever. Further, the
growing emphasis on research evidence to direct practice focuses the attention on the
education and training of nurses when applying family systems methods and research
findings into clinical practice. In order to improve the health of a population, both
the WHO (2005) and Canadian Institute of Health Research (2005) have emphasized the
importance of knowledge translation (KT) into clinical practice, where evidencebased
information is incorporated into healthcare services (e.g., interactions among
researchers and users) in such a way that it effects optimal healthcare outcomes and
strengthens healthcare systems. The process of translating new knowledge into
clinical practice has been conceptualized in the Knowledge to Action framework by
Graham and colleagues (2006) and Straus, Tetroe, and Graham (2011). In this model, KT
is seen as occurring in two interactive phases-the knowledge creation phase and the
action phase-with fluid boundaries between the creation and the action components of
the model. As knowledge is sorted out or refined, the resulting knowledge becomes
more developed and useful to the users. In the action phase, knowledge can be
implemented simultaneously, and the knowledge phase can influence the action phase at
several points in the model. Based on a review of the literature and the Knowledge to
Action model, new knowledge regarding the attitude of the nurses at LUH towards
involving families in their care, as well as creating knowledge about nurses'
theories and confidence in their own clinical skills in offering FSN after having
participated in the education and training intervention (ETI) program, were evaluated
(Figure 1). Based on a review of the literature and the conceptual framework that
guided the study, the following hypothesis was tested: Nurses' attitudes towards
involving families in their care will improve significantly after the ETI program,
compared to before the ETI program, as measured by the Family Importance in Nursing
Care-Nurses' Attitude (FINC-NA) scale. The following research question was asked:
What is the level of theoretical knowledge about the CFAM/CFIM and the level of
competence in applying FSN, as introduced in the Calgary models, in clinical practice
(e.g., using interviewing skills, assessments, interventions, relational
interactions, identifying strengths, etc.) among nurses and midwifes at LUH after
having participated in the ETI program in FSN?<component x="54.78" y="81.64"

one-group pre and post quasi-experimental study design was used. Data were collected
at two time periods from nurses working on all divisions except the emergency
division at LUH through an electronic procedure, as well as through paper and pencil
format. Nurses who met the inclusion criteria were introduced to the study by members
of the research team. The eligibility criteria were being a registered nurse or a
midwife who was employed at LUH at the time of the study and being able to read and
write Icelandic at a minimum of a fourth-grade level. An exclusion criterion for
participation was being involved in another study regarding attitudes or beliefs
towards FSN at the hospital. At time one in the first phase of the study
(pre-intervention), 457 nurses participated. At time two (post-intervention), which
took place about 8 to 24 months later, 411 nurses answered the questionnaire.
Information regarding the sample in the first phase of the study is distributed in
Table 1. For the second phase of the study, the design was cross-sectional. In this
phase, 812 nurses and midwifes consented and participated in the study over the 4
years that the data collection took place. Data were collected at one time after the
nurses and midwives had participated in the FSN ETI program.<component x="301.54"

implement FSN into clinical practice at the hospital, where the process of
translating new knowledge into clinical practice was based on the Knowledge to Action
framework of Graham et al. (2006). In this study, the knowledge creation phase
consisted of two separate studies: (a) evaluating the nurses' attitudes towards
involving families in their care, before and after having participated in the ETI
program, and (b) evaluating the nurses' knowledge and competence in applying FSN in
clinical practice. In the action phase of this model, the nurses in the FNSC, in
collaboration with nurses in the family systems nursing implementation teams (FSNIT)
on all divisions and units at the hospital, implemented simultaneously into clinical
practice the new knowledge that had been created in FSN intervention research
projects at the hospital (e.g., added benefit of offering short-term FSN
interventions to families) and had been trained in the ETI program.<component

their clinical settings appropriate educational and emotional support and
interventions based on the Calgary models. By focusing on conducting family
interviews, using therapeutic questions when interviewing families, and through
drawing forward family strengths to handle health situations, nurses might maintain
or increase the families' wellness and functioning. To fulfill the educational
objectives of the ETI program, the nurses attended either a 1-day seminar of 8 hr or
two half-day seminars of 4 hr (depending on the needs of the divisions) on the
CFAM/CFIM and on family interviewing. Further, the participants were offered family
skills lab training and workshops where the focus was on offering short-term family
nursing interventions (e.g., conducting family trees and mapping relationships among
family members and connection with society as well as training the nurses in asking
intervention questions, drawing forward family strengths, and offering
commendations). The nurses practiced FSN skills on each<component x="54.78" y="93.6"

Questionnaire. questionnaire is a 26-item scale (Benzein et al., 2008) that was
originally developed in a sample of Swedish nurses, but has been translated and
pilot-tested with a sample of Icelandic nurses. The psychometric properties of the
Icelandic version were similar to those reported by &#xF0; the authors (Skuladottir,
Konra sdottir, &amp; Agustsdottir, 2010). The scaling of the instrument is a 4-point
Likert strongly agree scale ranging from tostrongly disagree . For the whole
instrument, the scoring range was 26 to 104. The higher the score, the more positive
the attitude to&#x3B1; wards families reported by the nurses. Cronbach's for internal
consistency is 0.88 for the total scale. The FINCNA instrument is composed of four
factors: (a) family as a &#x3B1; resource in nursing ( 0.805; e.g., the presence of

families); (b) as a conversational partner ( = 0.785; e.g., I invite family members

resources in order to optimize their opportunities for coping with situations by
themselves; Benzein et al., 2008).<component x="301.55" y="477.46" width="227.17"

involving families in their care, on all the divisions except the emergency division
at LUH, were evaluated before and after having participated in the ETI program.
Interestingly, when the data from the hospital were evaluated all together, no
significant difference was found on the nurses' attitudes towards involving families
in their care at LUH after having participated in the ETI program compared to before
participating in the ETI program. When the data were further evaluated based on the
responses from the nurses on each division, no significant differences were found in
the nurses' attitudes towards involving families in their care after these nurses had
participated in the ETI program compared to before they had participated.
Nevertheless, when the data were evaluated based on the nurses' background
information, a significant difference was found after the ETI program on the nurse's
attitudes towards involving families in their care, based on if the nurses had taken
a course in FSN compared to the nurses who had not taken such a course. The nurses
who had taken a course in FSN reported significantly lower burden towards involving
families in their care after the ETI program, compared to the nurses who had not
taken such a course in FSN t (pre-ETI program 13.20, post-ETI program 12.97, == p =

differences in means on the knowledge about FSN based on the lectures about the
Calgary models and on family interviewing, and on the family nursing skills lab
training, regarding the nurses' confidence in applying FSN into clinical practice
after having participated in the ETI program. Even though all the data were scored
considerably high (the content of the Calgary models ranged in scoring from 12 to 30
[mean scoring ranged from 25.0 to 27.6; possible scoring ranged from 6 to 30] and the
confidence in applying FSN in clinical practice ranged in scoring from 0 to 11 [mean
scoring ranged from 6.6 to 9.4; possible scoring ranged from 0 to 11]), there was a
significant difference found based on the division in which the nurses worked. The
nurses at LUH who worked in the surgical division scored significantly higher on the
knowledge and content component than the nurses who worked in the women and children
division, internal medicine division, and emergency division. Further, the nurses who
worked in the emergency division scored significantly higher on the theoretical
knowledge and content component of the Calgary models than did the nurses who worked
in the women and the children division. In addition, the nurses in the internal
medicine division scored significantly higher on the knowledge and content component
of the Calgary models than did the nurses in the women and children services (Table
3). Similarly, when the clinical skills and confidence component was evaluated, the
nurses in the mental health division were found to score significantly higher on the
clinical skills and confidence component than did the nurses in the internal medicine
division and surgical division. Nurses in the women and the children division were
found to score significantly higher on the clinical skills and confidence component
than nurses in the internal medicine services and surgical division. Furthermore,
nurses in the internal medicine services were found to score significantly higher on

implementation of FSN into nursing practice at LUH, the nurses' attitudes towards
involving families in their care was evaluated. This evaluation was conducted on all
divisions except the emergency division at the hospital, because of specific
situations in the emergency division at the time. In the Calgary models (Wright &amp;
Leahey, 2009) and in the Illness Belief model (Wright &amp; Bell, 2009), emphasis is
placed on the fundamental assumption that a positive attitude of nurses towards
involving families in health care is essential to facilitating a therapeutic change,
leading to healing and decreasing suffering in families. Knowing the nurses'
attitudes towards the importance of involving families in their care is therefore
critical, because nurses' attitudes towards FSN can determine the quality of the
therapeutic conversations with families and determine the level of involvement that
the nurse can create in harmony with families in the therapeutic process.
Interestingly, however, in this study at LUH, nurses' attitudes towards involving
families in their care did not change after having participated in the ETI program,
neither when the data was evaluated by the nurses at the whole hospital, nor by the
nurses' evaluations on the women and children, mental health, surgical, or internal
medicine divisions at that hospital. One explanation for the lack of significant
findings can be based on the fact that the nurses scored high (86.3) on the FINC-NA
instrument (the highest possible score is 104 for the whole instrument) before
participating in the ETI program, and the nurses also scored similarly high<component

participated in the ETI program. Also, because of the design of this version of the
FINC-NA instrument (a 4-point Likert scale), a lack of variability of the scores in
the instrument may have contributed to the difficulty in capturing change after the
ETI program, compared to before the ETI program. Yet, the authors of the FINC-NA
instrument have recently (i.e., after this study took place) worked on refining and
revalidating the instrument regarding the scoring distribution, which has resulted in
an improved 5-point Likert scale instrument (Saveman et al., 2011). Nevertheless, a
significant difference was found on the nurses' attitudes towards involving families

lateness="0.75" reference_score="7.67">care after having participated in the ETI
program, based on whether the nurses had taken a course in FSN. These nurses reported
a significantly lower burden towards involving families in their care compared to the
nurses who had not taken such a course. These findings emphasize that education in
FSN had an influence on the nurses' attitudes towards evaluating families that they
cared for at LUH (i.e., families were viewed as significantly less burdensome). In
addition, these findings are in harmony with the theoretical underpinnings in the
Calgary and the Illness Beliefs models (Wright &amp; Bell, 2009; Wright &amp; Leahey,
2009), where nurses' attitudes are believed to have an impact on nurses' cognition or
behavior when practicing in clinical settings. On the other hand, training nurses in
FSN in clinical settings took place through lectures and through family skills labs.
The goal of the training program was to increase the nurses' knowledge and skills in
FSN within their clinical settings. The main emphasis in the learning process was on
stimulating ideas of applying FSN in clinical practice through discussions and
dialogue among the clinical instructors and clinical nurses. In this learning
environment, the nurses in the general practices got the opportunity to respond to
theoretical and conceptual issues regarding FSN and to reflect on their own clinical
experiences when working with families. Even though there was no significant
difference found at the hospital on the nurses' attitudes towards involving families
in their care after having participated in the ETI program, the content and
components of the ETI program were evaluated favorably by the nurses who took it over
the 4 years of the study. That is, the scoring was much skewed towards the positive
end of the scale on the NKC measure after the ETI program. The nurses scored on
average 25 out of the highest possible score of 30 in the knowledge and content
factor of the NKC scale, and the nurses' mean score was 7.8 out of the highest
possible scoring of 11 on the factor regarding using FSN in the clinical practice
part of the NKC scale. Interestingly, however, in the knowledge and content factor of
the NKC scale, the nurses in the surgical division were found to score the highest,
followed by nurses in the emergency division, when compared to the nurses in the
other divisions at the hospital. The nurses in the women and children division scored
the lowest on the knowledge and content component of the Calgary models,
significantly lower compared to the nurses in the other divisions. However, the
nurses in the mental health division were found to score the highest on the clinical
skills and confidence component of the NKC scale, followed by the nurses in the women
and children services at LUH, who scored the second highest on the clinical skills
and confidence component of the scale. Nonetheless, the nurses in the surgical
division were found to score the lowest or significantly lower than the nurses in the
other divisions at the hospital on the clinical skills and confidence factor of the
NKC scale. This finding is new and has not been reported previously in the
literature. A possible explanation is that the nurses in mental health services and
in women and children services are trained in working with families on a regular
basis and because of that might be more skilled in interviewing families than the
nurses working on units at the hospital dealing in general with more physical
diseases among their patient population. Nevertheless, having the nurses in the
emergency services scoring the third highest on the clinical skills and confidence
component in applying FSN in clinical practice was surprising but may stress the need
for a family nursing perspective in the nursing practice in the emergency division of
the hospital.<component x="299.87" y="93.78" width="227.17" height="151.84" page="8"

used at LUH to implement FSN into general as well as advanced nursing practices are
encouraging. Through meetings and support group activities, the implementation
process on each of the divisions was evaluated and the research findings adapted
based on specific needs from the divisions and units. However, what is still needed
in the years to come and what future research needs to focus on is to specifically
evaluate the benefits of the ETI program and the FSN interventions with valid and
reliable scales. It is also important to assess barriers to using FSN on the
divisions, to further monitor the outcomes of the implementation as well as sustain
the knowledge use, and to specifically select knowledge to use on each division. In
addition, evaluating implications to practice is of major importance. Nurses in
general practice and advanced practice at LUH who have been trained in FSN within
clinical settings have reported the ETI program to be a favorable experience. In
addition, nurses' attitudes at the hospital towards family nursing are in general
positive. Since nurses on all units at LUH have now received training in FSN in
general and advanced nursing practices, the most critical point from an
administrative and implementation perspective will be to continue to offer the ETI
program to the nurses who still have not taken it, and to continue to support nurses
who have already taken the ETI program, in offering short-term FSN interventions to
families. Such support and encouragement will be needed to facilitate the
implementation. Strategies that might be of help to build up confidence in family
nursing and to smooth out the process of further implementing, maintaining, and
sustaining FSN in nursing practices at LUH might be to (a) offer all nurses in
general practices further educational support in FSN in clinical settings, (b) offer
clinical consultation to nurses in advanced practices, and (c) support nurses in
further developing their skills in working with families. By continuing to build and
support a strong partnership between nurse scientists within academia and clinicians,
we may be more likely to succeed. One vignette for such a partnership is through the
newly established Center of Family Nursing Research and Development at LUH, and
through participation in programs of research and teaching, and application of FSN in
clinical practice at the hospital.<component x="301.55" y="81.64" width="227.18"

approaches that were used to assist with implementation of family systems nursing
(FSN) at a university hospital level in Northern Europe. Design and Methods: A
quasi-experimental research design was used for the first phase of the study. For the
second phase, a cross-sectional research design was used. Data were collected in the
first phase of the study from 457 nurses in all except one of the divisions of the
hospital regarding their attitudes towards involving families into their care before
and after having participated in the education and training intervention (ETI)
program in FSN. Furthermore, in the second phase, data were collected from 812
nurses, after FSN had been implemented in all divisions at Landspitali University
Hospital, regarding the nurses' knowledge of FSN and their evaluation of the quality
of the ETI program (i.e., theoretical lectures on FSN as well as the benefit of the
skill lab training regarding applying FSN into their clinical practices). Graham and
colleagues' Knowledge to Action framework was used as the conceptual framework for
the research. Results: Nurses who had taken a course in FSN reported a significantly
more positive attitude towards involving families in their care after the ETI program
compared to those who had not taken such a course. Furthermore, a majority of the
nurses who participated in the ETI program reported that the program was a favorable
experience and indicated readiness for applying FSN in clinical practice.
Conclusions: Further research is needed regarding the benefits of offering FSN at an
institutional level, but focusing international attention on effective strategies to
implement FSN into nursing practice may result in better health care for individuals
and families around the globe. Clinical Relevance: Providing clinically meaningful
education and training in family nursing through programs such as the ETI program for

a phenomenon that is getting increased attention among administrators, and scientists
in general, as well as advanced nurse practitioners. The reason is that stronger
evidence is being reported in the literature regarding the benefits of involving
families in healthcare services, both for patients and family members. Furthermore,
recommendations put forward by the International Council of Nursing (2002) and World
Health Organization (WHO; 2006) on the importance of involving families in health
care, and numerous research findings on improved health outcomes following
interventions for families dealing with chronic and acute illnesses, are promising
(Bell &amp; Wright, 2011; Chesla, 2010; Leahey &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2009;
Svavarsdottir, Sigurdardottir, &amp; Tryggvadottir, 2014; Sveinbjarnardottir,
Svavarsdottir, &amp; Wright, 2012). In addition, because of findings from
evidence-based research that supports benefits of psychosocial interventions in
clinical practice (Svavarsdottir &amp; Sigurdardottir, 2013; Warner et al., 2011),
clinical guidelines are increasingly recommending effective family nursing
involvement in health care to strengthen both the patient and the family (Registered
Nurses Association of Ontario, Canada, 2006). Based on the increased evidence in the
literature on positive outcomes of involving families in healthcare services, the
Landspitali University Hospital Family Nursing Implementation Project was established
in 2007 and was actively applied over a 4-year time period, until the end of 2011.
The purpose of this research was to evaluate strategies that were used to facilitate
implementation of FSN in general practices as well as advanced nursing practices at
Landspitali University Hospital (LUH) in 2007-2011.<component x="54.78" y="239.72"

lateness="0.25" reference_score="7.59">Recently, circularity between knowledge
transfer and clinical practice has received attention from scientists and healthcare
leaders worldwide. Among those who are responsible for knowledge translation at an
institutional level, however, little is known about what strategies have been used
when moving evidence into practice. Therefore, in today's societies, it is vital to
understand the importance of relational practices between healthcare professionals
and families. The quality of the relationship between healthcare professionals and
family members is important in order to understand how relational practices or
actions can be used to be of the most benefit to patients' health and wellbeing. One
indicator for evaluating the quality of the relationship between healthcare
professionals and family members is to evaluate healthcare professionals' attitudes
towards involving families in their care, and to evaluate family members' feelings of
receiving friendly, pleasant, and connected communications or behaviors versus
unfriendly, hostile, or distanced behaviors or attitudes from healthcare
professionals (Bell &amp; Wright, 2011; Benzein, Johansson, Arestedt, Berg, &#xA8;
&amp; Saveman, 2008; Saveman, Benzein, Engstrom, &amp; &#x2DA; Arestedt, 2011;
Simpson &amp; Tarrant, 2006; Wright &amp; Bell, 2009). Families who are supporting
their loved one at a hospital are often dealing with a very complex health situation.
Wright and Bell (2009) have emphasized that behaviors of family members cannot be
considered in isolation, but rather in the context of the family situation.
Therefore, families who experience high-quality relationships with healthcare
professionals are less likely to experience feelings of isolation or being vulnerable
or uncertain in their caregiving role. Nurses' attitudes towards involving families
in their care has been studied by nurses in Western societies (Saveman et al., 2011;
Sveinbjarnardottir, Svavarsdottir, &amp; Saveman, 2011). The attitudes of nurses are
believed to influence the quality of clinical practice among family nurses. When
establishing therapeutic relationships and offering families therapeutic
conversations, where the goal is to offer support, facilitate change, and/or maintain
or enhance family functioning and well-being, positive attitudes of nurses towards
families are essential. According to nurse scientists who have conceptualized these
beliefs in their models, such as in the Beliefs and Illness Model (Bell &amp; Wright,
2011; Wright &amp; Bell, 2009) and in the Calgary Family Assessment and Intervention
Models (CFAM/CFIM) (Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009), nurses' attitudes or beliefs towards
involving families in their care are seen to be fundamental to the possibility of
creating therapeutic change, leading to healing, and to decrease suffering among
family members. In these models, while embracing change, it is important to identify
constraining and facilitating beliefs when establishing involvement in therapeutic
relationships that nurses create in collaboration with the family. Strong research
evidence is now available of the importance of involving families in health care,
where families have been found to be of importance both to the acute and chronically
ill patient (Halldorsdottir &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2012; Kamban &amp; Svavarsdottir,
2013; Knafl, Deatrick, &amp; Havill, 2012; Konradsdottir &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2011;
McClement, Fallis, &amp; Pereira, 2009; Nelms &amp; Eggenberger, 2010;
Sigurdardottir, Svavarsdottir, Rayens, &amp; Adkins, 2013; Svavarsdottir et al.,
2014), as well as to general and advanced nurses who provide the care (McClement et
al., 2009; Schulman-Green et al., 2012). According to Benzein and colleagues (2008)
and Wright and Leahey (2009), when the needs of families are addressed and their
suffering is acknowledged, the time for patient care is actually maximized and more
efficient. This evidence must be of great value to the nursing profession, where time
constraints in clinical practice are now of more concern than ever. Further, the
growing emphasis on research evidence to direct practice focuses the attention on the
education and training of nurses when applying family systems methods and research
findings into clinical practice. In order to improve the health of a population, both
the WHO (2005) and Canadian Institute of Health Research (2005) have emphasized the
importance of knowledge translation (KT) into clinical practice, where evidencebased
information is incorporated into healthcare services (e.g., interactions among
researchers and users) in such a way that it effects optimal healthcare outcomes and
strengthens healthcare systems. The process of translating new knowledge into
clinical practice has been conceptualized in the Knowledge to Action framework by
Graham and colleagues (2006) and Straus, Tetroe, and Graham (2011). In this model, KT
is seen as occurring in two interactive phases-the knowledge creation phase and the
action phase-with fluid boundaries between the creation and the action components of
the model. As knowledge is sorted out or refined, the resulting knowledge becomes
more developed and useful to the users. In the action phase, knowledge can be
implemented simultaneously, and the knowledge phase can influence the action phase at
several points in the model. Based on a review of the literature and the Knowledge to
Action model, new knowledge regarding the attitude of the nurses at LUH towards
involving families in their care, as well as creating knowledge about nurses'
theories and confidence in their own clinical skills in offering FSN after having
participated in the education and training intervention (ETI) program, were evaluated
(Figure 1). Based on a review of the literature and the conceptual framework that
guided the study, the following hypothesis was tested: Nurses' attitudes towards
involving families in their care will improve significantly after the ETI program,
compared to before the ETI program, as measured by the Family Importance in Nursing
Care-Nurses' Attitude (FINC-NA) scale. The following research question was asked:
What is the level of theoretical knowledge about the CFAM/CFIM and the level of
competence in applying FSN, as introduced in the Calgary models, in clinical practice
(e.g., using interviewing skills, assessments, interventions, relational
interactions, identifying strengths, etc.) among nurses and midwifes at LUH after
having participated in the ETI program in FSN?<component x="54.78" y="81.64"

of the research team. The eligibility criteria were being a registered nurse or a
midwife who was employed at LUH at the time of the study and being able to read and
write Icelandic at a minimum of a fourth-grade level. An exclusion criterion for
participation was being involved in another study regarding attitudes or beliefs
towards FSN at the hospital. At time one in the first phase of the study
(pre-intervention), 457 nurses participated. At time two (post-intervention), which
took place about 8 to 24 months later, 411 nurses answered the questionnaire.
Information regarding the sample in the first phase of the study is distributed in
Table 1. For the second phase of the study, the design was cross-sectional. In this
phase, 812 nurses and midwifes consented and participated in the study over the 4
years that the data collection took place. Data were collected at one time after the
nurses and midwives had participated in the FSN ETI program.<component x="301.54"

interviews, using therapeutic questions when interviewing families, and through
drawing forward family strengths to handle health situations, nurses might maintain
or increase the families' wellness and functioning. To fulfill the educational
objectives of the ETI program, the nurses attended either a 1-day seminar of 8 hr or
two half-day seminars of 4 hr (depending on the needs of the divisions) on the
CFAM/CFIM and on family interviewing. Further, the participants were offered family
skills lab training and workshops where the focus was on offering short-term family

family members and connection with society as well as training the nurses in asking
intervention questions, drawing forward family strengths, and offering

Questionnaire. questionnaire is a 26-item scale (Benzein et al., 2008) that was
originally developed in a sample of Swedish nurses, but has been translated and
pilot-tested with a sample of Icelandic nurses. The psychometric properties of the
Icelandic version were similar to those reported by &#xF0; the authors (Skuladottir,
Konra sdottir, &amp; Agustsdottir, 2010). The scaling of the instrument is a 4-point
Likert strongly agree scale ranging from tostrongly disagree . For the whole
instrument, the scoring range was 26 to 104. The higher the score, the more positive
the attitude to&#x3B1; wards families reported by the nurses. Cronbach's for internal
consistency is 0.88 for the total scale. The FINCNA instrument is composed of four
factors: (a) family as a &#x3B1; resource in nursing ( 0.805; e.g., the presence of

families); (b) as a conversational partner ( = 0.785; e.g., I invite family members

resources in order to optimize their opportunities for coping with situations by
themselves; Benzein et al., 2008).<component x="301.55" y="477.46" width="227.17"

ranged in age from 31 to 50 years, and most of them had over 15 years of working
experience. A majority of the nurses believed that there was a policy on their unit
about caring for families, and over two thirds of them indicated that they had
themselves experienced serious illness in their families and needed professional
health care in their own family. One third of the nurses had finished diploma or
graduate education after their BSc degree in nursing, and around half of them had
taken a course in FSN. When these nurses were asked whether they wanted to take a
course in FSN, around half of them wanted to take such a course.<component x="299.87"

Interestingly, when the data from the hospital were evaluated all together, no
significant difference was found on the nurses' attitudes towards involving families
in their care at LUH after having participated in the ETI program compared to before
participating in the ETI program. When the data were further evaluated based on the
responses from the nurses on each division, no significant differences were found in
the nurses' attitudes towards involving families in their care after these nurses had
participated in the ETI program compared to before they had participated.
Nevertheless, when the data were evaluated based on the nurses' background
information, a significant difference was found after the ETI program on the nurse's
attitudes towards involving families in their care, based on if the nurses had taken
a course in FSN compared to the nurses who had not taken such a course. The nurses
who had taken a course in FSN reported significantly lower burden towards involving
families in their care after the ETI program, compared to the nurses who had not

differences in means on the knowledge about FSN based on the lectures about the
Calgary models and on family interviewing, and on the family nursing skills lab
training, regarding the nurses' confidence in applying FSN into clinical practice
after having participated in the ETI program. Even though all the data were scored
considerably high (the content of the Calgary models ranged in scoring from 12 to 30
[mean scoring ranged from 25.0 to 27.6; possible scoring ranged from 6 to 30] and the
confidence in applying FSN in clinical practice ranged in scoring from 0 to 11 [mean
scoring ranged from 6.6 to 9.4; possible scoring ranged from 0 to 11]), there was a
significant difference found based on the division in which the nurses worked. The
nurses at LUH who worked in the surgical division scored significantly higher on the
knowledge and content component than the nurses who worked in the women and children
division, internal medicine division, and emergency division. Further, the nurses who
worked in the emergency division scored significantly higher on the theoretical
knowledge and content component of the Calgary models than did the nurses who worked
in the women and the children division. In addition, the nurses in the internal
medicine division scored significantly higher on the knowledge and content component
of the Calgary models than did the nurses in the women and children services (Table
3). Similarly, when the clinical skills and confidence component was evaluated, the
nurses in the mental health division were found to score significantly higher on the
clinical skills and confidence component than did the nurses in the internal medicine
division and surgical division. Nurses in the women and the children division were
found to score significantly higher on the clinical skills and confidence component

implementation of FSN into nursing practice at LUH, the nurses' attitudes towards
involving families in their care was evaluated. This evaluation was conducted on all
divisions except the emergency division at the hospital, because of specific
situations in the emergency division at the time. In the Calgary models (Wright &amp;
Leahey, 2009) and in the Illness Belief model (Wright &amp; Bell, 2009), emphasis is
placed on the fundamental assumption that a positive attitude of nurses towards
involving families in health care is essential to facilitating a therapeutic change,
leading to healing and decreasing suffering in families. Knowing the nurses'
attitudes towards the importance of involving families in their care is therefore
critical, because nurses' attitudes towards FSN can determine the quality of the
therapeutic conversations with families and determine the level of involvement that
the nurse can create in harmony with families in the therapeutic process.
Interestingly, however, in this study at LUH, nurses' attitudes towards involving
families in their care did not change after having participated in the ETI program,
neither when the data was evaluated by the nurses at the whole hospital, nor by the
nurses' evaluations on the women and children, mental health, surgical, or internal
medicine divisions at that hospital. One explanation for the lack of significant
findings can be based on the fact that the nurses scored high (86.3) on the FINC-NA
instrument (the highest possible score is 104 for the whole instrument) before
participating in the ETI program, and the nurses also scored similarly high<component

participated in the ETI program. Also, because of the design of this version of the
FINC-NA instrument (a 4-point Likert scale), a lack of variability of the scores in
the instrument may have contributed to the difficulty in capturing change after the
ETI program, compared to before the ETI program. Yet, the authors of the FINC-NA
instrument have recently (i.e., after this study took place) worked on refining and
revalidating the instrument regarding the scoring distribution, which has resulted in
an improved 5-point Likert scale instrument (Saveman et al., 2011). Nevertheless, a
significant difference was found on the nurses' attitudes towards involving families

lateness="0.75" reference_score="7.67">care after having participated in the ETI
program, based on whether the nurses had taken a course in FSN. These nurses reported
a significantly lower burden towards involving families in their care compared to the
nurses who had not taken such a course. These findings emphasize that education in
FSN had an influence on the nurses' attitudes towards evaluating families that they
cared for at LUH (i.e., families were viewed as significantly less burdensome). In
addition, these findings are in harmony with the theoretical underpinnings in the
Calgary and the Illness Beliefs models (Wright &amp; Bell, 2009; Wright &amp; Leahey,
2009), where nurses' attitudes are believed to have an impact on nurses' cognition or
behavior when practicing in clinical settings. On the other hand, training nurses in
FSN in clinical settings took place through lectures and through family skills labs.
The goal of the training program was to increase the nurses' knowledge and skills in
FSN within their clinical settings. The main emphasis in the learning process was on
stimulating ideas of applying FSN in clinical practice through discussions and
dialogue among the clinical instructors and clinical nurses. In this learning
environment, the nurses in the general practices got the opportunity to respond to
theoretical and conceptual issues regarding FSN and to reflect on their own clinical
experiences when working with families. Even though there was no significant
difference found at the hospital on the nurses' attitudes towards involving families
in their care after having participated in the ETI program, the content and
components of the ETI program were evaluated favorably by the nurses who took it over
the 4 years of the study. That is, the scoring was much skewed towards the positive
end of the scale on the NKC measure after the ETI program. The nurses scored on
average 25 out of the highest possible score of 30 in the knowledge and content
factor of the NKC scale, and the nurses' mean score was 7.8 out of the highest
possible scoring of 11 on the factor regarding using FSN in the clinical practice
part of the NKC scale. Interestingly, however, in the knowledge and content factor of
the NKC scale, the nurses in the surgical division were found to score the highest,
followed by nurses in the emergency division, when compared to the nurses in the
other divisions at the hospital. The nurses in the women and children division scored
the lowest on the knowledge and content component of the Calgary models,
significantly lower compared to the nurses in the other divisions. However, the
nurses in the mental health division were found to score the highest on the clinical
skills and confidence component of the NKC scale, followed by the nurses in the women
and children services at LUH, who scored the second highest on the clinical skills
and confidence component of the scale. Nonetheless, the nurses in the surgical
division were found to score the lowest or significantly lower than the nurses in the
other divisions at the hospital on the clinical skills and confidence factor of the
NKC scale. This finding is new and has not been reported previously in the
literature. A possible explanation is that the nurses in mental health services and
in women and children services are trained in working with families on a regular
basis and because of that might be more skilled in interviewing families than the
nurses working on units at the hospital dealing in general with more physical
diseases among their patient population. Nevertheless, having the nurses in the
emergency services scoring the third highest on the clinical skills and confidence
component in applying FSN in clinical practice was surprising but may stress the need
for a family nursing perspective in the nursing practice in the emergency division of
the hospital.<component x="299.87" y="93.78" width="227.17" height="151.84" page="8"

used at LUH to implement FSN into general as well as advanced nursing practices are
encouraging. Through meetings and support group activities, the implementation
process on each of the divisions was evaluated and the research findings adapted
based on specific needs from the divisions and units. However, what is still needed
in the years to come and what future research needs to focus on is to specifically
evaluate the benefits of the ETI program and the FSN interventions with valid and
reliable scales. It is also important to assess barriers to using FSN on the
divisions, to further monitor the outcomes of the implementation as well as sustain
the knowledge use, and to specifically select knowledge to use on each division. In
addition, evaluating implications to practice is of major importance. Nurses in
general practice and advanced practice at LUH who have been trained in FSN within
clinical settings have reported the ETI program to be a favorable experience. In
addition, nurses' attitudes at the hospital towards family nursing are in general
positive. Since nurses on all units at LUH have now received training in FSN in
general and advanced nursing practices, the most critical point from an
administrative and implementation perspective will be to continue to offer the ETI
program to the nurses who still have not taken it, and to continue to support nurses
who have already taken the ETI program, in offering short-term FSN interventions to
families. Such support and encouragement will be needed to facilitate the
implementation. Strategies that might be of help to build up confidence in family
nursing and to smooth out the process of further implementing, maintaining, and
sustaining FSN in nursing practices at LUH might be to (a) offer all nurses in
general practices further educational support in FSN in clinical settings, (b) offer
clinical consultation to nurses in advanced practices, and (c) support nurses in
further developing their skills in working with families. By continuing to build and
support a strong partnership between nurse scientists within academia and clinicians,
we may be more likely to succeed. One vignette for such a partnership is through the
newly established Center of Family Nursing Research and Development at LUH, and
through participation in programs of research and teaching, and application of FSN in
clinical practice at the hospital.<component x="301.55" y="81.64" width="227.18"
