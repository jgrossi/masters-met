factors and staff nurses impact the student learning affect student satisfaction and
expectations process (Zafrir &amp; Nissim, 2011). Spiritual is valuable to educators
seeking to improve health has been identified as associated Knapp &amp; Krentler,
2006). A variety of factors influencing student satisfaction have been identified in
the literature, such as student educational experiences, student age, instructor
teaching style, and the quality of the instruction. Two studies conducted by Ansari
(2002a, 2002b) examined the effects of academic background and demographics on
student satisfaction at a university. The findings suggested that participants with a
diploma in nursing had higher satisfaction levels than the participants with a
baccalaureate degree in nursing (BSN). In addition, the older participants had higher
satisfaction levels than the traditional students who were less than 21 years old.
Student evaluations of curriculum design and teaching effectiveness have been viewed
as a major source of information for faculty development and for promoting positive
changes in learning outcomes (Hessler &amp; Humphreys, 2008; Salamonson, Halcomb,
Andrew, Peters, &amp; Jackson, 2010). Technology-driven and learner-centered
curricula can enhance students' professional practice (Floyd, Lewis, &amp; Walker,
2010; Fountain &amp; Alfred, 2009), and students are more satisfied with courses
incorporating web-enhanced teaching strategies to facilitate their learning (Salyers,
2005). Students perceive a learning environment to be effective when faculty develop
and promote a climate of mutual respect and trust, collaboration, positive affect,
and supportiveness (Ojeda, Flores, &amp; Navarro, 2011; Rowbotham, 2010). Students
feel more satisfied with the program when the aesthetic aspects of the physical
infrastructure are considered (Wiers-Jenssen, Stensaker, &amp; Grogaard, 2002).
Clinical experiences for nursing students are central and significant to the learning
of professionalism. The social context of the quality of program outcomes (Appleton-

2011; Hsiao, Chien, Wu, Chiang, &amp; Huang, 2010). Three studies (Espeland &amp;
Indrehus, 2003; Happell, 2008a, 2008b) had limited recruitment of student
participants from three university colleges and one university. These studies
indicated there was a need to improve the quality of clinical practice. In other
studies (Hendricks, Wallace, Narwold, Guy, &amp; Wallace, 2013; Jokelainen, Turunen,
Tossavainen, Jamookeeah, &amp; Coco, 2011; Shelton, 2003), students who viewed
faculty as providing direct help and facilitating learning as well as providing the
caring atmosphere of a mentoring relationship were more likely to be satisfied with a
program and to be successful academically. Evidence over the past decade has shown
the need for evaluating students' perceptions and expectations regarding their
education for greater program accountability (Appleton-Knapp &amp; Krentler, 2006;
Brown &amp; Marshall, 2008; Story et al., 2010). However, within the United States,
no nationwide studies have been conducted regarding ASN student satisfaction with the
nursing program as a whole in the areas of curriculum, faculty, social interaction,
and environment. Most schools have conducted internal evaluations of student
satisfaction with their nursing programs using independently developed tools. These
studies may have focused on evaluating needs specific to the program. Instruments for
Measuring Student Satisfaction Levels A literature review was undertaken to identify
existing instruments for measuring student satisfaction in order to judge the need
for developing a tool based on a comprehensive conceptual model for measuring student
satisfaction with<component x="45.0" y="67.59" width="356.28" height="672.17"

Evaluations of Educational Quality (SEEQ) and Ramsden's (1991) Course Experience
Questionnaire (CEQ) were developed for examining student perceptions of the quality
of teaching and curriculum. The SEEQ measures nine aspects of effective teaching. The
CEQ focuses on evaluating five course experiences, such as good teaching and
appropriate workload. Both the SEEQ and the CEQ were developed for a general student
population and may not measure elements related to clinical practice that are
critical for satisfaction among nursing students. Liegler (1997) developed a path
model consisting of the factors of external influences, college facilities and
services, academic integration, and social integration to predict nursing students'
overall satisfaction levels. The tool used to test the causal model was developed
based on two instruments, the Social Integration with Peers Scale and the Social
Integration with Faculty Scale, developed by Pascarella and Terenzini (1980). These
two instruments, originally developed in the late 1970s, may not accurately measure
satisfaction in today's nursing students. While instruments have been utilized to
assess students' satisfaction with a particular course, there was little evidence of
methods for evaluating students' experience of the program as a whole (Richardson,
2005). Moreover, there was a lack of consistency in research on the evaluation of the
psychometric properties of the instrument used for measuring nursing student
satisfaction, as well as a lack of a supportive model or a theory of student
satisfaction specifically developed for nursing education. Some of the instruments
found in the literature were outdated and focused only on curriculum and teaching;
they therefore may not reflect the complexities of measuring and understanding the
factors that influence satisfaction in today's nursing students. After a series of

Curriculum, Faculty, Social Interaction, and Environment (CFSE) developed by Chen,
Farmer, Barber, and Wayman (2012) was used to support the factors in measuring
nursing student satisfaction in this study (see Figure). The CFSE model was
synthesized according to several concepts from literature reviews (Ansari, 2002a,
2002b; Baykal, Sokmen, Korkmaz, &amp; Akgun, 2005; Floyd et al., 2010; Liegler, 1997;
NLNAC, 2008; Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 2008; Ramsden, 1991; Richardson, 2005).
Central to the CFSE model is the belief that student satisfaction evolves in a
dynamic process that is influenced by the interaction between the student and faculty
and the teaching and learning environments. In this model, Chen et al. (2012)
proposed that the level of student satisfaction with a nursing program is directly
affected by four major constructs: the content and structure of curriculum, faculty
teaching strategies, social interaction among students and faculty, and the learning
environment, such as a nursing skills laboratory. (See Chen et al. for definitions of
the constructs.) Based on the literature review, the research questions of our study
were: 1) What is the level of student satisfaction with ASN or ADN programs in the
United States? 2) Are there differences in the level of student satisfaction along
demographic lines such as gender or race? 3) While controlling for organizational
characteristics and demographics, to what extent does student satisfaction in the
areas of curriculum, faculty, social interaction, and environment predict overall
student satisfaction with an ASN or ADN program?<component x="45.0" y="202.59"
