      <p>Nursing education has engaged in numerous
quality-outcome and program-evaluation
activities designed to demonstrate that
their educational offerings benchmark with
regional and national educational standards
and state boards of nursing requirements
(Brown &amp; Marshall, 2008; Story et al., 2010).</p>
      <p>Accreditation by the National League for
Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC;
since 2013, the Accreditation Commission
for Education in Nursing [ACEN]) and
the Commission on Collegiate Nursing
Education (CCNE) is an essential indicator
that the nursing program offers high quality
outcomes that meet standards for higher
education in a specific discipline (Brown
&amp; Marshall, 2008). Measures of quality
outcomes proposed by the ACEN and CCNE
include student satisfaction, graduation rates,
attrition, passing rate on the National Council
Licensure Examination for Registered
Nurses (NCLEX-RN®), employment rate
after graduation, and employer and alumni
perceptions.</p>
      <p>Research indicates there is evidence
linking student satisfaction evaluations with
increased student engagement and retention
in higher education (Noel-Levitz,
20052006). The inclusion of student satisfaction
measures in a comprehensive program
evaluation may provide insights into the total
educational experience for students and an
understanding of student expectations for
program development and enhancement
(Appleton-Knapp &amp; Krentler, 2006; Brown
&amp; Marshall, 2008). To our knowledge,
no national studies have comprehensively
investigated student satisfaction with the
associate of science in nursing (ASN) or
associate degree in nursing (ADN) programs
in the United States.</p>
      <p>The aim of this study was to provide
evidence of ASN or ADN program
satisfaction among nursing students using
a standardized measurement in order to
identify areas needed for improvement in
general. Thus, the purpose of this study was
to conduct a national survey to describe the
level of ASN or ADN student satisfaction
with the nursing program and to identify
which areas of curriculum, faculty, social
interaction, and environment relate to overall
nursing student satisfaction.</p>
      <p>Ba CKgRO u Nd
Student Satisfaction with the Nursing
Program
In higher education, student satisfaction
has been viewed as an indicator of program
success, and students with higher satisfaction
levels progress well in their intellectual and
social development (Brown &amp; Marshall,
2008). The use of standardized questionnaires
to measure student satisfaction with a
nursing program as a whole has allowed
the identification of program features and
facilities that are necessary to enhance
program success and where change is needed
(Richardson, 2005).</p>
      <p>Although accrediting bodies have
proposed that student satisfaction be viewed
as one of the program outcomes (CCNE,
2008; NLNAC, 2008), nursing student
satisfaction has not been sufficiently studied
in the United States. Identifying which factors
affect student satisfaction and expectations
is valuable to educators seeking to improve
the quality of program outcomes
(AppletonKnapp &amp; Krentler, 2006).</p>
      <p>A variety of factors influencing student
satisfaction have been identified in the
literature, such as student educational
experiences, student age, instructor teaching
style, and the quality of the instruction.</p>
      <p>Two studies conducted by Ansari (2002a,
2002b) examined the effects of academic
background and demographics on student
satisfaction at a university. The findings
suggested that participants with a diploma
in nursing had higher satisfaction levels than
the participants with a baccalaureate degree
in nursing (BSN). In addition, the older
participants had higher satisfaction levels
than the traditional students who were less
than 21 years old.</p>
      <p>Student evaluations of curriculum
design and teaching effectiveness have been
viewed as a major source of information
for faculty development and for promoting
positive changes in learning outcomes
(Hessler &amp; Humphreys, 2008; Salamonson,
Halcomb, Andrew, Peters, &amp; Jackson, 2010).</p>
      <p>Technology-driven and learner-centered
curricula can enhance students’ professional
practice (Floyd, Lewis, &amp; Walker, 2010;
Fountain &amp; Alfred, 2009), and students are
more satisfied with courses incorporating
web-enhanced teaching strategies to
facilitate their learning (Salyers, 2005).</p>
      <p>Students perceive a learning environment
to be effective when faculty develop and
promote a climate of mutual respect and
trust, collaboration, positive affect, and
supportiveness (Ojeda, Flores, &amp; Navarro,
2011; Rowbotham, 2010). Students feel more
satisfied with the program when the aesthetic
aspects of the physical infrastructure are
considered (Wiers-Jenssen, Stensaker, &amp;
Grogaard, 2002).</p>
      <p>Clinical experiences for nursing students
are central and significant to the learning
of professionalism. The social context of
the clinical practice and the professional
interaction among nursing students, faculty,
and staff nurses impact the student learning
process (Zafrir &amp; Nissim, 2011). Spiritual
health has been identified as associated
with clinical practice stress in nursing
students (Gibbons, Dempster, &amp; Moutray,
2011; Hsiao, Chien, Wu, Chiang, &amp; Huang,
2010).</p>
      <p>Three studies (Espeland &amp; Indrehus,
2003; Happell, 2008a, 2008b) had limited
recruitment of student participants from
three university colleges and one university.</p>
      <p>These studies indicated there was a need
to improve the quality of clinical practice.</p>
      <p>In other studies (Hendricks, Wallace,
Narwold, Guy, &amp; Wallace, 2013; Jokelainen,
Turunen, Tossavainen, Jamookeeah, &amp;
Coco, 2011; Shelton, 2003), students who
viewed faculty as providing direct help and
facilitating learning as well as providing
the caring atmosphere of a mentoring
relationship were more likely to be satisfied
with a program and to be successful
academically.</p>
      <p>Evidence over the past decade has
shown the need for evaluating students’
perceptions and expectations regarding
their education for greater program
accountability (Appleton-Knapp &amp; Krentler,
2006; Brown &amp; Marshall, 2008; Story et al.,
2010). However, within the United States,
no nationwide studies have been conducted
regarding ASN student satisfaction with
the nursing program as a whole in the areas
of curriculum, faculty, social interaction,
and environment. Most schools have
conducted internal evaluations of student
satisfaction with their nursing programs
using independently developed tools. These
studies may have focused on evaluating
needs specific to the program.</p>
      <p>Instruments for Measuring Student
Satisfaction Levels
A literature review was undertaken to
identify existing instruments for measuring
student satisfaction in order to judge
the need for developing a tool based
on a comprehensive conceptual model
for measuring student satisfaction with
nursing programs. Marsh’s (1982) Students’
Evaluations of Educational Quality (SEEQ)
and Ramsden’s (1991) Course Experience
Questionnaire (CEQ) were developed
for examining student perceptions of the
quality of teaching and curriculum. The
SEEQ measures nine aspects of effective
teaching. The CEQ focuses on evaluating
five course experiences, such as good
teaching and appropriate workload. Both
the SEEQ and the CEQ were developed for
a general student population and may not
measure elements related to clinical practice
that are critical for satisfaction among
nursing students.</p>
      <p>Liegler (1997) developed a path model
consisting of the factors of external
influences, college facilities and services,
academic integration, and social integration
to predict nursing students’ overall
satisfaction levels. The tool used to test the
causal model was developed based on two
instruments, the Social Integration with
Peers Scale and the Social Integration with
Faculty Scale, developed by Pascarella and
Terenzini (1980). These two instruments,
originally developed in the late 1970s, may
not accurately measure satisfaction in today’s
nursing students.</p>
      <p>While instruments have been utilized to
assess students’ satisfaction with a particular
course, there was little evidence of methods
for evaluating students’ experience of the
program as a whole (Richardson, 2005).</p>
      <p>Moreover, there was a lack of consistency
in research on the evaluation of the
psychometric properties of the instrument
used for measuring nursing student
satisfaction, as well as a lack of a supportive
model or a theory of student satisfaction
specifically developed for nursing education.</p>
      <p>Some of the instruments found in the
literature were outdated and focused only on
curriculum and teaching; they therefore may
not reflect the complexities of measuring
and understanding the factors that influence
satisfaction in today’s nursing students.</p>
      <p>Conceptual Framework
After a series of discussions and literature
reviews regarding a comprehensive student
satisfaction appraisal, a conceptual model
of Curriculum, Faculty, Social Interaction,
and Environment (CFSE) developed by
Chen, Farmer, Barber, and Wayman (2012)
was used to support the factors in measuring
nursing student satisfaction in this study (see
Figure). The CFSE model was synthesized
according to several concepts from literature
reviews (Ansari, 2002a, 2002b; Baykal,
Sokmen, Korkmaz, &amp; Akgun, 2005; Floyd
et al., 2010; Liegler, 1997; NLNAC, 2008;
Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 2008; Ramsden,
1991; Richardson, 2005). Central to the
CFSE model is the belief that student
satisfaction evolves in a dynamic process
that is influenced by the interaction between
the student and faculty and the teaching and
learning environments.</p>
      <p>In this model, Chen et al. (2012) proposed
that the level of student satisfaction with
a nursing program is directly affected by
four major constructs: the content and
structure of curriculum, faculty teaching
strategies, social interaction among students
and faculty, and the learning environment,
such as a nursing skills laboratory. (See
Chen et al. for definitions of the constructs.)
Based on the literature review, the research
questions of our study were: 1) What is
the level of student satisfaction with ASN
or ADN programs in the United States? 2)
Are there differences in the level of student
satisfaction along demographic lines such
as gender or race? 3) While controlling
for organizational characteristics and
demographics, to what extent does student
satisfaction in the areas of curriculum,
faculty, social interaction, and environment
predict overall student satisfaction with an
ASN or ADN program?

student satisfaction with ASN programs
in the United States during 2008 and 2009.</p>
      <p>ASN and ADN programs prepare students
for practice as RNs and may lead to further
nursing education.

Participants/Population
This study targeted ASN or ADN programs
accredited by the ACEN. During the
20062007 academic year, 50 states offered 618
ACEN-accredited ASN or ADN programs
(NLNAC, 2007). The inclusion criterion
for each state’s participation was having
a minimum of two accredited schools of
nursing with an ASN or ADN program; 46
states were eligible for participation.</p>
      <p>A method of proportional stratified
random sampling was used to ensure
representativeness of all states according to
the number of ASN or ADN programs in the
state. Two nursing programs were randomly
selected from each state having 10 or fewer
nursing programs offering ASN or ADN
programs; four and six nursing programs
were randomly selected from states having
11 to 20 programs and one state having 21 or
more ASN or ADN programs.</p>
      <p>In total, 138 ASN or ADN programs from
46 states were selected for participation; 31
states producing 56 ASN or ADN programs
agreed to participate in this study. Nursing
students who were in their last semester in
either fall 2008 or spring 2009 were invited to
participate in this nationwide survey. There
were no requirements regarding students’
race, gender, age, or ethnicity.</p>
      <p>Data Collection
Before conducting this study, approval was
granted by the universities’ institutional
review boards. The chairs of the selected
ASN or ADN programs and the principal
investigators ensured that each student was</p>

Nursing curriculum:
Was relevant to current nursing practice
The equipment in the nursing lab was
in good repair
fully aware of the objective of the study and
participated voluntarily. A cover letter and an
invitation were emailed to all of the chairs of
the selected nursing programs to explain the
purpose of the study, the risks and benefits,
and the voluntary nature of participation.
After a program had obtained permission
to participate, a numerically coded
questionnaire packet including the NSSS, a
self-addressed and stamped return envelope,
and a cover letter were mailed to the chair.
Questionnaires were answered anonymously
one time during a regularly scheduled nursing
class. The chair was responsible for returning
all completed questionnaires by mail without
identifying the students.</p>
      <p>Instrument
The NSSS, developed by Chen et al. (2012),
was used to identify the extent to which
nursing students were satisfied with the
nursing program. The 30-item tool uses a
six-point Likert scale scored from 1 (not
satisfied at all) to 6 (very satisfied). It consists
of four subscales based on the CSFE model:
Curriculum (9 items), Faculty (8 items),
Social Interaction (6 items), and Learning
Environment (7 items). An additional item
asks about overall student satisfaction.</p>
      <p>See Chen et al. (2012) for a description
of the development process and an account
of a pilot study conducted to evaluate the
instrument. For the pilot study, Cronbach’s
alpha for the total scale of the NSSS was .96;
alphas for the subscales were: Curriculum,
.92; Faculty, .90; both Social Interaction and
Environment, .88.</p>
      <p>Data Analysis
Statistical analyses were made using Statistical
Product and Service Solutions (SPSS®) for
Windows® software version 20.0. Descriptive
statistics, including means, standard
deviations, frequency counts, and percentages
for demographics, were performed according
to the data level. Mean scores and standard
deviations were computed for the levels of
student satisfaction. The internal consistency
of the NSSS was assessed using Cronbach’s
alpha.</p>
      <p>Inferential statistics, including one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests,
were used to identify the differences in
student satisfaction among demographic
variables for research question 2. For research
question 3, hierarchical multiple regression
was computed to separate the effects of the
organizational and the demographic variables
on the overall student satisfaction in order
to examine how well satisfaction with the
curriculum, faculty, social interaction, and
environment contributed to students’ overall
satisfaction level. The rationale for using
the hierarchical multiple regression was the
consideration of variation among schools’
organizational characteristics and students’
background.</p>
      <p>The organizational and demographic
variables were grouped as separate units
in order to examine their effect on student
satisfaction levels. By entering variables as
units in a sequential way, the optimal unit
of predictors could be determined and the
change in predictability associated with the
four subscales could be identified (Petrocelli,
2003). An alpha level of .05 was set for
statistical tests.</p>
      <p>Resu Lts
Demographic Characteristics
Fifty-six ASN or ADN programs from
31 US states completed this study. Three
follow-up emails sent to inform the chair
of the department about the deadline for
completing the questionnaires contributed
to the average 76 percent response rate for
this study. Most of the 2,020 participating
students were white and non-Hispanic (n =
1,590, 79.1 percent); 88.8 percent (n = 1,791)
were females. Student ages ranged from 18 to
63 years old, with the average age being 31.
Many were married (n = 921, 45.8 percent)
and the majority were employed (n = 1,417,
70.5 percent).</p>
      <p>Student Satisfaction with the Nursing
Program
Regarding the level of student satisfaction
with the ASN or ADN program for research
question 1, item means for each subscale
were: Curriculum, 5.01 (SD = 0.69); Faculty,
4.97 (SD = 0.72); Social Interaction, 4.98 (SD
= 0.79); and Environment, 4.67 (SD = 0.88).
The overall student satisfaction level was 4.95
(SD = 0.97). The results indicated that the
nursing students experienced higher levels of
satisfaction with nursing curriculum items;</p>

they were less satisfied with the environment.
Regarding the three highest and lowest
item means of student satisfaction with the
nursing program, the results indicated that
students were most satisfied with faculty
being knowledgeable in their field and were
less satisfied with equipment in the nursing
lab being up-to-date. (See Table 1.)
Student Satisfaction Levels Based on
Demographic Variables
Results for research question 2, regarding
levels of satisfaction along demographic lines,
indicated that significant differences were
absent in overall student satisfaction for the
variables of age, gender, marital status, race,
and employment types. Scheffé’s method
for post hoc testing was used to compare
satisfaction among students who were
employed full-time, employed part-time, or
unemployed. It was found that unemployed
students were significantly more satisfied
with the nursing program than students
employed at part-time jobs (F [2, 1991] = 4.73,
p = .01).</p>
      <p>Factors Influencing Overall Student
Satisfaction Levels
To determine which areas predicted overall
student satisfaction (research question 3),
hierarchical multiple regression was used
to identify to what extent the four subscales
were predictors. The effects of demographic
characteristics — gender, age, marital status,
race, employment, and tuition and fees —
and the organizational characteristics of the
school type and state size were grouped as
individual units in order to examine which
areas nursing students felt were connected
to their overall satisfaction levels (see
Table 2). The results indicated that the
nursing faculty, the nursing curriculum,
and social interaction significantly and
positively predicted the overall level of
student satisfaction with the program, after
controlling for demographics, school type,
and state size (t = 9.48, p &lt; .01; t = 13.67,
p &lt; .01; t = 8.04, p &lt; .01, respectively). The
subscales of curriculum, faculty, and social
interaction contributed 65.5 percent of the
variation in the overall student satisfaction
level.
“satisfied” (M = 5) in areas of curriculum,
faculty, social interaction, and environment.
In particular, the nursing students were more
satisfied in the area of curriculum when it was
relevant to current nursing practice and the
syllabus clearly described what was expected
of them; they were also more satisfied when
faculty were knowledgeable in their field and
encouraged their learning. The findings are
similar to those of Hessler and Humphreys
(2008), Salamonson et al. (2010), and
WiersJenssen et al. (2002), whose studies proposed
that there is a significant relationship
between student academic development
(e.g., through intellectually stimulating
courses) and overall satisfaction, and a higher
satisfaction level when faculty were perceived
as knowledgeable about the subject matter,
set clear goals, and offered quality teaching
and an appropriate workload. The findings
are also supported by Ojeda et al. (2011),
Rowbotham (2010), and Zafrir and Nissim
(2011), suggesting that social interaction
between faculty and students is crucial in
developing a positive learning environment,
which can also lead to student satisfaction.</p>
      <p>Clinical practice is the most essential
part of ASN or ADN education (Hendricks,
2013). In our study, students were more
satisfied when nursing skills and knowledge
provided by nursing faculty were more
relevant to current nursing practice.
According to the recommendations of
Espeland and Indrehus (2003) and Happell
(2008a, 2008b), the quality of clinical
practice needs improvement. If clinical
practice is well structured in the curriculum,
the gap between theoretical courses and
practice should be minimized.</p>
      <p>In our study, students were less satisfied
with the ASN or ADN programs in the
area of environment. Students showed
lower satisfaction levels with nursing skills
labs, noting that equipment was not always
up-to-date, sufficient for their use, and
in good repair. This finding is similar to
Wiers-Jenssen et al.’s (2002) study, which
indicated that physical infrastructure is a
critical component for improving student
satisfaction. Because information technology
has become an integral component of health
care, one improvement a nursing program
might make would be to update
computerassisted instruction to facilitate learning
about the rapidly changing technological
equipment used in clinical practice (Floyd et
al., 2010; Fountain &amp; Alfred, 2009; Salyers,
2005).</p>
      <p>Student Satisfaction Levels Based on
Demographic Variables
In our study, there were no significant
differences between the variables of age,
gender, marital status, race, and employment
types and students’ overall satisfaction. The
result for age is not consistent with Ansari’s
(2002a) study, which found that older
students had higher levels of satisfaction with
the nursing program. In terms of employment
status, 1,417 students (70.5 percent) were
employed, and 79 percent of the employed
participants had nursing-related jobs, which
may have influenced their perceptions of
program satisfaction.</p>
      <p>Unemployed nursing students were more
satisfied with the ASN or ADN program than
students who were employed. Ansari (2002b)
found that employed nursing students
required more academic help to facilitate
their learning. Potential role conflict
between the demands of academic courses
and of employment may have impacted these
students’ satisfaction levels.</p>
      <p>Factors Influencing Overall Student
Satisfaction Levels
Overall, the nursing faculty, the nursing
curriculum, and social interaction are
significant factors predicting the level of
student satisfaction with an ASN or ADN
program. The essential element for nursing
student satisfaction is the nursing faculty.
The nursing faculty subscale explained
61.4 percent out of the total 65.5 percent
variation in student satisfaction. This result
is consistent with previous studies (Hessler
&amp; Humphreys, 2008; Rowbotham, 2010)
that found the best predictors of overall
student satisfaction to be faculty, effective
teaching, academic development, and social
interaction.</p>
      <p>The findings in our study are also
supported by Hendricks et al. (2013),
Jokelainen et al. (2011), and Wiers-Jenssen
et al. (2002) in holding that the academic
and pedagogic quality of the teaching and
mentoring are crucial determinants of
student satisfaction. It is recommended that
nursing programs evaluate their teaching
efficiency and have qualified faculty
knowledgeable in their fields in order to
build a safe, caring, trusting, and respectful
learning environment for students.</p>
      <p>CONCLusiON
This study provides a detailed evaluation
of curriculum, faculty, social interaction,
and environment offered by an ASN or
ADN program and identifies which areas
students were most and least satisfied with
in programs in the United States. The
study found that a curriculum relevant
to clinical practice, with high academic
and pedagogic quality in the faculty,
and positive psychosocial interaction are
essential components in enhancing student
satisfaction with their education.</p>
      <p>Regarding study limitations, the results
may not be generalized to all ASN or ADN
programs, or to BSN programs accredited
by the ACEN or to other nursing programs
not accredited by the ACEN in the United
States. However, the data collected from 56
ASN or ADN programs in 31 states using
proportional stratified random sampling
might increase the study validity and provide
an overall view of student satisfaction with an
ASN or ADN program in the United States.
The self-report data of students’ perceptions
and their voluntary participation in this study
may have had an impact on the findings for
student satisfaction levels. In addition, the
study’s cross-sectional design may not fully
represent the level of student satisfaction
with a nursing program, because how student
satisfaction is influenced over time may limit
the interpretation of the results.</p>
      <p>In summary, nursing educators are
encouraged to conduct a comprehensive and
consistent evaluation to measure student
satisfaction and expectations in curriculum,
faculty, social interaction, and environment
in order to guide decision-making and
improve the effectiveness of their educational
programs. Although a standardized measure
of factors that influence student satisfaction
provides faculty with information necessary
to enhance students’ educational experiences,
various measures of quality outcomes,
including qualitative and quantitative
methods, should be included in program
evaluation. It is suggested that the NSSS
may expand its applicability to BSN students
and evaluate programs not accredited by the
ACEN in future studies.
