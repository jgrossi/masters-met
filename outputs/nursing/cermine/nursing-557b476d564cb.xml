        <p>The need to effectively promote safe staffing levels in community settings challenges commissioners and providers of services to find rigorous methods of capturing workforce evidence that can be systematically used to shape effective services and skill mix for the future. This article presents a brief review of current approaches and challenges to measuring community nursing workload activity in England. Specifically, it shows phase 1 pilot results using the Cassandra Matrix activity tool and review of ongoing developments and progress to demonstrate scalability for national implementation. As part of a much larger practice development project to develop community nursing, the pilot used mixed methods to collect 10 days of workload activity data from a self-selected sample of band 5-7 nurses working in general and specialist community nursing roles in three community organisations, and to evaluate their experiences of using the tool via an electronic survey. The findings indicate that the tool has significant potential for capturing the complexity and multiple dimensions of nursing work in community contexts, and phase 2 work has led to a community version of the tool being piloted on a larger scale across six community organisations.</p>

      <p>that workforce planning and development will increase in
complexity as the variables affecting it proliferate with the
pace of services. The critical question is how to positively
and progressively support, develop and transform the
community nursing workforce in times of change to meet
demand as populations overall increase in age, live longer,
and as ever more complex comorbidities rise (Buchan and
Seccombe, 2012; Smith and Jack, 2012; RCN, 2013, 2015).
In addition, the political rhetoric and imperatives currently
surrounding health-care provision are compelling
workforce planning and development teams and commissioners
to implement strategies that will deliver on effectiveness,
safety and person-centredness (Francis, 2013).</p>
      <p>Situating nursing
Nursing work itself is complex (Hall, 1964; Leary et al,
2008; Warren et al, 2012); however, when portrayed in
terms of supply and demand, nursing work in the inpatient,
specialist or community setting is often represented as a
linear series of tasks that are deterministic in nature. These
assumptions have led to nursing work being subjected to
reductionist research methods using activity analysis that
are quite simplistic (e.g.  time and motion studies), but
such methods do not capture complex work well (De
Leon, 1993; Raiborn, 2004). In the research undertaken
by Leary (2011) with specialist nurses in oncology settings,
for example, a nursing act has eight dimensions, including
intervention, context, time, emotional effort and other
factors (Breast Cancer Care, 2008; Leary et al, 2008; RCN,
2010a; 2010b; Oliver and Leary, 2012). These aspects are
rarely accounted for in any kind of time and motion or
work-sampling study, particularly the application of
vigilance in order to rescue patients from adverse consequences
of disease or treatment (Oliver and Leary, 2012).
Scottish, Welsh and English contexts
The collection of meaningful data in the community nursing
context is difficult to coordinate or even access, given that
community nursing occurs in many different contexts or
locations and population demographics vary hugely across
the country (Leary et al, 2008; Chilton, 2012). In Scotland,
local and national workforce planning and the mechanisms
used are more centrally coordinated. Everyone Matters: 2020
Workforce Vision (Scottish Government, 2013) sets out its
priorities for creating an integrated workforce across care
settings for the next 5  years. A centralised whole-systems
approach to process mapping alongside measurement of
demand, capacity, activity and backlog provides the evidence
base for service improvement. There are four nationally
agreed tools for workload measurement and planning in the
following categories (Audit Scotland, 2007):
w Adult acute care
w Paediatrics and neonatal nursing
w Primary care
w Mental health and learning disabilities
In these areas, authorities are testing and piloting tools until
they are fit for purpose and ready to be rolled out on a
national basis. There are now seven tools in existence that
take a triangulation approach, measuring activity, professional
judgement and clinical quality indicators instead of
measuring a single value (RCN, 2010a).</p>
      <p>In Wales, health organisations submit annual workforce
plans to the National Leadership and Innovation Agency
for Healthcare (NLIAH) workforce development unit,
which then feed into the education commissioning
process. However, the quality of these plans appears to be
very variable.</p>
      <p>Models currently being piloted in England appear to be
looking at the time taken to perform an intervention activity.
Examples include:
w Time and motion studies based on capturing a linear
series of tasks (http://1.usa.gov/1A723GC)
w Work on averages like the Safer Nursing Care work
(http://bit.ly/1LqZti8)
w Diary-based examples making assumptions about what
people are doing but which are not transferable because
they are only sensitive to the diaries being monitored.</p>
      <p>While it is important to develop a variety of tools to map
workload activity and workforce requirements according to
local health context needs, the limitation of these approaches
is that they could underestimate and misrepresent the
complexity and multiple dimensions of the community care
episode, the time taken to provide it and the skill mix required
to deliver it. It is important to acknowledge that there may
not be one tool that will provide all the answers, but instead
focus should be placed on testing tools for validity and
reliability so that they reflect the multiple dimensions of care
and are able to calculate the workload activity of the whole
workforce to create a systematic evidence base to promote
whole-systems working across the local health economy.</p>
      <p>In 2013 and 2014, the England Centre for Practice
Development piloted the Cassandra Matrix tool, a data
collection tool originally designed for the specialist nursing
community to help them articulate their activity to
nonnurses (Leary, 2011). This article presents the initial findings
of the phase  1 pilot study and highlights the benefits and
challenges of using a new approach to capturing workload
activity as well as providing a snapshot of the story so far in
terms of phase 2 and 3 work.</p>
      <p>Current themes in workload
planning and measurement
The current understanding of how to provide safe staffing
levels in order to provide the right care in the right place at
the right time has been identified by the RCN (2010b) in
their Safer Staffing Guideline report. These recommendations
are currently being addressed by NICE as well as the Centre
for Workforce Intelligence and professional organisations
and regulatory bodies. Workforce planning at a national
level presents a number of challenges because, as the RCN
(2010a) suggests:
w It has generally not been done well across the UK and
has led to ‘boom to bust’ scenarios
w Changes in demand (increasing capacity, move to
community) and changes in supply (ageing workforce), and
the relationship between the two are not well reflected
in workforce plans
w With the exception of Scotland, local and national
workforce planning is not systematically integrated
w Effective workforce planning requires commitment to
matching supply to demand (with an accurate
assessment of both) and the authority to translate the results
of the agreed approach into workforce plans.</p>
      <p>Workload measurement tools may capture workload
demands in order to plan staffing levels, but few give a clear
idea of the mix of employees or skills needed to deliver safe,
quality and effective patient care specifically in the
community setting. The first fundamental issue is that there is a
lack of national consensus around the definitions being used
to describe nursing interventions and activities, starting with
the service itself (what is being done and how frequently
it involves contact with clients) and the population served
(and its density) (RCN, 2010a). It is further compounded
by variation in how ‘caseloads’ are defined; therefore, it is
almost impossible to arrive at consistently defined data that
allows averages to be produced and comparisons to be drawn
because of population demographics and differences in skill
mix across the country.</p>
      <p>If the level and mix of staffing is not well matched to what
is needed, it is not just the volume of care that is affected, but
the quality of each and every nursing action or interaction
could be affected by excessive workloads—the net effect
being increased stress, sickness and low staff morale as well as
a higher rates of staff leaving the profession (RCN, 2010a).
From a community perspective it is vitally important to have
accurate data to underpin decisions regarding commissioning
skill mix and services so that the duration of each individual
care episode provides the highest quality of interaction
possible for both the practitioner and the client at home. In
some parts of the country, directors of nursing are reporting
variance in the contact time allocated by patients, but there
is currently no systematic evidence to support a
standardised approach. From anecdotal evidence it is not difficult to
determine the potential impact on the quality of care and
tasks that may be omitted or missed due to lack of time.</p>

    <sec id="2">
      <title>Levels of workforce planning</title>
      <p>Workforce planning is undertaken at different levels
(national, regional and local) and can be categorised into three main
types of activity by level and purpose.</p>
      <sec id="2-1">
        <title>1. Workforce modelling</title>
        <p>Workforce modelling uses current provision to predict future
care needs to anticipate the demand for nursing staff. Also
known as workforce flow, calculations are made on the basis
of flow into and out of the labour market to predict the
number of nurses needed to meet demand (a demand-driven
model to inform workforce training plans).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="2-2">
        <title>2. Establishment setting</title>
        <p>Establishment setting is a commonly used approach to
determine or review the funded establishment of nursing posts
required to deliver a specific service.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="2-3">
        <title>3. Daily planning/rostering</title>
        <p>Daily planning or rostering is an approach used to match the
staff deployed to variation in workload. It requires a regular
review of patient mix (a predictor of associated workload)
to ensure that supply meets demand for care anticipated. For
example, the workload may be higher during flu vaccination
season to meet the demands of the local population.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, due to the lack of research and literature in
the area of health workforce planning and development, and
in community nursing more generally (Curson et al, 2010),
there are real opportunities to lead on research and
development, with the possibility of effective tools, models and
conceptual frameworks providing exemplars for best practice
locally, nationally and internationally. Equally, the challenge
is to develop visionary methodologies, methods and tools
by designing them to allow for a filtering of context and a
responsiveness to wider sociocultural, socioeconomic and
sociopolitical subjectivities (Hurst, 2006; Reid et al, 2008;
Holloway et al, 2009; Kelly et al, 2009; Curson et al, 2010;
Masnick and McDonnell, 2010; Parsons, 2010; Fraher and
Jones, 2011; Haycock-Stuart and Kean, 2011; Leach and
Segal, 2011; Buchan and Seccombe, 2012; Chilton, 2012;
Farmer et al, 2012; Tomblin Murphy et al, 2012; Centre for
Workforce Intelligence, 2013).</p>
        <p>The Cassandra Matrix tool
‘Cassandra’ was originally designed as a paper-based tool to
capture what nurses do (interventions), where their actions
occur (contexts), who the work is done for (patients or
carers), and what the nurses do not have time to do (work left
undone) (Leary, 2011). The tool’s robustness is derived from
the fact that it is based on 50 million hours of activity
analyd
tL sis. Some 65 000 interventions have been captured to provide
e
r
cah detailed information about specialist nurse contributions in
ltea the field of oncology over a 9-year period.The research team
H
A had previously worked with the tool to measure the
specialM
15 ist nurse contribution in a large NHS acute trust that was
0
2© undergoing a significant programme of workforce
remodelling. Based on the authors’ experiences, the aim of the
present project was to evaluate whether it could be piloted
in the community nursing context.</p>
        <p>The electronic version of Cassandra is designed to be
used in ‘real time’ as practitioners carry out their daily work
using computers, phones or tablets to input their activity.The
interventions are grouped into four main types:
w Physical interventions
w Psychological interventions
w Social interventions
w Case management and administration</p>
        <p>The tool will provide an accurate picture of how an
individual practitioner spends most of their working time
provided that a minimum of 70–100 hours of work are
recorded. The electronic version of the tool generates
individual reports (for a practitioner to judge their own
workload) and annual appraisal negotiations. This information
would also be useful for personal development planning and
career progression. The organisational-level report
demonstrates the spread and complexity of work across professional
career bands as well as demonstrating what work has been
left undone.</p>
        <p>Methods
Purpose and objectives
The phase  1 pilot was commissioned by NHS England
Kent and Medway local area team and North Kent clinical
commissioning groups between September and December
2013 to determine the suitability and applicability of the
Cassandra workload activity tool for the community nursing
context. Project commissioners’ critical questions guiding
the study were:
w What tools are already in existence and what are their
strengths and limitations? Where are the gaps?
w What would a community nursing workforce look like
to deliver this model?
w How can existing tools be used as a benchmark for
effective workforce development planning for nursing
services?
w How can a benchmark tool be used by
commissioners to lobby for nursing skill mix, delivering value for
money, effectiveness and economic benefits for patient
outcomes?</p>
        <p>A regional project steering group consisting of
representatives from NHS England local area team, Health Education
England, directors of nursing and quality in community
nursing organisations and local NHS trusts was established
to monitor and review project progress.</p>
        <p>Testing
In order to test the validity of the tool for the community
nursing context, a regional integrated mental health trust
agreed to test it prior to the pilot with one of its community
nursing teams to ensure that it appropriately described
community nursing activities and interventions. A paper-based
version of the tool was then piloted with three self-selected
organisations working with a designated champion in each
who recruited a sample of self-selected band 5–7 community
nurses willing to pilot the tool (Appendix 1).The total sample
size for the pilot was 24 self-selected participants. Data were
captured by each individual participant over a period of 10
working days. Using the paper-based tool, an activity was
ticked every time it occurred against an inventory of
predetermined interventions. Each participant was responsible
for completing daily record sheets and then adding up the
total number of activities for each day. Once 10  days’ data
capture had been completed, the data sheets were returned
to the research team and inputted into a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet.This provided an instant analysis of key activities,
generating an individual report of workload activity as well
as an organisational-level report of the spread of workload
across the bands participating in the pilot.</p>
        <p>A Bristol Online Survey (BOS) (BOS, 2013) was
launched to provide an opportunity for participants to
capture their evaluation in a pre-test/post-test design
format. Using a claims, concerns and issues framework
derived from fourth-generation evaluation (Lincoln and
Guba, 1985), the survey asked what positive statements
participants would like to make about using the tool, what
concerns they had and what questions they would like to
be addressed. This information was taken with a simple
cognitive mapping tool asking participants to make a
judgment regarding how effective they were at measuring what
they did both pre- and post-pilot.This enabled comparison
before and after the workload activity data collection.
Ethical approval for the study
Ethical approval for the study was provided by the University
Ethics Committee. Anonymity for community nurse
participants was clarified in a participant information sheet and
consent was informed by self-selected participant uptake.
Participants received a letter of thanks following their
participation to enable them to request a copy of their
personalised Cassandra Matrix work profile data for their own
records and interest and to determine whether they wished
to receive a full copy of the report. Individual participant
data was not readily identifiable in the organisational
analysis provided for each community organisation in the data
analysis charts provided. It was made clear to employers
of the participant organisations that individual community
nurses’ Cassandra activity profiles were confidential to the
participants to avoid individuals being readily identifiable.
Results
Phase 1 pilot findings
Some 24 out of 26 participants returned 10  days of
complete data, providing a 92% response rate. Individual reports
were produced for each participant showing their overall
intervention totals by the context in which they were
carrying them out. The organisational charts provided an
opportunity to see the profile for a whole set of employees’
activity, and for some inferences to be made from
observation of an organisation’s profile. This enabled comparison
between activities and ratios relating to employment bands
at an organisational level. The pilot also generated a
crossorganisational analysis report that showed the consolidated
interventions for the whole cohort of participants according
to the context in which the care took place.This offered the
opportunity to understand where the concentration of care
activity lies, both in terms of interventions made and
context. It also enabled the identification of some work overlap
and repetition between band 5 and band 7 practitioners.</p>
        <p>The data demonstrated that participating community
nurses were involved in significantly more procedural and
holistic assessment work over and above anything else,
followed by (in order of significance): care planning and
evaluation, caseload management, symptom control and
advice, promoting self-management, reassessment of needs,
handovers, and administration.The largest spike in the data
identified that a significant amount of travelling was done
in order to manage caseloads, with the majority of travel
being scheduled as opposed to unscheduled. The
majority of care activity took place in domiciliary settings, and
although there was evidence of some telephone and clinical
activity, the minority of activity occurred within a
multiprofessional context.</p>
        <p>The data also indicated that practitioners engaged
less (although still significantly) in providing health
education, risk assessment and reviews, hospital
avoidance, coordinating care, clinical risk assessment, and the
chasing up of referrals and results. A less significant part
of the overall work consisted of rescue work, carer
support, dealing with distress, anxiety management, anxiety
rescue, social assessment, safeguarding the vulnerable,
mediation of relationships, social advice, psychological
assessments, advocacy, communicating significant news,
and joint assessments.</p>
        <p>In summary, the data from this small pilot demonstrated
that community nurses are required to draw on a broad
spectrum of skills; however, the emphasis upon which of
those skills is put into action differs according to the
working environment.</p>
        <p>User responses to the tool
The survey indicated overwhelmingly that participants
felt that the tool would make visible the contribution of
community nurses and is useful for both peer review and
benchmarking care standards. One participant stated:
‘It clearly highlights what we do each day as well
as the scope and impact of my role’.</p>
        <p>The pilot demonstrates that participants found the tool
easy to engage with and use, and that it has:
‘...potential to provide evidence of what I do, the
skills and knowledge I use daily as well as inform
staffing levels and admin support’.</p>
        <p>The survey also identified for participants that managing
time is a major concern that:
‘...at times can be difficult due to the number of
visits or shortness of staff. This in turn makes it
difficult to measure what I do consistently’.</p>
        <p>Participants also identified the potential for the tool to be
used to support integrated service delivery:
‘It has the potential to promote more
understanding of different roles and who does what in the
multidisciplinary team.’
Discussion
The purpose of this initial phase  1 project was to test
whether the Cassandra Matrix tool had the potential to be
adapted for and used more extensively within community
nursing organisations and settings. Therefore, our results
and conclusions with a small sample size are not sufficiently
generalisable to make broader recommendations regarding
workforce design. However, they are useful in
demonstrating that the tool is potentially valuable, that it is scalable
and easy to use and that it promotes quick and easy
comparative analysis of workforce activity for individuals, teams
and organisations.</p>
        <p>We can report with confidence that the tool clearly
captured the full range of nursing activities across band 5–7
selfselected participants, verified by expert groups of community
nurses. Furthermore, the tool demonstrated that band 5
practitioners were engaged more significantly in procedural work,
care planning, and travelling. It was not possible given the small
sample size to identify or infer the management activity of the
d
tLe band 7 practitioners. The phase 1 pilot demonstrated that the
r
ca tool required some amendments in order to pick up
additionh
ltea al community nursing interventions. A series of stakeholder
H
A workshops were established quickly to undertake consultation
M
15 and consensus on what inclusions and additions needed to
0
2© be made.</p>

      <title>Future directions</title>
      <p>Following a series of dissemination events at regional and
national level, and further funding from Health Education
England (Kent, Surrey and Sussex), the team is finalising
a phase  2 pilot, testing an electronic community
nursing version of the tool more widely with six community
organisations across Kent, Surrey and Sussex to capture
the workload activity of band 5–8 generalist and specialist
community nurses on a larger scale (Figure 1). In addition,
work is currently taking place with an integrated mental
health and social care organisation to develop a mental
health version of the tool for pilot in 2015 with a range of
professional groups.</p>
      <p>There now exists the national appetite and widespread
support from NHS England, the Queen’s Nursing Institute
and the Royal College of Nursing to scale the use of
Cassandra across a number of implementation sites in
England in 2015. This will enable activity data to continue
to be gathered using a grounded approach until saturation
is achieved. Following this, the data will be mined for
patterns in order to develop a representative optimum caseload
simulation model ready for testing. This has not previously
been achieved in the community context. It is hoped that
this will enable a representative ‘whole system’ to be built
that injects realism into practice, accurately reflecting the
management of complex work instead of trying to measure
the component parts in isolation. Developing an
understanding of the interrelationships between care
interventions, context and multiple users is an iterative process that
involves working with large data to look for patterns that
will enable the development of a representative model that
reflects activity in all its dimensions in order to simulate the
optimum caseload. By mining data and modelling the
relationship that is assumed to exist, it may be possible to build
more accurate data capture tools that provide increased
insight into the relationship between complex nursing care
and patient safety factors (and subsequent cost
effectiveness). It is hoped that this will allow predictive modelling in
future. Furthermore, the approach will help to identify how
much work is planned and how much is unplanned. This is
an important aspect to explore in detail since it enables the
analysis of reactive versus proactive workforce activity and
to balance the supply-and-demand-driven model currently
pervading workforce planning. It is also an important
factor in estimating the cost of care, or the cost of poor care.
Conclusion
Phase  1 and 2 testing has demonstrated that the
community nursing version of the tool can quickly and accurately
capture a representative picture of how community and
district nurses spend their time. The electronic version of
the tool has enabled more complex data to be collected that
describes what people are doing and what breakdown of
activity types is occurring within organisations and across
NHS career grades within the workforce. Evidencing the
complexity of community nursing enables practitioners,
services, organisations and service users to reflect on its
tangible value, and also to understand and appreciate that
complexity alongside a fluid health economy in such a way
that it is possible to plan future workforce development in
a more comprehensive and inclusive way. BJCN
