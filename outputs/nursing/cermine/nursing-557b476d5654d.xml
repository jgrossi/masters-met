        <p>Purpose: To report on approaches that were used to assist with implementation of family systems nursing (FSN) at a university hospital level in Northern Europe. Design and Methods: A quasi-experimental research design was used for the first phase of the study. For the second phase, a cross-sectional research design was used. Data were collected in the first phase of the study from 457 nurses in all except one of the divisions of the hospital regarding their attitudes towards involving families into their care before and after having participated in the education and training intervention (ETI) program in FSN. Furthermore, in the second phase, data were collected from 812 nurses, after FSN had been implemented in all divisions at Landspitali University Hospital, regarding the nurses' knowledge of FSN and their evaluation of the quality of the ETI program (i.e., theoretical lectures on FSN as well as the benefit of the skill lab training regarding applying FSN into their clinical practices). Graham and colleagues' Knowledge to Action framework was used as the conceptual framework for the research. Results: Nurses who had taken a course in FSN reported a significantly more positive attitude towards involving families in their care after the ETI program compared to those who had not taken such a course. Furthermore, a majority of the nurses who participated in the ETI program reported that the program was a favorable experience and indicated readiness for applying FSN in clinical practice. Conclusions: Further research is needed regarding the benefits of offering FSN at an institutional level, but focusing international attention on effective strategies to implement FSN into nursing practice may result in better health care for individuals and families around the globe.

      <p>nurses at a university hospital is essential in supporting nurses applying new
knowledge, when providing evidence-based health care services, to individuals
and their family members. Such training can facilitate integration of new and
needed information in clinical practice.</p>
      <p>Family systems nursing (FSN) is a phenomenon that
is getting increased attention among administrators,
and scientists in general, as well as advanced nurse
practitioners. The reason is that stronger evidence is
being reported in the literature regarding the benefits
of involving families in healthcare services, both for
patients and family members. Furthermore,
recommendations put forward by the International Council of
Nursing (2002) and World Health Organization (WHO; 2006)
on the importance of involving families in health care,
and numerous research findings on improved health
outcomes following interventions for families dealing
with chronic and acute illnesses, are promising (Bell
&amp; Wright, 2011; Chesla, 2010; Leahey &amp;
Svavarsdottir, 2009; Svavarsdottir, Sigurdardottir, &amp; Tryggvadottir,
2014; Sveinbjarnardottir, Svavarsdottir, &amp; Wright, 2012).</p>
      <p>In addition, because of findings from evidence-based
research that supports benefits of psychosocial
interventions in clinical practice (Svavarsdottir &amp;
Sigurdardottir, 2013; Warner et al., 2011), clinical guidelines
are increasingly recommending effective family nursing
involvement in health care to strengthen both the
patient and the family (Registered Nurses Association of
Ontario, Canada, 2006). Based on the increased
evidence in the literature on positive outcomes of involving
families in healthcare services, the Landspitali University
Hospital Family Nursing Implementation Project was
established in 2007 and was actively applied over a 4-year
time period, until the end of 2011. The purpose of this
research was to evaluate strategies that were used to
facilitate implementation of FSN in general practices as well
as advanced nursing practices at Landspitali University
Hospital (LUH) in 2007–2011.</p>
      <p>Recently, circularity between knowledge transfer and
clinical practice has received attention from scientists
and healthcare leaders worldwide. Among those who
are responsible for knowledge translation at an
institutional level, however, little is known about what
strategies have been used when moving evidence into practice.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in today’s societies, it is vital to
understand the importance of relational practices between
healthcare professionals and families. The quality of
the relationship between healthcare professionals and
family members is important in order to understand
how relational practices or actions can be used to
be of the most benefit to patients’ health and
wellbeing. One indicator for evaluating the quality of
the relationship between healthcare professionals and
family members is to evaluate healthcare
professionals’ attitudes towards involving families in their care,
and to evaluate family members’ feelings of
receiving friendly, pleasant, and connected communications
or behaviors versus unfriendly, hostile, or distanced
behaviors or attitudes from healthcare professionals (Bell
&amp; Wright, 2011; Benzein, Johansson, Arestedt, Berg,
&amp; Saveman, 2008; Saveman, Benzein, Engstr o¨m, &amp;</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>A˚restedt, 2011; Simpson &amp; Tarrant, 2006; Wright &amp;</title>
      <p>Bell, 2009).</p>
      <p>Families who are supporting their loved one at a
hospital are often dealing with a very complex health
situation. Wright and Bell (2009) have emphasized that
behaviors of family members cannot be considered in
isolation, but rather in the context of the family
situation. Therefore, families who experience high-quality
relationships with healthcare professionals are less likely
to experience feelings of isolation or being vulnerable or
uncertain in their caregiving role. Nurses’ attitudes
towards involving families in their care has been studied
by nurses in Western societies (Saveman et al., 2011;
Sveinbjarnardottir, Svavarsdottir, &amp; Saveman, 2011). The
attitudes of nurses are believed to influence the quality
of clinical practice among family nurses. When
establishing therapeutic relationships and offering families
therapeutic conversations, where the goal is to offer support,
facilitate change, and/or maintain or enhance family
functioning and well-being, positive attitudes of nurses
towards families are essential. According to nurse
scientists who have conceptualized these beliefs in their
models, such as in the Beliefs and Illness Model
(Bell &amp; Wright, 2011; Wright &amp; Bell, 2009) and in
the Calgary Family Assessment and Intervention
Models (CFAM/CFIM) (Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009), nurses’
attitudes or beliefs towards involving families in their
care are seen to be fundamental to the
possibility of creating therapeutic change, leading to healing,
and to decrease suffering among family members.
In these models, while embracing change, it is
important to identify constraining and facilitating
beliefs when establishing involvement in therapeutic
relationships that nurses create in collaboration with
the family.</p>
      <p>Strong research evidence is now available of the
importance of involving families in health care,
where families have been found to be of
importance both to the acute and chronically ill
patient (Halldorsdottir &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2012; Kamban &amp;
Svavarsdottir, 2013; Knafl, Deatrick, &amp; Havill, 2012;
Konradsdottir &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2011; McClement, Fallis,
&amp; Pereira, 2009; Nelms &amp; Eggenberger, 2010;
Sigurdardottir, Svavarsdottir, Rayens, &amp; Adkins, 2013;
Svavarsdottir et al., 2014), as well as to general and advanced
nurses who provide the care (McClement et al., 2009;
Schulman-Green et al., 2012). According to Benzein and
colleagues (2008) and Wright and Leahey (2009), when
the needs of families are addressed and their
suffering is acknowledged, the time for patient care is
actually maximized and more efficient. This evidence must
be of great value to the nursing profession, where time
constraints in clinical practice are now of more
concern than ever. Further, the growing emphasis on
research evidence to direct practice focuses the attention
on the education and training of nurses when
applying family systems methods and research findings into
clinical practice.</p>
      <p>In order to improve the health of a population, both the
WHO (2005) and Canadian Institute of Health Research
(2005) have emphasized the importance of knowledge
translation (KT) into clinical practice, where
evidencebased information is incorporated into healthcare
services (e.g., interactions among researchers and users)
in such a way that it effects optimal healthcare
outcomes and strengthens healthcare systems. The process
of translating new knowledge into clinical practice has
been conceptualized in the Knowledge to Action
framework by Graham and colleagues (2006) and Straus,
Tetroe, and Graham (2011). In this model, KT is seen
as occurring in two interactive phases—the knowledge
creation phase and the action phase—with fluid
boundaries between the creation and the action components
of the model. As knowledge is sorted out or refined,
the resulting knowledge becomes more developed and
useful to the users. In the action phase, knowledge
can be implemented simultaneously, and the knowledge
phase can influence the action phase at several points in
the model.</p>
      <p>Based on a review of the literature and the
Knowledge to Action model, new knowledge regarding the
attitude of the nurses at LUH towards involving
families in their care, as well as creating knowledge about
nurses’ theories and confidence in their own clinical skills
in offering FSN after having participated in the education
and training intervention (ETI) program, were evaluated
(Figure 1). Based on a review of the literature and the
conceptual framework that guided the study, the
following hypothesis was tested: Nurses’ attitudes towards
involving families in their care will improve significantly
after the ETI program, compared to before the ETI
program, as measured by the Family Importance in Nursing
Care-Nurses’ Attitude (FINC-NA) scale. The following
research question was asked: What is the level of theoretical
knowledge about the CFAM/CFIM and the level of
competence in applying FSN, as introduced in the Calgary
models, in clinical practice (e.g., using interviewing
skills, assessments, interventions, relational interactions,
identifying strengths, etc.) among nurses and midwifes
at LUH after having participated in the ETI program
in FSN?
Design and Sample</p>
      <p>For the first phase of the research, a one-group pre
and post quasi-experimental study design was used. Data
were collected at two time periods from nurses working
on all divisions except the emergency division at LUH
through an electronic procedure, as well as through
paper and pencil format. Nurses who met the inclusion
criteria were introduced to the study by members of the
research team. The eligibility criteria were being a
registered nurse or a midwife who was employed at LUH
at the time of the study and being able to read and
write Icelandic at a minimum of a fourth-grade level.
An exclusion criterion for participation was being
involved in another study regarding attitudes or beliefs
towards FSN at the hospital. At time one in the first phase
of the study (pre-intervention), 457 nurses participated.
At time two (post-intervention), which took place about
8 to 24 months later, 411 nurses answered the
questionnaire. Information regarding the sample in the first
phase of the study is distributed in Table 1. For the
second phase of the study, the design was cross-sectional.
In this phase, 812 nurses and midwifes consented and
participated in the study over the 4 years that the data
collection took place. Data were collected at one time
after the nurses and midwives had participated in the FSN
ETI program.</p>

      <p>At LUH, the family nursing steering committee (FNSC)

process of translating new knowledge into clinical
practice was based on the Knowledge to Action framework of
Graham et al. (2006). In this study, the knowledge
creation phase consisted of two separate studies: (a)
evaluating the nurses’ attitudes towards involving families in
their care, before and after having participated in the ETI
program, and (b) evaluating the nurses’ knowledge and
competence in applying FSN in clinical practice. In the
action phase of this model, the nurses in the FNSC, in
collaboration with nurses in the family systems nursing
implementation teams (FSNIT) on all divisions and units
at the hospital, implemented simultaneously into clinical
practice the new knowledge that had been created in FSN
intervention research projects at the hospital (e.g., added
benefit of offering short-term FSN interventions to
families) and had been trained in the ETI program.</p>
      <p>The ETI Program</p>
      <p>The main focus of the ETI program was on
increasing nurses’ knowledge and skills in FSN. The content
of the ETI program was on training nurses in assessing
families and offering families within their clinical
settings appropriate educational and emotional support and
interventions based on the Calgary models. By
focusing on conducting family interviews, using
therapeutic questions when interviewing families, and
through drawing forward family strengths to handle
health situations, nurses might maintain or increase
the families’ wellness and functioning. To fulfill the
educational objectives of the ETI program, the nurses
attended either a 1-day seminar of 8 hr or two half-day
seminars of 4 hr (depending on the needs of the
divisions) on the CFAM/CFIM and on family interviewing.</p>
      <p>Further, the participants were offered family skills lab
training and workshops where the focus was on
offering short-term family nursing interventions (e.g.,
conducting family trees and mapping relationships among
family members and connection with society as well
as training the nurses in asking intervention questions,
drawing forward family strengths, and offering
commendations). The nurses practiced FSN skills on each</p>

other in the clinical lab sessions and discussed
clinical cases from their units regarding different aspects of
family interviewing and in conducting and maintaining
therapeutic conversations with family members.
Depending on the needs and willingness of the nurses at the
units and the divisions, in the ETI program emphasis was
placed on offering regular supervision every week
regarding implementation for a time period of 1 month up to 4
months. The supervision was offered when nurses started
to apply FSN in clinical practice immediately following
the lectures. It was recommended that each nurse attend
three to five sessions of clinical supervision, or more,
depending on her or his need for supervision on therapeutic
conversations with families on their units.</p>
      <p>Data were gathered from the nurses through
demographic information, the FINC-NA questionnaire,
evaluation of lectures on the CFNA/CFNI models, and
evaluation of nurses’ confidence in using these FSN skills
in clinical practice via the Nurses’ Knowledge and
Confidence (NKC) scale.</p>
      <p>Background information</p>
      <p>Nurses’ demographic information was gathered in the
first phase of the study using an eight-item scale
developed by the members of the FNSC at LUH, regarding the
nurses’ age, education, length of nursing practice, having
taken a course in family nursing, FSN policy on unit, etc.
(LUH FNSC, 2007a).</p>
      <p>The Family Importance in Nursing
CareNurses’ Attitude Questionnaire. The FINC-NA
questionnaire is a 26-item scale (Benzein et al., 2008)
that was originally developed in a sample of Swedish
nurses, but has been translated and pilot-tested with a
sample of Icelandic nurses. The psychometric properties
of the Icelandic version were similar to those reported by
the authors (Skuladottir, Konraðsdottir, &amp; Agustsdottir,
2010). The scaling of the instrument is a 4-point Likert
scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. For
the whole instrument, the scoring range was 26 to 104.
The higher the score, the more positive the attitude
towards families reported by the nurses. Cronbach’s α for
internal consistency is 0.88 for the total scale. The
FINCNA instrument is composed of four factors: (a) family as a
resource in nursing (α = 0.805; e.g., the presence of
family members eases my workload; it is important to spend
time with families); (b) as a conversational partner (α =
0.785; e.g., I invite family members to have a
conversation with me at the end of the care period; I always find
out what family members a patient has); (c) family as a
burden (α = 692; e.g., the presence of family members
makes me feel stressed; I don’t have time to take care of
families); and (d) family as its own resource (α = 0.701;
e.g., I consider family members as cooperation partners; I
encourage families to use their own resources in order to
optimize their opportunities for coping with situations by
themselves; Benzein et al., 2008).</p>

17-item scale with two factors: (a) knowledge about the
Calgary models (11 items; α = 0.611; e.g., Can you
identify the assumptions and the theories that the CFAM
and the CFIM are based on? Can you identify the main
components that the Calgary models are based on?
Responses were yes, no, and not sure) and (b) clinical skills
lab training (6 items; α = 0.949). Examples of items
that belong to this factor are presentations on cases,
discussions about FSN, role play, etc. The items were
evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from not good
to excellent.</p>
      <p>Procedure for Data Collection</p>
      <p>The nurses in both phases were introduced to the study
by members of the FNSC at LUH and or the nurses who
belonged to the implementation team at each of the
divisions. If the nurses agreed to participate, they answered a
package of questionnaires either electronically or through
the paper and pencil format (e.g., background questions
and the FINC-NA questionnaire; pre-intervention). After
the nurses in the first phase of the study had participated
in the ETI program they were asked again to answer the
FINC-NA questionnaire. In the second phase of the study,
the nurses who had finished the ETI program were asked
to fill out the NKC scale in using FSN in clinical practice
only at this one time after the ETI program. By agreeing
to participate in the study and by filling out the
questionnaire, the nurses were told that they were willingly
agreeing to participate in the study. Approval to conduct
the study was received from the Scientific Committee
at LUH (No. 28/2008, 16/2009, and 02/2009); from the
Staff Ethical Board (No. 01/2008); and from the Chief
Executive of Nursing and Medicine at LUH. The study
was reported to the Data Protection Committee in
Iceland (No. S3739/2008, S4471/2009, and S4189/2009).
Data were collected at all phases from January 2007 until
December 2011.</p>
      <p>Data Analysis. Data were summarized using
descriptive analyses, including means, standard deviations,
and frequency distributions. When the data met the
assumption for normal distribution, comparisons of
demographic characteristics and main study variables of nurses’
attitudes towards involving families in their care and
regarding the nurses’ knowledge and confidence in
applying FSN in clinical practice were made using the
independent samples t test and one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Data analyses were conducted using SPSS for
Windows version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA);
p &lt; .05 was used throughout (Kinnear &amp; Gray, 2011).</p>
      <p>Nurses from all divisions, except the emergency
division, participated in the first phase of the study. Over
half of these nurses ranged in age from 31 to 50 years,
and most of them had over 15 years of working
experience. A majority of the nurses believed that there
was a policy on their unit about caring for families, and
over two thirds of them indicated that they had
themselves experienced serious illness in their families and
needed professional health care in their own family.
One third of the nurses had finished diploma or
graduate education after their BSc degree in nursing, and
around half of them had taken a course in FSN. When
these nurses were asked whether they wanted to take a
course in FSN, around half of them wanted to take such
a course.</p>
      <p>Nurses’ attitudes towards involving families in their
care, on all the divisions except the emergency division at
LUH, were evaluated before and after having participated
in the ETI program. Interestingly, when the data from the
hospital were evaluated all together, no significant
difference was found on the nurses’ attitudes towards
involving families in their care at LUH after having participated
in the ETI program compared to before participating in
the ETI program. When the data were further evaluated
based on the responses from the nurses on each division,
no significant differences were found in the nurses’
attitudes towards involving families in their care after these
nurses had participated in the ETI program compared to
before they had participated. Nevertheless, when the data
were evaluated based on the nurses’ background
information, a significant difference was found after the ETI
program on the nurse’s attitudes towards involving
families in their care, based on if the nurses had taken a course
in FSN compared to the nurses who had not taken such
a course. The nurses who had taken a course in FSN
reported significantly lower burden towards involving
families in their care after the ETI program, compared
to the nurses who had not taken such a course in FSN
(pre–ETI program = 13.20, post–ETI program = 12.97, t
= 1.75, p = .041; Table 2), partly supporting the
hypothesis.</p>
      <p>Nurses’ Knowledge on FSN and Confidence in
Using It in Clinical Practice</p>
      <p>ANOVA was used to test differences in means on
the knowledge about FSN based on the lectures about the
Calgary models and on family interviewing, and on the
family nursing skills lab training, regarding the nurses’
confidence in applying FSN into clinical practice after
having participated in the ETI program. Even though
all the data were scored considerably high (the content
of the Calgary models ranged in scoring from 12 to 30
[mean scoring ranged from 25.0 to 27.6; possible
scoring ranged from 6 to 30] and the confidence in
applying FSN in clinical practice ranged in scoring from 0 to
11 [mean scoring ranged from 6.6 to 9.4; possible
scoring ranged from 0 to 11]), there was a significant
difference found based on the division in which the nurses
worked. The nurses at LUH who worked in the
surgical division scored significantly higher on the knowledge
and content component than the nurses who worked in
the women and children division, internal medicine
division, and emergency division. Further, the nurses who
worked in the emergency division scored significantly
higher on the theoretical knowledge and content
component of the Calgary models than did the nurses who
worked in the women and the children division. In
addition, the nurses in the internal medicine division scored
significantly higher on the knowledge and content
component of the Calgary models than did the nurses in the
women and children services (Table 3).</p>
      <p>Similarly, when the clinical skills and confidence
component was evaluated, the nurses in the mental health
division were found to score significantly higher on the
clinical skills and confidence component than did the
nurses in the internal medicine division and surgical
division. Nurses in the women and the children division
were found to score significantly higher on the clinical
skills and confidence component than nurses in the
internal medicine services and surgical division. Furthermore,
nurses in the internal medicine services were found to
score significantly higher on the clinical skills and
confidence component of the scale than did the nurses in the
surgical division (see Table 3).</p>
      <p>In order to facilitate implementation of FSN into
nursing practice at LUH, the nurses’ attitudes towards
involving families in their care was evaluated. This evaluation
was conducted on all divisions except the emergency
division at the hospital, because of specific situations in the
emergency division at the time. In the Calgary models
(Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009) and in the Illness Belief model
(Wright &amp; Bell, 2009), emphasis is placed on the
fundamental assumption that a positive attitude of nurses
towards involving families in health care is essential to
facilitating a therapeutic change, leading to healing and
decreasing suffering in families. Knowing the nurses’
attitudes towards the importance of involving families in
their care is therefore critical, because nurses’ attitudes
towards FSN can determine the quality of the
therapeutic conversations with families and determine the level of
involvement that the nurse can create in harmony with
families in the therapeutic process. Interestingly,
however, in this study at LUH, nurses’ attitudes towards
involving families in their care did not change after having
participated in the ETI program, neither when the data
was evaluated by the nurses at the whole hospital, nor
by the nurses’ evaluations on the women and children,
mental health, surgical, or internal medicine divisions at
that hospital.</p>
      <p>One explanation for the lack of significant findings can
be based on the fact that the nurses scored high (86.3)
on the FINC-NA instrument (the highest possible score is
104 for the whole instrument) before participating in the
ETI program, and the nurses also scored similarly high

(86.5) after having participated in the ETI program. Also,
because of the design of this version of the FINC-NA
instrument (a 4-point Likert scale), a lack of variability of
the scores in the instrument may have contributed to the
difficulty in capturing change after the ETI program,
compared to before the ETI program. Yet, the authors of the
FINC-NA instrument have recently (i.e., after this study
took place) worked on refining and revalidating the
instrument regarding the scoring distribution, which has
resulted in an improved 5-point Likert scale instrument
(Saveman et al., 2011).</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, a significant difference was found on
the nurses’ attitudes towards involving families in their
care after having participated in the ETI program, based
on whether the nurses had taken a course in FSN.
These nurses reported a significantly lower burden
towards involving families in their care compared to the
nurses who had not taken such a course. These
findings emphasize that education in FSN had an
influence on the nurses’ attitudes towards evaluating
families that they cared for at LUH (i.e., families were
viewed as significantly less burdensome). In addition,
these findings are in harmony with the theoretical
underpinnings in the Calgary and the Illness Beliefs models
(Wright &amp; Bell, 2009; Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009), where
nurses’ attitudes are believed to have an impact on
nurses’ cognition or behavior when practicing in clinical
settings.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, training nurses in FSN in clinical
settings took place through lectures and through family
skills labs. The goal of the training program was to
increase the nurses’ knowledge and skills in FSN within
their clinical settings. The main emphasis in the learning
process was on stimulating ideas of applying FSN in
clinical practice through discussions and dialogue among the
clinical instructors and clinical nurses. In this learning
environment, the nurses in the general practices got the
opportunity to respond to theoretical and conceptual issues
regarding FSN and to reflect on their own clinical
experiences when working with families. Even though there
was no significant difference found at the hospital on the
nurses’ attitudes towards involving families in their care
after having participated in the ETI program, the content
and components of the ETI program were evaluated
favorably by the nurses who took it over the 4 years of
the study. That is, the scoring was much skewed towards
the positive end of the scale on the NKC measure after
the ETI program. The nurses scored on average 25 out
of the highest possible score of 30 in the knowledge and
content factor of the NKC scale, and the nurses’ mean
score was 7.8 out of the highest possible scoring of 11 on
the factor regarding using FSN in the clinical practice part
of the NKC scale.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, however, in the knowledge and content
factor of the NKC scale, the nurses in the surgical
division were found to score the highest, followed by nurses
in the emergency division, when compared to the nurses
in the other divisions at the hospital. The nurses in the
women and children division scored the lowest on the
knowledge and content component of the Calgary
models, significantly lower compared to the nurses in the
other divisions. However, the nurses in the mental health
division were found to score the highest on the clinical
skills and confidence component of the NKC scale,
followed by the nurses in the women and children services
at LUH, who scored the second highest on the clinical
skills and confidence component of the scale.
Nonetheless, the nurses in the surgical division were found to
score the lowest or significantly lower than the nurses
in the other divisions at the hospital on the clinical skills
and confidence factor of the NKC scale. This finding is
new and has not been reported previously in the
literature. A possible explanation is that the nurses in
mental health services and in women and children services
are trained in working with families on a regular
basis and because of that might be more skilled in
interviewing families than the nurses working on units at
the hospital dealing in general with more physical
diseases among their patient population. Nevertheless,
having the nurses in the emergency services scoring the third
highest on the clinical skills and confidence component
in applying FSN in clinical practice was surprising but
may stress the need for a family nursing perspective in
the nursing practice in the emergency division of the
hospital.</p>
      <p>Limitations of the Study</p>
      <p>The findings from the study need to be interpreted
within the context of the site and the country in which it
was conducted. It also needs to be interpreted within the
context of the overall purpose of the study, which was to
evaluate knowledge translation at an institutional level.
In addition, the measures were newly developed, which
creates a limitation within itself in that they had not been
previously tested or evaluated within a variety of
different cultures or clinical settings.</p>
      <p>The strategies that have been used at LUH to
implement FSN into general as well as advanced nursing
practices are encouraging. Through meetings and
support group activities, the implementation process on each
of the divisions was evaluated and the research
findings adapted based on specific needs from the divisions
and units. However, what is still needed in the years to
come and what future research needs to focus on is to
specifically evaluate the benefits of the ETI program and
the FSN interventions with valid and reliable scales. It
is also important to assess barriers to using FSN on the
divisions, to further monitor the outcomes of the
implementation as well as sustain the knowledge use, and
to specifically select knowledge to use on each
division. In addition, evaluating implications to practice is of
major importance.</p>
      <p>Nurses in general practice and advanced practice at
LUH who have been trained in FSN within clinical
settings have reported the ETI program to be a favorable
experience. In addition, nurses’ attitudes at the
hospital towards family nursing are in general positive. Since
nurses on all units at LUH have now received training in
FSN in general and advanced nursing practices, the most
critical point from an administrative and implementation
perspective will be to continue to offer the ETI program to
the nurses who still have not taken it, and to continue to
support nurses who have already taken the ETI program,
in offering short-term FSN interventions to families. Such
support and encouragement will be needed to facilitate
the implementation.</p>
      <p>Strategies that might be of help to build up
confidence in family nursing and to smooth out the process of
further implementing, maintaining, and sustaining FSN
in nursing practices at LUH might be to (a) offer all nurses
in general practices further educational support in FSN in
clinical settings, (b) offer clinical consultation to nurses
in advanced practices, and (c) support nurses in further
developing their skills in working with families. By
continuing to build and support a strong partnership between
nurse scientists within academia and clinicians, we may
be more likely to succeed. One vignette for such a
partnership is through the newly established Center of Family
Nursing Research and Development at LUH, and through
participation in programs of research and teaching, and
application of FSN in clinical practice at the hospital.
