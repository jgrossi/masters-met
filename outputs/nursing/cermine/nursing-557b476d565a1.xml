        <p>The professional literature predicts worldwide perioperative nursing shortages. Compounding this is the absence of perioperative curricula in most nursing programs, which reduces new graduate interest in and awareness of employment opportunities in the OR environment. Educators at a university and a large hospital system formed an innovative partnership to create a pilot undergraduate nursing course to better prepare nurses for the surgical setting. The course was offered in a condensedsemester format and included online activities, simulation experiences, classroom discussions, and clinical experiences in a small group setting. Two of the four nursing students in the course were hired directly into the perioperative setting after graduation, decreasing hospital costs related to recruitment and orientation. The success of the course led to its integration into the undergraduate curriculum, thus providing a valuable elective option for junior and senior nursing students, as well as achieving a new model for perioperative nursing education.

      <p>T nurses,1-5 and the demand for perioperative
here is a critical shortage of perioperative
nurses in the United States is growing steadily
by 1% to 2% each year.4,6-8 Only a small percentage
of all nurses practice in the perioperative arena, and
it is estimated that nearly 20% of those currently
employed in this specialty area will retire in the
next five years.4 As a result, many health care
environments are beginning to experience the
effects of this long-anticipated perioperative
nursing shortage.4</p>
      <p>The shortages in perioperative nursing can be
summarized as the result of many trends that
are intensifying in the workplace today. These
include
n decreased exposure to perioperative nursing
in both the classroom setting and the clinical
environment,1,4
n a perioperative workforce that is aging and
nearing retirement,9
n a patient population that requires more intense
nursing care and complex interventions,1,4 and
n technological advancements that require intense
education and skill adaptations.1,4
EFFECTS OF CLINICAL NURSING</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>EDUCATION</title>
      <p>Surgical nursing requires specialized training and
skills that are not routinely offered as part of the
curricula in most nursing schools. Instead, the
extent of many nursing students’ exposure to
perioperative nursing is limited to the occasional
observation assignment, which prevents them from
comprehending the role of circulating, scrubbing,
or first assisting during surgical procedures. This
creates a knowledge gap in clinical nursing
education. As a result, nurse graduates are not aware of
the full scope of the perioperative specialty and
therefore do not apply for perioperative positions.
The limited number of nursing school faculty
members with perioperative experience also
contributes to the lack of perioperative nursing
education in academia. In addition, even nurses who
have been in practice for several years often are
unaware of what perioperative nursing practice
entails as a result of the limited exposure to
perioperative practices.</p>
      <p>Many OR managers have encouraged new nurse
graduates interested in working in the OR to gain
one to two years of medical-surgical unit
experience before applying for a position in the surgical
environment (D. Doyle, MS, RN, CNOR, NE-BC,
administrative director of surgery and anesthesia,
Grant Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio; in-person
communication; December 12, 2013). The rationale
for recommending medical-surgical experience is
that it helps the novice nurse develop critical thinking
skills. However, as the new nurse becomes part of
the culture on the medical-surgical unit, the
probability of transfer to the OR decreases, thus
contributing to the already existing perioperative nursing
shortage. When nurses lack perioperative knowledge
and skills and have limited exposure to this
environment, even after gaining medical-surgical unit
experience, they can be uninterested in practicing
perioperative nursing. Furthermore, if these nurses
are hired into the OR, they may have unrealistic
expectations that can lead to dissatisfaction and
disappointment about the perioperative nurse’s role
and the reality of perioperative nursing.10</p>
      <p>Another factor to consider is that nurses with no
previous exposure to perioperative nursing may
decide to quit midway through an intensive
orientation program. This in turn creates a financial
burden on the health care facility because orienting
a nurse to the perioperative environment can cost
upward from $59,000 (D. Doyle, MS, RN, CNOR,
NE-BC; in-person communication; December 12,
2013).4 Thus, nurses who quit during an orientation
program can be a tremendous loss for a facility, not
only in dollars but also in human resources (as
discussed more in depth later in this article).</p>
      <p>Results from a survey of OR leaders, which was
conducted at a 2012 perioperative nurse leader
conference, confirmed the potential for a future shortage
of perioperative nurse leaders.5 Respondents (73.4%)
reported that they are current OR nurses who are
older than 50 years of age, 76% of respondents
reported 20 or more years of nursing experience, and
approximately 65% of respondents reported that they
plan to retire in 10 years or less. These results
suggest that the anticipated demand for nurse leaders
aligns with other nursing research related to the
perioperative nursing shortage.1,4,6,7,9</p>
      <p>Changes in curricula standards for nursing
education amplify concerns about the perioperative
nursing shortage.1,11,12 Because programs for an
associate degree in nursing (ADN) and a bachelor
of science in nursing (BSN) contain vast amounts
of professional and clinical information,
educational institutions offer fewer courses in clinical
specialty areas.9 Rotations for clinical observation
experiences in the perioperative environment have
been eliminated from many BSN programs, and in
most cases, undergraduate nursing students are not
exposed to perioperative nursing at all during their
clinical or practicum experiences.1,4,9,11 Many
individuals being oriented into specialty nursing
practice are recent graduates, and hospital
administrators experience difficulty successfully filling
Health care facilities and nursing schools are
forming collaborative partnerships to revise
nursing education models by introducing
detailed perioperative nursing courses with
clinical experiences into the already packed
nursing curricula.
perioperative nursing positions if nursing student
candidates were not introduced to surgical
environments during their schooling.1,6 Researchers
have noted that school exposure to perioperative
nursing influences whether nurses choose the OR
as their area of practice.3,9
ECONOMICS OF THE NURSING</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="3">
      <title>SHORTAGE</title>
      <p>Surgery departments are often referred to as the
economic engines of health care facilities because
they can generate as much as 60% of a hospital’s
revenue.13 Perioperative nurses have reported that
surgical volumes have continued to increase from
14% in 2009,14 and Sherman et al5 note that a
recent nationwide survey reports that surgical
volumes have increased in 2012. Because baby boomers
are living longer and
experiencing more
complex health
issues, surgical
volumes are predicted to
continue their steady</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="4">
      <title>increase.5 This pre</title>
      <p>cipitates an increased
demand for
perioperative nurses and an
even greater demand for nurse leaders in the
surgical specialty practice.5 Succession planning does
not appear to be a priority for OR directors and
managers (eg, lack of planning strategies and
administrative support, no expectation that nurse
leaders participate in this planning), and this results
in a universal need to strategize about how to fill
this predicted void.5</p>
      <p>The cost of recruiting, hiring, and orienting
nurses to a specialty area is difficult to calculate.
According to the literature, the cost to orient a
nurse to the OR is estimated to start at $59,000, but
can rise well above that amount when including the
cost of the application process, recruitment, and
interviewing and hiring processes.1,4,6,7,11
Additional costs associated with hiring new nurse
graduates include the extensive time and practical
CREATING A PERIOPERATIVE NURSING
PROGRAM
In 2012, the director of surgery at a Midwestern
hospital system attended a presentation at the
annual AORN Congress about the recruitment of
nursing students into the perioperative specialty
through a partnership with an academic nursing
program. In response to this presentation, this
director of surgery recognized the need to create a
pool of potential perioperative nurses to fill staffing
needs and saw an opportunity to address the growing
perioperative nursing shortage in her hospital
system. She approached the dean of nursing at a local
university and suggested a partnership between
her hospital system and the university to pilot a
simulation-based elective course to increase
interest, knowledge, and skills in perioperative nursing
among senior students. The dean then contacted
one of the university faculty members who is a
perioperative nurse to lead this initiative.</p>
      <p>A partnership between the hospital system and
university had previously existed with the creation
of a nurse anesthesia program. That program was
so successful that faculty at the university expected
a partnership for the proposed perioperative nursing
course to be a resounding success. The university
involved in this partnership is located in a
residential community of approximately 36,000
residents and is highly acclaimed, ranking 14th among
146 peers in the “UniversitieseMasters (Midwest)”
category of the 2012 edition of America’s Best</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="5">
      <title>Colleges by U.S. News &amp; World Report.15 Annual</title>
      <p>student enrollment at the university is more than
3,000 students, who have a choice of 73 majors and
44 minors along with individualized courses of
study. The university offers programs for students
to earn bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees
in nursing. Approximately 60 to 70 students
graduate each year from the undergraduate program
for nursing.</p>
      <p>The hospital system is a not-for-profit charitable
health care organization that Fortune magazine has
recognized as one of the “100 Best Companies to
Work For.”16 As one of the top five largest health
systems in America, it comprises a network of 11
hospitals, more than 50 ambulatory sites, hospice
and home-health services, medical equipment
supply, and other health services that span a diverse
rural, urban, suburban, and Appalachian 40-county
area across the state.16,17 With more than 22,000
employees, this hospital system has several
facilities that range in size from 100 beds to more than
1,000 beds. Each hospital and several satellite care
sites in this system offer surgical services in their
facilities.</p>
      <p>Determining the Stakeholders
Administrators at both facilities approved the
partnership between the university and the hospital
system. The first step of this collaborative effort
involved determining the stakeholders who would
be directly involved with the creation of the course.
The OR director and the university perioperative
faculty member chose staff members to join them
at the planning table. Selected staff members
included four perioperative educators from three of
the hospital facilities, one OR manager, and one
simulation laboratory expert. Although there was
only one faculty member at the university with
perioperative experience, other faculty members
volunteered to help with the course as needed.</p>
      <p>These initial stakeholders determined the major
steps in the process of creating and conducting
the perioperative educational experience. These
included
n establishing the course description and goals,
n developing a curriculum and schedule,
n implementing the course, and
n evaluating the success of the program.
They developed a pilot perioperative elective
course and offered it during a condensed semester,
referred to as a J-term because it was held in
January 2013. The J-term consisted of an
intensive three-week learning experience that offered
three credit hours, which is the same number of
credit hours offered by courses that are conducted
during a full semester.</p>
      <p>Although the collaborative relationship among
these specific stakeholders was new to all, they
formed an immediate bond. The success of this
close partnership would demonstrate the need,
opportunity, and quality of future cross-disciplinary
joint ventures for both the university and the
hospital system. The planning committee hoped that
the pilot course would increase academic
opportunities in specialty nursing courses offered by the
university and that it would help address staffing
needs within the hospital. For example, the success
of this collaborative partnership could not only
ensure future staffing for the ORs, but also serve as
a model to provide staffing and reduce orientation
time for other specialty nursing areas.</p>
      <p>Planning Meeting Initiatives
The university faculty member created a
description of the perioperative course to market it to
senior nursing students. Included in the course
description was the following statement:
This perioperative nursing course will introduce
perioperative nursing, including aseptic
technique principles, equipment used in the OR,
perioperative patient care considerations, and
other critical surgical topics. A strong
foundation of perioperative knowledge and skills will
be provided in classroom, simulation, Internet,
and clinical experiences. At the end of this
course, the student will realize if perioperative
nursing is a specialty area that is attractive to
the student for future employment.</p>
      <p>The planning team reviewed the course description
and determined the following goals for this
collaborative effort:
n Integrate experiential learning and simulation
into the learning/training environment for
perioperative nursing students.
n Develop a course that enhances the recruitment
of nurses into the perioperative environment.
An anticipated indirect outcome of this course was
to shorten the overall OR orientation process for
newly hired graduate nurses who participated in
this perioperative elective.</p>
      <p>The university faculty member also introduced
a comprehensive list of course objectives for the
planning team to review. The six course objectives
(Table 1) aligned with the nursing accreditation
standards (ie, Essentials)18 and AORN
perioperative standards19 and established a framework to
direct lecture, simulation, and clinical experiences.
After review and approval of the course description
and objectives, the next detail for committee
members to address was determining teaching
methodology for the course.</p>
      <p>Teaching Methodology
Traditional approaches to nursing education,
including classroom lectures, laboratory return
demonstrations, and basic memorization, often lead to
technical mastery but may not promote critical
thinking.20 Because critical thinking acquisition is
related to structured practice, the design of teaching
and learning strategies needs to promote active
rather than passive learning. According to Kolb,21
learning is a continuous process, and the way a
person thinks and behaves can be changed by
imprinting experiences into existing intellectual
frameworks. Although Kolb’s theory is not
recognized as a specific nursing theory, it can be used
as a firm foundation for the creation and
implementation of a perioperative nursing course.</p>
      <p>Research shows that undergraduate nursing
curricula should prepare students in the skills
required to function effectively on medical teams.22
Therefore, members of the committee chose a
collaborative, experiential, group learning
environment to present a valuable teaching atmosphere
and enhance the learning of perioperative
knowledge and skills. Committee members hoped that
this type of learning environment would increase
the students’ understanding of group processes,
roles, communication skills, and self-awareness
in a manner conducive to professional growth.
Because teamwork is the foundation of
perioperative practice, students’ exposure to collaborative</p>

      <p>Critical thinking. Critical thinking is a core skill
in perioperative nursing and can be practiced
through the use of simulation and the application of
adult learning theory.23 Simulation experiences can
help novice students understand specific patient
care situations that may change the manner in
which nursing care is delivered. The student can
feel an increased sense of self-efficacy and
confidence in the clinical practice setting when
simulation experiences are provided.22,24,25 Being able
to apply learning and theoretical principles in a
simulation setting has been demonstrated to
improve communication, confidence, and clinical
judgment25,26 and enhance performance.24 By
providing simulation opportunities in nursing
education, students are able to practice skills and
apply nursing care theoretical principles in a safe
environment.24,25 Advances in technology during
the past decade have generated opportunities to
create realistic simulations during which nursing
students can develop and demonstrate skills and
clinical judgment without endangering real patients.1
Simulation. Although ultimate clinical
proficiency was not an objective of this course, planning
team members agreed that simulated clinical
experiences provide nursing students with the link
between nursing theory and practice. Through
simulated learning activities, nursing students can
provide safe care even if they are novices.25 These
simulated experiences that demonstrate specific
perioperative skills, which are often missing in the
traditional clinical skills laboratory setting, were
deemed a requirement for this nursing specialty.</p>
      <p>Nursing courses that integrate simulation with
didactic learning contribute to improved
selfefficacy and confidence levels25 and may be
identified as an early factor in whether nurse students
will go on to select perioperative nursing as a
career focus. The planning team agreed that
experiential learning in the simulation laboratory, which
considers reflection and conceptualization during
practice, would serve as a framework for the course,
thus allowing a focus on hands-on simulation
experiences to increase student engagement and
learning retention.</p>
      <p>Collaborative Curriculum
During six planning meetings, members of the
committee created a skeleton perioperative
curriculum. They began development of the curriculum
by discussing current
and best practices,
facility options, and
technology
capabilities. The program
planners needed to
align their attitudes
and ideas about the
course before they
could develop a
collaborative curriculum. University faculty and OR
educators toured the simulation centers to observe
the training technology and facility capabilities.
This aspect of planning the simulation segment of
the course was critical because students would
need creative simulation scenarios to develop
actual perioperative skills.</p>
      <p>The planning team also explored how to best
prepare the students for the simulation experiences.
After reviewing and discussing different learning
opportunities, members of the planning team
selected eight AORN Periop 101 27 training
modules for the students to review before participating
in simulation classes. These modules would be
used to enhance the students’ knowledge of the
perioperative skills that they would practice during
their simulation experiences. Reviewing these
modules before the simulation experience would
help students feel more comfortable with the skill
expectations. Included module topics were
n anesthesia;
n perioperative assessment;
n scrubbing, gowning, and gloving;
n positioning the surgical patient;
n safety in the surgical suite,
n skin prep;
n surgical instruments; and
n sterilization and disinfection.27</p>
      <p>Nursing courses that integrate simulation with
didactic learning contribute to improved
selfefficacy and confidence levels, and may be
identified as an early factor in whether nursing
students will go on to select perioperative
nursing as a career focus.</p>

Challenges
Committee members identified and discussed
the challenges of this new perioperative course
at the planning meetings. These challenges
included
n marketing a new elective course to senior
nursing students who have other options for
their between-semester break,
n J-term time limits and the unpredictability of
weather because the course would be conducted
during a winter month,
n limiting the number of students who could be
accommodated while identifying suitable
clinical experiences, and
n creating perioperative preceptor criteria.</p>
        <p>J-term. The J-term is an intensive experience for
students that is offered each year during the month
of January, which is strategically placed between
the fall and spring semesters. As an optional
enrollment opportunity, many innovative electives
that the university offered during J-term (eg, study
abroad, service-type courses) could be seen as
competition for the new course. The planning team
knew that marketing of the new course and J-term
time and enrollment limits could make it difficult
to attract students. Additionally, participating in a
J-term course reduces time off between semesters
from six to two weeks. Students often use this time
off to work, travel home, or take vacations, and
it represents the last academic break for senior
students. Intense marketing for the perioperative
J-term course to address these challenges included
describing the details and benefits of this exciting
new course at some of the fall senior nursing
classes, conducting individual meetings with
students by the perioperative faculty member to
determine interest, and answering e-mail questions
posed by potential students. The passion displayed
by the faculty member for perioperative nursing
was evident to the students and created an enthusiasm
for this course that was demonstrated when it
immediately filled to capacity.
Weather. The next challenge involved the
unpredictability of weather during the month of
January in this midwestern state. Any course
offered during the winter has the potential for being
adversely affected by the weather. Even though
the course schedule was very intense to allow it to
be completed in three weeks, the planning team
identified, published, and reserved alternate dates
for students to attend backup classes if any were
missed because of inclement weather. If the
university had to close because of weather, the
simulation or clinical day also would be cancelled. In
the event of a cancelled class due to inclement
weather, students bore the responsibility of
contacting their assigned preceptors so that
rescheduling could be accomplished.</p>
        <p>Enrollment limits. The planning team spent
considerable time discussing the limitations created
by the number of students who could be
accommodated and the clinical experiences they would
have. Hospital-site restrictions for staffing and the
space necessary to accommodate the students were
also considered. Across the United States, student
access to perioperative clinical rotations has been
prevented by the high volume of surgical procedures
being performed, limitations on the number of
professionals allowed to be present during specific
procedures, the need for extra scrub attire to clothe
students, and the number of nurses already being
oriented who have priority for experience in surgical
rooms.1 This course represented the first time that
students were allowed to have a clinical experience
in the OR within this hospital system’s campuses.
Therefore, ensuring that personnel in the various
perioperative areas were accepting of the students
was extremely important. The planning team worked
to help ensure that the students had a positive learning
experience, but they also worked hard to see that OR
personnel were supportive of these experiences, saw
them as valuable, and were minimally burdened by
the students’ presence. The planning team used
education and change management strategies to
discuss student presence in the OR and to identify

the advantages of this new elective in various
meetings with OR personnel and surgeons throughout
the planning phase of the course. The planning
committee published articles in the hospital newsletter to
communicate progress of planning for this course
within the department. The committee’s decision to
maintain a low enrollment, with a maximum of four
students, was to minimize disruption to OR personnel
and enable a smooth transition to a new learning
model.</p>
        <p>Preceptor criteria. The inclusion of students
in the perioperative areas for their clinical
experiences was new for the hospital system; therefore,
the planning team had to review the academic and
hospital campus preceptor requirements. The
university requires that preceptors have an
unencumbered professional nursing license (ie, no violations,
no restrictions on practice) and at least two years
of perioperative experience with a demonstrated
competence in this area of clinical practice.
Additionally, the OR managers at the hospital campuses
would need to provide these staff member
preceptors during the student’s scheduled clinical days.
The ongoing challenges of nursing shortages in the
OR, the limited number of nurses willing to serve as
preceptors, and the need to provide a consistent
learning experience for the students presented
barriers that had to be addressed before the start
of the course. To address these issues, the course
educators met with each potential preceptor to
discuss the role of the preceptor, student
assignments and skills laboratory experiences, and other
expectations to provide a consistent and effective
clinical experience.</p>
        <p>IMPLEMENTING THE PILOT COURSE
The university faculty member along with a team
of OR nurse educators and the simulation
laboratory expert led the entire curriculum, as
outlined in detail in Table 3. A variety of teaching
methods were used during the course, including
lecture, discussion, case studies, group presentations,
Internet assignments, audiovisuals, demonstration,
simulations, observation, and clinical experiences.</p>
        <p>Because each segment of the course was built on
the previous segment (eg, the assignments using the
AORN Periop 101 online modules prepared the
student for the classroom presentations), the
classroom presentations reinforced this new information
and allowed students to discuss the material and ask
questions. By the time students entered the
simulation laboratory to practice a specific skill, they
had the foundational information to demonstrate
their understanding of the concepts presented in
class. The simulation laboratory also provided a
safe setting for practice without the negative
consequences of performing a skill incorrectly in the
clinical setting. The skills could be practiced over
and over until the student felt comfortable and
exhibited competence. Finally, the student entered
the clinical environment to perform the newly
learned perioperative skills in the real setting with
real surgical patients. The students’ clinical time
also allowed them to expand their knowledge of
perioperative nursing by experiencing the
sequences of events during the actual care of a
surgical patient, which cannot be learned in the
simulation laboratory.</p>
        <p>During the course’s first day of class, university
faculty introduced students to various settings in
the perioperative environment and the role of the
perioperative nurse. Perioperative practices are
evidence based; therefore, instructors explained
how to use the AORN Perioperative Standards and
Recommended Practices20 as a valuable resource
and also discussed ethics, professionalism, and
other expectations of a perioperative nurse. Other
topics covered were surgical attire, traffic patterns,
patient flow, responding to emergencies, and
perioperative assessment. The students visited the
simulation laboratory to review zones within the
OR and identify routine surgical furniture and
equipment. The hospital educators enacted a
simulated exercise portraying the different roles within
the surgical suite, along with how each professional
functions during a procedure. The students were
taught what is sterile and what is not sterile and
how to move within a surgical suite. Later in the
The preceptors understood what the students
had covered in the classroom and simulation
laboratory and were able to build on that
knowledge by ensuring that the students were
able to perform some of those skills under the
direct supervision of the preceptor.
day, the students practiced opening different types
of packs and supplies while demonstrating a
surgical conscience. A simulation along with
reflection was held at the end of the day to discuss time
outs, surgical counts, and documentation principles.
This first day culminated with a presentation by a
nurse anesthetist on general, regional, and local
anesthesia.</p>
        <p>With this introduction to perioperative nursing,
the next day the students then toured two hospitals
and visited the different preoperative areas,
intraoperative rooms, postanesthesia care units, and
sterile processing departments. The students were
able to note the different surgical settings, attire to
be worn, sterile technique, patient communication,
and other basic
perioperative practices.</p>
        <p>Each student was able
to see his or her
assigned clinical site,
which helped the
student feel more
comfortable for the first
day of the clinical
experience.</p>
        <p>The second class provided intense simulation
experiences to practice the skills of scrubbing,
gowning, and gloving; patient positioning; patient
skin preps; and surgical instrumentation. Four
educators were present, and each student had his or
her own educator to review the simulated skills to
be practiced. This one-on-one relationship fostered
quick learning by the students because immediate
attention could be given to assist the students and
answer questions. The students were able to
observe one other, which gave them a sense of pride
and accomplishment when a skill was performed
well. The university faculty member was also
present to answer questions and offer information on
best practices. After the students learned to scrub,
gown, and glove, they were expected to gown and
glove one another. Patient positioning included
supine, prone, lateral, and lithotomy positions.
Instructors demonstrated the proper use of various
charge of smoke evacuation. An industry
representative from a laser company provided
information about laser biophysics and safety. The students
again returned to the laboratory to observe the
setup of a carbon dioxide laser and then to practice
using this energy by writing their names on wet
tongue blades. They also compared the action of the
laser beam on the tissue with the electrosurgical
energy. Instructors discussed other energies used in
surgery, including ultrasonic and thermal (heat and
cryotherapy) energies. Next, the director of the
nurse anesthetist program along with a senior
student nurse anesthetist presented a session about
airway maintenance and discussed how the
perioperative nurse can best assist an anesthesia
professional during induction. The students were then
shown the basics of intubation and were allowed to
try to intubate a simulation manikin to help
understand how to best help an anesthesia
professional during intubation. At the end of the class, the
students were able to use a laparoscopic simulator
while trying to perform a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. The students quickly realized the
difficulty maneuvering instruments during laparoscopic
simulation.</p>
        <p>During the J-term, the students were able to use
their perioperative knowledge and skills in the
surgical setting. The preceptors managed the
students as they circulated and scrubbed for a variety
of different procedures. During the last week of the
course, the students took the final examination,
which was simulated. The four educators set up a
surgical scene portraying the roles of circulating
nurse, scrub nurse, surgeon, and anesthesia
professional, with a simulator manikin as the patient.
The students were instructed to write down every
infraction noted (eg, attire, sterile technique,
sterile environment, communication) and were
expected to find at least 15 errors during this scenario.
Some of the errors included
n hair hanging out of the surgical cap,
n uncovered dangling earrings worn by the scrub
nurse,
n the RN circulator handling bloody sponges with
bare hands,
n the anesthesia professional wearing her mask
under her nose,
n the patient’s arm abducted too much,
n the patient’s feet uncovered,
n the electrosurgical unit (ESU) pencil dangling
below the sterile field,
n no goggles worn by the surgeon,
n the count written incorrectly on the white board,
and
n a coffee cup on the anesthesia machine.</p>
        <p>At the end of the session, after each student had
completed the quiz, instructors held a debriefing
session to discuss each infraction. This experience
not only provided a great learning experience, but
the students stated that they really had fun with this
type of learning.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon of the fourth class session, each
student delivered a presentation on a surgical
patient he or she followed during a clinical
experience. The students were instructed to pick a
patient during one of their clinical days and visit
with the patient preoperatively to learn about the
patient’s physical, emotional, and mental states and
discuss the surgery to be performed. The student
was expected to accompany the patient into the
surgery suite and assist with the circulating duties.
The student then accompanied the patient to the
postanesthesia care unit area and observed the
patient’s experience in this area until discharge. After
obtaining the patient’s permission and referring
only to the patient as “my patient,” the student
prepared and presented the case study to the other
students, educators, OR director, and university
faculty members in the audience. The student also
reflected on this perioperative experience and how
it affected him or her.</p>
        <p>The day before the end of the course, faculty
members scheduled a practice time for students in
the simulation laboratory so that they could
practice any skills they felt weak in performing. The
four educators assisted the students in performing
The most notable outcome was the increased
interest in perioperative nursing that led to
two of the four senior nursing students who
completed the course being hired by two of
the hospital campuses.
all the skills taught during this course and the skills
they would be expected to perform in the final
simulation examination the next day. The students
practiced all the skills, but seemed to focus on
gowning and gloving, along with patient preps,
because these tasks seemed to be more difficult
for the students to perform. After the practice
session, the students returned to the classroom to
discuss the final examination expectations with
the four educators and the university faculty
member.</p>
        <p>On the last day of the course, the students took
the final simulation examination in the presence of
the four educators and the university faculty
member. Instructors took two students at a time into the
simulation room and observed as one student
performed the role of
the scrub nurse while
the other served as
the RN circulator.</p>
        <p>Then the students
switched roles so
that each student
had an opportunity
to perform in each
role. In the scrub nurse role, the student was
expected to perform the following skills:
n open gown and gloves for donning after the
scrub,
n scrub,
n dry their hands after the scrub,
n don a gown and use closed glove technique to
don gloves,
n gown and glove another member of the team,
n request a contaminated glove be removed and
then re-glove,
n participate in a sponge and sharps count,
n receive liquids onto the sterile field and label
the liquid,
n participate in the time out, and
n remove a contaminated gown and gloves.
Students were not asked to demonstrate passing
instruments; however, this will be included in the
next class. The student in the RN circulator role
was expected to perform the following skills:
n open sterile packs and supplies,
n greet the patient,
n identify the patient,
n move the patient onto the surgical bed (with
help from others),
n position the patient for a procedure,
n apply the ESU pad,
n tie up the scrub person’s gown,
n remove the scrub person’s contaminated glove,
n open another sterile glove for the scrub nurse,
n participate in the count,
n record the count on the white board,
n pour liquid onto sterile field, and
n conduct the time out.
rated the student’s success during the simulation
experiences and classroom activities. Class and
simulation laboratory and clinical experiences were
mandatory. If a student missed any class or clinical
experience, a make-up plan had to be implemented
to ensure that the student gained the required skills
and clinical experiences needed to pass the course.</p>
        <p>The university faculty member, OR educators,
and preceptors were able to work very closely with
the students because there were only four students
in this pilot class. The individualized attention was
critical in the careful instruction and assessment
of each perioperative skill needed to successfully
complete the course. Reflections shared by the
students also were extremely valuable to faculty to
help promote positive student attitudes and also
intermingling of the students within the culture of
the OR.</p>
        <p>EVALUATING THE PROGRAM
This innovative elective course resulted in many
positive outcomes. These include
n development of an elective perioperative course
option for undergraduate nursing students,
n increased interest in perioperative nursing,
n identification of potential OR and/or surgical
nurse new hires for the hospital campus ORs,
n a reduction in orientation and precepting time
needed for new hires, and
n a reduction in hiring and orientation costs to the
hospital system.</p>
        <p>The university added this course to the
undergraduate nursing curriculum for a second J-term in
2014 and may consider offering it as a full semester
class in the future. Additionally, the university
intends to use this planning model to pilot other
elective courses for alternate specialty areas, such
as case management. The course’s success has
increased the effectiveness of the partnership
between the university and hospital system. The
cross-section of experience and knowledge within
the planning team offered a dynamic and diverse
group to help meet the program’s goals.</p>
        <p>Although a larger number of students completing
this pilot course would offer increased validity of the
identified outcomes, the positive effects of this
partnership are evident. The most notable outcome
for the hospital system was the increased interest in
perioperative nursing that led to two of the four
senior nursing students who completed the course
being hired by two of the hospital campuses. Hiring
these graduating nursing students reduced the
human resource costs of recruiting and hiring nurses
for the perioperative area. Orientation time for new
perioperative nurses can be extensive. Although the
nurse staffing numbers and vacancies may be lower
than within other hospital departments, the
orientation length in the perioperative environment is
often five to six times longer (eg, the average
orientation time usually reported in this hospital
system for perioperative nurses is approximately six
to 12 months because of the intensity of skills
required; D. Doyle, MS, RN, CNOR, NE-BC; in
person communication; December 12, 2013).
Following the course experiences and interactions with
perioperative leaders and staff members, the
orientation time for these two newly hired nurses was
determined to be four to eight months. The reduced
orientation time resulted in the newly hired nurse
becoming functional much sooner, which resulted
in improved productivity for both the preceptor and
the new nurse. Additionally, because the course
also eliminated the talent search process and
reduced the application process, the hospital system
also realized a reduced cost in human resource
efforts. The exact dollar figure is undetermined, but
includes human resource and OR manager staffing
time for recruitment, interviewing, and the
application process. The two students who did not
chose perioperative nursing went into other
areas. One went into intensive care nursing while
the other student is currently pursuing ministry
with plans that include also working as a
perioperative nurse in the future.</p>
        <p>Additional outcomes of this perioperative nursing
course included opportunities to offer senior
practicum and nursing electives in various specialty</p>

      <title>Ambulatory Perioperative Nursing Programs</title>
      <p>areas within the hospital system and improved
communication among and within perioperative
areas across the participating hospital campuses.
The improved communication included exciting
discussions regarding a systems approach to
perioperative orientation, ongoing training, hiring, and
on-boarding practices.</p>
      <p>Another opportunity arose as a result of the
J-term perioperative nursing course. During the
spring semester (which is the final semester before
graduation), the OR director allowed one senior
student who had not taken the J-term perioperative
course to take a senior practicum rotation in
surgery. This practicum is fifteen weeks in length
because it extends across the entire spring semester.
This is different from the abbreviated three-week
J-term elective course; it offers more clinical
experiences and the student has an assigned preceptor
and attends orientation sessions at the hospital
facility to learn perioperative skills. The OR director,
who saw the value in the J-term course along with
the participating students’ excitement about
perioperative nursing, allowed this senior practicum to
occur. As with the students who took the J-term
pilot course, the senior practicum student was also
offered a position in the OR on graduation and has
been assigned to the reduced orientation program.
This resulted in an additional savings because the
new nurse becomes a functioning member of the
team sooner.</p>
      <p>The nursing students, university faculty, and
hospital system staff members all evaluated the
J-term perioperative course positively. Pre- and
posttest results of a survey given to the students
indicated increased confidence levels associated
with performing the perioperative skills introduced
during the course. Those skills involved basic OR
preparation, including gloving, gowning, and room
setup. Competent skill demonstration aligned with
the reported increase in confidence for OR roles,
equipment use, and patient positioning. Preceptors
and educators indicated increased student
knowledge and abilities throughout the three-week term
for the course participants. Surgical educators and
preceptors indicated reduced personal anxiety
related to hiring new graduates. The students consistently
reported that the relationships developed with the
preceptors and the OR educators contributed to
their increased confidence and their plans to seek
employment in a perioperative environment.
Different from other perioperative courses, the
application of Kolb’s experiential learning theory to
simulated course experiences may have fostered the
students’ higher level of thinking and reflection and
therefore may have affected the faculty and staff
member’s positive observations and feedback.</p>
      <p>The students also rated each of the AORN
Periop 101 modules they reviewed. Analysis of the
data showed that all modules received ratings from
3.25 to 4 on a 4-point Likert scale, with 4 being the
highest. The highest-rated module was
Perioperative Assessment, and the lowest-rated modules
(even though these ratings were still very positive)
were Positioning the Surgical Patient and Surgical
Instruments. The students suggested that videos be
used to help understand the positioning practices
and devices in more detail. The students rated the
simulation experiences as the best learning
activities in the course. They also rated the quiz that
challenged their knowledge to pick faulty practices
very highly and settings in the simulated
intraoperative scene as contributing to the students’
sense of a surgical conscience. One student, who
delivered the university’s 2013 student
commencement address, proclaimed his experience as
“exceptional.” Another student remarked, “The course
brings in a breath of new, fresh air as we never were
given the opportunity to be fully exposed to the OR
in other courses.” Yet another commented, “I
would greatly recommend this course to other
students.” The students also rated the clinical
experiences very high and stated that they provided
valuable learning opportunities about the role of
the perioperative nurse. Students also gave the final
examination high ratings. They said that they much
preferred simulated testing compared with
completing a written test. Faculty members are using
these comments along with face-to-face interviews
with the students completing the course to refine
future perioperative courses that will be offered at
the university.</p>
      <p>Faculty identified two unforeseen outcomes
during the course implementation and evaluation
n opportunities to offer a senior practicum and
nursing electives in various other specialty areas
within the hospital system, and
n ways to improve communication among
perioperative areas across the participating hospital
campuses.</p>
      <p>Other specialty areas within the hospital system
also are experiencing nursing shortages, and faculty
are exploring and conducting preliminary
discussions to offer senior practicums and/or nursing
electives in these areas that follow the model of the
perioperative nursing course. These added courses
and experiences may assist in elevating the
students’ interest in other nursing specialty areas that
are experiencing shortages.</p>
      <p>The OR director and clinical educators also
reported improved communication among their
various surgical areas. This collaboration expanded
across three hospital systems and four surgical
departments that were used to implement this
perioperative nursing course. Because of the
regular and open communication, the OR educators
found commonalities among the different hospital
clinical sites, but more important, they found
unexpected differences in practices and policies. In an
attempt to standardize across all hospital campuses,
the educators are collaboratively striving to create
consistency. This, in turn, could save the hospital
system money, time, and energy by reducing
inconsistencies and redundancies in practice. In
addition, this unique collaboration can creatively
help to meet staffing needs in the OR for all
campuses within the hospital system, even those not
directly involved with the course.</p>
      <p>CONCLUSION
Members of the course planning committee added
advanced simulation technology to the perioperative
nursing coursework to create realistic perioperative
scenarios, and the nursing students involved with
this elective perioperative J-term course were able
to develop and demonstrate clinical judgment
without endangering real patients. The
perioperative skill simulations appeared to contribute to the
students’ improved self-efficacy and confidence
levels which, in turn, was a factor for these students
in selecting perioperative nursing as a career focus.
If the university offers more courses that
incorporate experiential learning theory methods and
simulation that align with clinical experiences, positive
outcomes could affect the current and anticipated
nursing shortages in this specialty area and others.
This pilot course enabled the OR director to
identify and hire nurses more quickly and move
them from new graduate status to full
employment status in a shorter time. Partnerships
between academia and hospital systems together
with innovative methods of teaching and learning
can help solve the major challenge of staffing ORs
in the future.</p>
