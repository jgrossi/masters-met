        <p>Aim: This research examined the relationship between nursing managers' power and nursing group power in public health service organizations. Approach/Methods: A cross-sectional survey of first-line nurse managers (n ¼ 264) from 11 Finnish hospitals was conducted. The power of nurse managers and nursing groups was examined through two reliable instruments: the Nursing Managers' Power instrument and the Sieloff-King Assessment of Group Power within Organizations instrument . Findings: The power of nurse managers was perceived to be moderate on a 5-point Likert scale. Managers reported that they gained the most power from their role and position as a nursing manager, and lastly, from their resources. The power of nurse managers correlated no more than moderately with nursing group power. Implications for Nursing Management: Organizations need to ensure that nursing managers have the power and opportunity to influence nursing goals and outcomes.</p>

      <p>In recent years, nursing managers have faced different
challenges resulting from changes in health care
organizations and service structure reform. One of these
changes involves the changing role of first-line nursing
managers (i.e., nurse managers and assistant nurse
managers). For the first-line nurse manager, this means new
and additional tasks, increased responsibilities and
larger staff groups.1 Competent professional nurses do
not need to be managed. Rather, the health care
environment needs to be managed so that nurses can better
work with patients.2 Thus, by managing the
environment, the nurse managers exert influence on the
achievement of the goals and outcomes of wards and
nursing groups.3,4</p>
      <p>During the last few years, researchers have studied
nursing management from the point of view of hospitals’
Magnet factors and first-line nurse managers’
competency.5,6 First-line nurse managers need competencies,
knowledge and skills in the essentials of power and
influence to lead nursing groups to achieve their goals.7
However, whether first-line nurse managers have the
power to lead nurses, and the type of power they possess,
has not been investigated.</p>
      <p>In studies by Skytt1 and Brown et al.,8 first-line nurse
managers described the difficulties they face every day,
such as staffing, nursing shortages and economics. These
managers are responsible for issues such as the
management of ward resources, recruitment, staff
development, the guidance or support of staff, etc.9 It is obvious
that if first-line nurse managers are provided with
additional support, resources and access to information, they
could use the resulting power to more effectively influence
ward, staff and patient outcomes.10</p>
      <p>Nursing group power, as a concept, has been minimally
defined in public health care services in Finland,11
although nursing power has been identified as an essential
pre-requisite if a nursing group is to achieve its goals.
Although traditional work environment factors have
drawn the attention of nursing researchers, nursing
group power (as a work environment factor) has received
minimal attention. This study examined the relationship of
first-line nurse managers’ power to the power of the
nursing group.
The concept of power
Power is a complex and broad concept with many diverse
definitions and theoretical approaches drawn from
organizational, psychological and social sciences. Several
definitions of power have been identified in nursing.12 Although
power is often perceived as a negative concept, some nursing
researchers2 have viewed it as a positive resource available
to every group within every health care organization.</p>
      <p>Leadership, influence, authority and power are
interrelated concepts. Power can be seen as a capacity to
influence, while authority is the right to influence. In any case,
power is an essential part of management, and is a
characteristic of the social context and individual behaviour.13
In this study, the concept of power is defined as a group’s
capability to achieve its goals (Sieloff, personal
communication, 27 November 2009), affecting the goals and
outcomes of the health care organization.</p>
      <p>Nurse managers’ power
Sieloff3 defined nurse managers’ power as the knowledge
and skills of a manager in relation to the achievement of
nursing group goals. Several types of nurse manager power
have been identified in the nursing literature: legitimate,
expert, referent,14 positional and personal.15,16 Based on
these types, we examined nurse managers’ power in
relation to their role, position and resources. First-line nurse
managers were defined as nurse managers and assistant
nurse managers, as these individuals work as the manager
of units or wards.</p>
      <p>Hersey et al.16 stated that managers who understand
and know how to use power in their role, are more effective
than those who do not. Managers who feel they have the
power in their role to implement change also report higher
job satisfaction.17 In addition, nurse managers who feel
more efficacious in their nursing manager roles not only
report more access to power for themselves but they also
provide more access to power for their staff.18</p>
      <p>The literature shows that not all levels of nursing
management have equal access to the same sources of power.
The findings of Manojlovich17 showed that the sources of
power available to a nurse manager depended on the
manager’s position in the organizational hierarchy. Positional
power has been associated with nursing knowledge and
management. Organizational cultures have clearly
identified behaviours associated with nurse managers’ positions,
delegated responsibilities and the authority to work
independently.16
Nursing group power
Sieloff2 defined nursing group power as ‘the capacity of a
group to achieve its goals’ (p. 54). This definition is based
on Sieloff’s theory of the group power within
organizations, that power is composed of eight components:
controlling the effects of environmental forces, nursing
position, nursing resources, nursing role, communication
competency, goals/outcomes competency, manager’s
power competency and power perspective.3</p>
      <p>Nurses expect that managers will provide them with
resources to deliver patient care. Without these resources,
nurses describe that they are unable to control their work
environment.22 However, literature has suggested that this
provision of resources is not actually occurring, as nurses
rated their levels of power in controlling the effects of
environmental forces, nursing resources and their
manager’s power competency as low. In contrast, nurses’
perceptions of the power perspective and goals/outcome
competency were reported as moderate.24 Nurses
themselves perceive nursing group power as professional
power that is related to the application of knowledge and
skills to nursing practice,23 and to achieving their
professional role as patient advocates.25 It is thus logical to
propose that increasing work experience and knowledge
would also increase power.</p>
      <p>Groups who collaborate well with others are more likely
to achieve their goals.3 Doctor–nurse collaboration and
communication have been found to contribute to positive
results in patient care.26 The nurses’ role as members of
multi-professional groups also involves having a sufficient
degree of power and autonomy.27
Aim and the research questions
The aim of this study was to answer the following research
questions: 1) What is the level of power perceived by
firstline nurse managers in public health care services? 2) What
is the relationship between first-line nurse managers’ power
and nursing group power in the public health care services?</p>
      <p>The hypotheses designed to address the above research
questions were: 1) Nurse managers’ overall levels of power
are positively correlated with an individual nurse
manager’s instrument scores. 2) Nurse managers’ power is
positively correlated with nursing group power, as measured by
the SKAGPO .
A cross-sectional descriptive correlation survey design was
used. Information was obtained from first-line nurse
managers in three specific divisions in eleven public health care
hospitals in Finland.</p>
      <p>In Finland, five university hospitals and 15 central
hospitals provide public health care services. A convenience
sample of 11 hospitals (population base approximately
200,000–250,000) was selected with divisions of surgical,
medical and psychiatric care.</p>
      <p>In calculating the differences between means, a power
analysis identified a required sample size of 259 based on
90% power (p ¼ 0.05) in order to detect a statistically
significant 20% difference. At the time of conducting the
research, there were 1,960 nurse managers and 1,390
assistant nurse managers working in Finnish hospitals. All
firstline nurse managers in the three designated divisions of the
selected hospitals were invited to participate in the survey.
The nursing directors informed respondents about the
study and data collection.</p>
      <p>The first-line managers who responded to this study
(n ¼ 264) represented about 8% of the population. In
addition to a bachelor degree in nursing, Finnish first-line
nurse managers may have additional management
education or university degrees.
Data was collected from February to May 2010 using a
questionnaire that consisted of three parts: 1) a
background questionnaire, 2) the Nursing Managers’ Power
instrument, 3) the Sieloff-King Assessment of Nursing
Group Power within Organizations (SKAGPO)
instrument. The instruments were both pre-tested by a group of
first-line managers (n ¼ 27) to confirm the content
validity and language clarity of the instruments in Finnish.
Based on the outcomes, only linguistic revisions were
required.</p>
      <p>Background variables. The demographic data collected
included: age, gender, length of work experiences in
nursing (both as a nursing manager and in their present
position), present title, and education level. The data collected
on the organizations and divisions included: the type of
organization, total number of health care staff in the
organization, and the title of the first-line nurse manager’s
supervisor, total number of wards managed by the first-line
nurse manager and the nursing professionals on those
wards.</p>
      <p>In addition, managers were asked to assess their own
overall level of power and responsibility as a first-line nurse
manager using a Visual Analogue Scale of 0–10 (zero
indicating the lowest and 10 the highest level). These were used
as additional background variables.</p>
      <p>Nurse Managers’ Power instrument. The Nurse Managers’
Power instrument included 31 items with three subscales:
role12 position7 and resources.12 Power was measured for
each of the subscales by asking whether managers
perceived that they had power, what made power possible
for them, and also the source of that power. Items were
measured on a 5-point Likert-scale (1 ¼ Strongly agree to
5 ¼ Strongly disagree). Consistent with the ranges
associated with Sieloff’s instrument: 1–2.3 indicated a high
level of power; 3.6–2.4 indicated a moderate level of
power, and 3.7–5 indicated a low level of power. The
internal consistency of the scale was measured by Cronbach’s
alpha (overall a ¼ 0.847; role subscale, a ¼ 0.632; position
subscale a ¼ 0.599; resources subscale a ¼ 0.697). These
were at the satisfactory level, if a coefficient alpha of 0.70
is acceptable for new scales. The overall split-half
reliability, tested by the Equal-Length Spearman- Brown Formula
was 0.77.
Nursing Group Power Instrument. The Sieloff-King
Assessment of Group Power within Organizations
(SKAGPO) is a 36-item questionnaire that estimates
nursing group power and includes eight subscales: controlling
the effects of environmental forces,7 nursing position,4
nursing role,3 nursing resources,6 communication
competency,3 goals/outcome competency,4 group manager’s
power,4 and power perspective.5 The items were measured,
and cut-off (mean) scores indicated as above. The
instrument has previously been psychometrically evaluated in
three studies and its reliability and validity has been
con</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>sistently demonstrated.27,28,29 In this study, for the Finnish</title>
      <p>version of the instrument, the internal consistency of the
overall scale was 0.87 and the Cronbach’s alpha
coefficients for the eight subscales were at satisfactory level
ranged from 0.49 to 0.75. The overall split-half reliability
(Spearman- Brown Formula) was 0.86.</p>
      <p>Ethical considerations
Permission to conduct the study was obtained from each
target organization, however further permissions from
associated ethical committees were not required. Written
permission to use the survey instrument was obtained from
the authors. The participants were informed about the
opportunity to participate in the study by their own
supervisor by the cover letter. In that had been told about length
of the instrument and possibility to interrupt their
completion of the questionnaires without cause. No one took
advantage of this option. Each respondent consented to
participate in the study by completing the research
questionnaires and questionnaires were completed
anonymously.25
The data was analysed using SPSS 18.0 statistical software
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Descriptive statistics (mean,
range, and standard deviation) were analysed for all
variables and demographic data. The distribution of the
variables and sum scores were analysed with tests of skewness
and kurtosis. The mean scores for the subscales were
derived by calculating the scores of the individual items
and then dividing them by the number of items in the
subscale. Differences between groups were examined
using the independent samples t test and one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA). Pearson Product-moment
correlations were used to analyse the relationship between the
nurse managers’ and nursing group’s power. The
relationship between the overall level of power and responsibility
as a constant variable was analysed using Spearman’s
Rank Correlation Coefficient. The level of statistical
significance was set at p &lt; 0.05 for all analyses.31
Validity and reliability
The Nursing Managers’ Power instrument was developed
for this study based on a literature review, the SKAGPO
instrument and a qualitative study.14,15 Construct validity

was statistically evaluated using item-total correlations. A
pilot study was conducted with the first-line nurse managers
in three different divisions in one health care organization.</p>
      <p>The reliability of the instrument was measured by its
internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha ¼ 0.847;
SplitHalf ¼ 0.77).The SKAGPO was translated into Finnish
using back translation.25 A panel of eight experts (two
charge nurses, two nurse managers, two experts in research
related to organizational power and two experts in research
methodology) assessed content validity.26 They were chosen
on the basis of their length of work experience, experience in
the field of research, and their educational background. The
construct validity of the translated instrument was
statistically evaluated using item-total correlations.27 The reliability
of the translated SKAGPO was comparable the basis of
Cronbach’s alpha and item- total correlations to that
determined in previous studies.28,29
Description of participants
The study participants’ mean age was 49 years (SD ¼ 6.94,
range ¼ 29–63). The majority of the participants were
women 92% (n ¼ 241). The mean length of nursing work
experience was 24 years (SD ¼ 7.97, range 5–40) and the
mean length of managerial nursing work experience was 10
years (SD ¼ 8.51, range ¼ 1–32). Over half, 56% (n ¼ 249),
of the respondents had less than 10 years of experience as a
nursing manager. The mean length of time in their current
position was 8 years (SD ¼ 7.36, range 1–30) (n ¼ 237).</p>
      <p>However, of the 25 participants who had been in their
current position for less than one year (mean of six
months, SD ¼ 3.2, range ¼ 1–11), 85 % were nurse
managers and 14 % assistant nurse managers.</p>
      <p>Nursing managers’ power
The first-line nurse managers assessed their power as nurse
managers in their specific divisions through three
subscales: role, position and resources. They experienced
that their power was highest in their role as a nursing
manager (mean 2.11, range ¼ 1–5), second in regard to their
position as a nursing manager (mean 2.43, range ¼ 1–5),
and lowest in regard to their resources (mean 2.58,
range ¼ 1–5). Statistically significant differences were
found between the background variables and the sum
variables regarding the overall level of power as nurse manager
(position p &lt; 0.001, resources p &lt; 0.001 and role p &lt; 0.001),
and the overall level of responsibility as nurse manager
(position p &lt; 0.05 and role p &lt; 0.01) (Table 1). When
measuring overall power using the Visual Analogue Scale,
respondents who perceived their overall level of power or
responsibility as low (i.e., between 0 and 4), also assessed
the other subscales of role, position and resources of the
Nurse Managers’ Power instrument at the low levels.</p>
      <p>Comparing the first-line nurse managers’ perceptions of
their overall level of power and responsibility; based on the
manager’s work areas there were not significant
differences. Respondents from the surgical division perceived
their overall level of power to be the lowest, and of the
three divisions, the psychiatric division first-line managers
reported the lowest levels of responsibility. Hypothesis 1
(Table 2) was therefore not supported.
Respondents’ self-reported power was initially evaluated
on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10. This level of
power correlated negatively, but weakly with the nurse
managers’ position (r ¼ 0.178, p &lt; 0.01), resources
(r ¼ 0.197, p &lt; 0.01), and with the nurse managers’ role
(r ¼ 0.275, p &lt; 0.01). Most respondents (92%, n ¼ 264)
reported that they drew power from their position as a
nurse manager, while an indication of personal power
was only reported by 65% of the respondents.</p>
      <p>More than a third of participants (36.9%, n ¼ 97)
reported that they did have enough financial resources to
manage their ward, in contrast to 38.4% (n ¼ 100) who

perceived they did not. Similar results were reported in
relation to human resources, with 42% (n ¼ 112) of
participants perceiving they had sufficient resources, while 43%
(n ¼ 113) did not. Over two-thirds (68%, n ¼ 179) of the
participants reported that sufficient informational
resources were available for decision-making.</p>
      <p>Nearly all of the respondents thought that their role as a
nurse manager included staff development (93%, n ¼ 245)
for their ward. 98% (n ¼ 258) believed that their role
included responsibility for the performance of the ward.
87% (n ¼ 228) perceived that they were responsible for
the finances of the ward, and 97% (n ¼ 256) perceived
that they were responsible for monitoring the delivery of
nursing care on the ward.</p>
      <p>Participants reported that nursing management
knowledge contributed more to their position of power on the
ward, than power that was delegated to them (84%,
n ¼ 221). About two-thirds (65%, n ¼ 170) of the
respondents perceived that the power delegated to them was
associated with the availability of resources, however 85%
(n ¼ 224) perceived that delegated power facilitated
power associated with their role.</p>
      <p>In relation to organizational contributions to power,
78% (n ¼ 204) totally agreed or agreed that organizational
hierarchy facilitated their position of power, while 74%
(n ¼ 193) reported it facilitated power associated with
their role, and 57% (n ¼ 149) of respondents totally
agreed or agreed in terms of whether the organization’s
hierarchy facilitated their power associated with resources.</p>
      <p>The greatest differences were noted in participants’
responses regarding the factor that contributed most to
their power. Nearly one-third (30%, n ¼ 78) of the
participants perceived that their position power was not effected
by their supervisor. In contrast, 64% (n ¼ 168) of the
respondents reported that the power associated with
resources was influenced by their supervisor.</p>
      <p>In total, 92% of the respondents perceived that their
power was associated with their position (n ¼ 242),
however 46% (n ¼ 120) felt their role was not dependent on
nurses. Similarly, 56% (n ¼ 146) of the respondents also
reported that their power associated with resources was
not dependent on nurses. In contrast, 32% (n ¼ 84) of
the respondents perceived that their power associated
with their position, role and resources, was dependent on
their colleagues, while 25 % (n ¼ 66) did not report which
type of power was most dependent on their colleagues.</p>

The relationship of a first-line nursing manager’s power
to the power of nursing
The SKAGPO instrument and its eight subscales were used
to estimate nursing group power. The scores on the
subscales of goals/outcome competency (mean ¼ 1.79,
SD ¼ 0.39) and power perspective (mean ¼ 1.85,
SD ¼ 0.42) were reported in the high range. Nursing
group power was reported to be lowest for the subscale
of resources (mean ¼ 3.23, SD ¼ 0.59), followed by the
subscales of controlling the effects of environmental forces
(mean ¼ 2.93, SD ¼ 0.53) and communication competency
(mean ¼ 2.74, SD ¼ 0.65). Hypothesis 2 (Table 3) was
therefore supported. Only moderate correlations were
found between the total scores of first-line nurse managers’
power and nursing group power in relation to the three
subscales of the nurse manager’s instrument: position
(r ¼ 0.292, p ¼ 0.01), resources (r ¼ 0.351, p ¼ 0.01) and
role (r ¼ 0.468, p ¼ 0.01).
Even if power is a general concept within organizational
and social theory, there is a paucity of literature
addressing the power of nurse managers or nursing. Therefore,
it is difficult to compare the results of this study with
previous research. In addition, it was the first time the
Nursing Managers’ Power and SKAGPO instruments
had been used in Finland, although the Nursing
Managers’ Power instrument demonstrated reliability in
this study and the SKAGPO instrument had previously
demonstrated reliability and validity in the United
States.12,29,30,32 Despite the translation issues related to
SKAGPO, there may also have been different cultural
interpretations of items by the respondents and this
may have affected their responses. There may be
differences in interpretation between the use of the
SKAGPO in different countries and when using
different languages. Consequently, these differences may
present some limitations to the generalizability of related
findings. However, the generalizability of findings
within the Finnish public health care system is possible
as the sample was representative of ten of the twenty
public hospitals in Finland.
Discussion of study results
The findings revealed that first-line nurse managers
perceive the highest levels of power to be associated with
their role, position and resources (respectively), on all
three subscales at a moderate level. The respondents also
perceived that their role as nurse manager was to be
responsible for the ward’s daily operations, staffing and
finance, and as a developers of nursing practice. This
supports the earlier findings of Kleinman9 and Jooste7
However, the respondents did not unanimously support
the idea that they should be nursing experts, so first-line
nurse managers must further identify those nursing
practices that need improvement and support their nurses to
develop nursing practice.</p>
      <p>The nurse managers’ role related power and the power
of the nursing group (also associated with the role
subscale), were moderately related to each other (r ¼ 0.468,
p &lt; 0.01). This positive relationship is consistent with
findings from previous studies, since a nurse manager’s role is
to provide leadership in their ward and support nursing
groups to achieve defined outcomes and goals3,4,12 When
nurse managers perceive themselves to be powerful in
relation to their role, this perception should also contribute to
the nursing group’s view of the importance of their role
within the organization.</p>
      <p>According to the respondents’ perceptions of their
power of position, they have power and legitimacy that
occur specifically through the nursing context.16 The
results concerning the overall level of power and the
firstline nursing managers’ power of position support this.</p>
      <p>However, the correlation between first-line nursing
managers’ position and the nursing group’s position subscale
was weak (r ¼ 0.292). Both positional powers could be
influenced by organizational culture factors not explained
by this study, however, the respondents’ assessments of the
power of first-line nursing managers’ position in the
different divisions did not differ significantly.</p>
      <p>Even if first-line nurse managers perceive that they have
power associated with their position, the level of power
seems to depend on the manager’s supervisor and
colleagues, and depends less on the nursing group. In
addition, respondents described the organization’s statutes as
facilitating this positional power. This perception seems
logical as the position of first-line nurse managers is
defined by the organization’s policies, and these policies
and guidelines also play a role in the nursing group’s
power.3 In contrast, previous research has found that the
organization’s past and current statutes also could limit
first-line nurse managers’ power16 through the
organization’s culture.</p>
      <p>Over half of the first-line nurse managers experienced
personal power. Personal power was previously described
as the ability and opportunity to get things done in
advance, and is also seen to influence cooperation and
communication.16 Upenieks32 stated that personal power
increases through the development of trust in relation to
others. Therefore, personal power is an important resource
and proposed to be linked to informal power.</p>
      <p>In this study, the respondents perceived that they had
low levels of resources to support the provision of care.</p>
      <p>This perception was consistent with that of the nursing
group. At the same time, first-line nurse managers
perceived that they are responsible for the budget of the
ward’s nursing practice and the organization’s policies,
governing the work of nurse managers, are thought to
generally contribute to these perceptions.</p>
      <p>Respondents also reported that they did not have
sufficient information on which to base their decisions. These
findings support those of Upenieks’,32 where first-line
nurse managers reported that they did not have sufficient
knowledge to manage their budgets effectively. As a result,
first-line nurse managers are often the least prepared to
meet organizational challenges, even though they are
expected to provide sufficient information to the staff.4
Power related to knowledge has been identified in other
studies as important,10,18 and having sufficient knowledge
means being informed of the organization’s overall goals
and actively participating in the organization’s
decisionmaking processes.33
When first-line nurse managers do not have sufficient
power, they cannot effectively foster the development of
nursing practice, or ensure that their units achieve their
operational goals. The positive relationships between a
manager’s perceived power and the power perceived by
their nursing group should be viewed as important at
unit and organizational levels, as these relationships
could subsequently have a significant impact on the
attainment of patient goals and outcomes related to safety and
quality of care.</p>
      <p>The results of this study suggest that nurse managers
perceive that their power base lies with their supervisor
and colleagues, rather than their own nursing group. In
order for nurse managers to further increase their power
and decrease their oppressed group behaviours, it is critical
that they look to alliances within their nursing group
rather than to external parties.</p>
      <p>Due to changing health care environments, particular
attention should be paid to the first-line nurse manager’s
role, position and resources, in order to enable them to
safeguard the operations of their unit or ward and ensure
successful change management.</p>
