				<p>Descriptive and transverse study aimed to examine the relationship between the level of depression and the pattern of alcohol consumption in students of a public school in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico. The sample reached 175 students of both sexes between 15 and 19 years old selected by simple random sampling. It was used a document containing personal data, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and the AUDIT test. It was found that 96.6% of participants presented some level of depression, 97.9% were women and 95.1% were men. Regarding the consumption of alcohol, 58.3% reported consuming it, 14.3% with risk consumption, 2.9% with harmful use and 1.1% already showed dependence. It was found that most young people consume alcohol and have some level of depression.</p>

As noted currently the consumption of alcohol by adolescents is a threat to public health, not only a negative impact on biological and physical, but also psychological in those who consume it, which can cause many psychiatric disorders, among which identifies depression, and was identified that women are 3.7 times more likely to experience a depressive episode than men(11). According to what has been explained above this study aimed to examine if there is a relationship between the level of depression and the pattern of alcohol consumption by students of a public school of the city of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico. Methodology The design of this study was descriptive and transversal. The population was formed by students from a school located in the suburban area of the city of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico. 175 students of both sexes participated in the sample, registered in the period of 2010 and who was studying in the second and fourth semester, selecte</context>

It was found that 96.6% of young people between 15 and 19 years old had some level of depression, this is similar to the results of Balcázar and Col.(2), in their study they mentioned that adolescence is a stage of life where young people are more vulnerable to present some level of depression. In relation to gender and the presence of depression, it was found 97.9% in women and 95.1% in men, which coincides with that reported by CONADIC, when it mentions that in women there is more likely to have a depressive episode than in men(11). Although the difference is minimal, which follows the characteristic of females with greater predisposition to suffer depression, it is alarming to note that men are showing a higher percentage of mild depression, which also gives the estimated by WHO(6), indicating that this suffering will increase and that depression will be one of the most common disorders and will occupy the second place among the causes of illness in the general population. With regard to alcohol consumption was identified that 40.7% of this population reports being abstinent, 58.3% consumes alcohol, 40% drinks as a nor</context>

Regarding the consumption of alcohol and the level of depression this study found that levels of moderate and severe depression were presented more frequently in young people who reported consuming alcohol in the normal, dependent and harmful ways than those who reported not consuming. A possible relationship between alcohol consumption and the depression, similar to the way identified study Christie Burke and Cols.(15), supported the research which found a high relationship between depression and alcohol consumption. Conclusion The results showed that most young people have levels of depression and alcohol consumption. Depression predominated in women and students consumers. This highlights that the mental health of these young people www.eerp.usp.br/resmad 147Hernández-Cortaza BA, Cortaza-Ramírez L, Costa Jr ML. are being affected by the levels of depression that they present, situation which, if continues without being resolved, could increase the risky behaviors, including alcohol consumption, that is on</context>
