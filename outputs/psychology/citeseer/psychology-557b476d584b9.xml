			<abstract>
				<p>The relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success has been the source of numerous controversies. The present paper conducted a meta-analysis of the longitudinal studies that have investigated intelligence as a predictor of success (as measured by education, occupation, and income). In order to better evaluate the predictive power of intelligence, the paper also includes meta-analyses of parental socioeconomic status (SES) and academic performance (school grades) as predictors of success. The results demonstrate that intelligence is a powerful predictor of success but, on the whole, not an overwhelmingly better predictor than parental SES or grades. Moderator analyses showed that the relationship between intelligence and success is dependent on the age of the sample but there is little evidence of any historical trend in the relationship.</p>

First, the present study used only three measures of social background (parental education, occupation, and income) and therefore, could have underestimated its importance. Although these three have always been the central indicators of social advantages, several additional measures of social background could have an independent effect on career success (Fischer et al., 1996). Future metaanalyses could, therefore, benefit from considering other variables, such as neighborhood quality (Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000), number of siblings (Blake, 1989), or parental divorce (Amato &amp; Keith, 1991), to get a more comprehensive picture T. Strenze / Intelligof the effects of social background. Second, the useof grade point average and class rank as the only measures of academic performance can be criticized for ignoring between-school differences; i.e., the same average grade or rank can have different meanings in different schools depending on the quality of the schools (Bassiri &amp; Schulz, 2003).

If we take the traditional threefold distinction between ability, aptitude, and achievement tests (Jensen, 1981), then the present study should use only ability and aptitude test scores. Although some researchers have contended that achievement tests can also be treated as measures of general ability (Boudreau, Boswell, Judge, &amp; Bretz, 2001), and even everyday life can be interpreted as an IQ test (Gordon, 1997), the present study took a more conservative approach and included only those tests that are generally regarded as tests of intelligence (see e.g., Anastasi &amp; Urbina, 1997; Jensen, 1980, chapter 7, for a discussion and classification of different tests). There are numerous “classical” tests (e.g., Henmon– Nelson, Lorge–Thorndike, Otis–Lennon, Raven Progressive Matrices, Stanford–Binet, Wechsler tests) for which there seems to be a general consensus that these are indeed tests of general mental ability. Such multiple aptitude test batteries as Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery or General Aptitude Test Battery are also often treated as measures of general ability. The most problematic ones are the tests that are specifically constructed for use in a sing</context>

The present paper will address these questions by conducting a meta-analysis of the longitudinal research on the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. I will concentrate on longitudinal studies (where intelligence is measured before the actual success) because only longitudinal research design allows us to make conclusions about the possible causal impact of intelligence on success. 2. A brief history Longitudinal studies on the relationship between intelligence and career success have been conducted since the first decades of the 20th century (Ball, 1938; Thorndike et al., 1934). And these studies have invariably uncovered a positive relationship. The early studies, however, did not consider other possible determinants of success, most importantly parental SES. Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that</context>

The estimates ranged from .45 to .59. with an average of .51 that was used in the present paper. The third source of information on parental SES is objective data (e.g., tax records of income) that was assumed to have a reliability of 1. Internal consistency method (Cronbach alpha) was used to correct for unreliability in the SES index. This method was recommended by Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 438) for composite variables.

First, the present study used only three measures of social background (parental education, occupation, and income) and therefore, could have underestimated its importance. Although these three have always been the central indicators of social advantages, several additional measures of social background could have an independent effect on career success (Fischer et al., 1996). Future metaanalyses could, therefore, benefit from considering other variables, such as neighborhood quality (Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000), number of siblings (Blake, 1989), or parental divorce (Amato &amp; Keith, 1991), to get a more comprehensive picture T. Strenze / Intelligof the effects of social background. Second, the useof grade point average and class rank as the only measures of academic performance can be criticized for ignoring between-school differences; i.e., the same average grade or rank can have different meanings in different schools depending on the quality of the schools (Bassiri &amp; Schulz, 2003). A more comprehensive study of the importance of academic performance should, therefore, also take account of the quality of the school the individual is</context>

The definitions of intelligence state that it is an abstract ability that is not tied to any specific domain of knowledge. Therefore, only the tests that are designed to measure such ability should be used in the meta-analysis. If we take the traditional threefold distinction between ability, aptitude, and achievement tests (Jensen, 1981), then the present study should use only ability and aptitude test scores. Although some researchers have contended that achievement tests can also be treated as measures of general ability (Boudreau, Boswell, Judge, &amp; Bretz, 2001), and even everyday life can be interpreted as an IQ test (Gordon, 1997), the present study took a more conservative approach and included only those tests that are generally regarded as tests of intelligence (see e.g., Anastasi &amp; Urbina, 1997; Jensen, 1980, chapter 7, for a discussion and classification of different tests). There are numerous “classical” tests (e.g., Henmon– Nelson, Lorge–Thorndike, Otis–Lennon, Raven Progressive Matrices, Stanford–Binet, Wechsler tests) for which there seems to be a general consensus that these are indeed tests of general mental ability.

A brief history Longitudinal studies on the relationship between intelligence and career success have been conducted since the first decades of the 20th century (Ball, 1938; Thorndike et al., 1934). And these studies have invariably uncovered a positive relationship. The early studies, however, did not consider other possible determinants of success, most importantly parental SES. Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that considered several determinants of success at the same time (Duncan, 1968; Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp; Ohlendorf, 1970). But it was with the publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the question of intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to public attention. Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray f</context>

The index of parental SES, arguably the most representative measure of social background, did not differ significantly from intelligence in its predictive power (see Table 1). The same is true about the predictive power of academic performance in relation to education and occupation. It has been observed before that meta-analyses typically do not provide support for extreme scientific positions (Lytton &amp; Romney, 1991). This is also true in the present case because the extreme positions favoring intelligence (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) or parental SES (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976) were not supported by the results. The reasonable conclusion is rather modest: while intelligence is one of the central 4155 (2007) 401–426determinants of one&amp;apos;s socioeconomic success, parental ence 3SES and academic performance also play an important role in the process of status attainment. Despite the modest conclusion, these results are important because they falsify a claim often made by the critics of the “testing movement”: that the positive relationship between intelligence and success is just the effect of parental SES or academic performance influencing them both (see Bowles &amp; Gintis</context>

This conclusion has been criticized for ignoring the genetic influences on parental SES (Jensen, 1998). On the other hand, the evidence on the heritability of intelligence (Devlin, Daniels, &amp; Roeder, 1997) and socioeconomic success (Rowe, Vesterdal, &amp; Rodgers, 1999) together with the evidence on the relationship between intelligence and success (see Table 1) can be taken as proof that parents&amp;apos; and children&amp;apos;s social status are both determined by the genes for intelligence that run in the family. This conclusion has been challenged by Bowles and Gintis (2002) who argued that, although socioeconomic success might be heritable, the genetic inheritance of IQ, in particular, plays only a very minor part in this process.

This is a question about the nature of the society we live in: whether a typical western society rewards people for their own abilities or their social background (Saunders, 1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a definite answer to this question. Some authors have found that intelligence outcompetes parental SES as a predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998; Saunders, 1997). Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a better predictor (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important aspects of parental status (most importantly, parental income) among the predictors (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation between intelligence and success with the correlation between parental SES and success.

Some of the most comprehensive reviews have been conducted by Jencks (see Jencks et al., 1972, 1979). Two meta-analyses have so far addressed the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. Both of them used income as a measure of success. The more comprehensive one of the two was conducted by Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001). They assembled 65 estimates from 24 studies to estimate the relationship between intelligence and income. The mean standardized regression coefficient of intelligence on income is .15 according to their study (p. 1154). In addition to that, Bowles et al. (2001) reported that there is no time trend in the size of the coefficients between the years 1960 and 1995 and that the age of the sample at the time of ability testing has no effect on the results. The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. is a valuable contribution but it suffers from several shortcomings. First, it considered only one measure of success, income, thereby ignoring education and occupation. Second, the meta-analytic estimate of .15 was not derived from zero-order correlations as is usually required by the textbooks of meta-analysis (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 475) but from regression equ</context>

This cannot be the only aim of the present meta-analysis because very few social scientists would doubt that there is a positive correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success. Having acknowledged that, the next logical question is: what is the approximate size of the correlation? Answers to this question are far from uniform. Take the correlation between intelligence and income: Jensen has suggested that it is somewhere around .40 (Jensen, 1998: 568) while Bowles et al. (2001) have found that it is only about .15. That is why the first aim of the present meta-analysis is to estimate the approximate sizes of the correlations between intelligence and measures of success. The importance of the correlations can be evaluated using Cohen&amp;apos;s classification scheme which classifies correlations as small if they are below .30, medium-sized if they are between .30 and .50, and large if they are over .50 (Cohen, 1988). Knowing the size of the correlation between intelligence and career success would allow us to compare it to other, well-established, correlations in the social s</context>

A study by McCall (1977) found a clear upward trend in the correlations between intelligence and success; that is, correlations grew stronger as age at testing increased. Some of the studies reviewed by Jencks and Phillips (1999) have found a similar trend. The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. (2001), however, found that age at testing has no effect on the association between intelligence and income. Jencks et al. (1979) reached a similar conclusion in their review. 2 I am grateful to a reviewer for pointing this interpretation out to me. ence 34.3.2. Age at the measurement of success A related issue concerns the age of the individuals at the time their career success is measured. According to the so-called gravitational hypothesis, the correlation between intelligence and success should grow stronger as individuals grow older because (as a result of selfselection and competition) individ</context>
<context citStr="Bowles et al. (2001)" endWordPosition="5238" position="27660" startWordPosition="5235">t correspond to their ability as time goes by – but in this case the gravitation does not take place during a life course of a single individual but over several generations. Several studies have investigated changes in the association between intelligence and success during past decades. Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded that “the main point seems beyond dispute” (1994: 52) and some studies have found support for this point (Murnane, Willett, &amp; Levy, 1995), there are still serious reasons to doubt that the importance of intelligence is or has been growing. Neither the meta-analysis by Bowles et al. (2001) nor the review by Jencks et al. (1979) found any clear trend in the correlations between intelligence and success. The same conclusion was reached by Flynn (2004) and Hauser and Huang (1997). Breen and Goldthorpe (2001) found that the association between intelligence and occupational status in England is, if anything, declining. 5. Method 5.1.

Two of the correlations – with education and occupation – are of substantial magnitude according to the usual standards of social science (Cohen, 1988); the correlation with education even surpasses the wellestablished correlation of .51 between intelligence and T. Strenze / Intelligjob performance (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998). Thecorrelation with income is considerably lower, perhaps even disappointingly low, being about the average of the previous meta-analytic estimates (.15 by Bowles et al., 2001; and .27 by Ng et al., 2005). But it should be noted that other predictors, studied in this paper, are not doing any better in predicting income, which demonstrates that financial success is difficult to predict by any variable. This claim is further corroborated by the meta-analysis of Ng et al. (2005) where the best predictor of salary was educational level with a correlation of only .29. It should also be noted that the correlation of .23 is about the size of the average meta-analytic result in psychology (Hemphill, 2003) and cannot, therefore, be treated as insignificant. The second aim o</context>

Therefore, the safest conclusion from Tables 2 and 3 seems to be that the correlation between intelligence and success has not changed in any consistent direction over the past decades. It should be noted that the present paper analyzed changes in the absolute importance of intelligence (measured by zero-order correlations); the results so far discussed do not exclude the possibility of growing relative importance of intelligence (i.e., importance relative to other predictors). 5 (2007) 401–426However, the analyses of Bowles et al.

Reviewers typically cite only a couple of studies (see e.g., Brody, 1997; Farkas, 2003; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Some of the most comprehensive reviews have been conducted by Jencks (see Jencks et al., 1972, 1979). Two meta-analyses have so far addressed the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. Both of them used income as a measure of success. The more comprehensive one of the two was conducted by Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001). They assembled 65 estimates from 24 studies to estimate the relationship between intelligence and income. The mean standardized regression coefficient of intelligence on income is .15 according to their study (p</context>

Some of them have found that the correlations indeed increase with age as predicted by the gravitational hypothesis (Brown &amp; Reynolds, 1975; Deary et al., 2005; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996), others have found no clear trend (Hauser, Warren, Huang, &amp; Carter, 1996; Warren, Sheridan, &amp; Hauser, 2002). The reviews by Hulin, Henry, and Noon (1990) and Keil and Cortina (2001) found support for the declining validity thesis but it should be noted that many of the studies reviewed in these papers used specific laboratory tasks as dependent variables and are, therefore, not directly comparable to the studies reviewed in the present paper. 4.3.3.

But on the other hand, if we assume that the test scores of older individuals are more “contaminated” by genetic influences, then it would mean that genes make a contribution to this correlation. Yet another explanation would be that IQ scores of children are simply less reliable and the predictive validity of childhood IQ was, therefore, underestimated. But contrary to this explanation, preliminary examination of some evidence on the stability of intelligence among children (e.g., Burchinal, Campbell, Bryant, Wasik, &amp; Ramey, 1997; Jensen, 1980: 279) suggested that the test–retest coefficients among children below 10 are, on the whole, rather similar to the test–retest coefficients among older individuals. It appears that the age-related changes in the predictive validity of test scores cannot be explained by 416 T.

Take the correlation between intelligence and income: Jensen has suggested that it is somewhere around .40 (Jensen, 1998: 568) while Bowles et al. (2001) have found that it is only about .15. That is why the first aim of the present meta-analysis is to estimate the approximate sizes of the correlations between intelligence and measures of success. The importance of the correlations can be evaluated using Cohen&amp;apos;s classification scheme which classifies correlations as small if they are below .30, medium-sized if they are between .30 and .50, and large if they are over .50 (Cohen, 1988). Knowing the size of the correlation between intelligence and career success would allow us to compare it to other, well-established, correlations in the social scientific literature; e.g., the correlation of .51 between intelligence and job performance (Schmidt &amp; 404 T. Strenze / IntelligHunter, 1998).4.2. Intelligence and other predictors of success It is difficult to evaluate the importance of a predictor in isolation; it would be informative to compare the predictive power of intelligence to the predictive power of other relevant predictors of socioeconomic success.

Exclusion of the samples that were too old (over 18) at the time of testing or too young (below 30) at the measurement of success resulted in somewhat larger correlations: .56, .45, and .23, respectively. These results demonstrate that intelligence, when it is measured before most individuals have finished their schooling, is a powerful predictor of career success 12 or more years later when most individuals have already entered stable careers. Two of the correlations – with education and occupation – are of substantial magnitude according to the usual standards of social science (Cohen, 1988); the correlation with education even surpasses the wellestablished correlation of .51 between intelligence and T. Strenze / Intelligjob performance (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998). Thecorrelation with income is considerably lower, perhaps even disappointingly low, being about the average of the previous meta-analytic estimates (.15 by Bowles et al., 2001; and .27 by Ng et al., 2005). But it should be noted that other predictors, studied in this paper, are not doing any better in predicting income, which demonstrates that financial success is difficult to predict by any variable.

On the one hand, there is clear evidence that children&amp;apos;s IQ scores are correlated with parental SES (White, 1982), this result together with the fact that parental SES predicts socioeconomic success (see Table 1) can be interpreted as showing that environment is the “final cause” of one&amp;apos;s success or failure. This conclusion has been criticized for ignoring the genetic influences on parental SES (Jensen, 1998). On the other hand, the evidence on the heritability of intelligence (Devlin, Daniels, &amp; Roeder, 1997) and socioeconomic success (Rowe, Vesterdal, &amp; Rodgers, 1999) together with the evidence on the relationship between intelligence and success (see Table 1) can be taken as proof that parents&amp;apos; and children&amp;apos;s social status are both determined by the genes for intelligence that run in the family. This conclusion has been challenged by Bowles and Gintis (2002) who argued that, although socioeconomic success might be heritable, the genetic inheritance of IQ, in particular, plays only a very minor part in this process.

The early studies, however, did not consider other possible determinants of success, most importantly parental SES. Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that considered several determinants of success at the same time (Duncan, 1968; Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp; Ohlendorf, 1970). But it was with the publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the question of intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to public attention. Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray found that intelligence is a better predictor of several desirable outcomes (e.g., not living in poverty, not being arrested) than is parental SES.

It is important, however, that the information about father&amp;apos;s occupation or parental income obtained from adult respondents refers to parents&amp;apos; past (not current) occupation or income. The latter requirement was not applied to parental education because parents&amp;apos; education is unlikely to change while children grow up.

Previous reviews There have been surprisingly few attempts to systematically review the literature on intelligence and socioeconomic success. Reviewers typically cite only a couple of studies (see e.g., Brody, 1997; Farkas, 2003; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Some of the most comprehensive reviews have been conducted by Jencks (see Jencks et al., 1972, 1979). Two meta-analyses have so far addressed the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. Both of them used income as a measure of success. The more comprehensive one of the two was conducted by Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001). They assembled 65 estimates from 24 studies to estimate the relationship between intelligence and income. The mean standardized regression coefficient of intelligence on income is .15 according to their study (p. 1154). In ad</context>

Thus, the existence of an overall positive correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success is beyond doubt. But quite surprisingly, the mere existence of this correlation seems to be the only fact that is established beyond doubt after many decades of research. Several major questions are still without example in recent decades; see Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Fischer et al., 1996). First, what is the approximate size of the correlation between intelligence and success? Is it large enough to be of any practical importance? While some researchers have said that this correlation is “larger than most found in psychological research” (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004: 162), others are convinced that “IQ is just not an important enough determinant of economic success” (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 2002: 12). Second, how does the predictive power of intelligence compare to the predictive power of other variables, such as parental socioeconomic status (SES) or school grades?

Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray found that intelligence is a better predictor of several desirable outcomes (e.g., not living in poverty, not being arrested) than is parental SES. They also found evidence that the role of intelligence in status attainment has been growing throughout the 20th century and concluded that the social structure of American society is increasingly based on mental ability. The ideas of The Bell Curve have been severely criticized for a number of reasons. Fischer et al. (1996) argued that Herrnstein and Murray used an inappropriate measure of parental SES and, therefore, underestimated its importance. Hauser and Huang (1997) argued that the claim about the growing importance of intelligence is simply a misinterpretation of previous research. Other researchers have, however, supported the ideas of The Bell Curve (Gottfredson, 2003; Jensen, 1998) saying that its central claims have T. Strenze / Intelligbeen convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459).At the same time in Great Britain, a similar discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who, analyzing a represent</context>

This is a question about the nature of the society we live in: whether a typical western society rewards people for their own abilities or their social background (Saunders, 1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a definite answer to this question. Some authors have found that intelligence outcompetes parental SES as a predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998; Saunders, 1997). Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a better predictor (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important aspects of parental status (most importantly, parental income) among the predictors (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation between intelligence and success with the correlation between parental SES and success. To accomplish that, the present paper will include a meta-analysis of the relationship between the diff</context>

The reasonable conclusion is rather modest: while intelligence is one of the central 4155 (2007) 401–426determinants of one&amp;apos;s socioeconomic success, parental ence 3SES and academic performance also play an important role in the process of status attainment. Despite the modest conclusion, these results are important because they falsify a claim often made by the critics of the “testing movement”: that the positive relationship between intelligence and success is just the effect of parental SES or academic performance influencing them both (see Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; Fischer et al., 1996; McClelland, 1973). If the correlation between intelligence and success was a mere byproduct of the causal effect of parental SES or academic performance, then parental SES and academic performance should have outcompeted intelligence as predictors of success; but this was clearly not so. These results confirm that intelligence is an independent causal force among the determinants of success; in other words, the fact that intelligent people are successful is not completely explainable by the fact that intelligent people have wealthy parents and are doing better at school.

First, the present study used only three measures of social background (parental education, occupation, and income) and therefore, could have underestimated its importance. Although these three have always been the central indicators of social advantages, several additional measures of social background could have an independent effect on career success (Fischer et al., 1996). Future metaanalyses could, therefore, benefit from considering other variables, such as neighborhood quality (Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000), number of siblings (Blake, 1989), or parental divorce (Amato &amp; Keith, 1991), to get a more comprehensive picture T.

Efforts to collect information about the existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been studied in continental Europe (see e.g., Flynn, 1987; Sternberg, 2004; Weinert &amp; Schneider, 1999) but I have not been able to find suitable data for the present study.

Several studies have investigated changes in the association between intelligence and success during past decades. Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded that “the main point seems beyond dispute” (1994: 52) and some studies have found support for this point (Murnane, Willett, &amp; Levy, 1995), there are still serious reasons to doubt that the importance of intelligence is or has been growing. Neither the meta-analysis by Bowles et al. (2001) nor the review by Jencks et al. (1979) found any clear trend in the correlations between intelligence and success. The same conclusion was reached by Flynn (2004) and Hauser and Huang (1997). Breen and Goldthorpe (2001) found that the association between intelligence and occupational status in England is, if anything, declining. 5. Method 5.1.

Therefore, only the tests that are designed to measure such ability should be used in the meta-analysis. If we take the traditional threefold distinction between ability, aptitude, and achievement tests (Jensen, 1981), then the present study should use only ability and aptitude test scores. Although some researchers have contended that achievement tests can also be treated as measures of general ability (Boudreau, Boswell, Judge, &amp; Bretz, 2001), and even everyday life can be interpreted as an IQ test (Gordon, 1997), the present study took a more conservative approach and included only those tests that are generally regarded as tests of intelligence (see e.g., Anastasi &amp; Urbina, 1997; Jensen, 1980, chapter 7, for a discussion and classification of different tests). There are numerous “classical” tests (e.g., Henmon– Nelson, Lorge–Thorndike, Otis–Lennon, Raven Progressive Matrices, Stanford–Binet, Wechsler tests) for which there seems to be a general consensus that these are indeed tests of general mental ability.

Although it is sometimes claimed in popular press and textbooks that intelligence has no relationship to important real-life outcomes (see Barrett &amp;Depinet, 1991, for a review of such claims), the scientific research on the topic leaves little doubt that people with higher scores on IQ tests are better educated, hold more prestigious occupations, and earn higher incomes than people with lower scores (Gottfredson, 1997, 2003; Jensen, 1980, 1998; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Thus, the existence of an overall positive correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success is beyond doubt. But quite surprisingly, the mere existence of this correlation seems to be the only fact that is established beyond doubt after many decades of research. Several major questions are still without example in recent decades; see Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Fischer et al., 1996). First, what is the approximate size of the correlation between intelligence and success? Is it large enough to be of any practical importance? While so</context>

The raw data dummy has a highly significant negative effect on the correlation with education and a barely significant positive effect on the correlation with occupation. Therefore, it seems that the inclusion of raw data is more likely to introduce a downward (rather than upward) bias into the meta-analysis thus making the results conservative. 7. Discussion 7.1. Intelligence as a predictor of socioeconomic success Intelligence plays an influential and yet controversial role in people&amp;apos;s career (Gottfredson, 1997). In order to investigate this role, the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success was analyzed using meta-analytic techniques. The first aim of the paper was to estimate the strength of this relationship. The overall correlations were .56 (between intelligence and education), .43 (between intelligence and occupation), and .20 (between intelligence and income). Exclusion of the samples that were too old (over 18) at the time of testing or too young (below 30) at the measurement of success resulted in somewhat larger correlations: .56, .45, and .23, respectively.

The ideas of The Bell Curve have been severely criticized for a number of reasons. Fischer et al. (1996) argued that Herrnstein and Murray used an inappropriate measure of parental SES and, therefore, underestimated its importance. Hauser and Huang (1997) argued that the claim about the growing importance of intelligence is simply a misinterpretation of previous research. Other researchers have, however, supported the ideas of The Bell Curve (Gottfredson, 2003; Jensen, 1998) saying that its central claims have T. Strenze / Intelligbeen convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459).At the same time in Great Britain, a similar discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who, analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from Great Britain, found that intelligence is a better predictor of occupational attainment than is parental SES and concluded that England is, to a large extent, a meritocratic society (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999; Saunders, 1997, 2002).

According to the so-called gravitational hypothesis, the correlation between intelligence and success should grow stronger as individuals grow older because (as a result of selfselection and competition) individuals “gravitate” towards the positions that correspond to their ability levels as they progress in their careers. This reasoning has been used to support the idea that intellectual differences cumulate over life course and become progressively more important (see Gottfredson, 2003; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996). Other researchers have suggested that exactly the opposite is true: the predictive validity of IQ scores should decline as time goes by because less able people have time to accumulate skills to compensate for their initial lack of ability (Ackerman, 1987; Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001). These opposing views can be reconciled by saying that the idea of declining importance of IQ applies to the performance of specific tasks that become automatic after some practice and the idea of growing importance applies complex long term activities, such as attaining and maintaining social s</context>

This result confirms the ideas of the gravitational hypothesis about intellectual differences cumulating throughout life course leading people increasingly towards the social positions that correspond to their ability (Gottfredson, 2003). The fact that declining validity hypothesis (Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001) received no support for occupational and income attainment indicates that being successful in these areas is a complex activity that never ceases to be cognitively demanding. But as for educational attainment, the negative impact of age at success on the IQeducation correlation in Table 3 provides some support for the declining validity hypothesis and suggests that, in educational career, intellectual differences might indeed become somewhat less important as people get older.

The reviews by Hulin, Henry, and Noon (1990) and Keil and Cortina (2001) found support for the declining validity thesis but it should be noted that many of the studies reviewed in these papers used specific laboratory tasks as dependent variables and are, therefore, not directly comparable to the studies reviewed in the present paper. 4.3.3.

Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation between intelligence and success with the correlation between parental SES and success. To accomplish that, the present paper will include a meta-analysis of the relationship between the different aspects of parental SES (parental education, occupation, and income) and socioeconomic success. Research on this relationship is, of course, voluminous and several narrative and quantitative reviews of it are available (see Ganzeboom, Luijkx, &amp; Treiman, 1989; Haveman &amp; Wolf, 1995; Mulligan, 1999).

But it should be noted that other predictors, studied in this paper, are not doing any better in predicting income, which demonstrates that financial success is difficult to predict by any variable. This claim is further corroborated by the meta-analysis of Ng et al. (2005) where the best predictor of salary was educational level with a correlation of only .29. It should also be noted that the correlation of .23 is about the size of the average meta-analytic result in psychology (Hemphill, 2003) and cannot, therefore, be treated as insignificant. The second aim of the meta-analysis was to compare the predictive power of intelligence to the predictive power of other prominent predictors of success, parental SES and academic performance. Such comparisons are informative because different predictors represent different paths to a successful career: intelligence represents one&amp;apos;s general ability, parental SES represents the social advantages or disadvantages experienced by a person, and academic performance represents school-related learning and motivation.

Meta-analysis demonstrated that parental SES and academic performance are indeed positively related to career success but the predictive power of these variables is not stronger than that of intelligence (see Table 1). In fact, intelligence exhibited several correlations with the measures of success that were larger than the respective correlations for other predictors suggesting that intelligence is, after all, a better predictor of success. Still, the differences in favor of intelligence were not as overwhelming as one would have expected based on the results of Herrnstein and Murray (1994). The index of parental SES, arguably the most representative measure of social background, did not differ significantly from intelligence in its predictive power (see Table 1). The same is true about the predictive power of academic performance in relation to education and occupation. It has been observed before that meta-analyses typically do not provide support for extreme scientific positions (Lytton &amp; Romney, 1991). This is also true in the present case because the extreme positions favoring intelligence (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) or parental SES (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976) were not supporte</context>

Year of the measurement of success had no obvious effect on the corrected correlations (p) between intelligence and success in Table 2. The meta-regression analysis in Table 3 showed that there is a slight tendency for correlation between intelligence and education to increase over the years. This is the only bit of evidence there is to support the claims of Herrnstein and Murray (1994) about the growing importance of mental ability and increasing cognitive stratification. This evidence is rather weak in comparison with the much stronger declining trend exhibited by the correlation with occupation in Table 3. It would be difficult to come up with explanations why intelligence might have become more important with respect to one criterion and less important with respect to another. Therefore, the safest conclusion from Tables 2 and 3 seems to be that the correlation between intelligence and success has not changed in any consistent direction over the past decades.

Thus, the existence of an overall positive correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success is beyond doubt. But quite surprisingly, the mere existence of this correlation seems to be the only fact that is established beyond doubt after many decades of research. Several major questions are still without example in recent decades; see Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Fischer et al., 1996). First, what is the approximate size of the correlation between intelligence and success? Is it large enough to be of any practical importance? While some researchers have said that this correlation is “larger than most found in psychological research” (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004: 162), others are convinced that “IQ is just not an important enough determinant of economic success” (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 2002: 12). Second, how does the predictive power of intelligence compare to the predictive power of other variables, such as parental socioeconomic status (SES) or school grades? </context>

Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that considered several determinants of success at the same time (Duncan, 1968; Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp; Ohlendorf, 1970). But it was with the publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the question of intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to public attention. Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray found that intelligence is a better predictor of several desirable outcomes (e.g., not living in poverty, not being arrested) than is parental SES. They also found evidence that the role of intelligence in status attainment has been growing throughout the 20th century and concluded that the social structure of American society is increasingly based on mental ability. The ideas of The Bell Curve have been sev</context>

Intelligence versus parental SES The question about the relative importance of intelligence and parental SES in predicting success is one of the central questions of status attainment research. This is a question about the nature of the society we live in: whether a typical western society rewards people for their own abilities or their social background (Saunders, 1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a definite answer to this question. Some authors have found that intelligence outcompetes parental SES as a predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998; Saunders, 1997). Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a better predictor (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important aspects of parental status (most importantly, parental income) among the predictors (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation between intelligence </context>

It was one of the central claims of The Bell Curve that the association between mental ability and career success in western societies has been growing throughout the 20th century (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994). The logic behind this idea is similar to the gra406 T. Strenze / Intelligvitational hypothesis, discussed in the previous section –in both cases individuals are increasingly drawn towards the positions that correspond to their ability as time goes by – but in this case the gravitation does not take place during a life course of a single individual but over several generations. Several studies have investigated changes in the association between intelligence and success during past decades. Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded that “the main point seems beyond dispute” (1994: 52) and some</context>

The same is true about the predictive power of academic performance in relation to education and occupation.

A correlation with SES index was included in the present metaanalysis if the index was composed of the following components — parental education (education of one or both parents), parental occupation (occupation of one or both parents), and material well-being of the parental home. The latter was measured by parental income or by a “possession index” which indicates how many of the valued items (e.g., a car, TV set, computer) were present at home. If a study did not use an index of SES but presented intercorrelations among the necessary variables, then I used the formulas reported by Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 433) to calculate a composite score correlation between SES index and success. 5.1.4. Academic performance Academic performance was in most studies measured by a grade point average (GPA) obtained in high school or the years preceding high school. In some studies, rank in class (i.e., how well the student performed in comparison with other students in the class) was used instead of GPA. Rank is generally used interchangeably with GPA (see Kuncel, Crede, &amp; Thomas, 2005), therefore, these studies were also included. 5.2.

I could locate two studies (Bell, Senese, &amp; Elliott, 1984; Massagli &amp; Hauser, 1983) that provided reliability estimates from three samples. The estimates ranged from .45 to .59. with an average of .51 that was used in the present paper. The third source of information on parental SES is objective data (e.g., tax records of income) that was assumed to have a reliability of 1. Internal consistency method (Cronbach alpha) was used to correct for unreliability in the SES index. This method was recommended by Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 438) for composite variables. For all but two studies, the alpha value of the SES index was obtained from the same sample as the correlation itself. For the remaining two, the average alpha of all the other studies (.71) was used. 5.3.4. Academic performance If the information on academic performance (GPA or class rank) was obtained from school records, it was assumed to have a reliability of 1. Students&amp;apos; selfreports on their GPA or rank are, of course, not perfectly reliable.

(2001) reported that there is no time trend in the size of the coefficients between the years 1960 and 1995 and that the age of the sample at the time of ability testing has no effect on the results. The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. is a valuable contribution but it suffers from several shortcomings. First, it considered only one measure of success, income, thereby ignoring education and occupation. Second, the meta-analytic estimate of .15 was not derived from zero-order correlations as is usually required by the textbooks of meta-analysis (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 475) but from regression equations that included several predictors in addition to intelligence. Peterson and Brown (2005) have recently suggested that the use of partial effect sizes, instead of zero-order ones, does not affect the meta-analytic results very much but it is nevertheless obvious that the use of disparate studies makes the results difficult to interpret. Third, the metaanalysis of Bowles et al. was not based on independent samples.

In order to ascertain that every sample contributed only one correlation to one analysis, I averaged all the correlations that were derived from the same sample. If the sample sizes of the averaged correlations were different, mean sample size was used. The procedures for moderator analyses are described in Sections 6.3 and 6.4. 5.3. Correcting for unreliability Ideally, every correlation should be corrected with the reliability coefficients obtained from the same sample as the correlation that needs to be corrected (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004, chapter 3). However, such reliability coefficients were available for only a small minority of studies included in the present meta-analysis. The correlations from these studies were corrected with these reliability coefficients. But for the majority of studies, mean reliabilities (estimated from various sources, as described below) were used. Each study was then corrected individually with the appropriate reliability coefficient. The nature and sources of reliability information are described next. 5.3.1.

I also excluded the correlation if the range of one (or both) of the correlated variables was deliberately restricted by the research design. For example, in the study of gifted children by Terman and Oden (1947), the range of intelligence was severely restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs over 135; in the Polish study by Firkowska-Mankiewicz (2002), the range of intelligence was restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs below 86 or over 130. The correlations obtained from Fergusson, Horwood, and Ridder (2005) and Kuh and Wadsworth (1991) were the only ones that had to be c</context>

Because the sample sizes were highly variable (from 60 to 339,951 with a median of 518), weighting the correlations by sample size would allow the few very large studies to overly dominate the results. To prevent that, all the samples with the size over 7000 individuals (about 5% of the samples in this study) were set equal to 7000 for the weighting procedure. In order to estimate the variability of the correlations, the standard deviation of original correlations and corrected standard deviation of corrected correlations (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 126) were calculated. The 95% credibility intervals of sample size weighted corrected correlations were calculated to assess the presence of moderators. Moderators are present if the credibility intervals are large (over 0.11 according to Koslowsky &amp; Sagie, 1993) or include zero (see Whitener, 1990). Finally, 95% confidence intervals of the sample size weighted corrected correlations were calculated using the formula for heterogeneous studies (Whitener, 1990: 317). Confidence intervals can be used to assess the significance of the correlations (correlation is signifi5 (2007) 401–426cantly di</context>

Possible limitations and implications for future research Like all research, the present meta-analysis contains several limitations that can be amended in future research. One limitation concerns the metaanalytic database. Although the present meta-analysis is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive review of the longitudinal research on intelligence and socioeconomic success, it does not cover all the existing data. I am aware of several additional longitudinal data sets that contain information on intelligence and success but from which I have been unable to obtain necessary data (see Jæger &amp; Holm, 2003; Meghir &amp; Palme, 2005; Nyborg &amp; Jensen, 2001; Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1994). There are probably others. Efforts to collect information about the existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other scientific cultures.

A study by McCall (1977) found a clear upward trend in the correlations between intelligence and success; that is, correlations grew stronger as age at testing increased. Some of the studies reviewed by Jencks and Phillips (1999) have found a similar trend. The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. (2001), however, found that age at testing has no effect on the association between intelligence and income. Jencks et al. (1979) reached a similar conclusion in their review. 2 I am grateful to a reviewer for pointing this interpretation out to me. ence 34.3.2. Age at the measurement of success A related issue concerns the age of the individuals at the time their career success is measured. According to the so-called gravitational hypothesis, the correlation between intelligence and success should grow stronger as individuals grow older because (as a result of selfselection and competition) individuals “gravitate” towards the positions that correspond to their ability levels as they progress in their careers.

Several studies have investigated changes in the association between intelligence and success during past decades. Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded that “the main point seems beyond dispute” (1994: 52) and some studies have found support for this point (Murnane, Willett, &amp; Levy, 1995), there are still serious reasons to doubt that the importance of intelligence is or has been growing. Neither the meta-analysis by Bowles et al. (2001) nor the review by Jencks et al. (1979) found any clear trend in the correlations between intelligence and success. The same conclusion was reached by Flynn (2004) and Hauser and Huang (1997). Breen and Goldthorpe (2001) found that the association between intelligence and occupational status in England is, if anything, declining. 5. Method 5.1. Definition of variables The present meta-analysis investigated the relationship between three measures of socioeconomic success (educational level, occupational level, and income) and three predictors (intelligence, parental SES, and academic performance).

Intelligence versus academic performance The question about the relative importance of mental ability and academic performance in predicting success has also been recognized as important (see Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1999). It is a question of what really matters for career success: is it one&amp;apos;s general ability (as measured by IQ tests) or the things one has learned at school and motivation to learn (as measured by school grades)? Not many studies have explicitly compared the predictive power of IQ scores and school grades (e.g., Taubman &amp; Wales, 1974, chapter 3). But the more general question about the usefulness of grades as predictors of success has been the object of considerable debate (see Roth, BeVier, Switzer, &amp; Schippmann, 1996; Roth &amp; Clark, 1998).

Age at the time of testing The first moderator analysis concerns age at testing (age of individuals at the time the IQ test was taken) and how it affects the correlation between intelligence and success. Analysis of the effect of age at testing reveals something about the mechanism behind the intelligence–success correlation. If intelligence predicts success irrespective of the age at which it is measured, then there is reason to believe that the differences in people&amp;apos;s career success are the result of the stable individual differences measured by IQ tests (Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1999). If however, the predictive power of IQ tests changes with age, then different interpretations are possible depending on how we believe the test score to be affected by genes and environment. According to the standard sociological interpretation, the test scores of older individuals should be more affected by life experiences than the scores of children (because older individuals simply have had more experiences) and consequently, if intelligence tested at an older age should turn out to be a better predictor career success, then it would mean that the test scores probably reflect some career</context>

The early studies, however, did not consider other possible determinants of success, most importantly parental SES. Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that considered several determinants of success at the same time (Duncan, 1968; Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp; Ohlendorf, 1970). But it was with the publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the question of intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to public attention. Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray found that intelligence is a better predictor of several desirable outcomes (e.g., not living in poverty, not being arrested) than is parental SES. They also found evidence that the role of intelligence in status attainment has been growing throughout the 20th century and concluded that </context>

These conclusions were challenged by Breen and Goldthorpe (1999, 2001) who argued that Saunders greatly overestimated the importance of intelligence by using inappropriate analytic techniques. 3. Previous reviews There have been surprisingly few attempts to systematically review the literature on intelligence and socioeconomic success. Reviewers typically cite only a couple of studies (see e.g., Brody, 1997; Farkas, 2003; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Some of the most comprehensive reviews have been conducted by Jencks (see Jencks et al., 1972, 1979). Two meta-analyses have so far addressed the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. Both of them used income as a measure of success. The more comprehensive one of the two was conducted by Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001). They assembled 65 estimates from 24 studies to estimate the relationship between intelligence and income. The mean standardized regression coefficient of intelligence on income is .15 according to their study (p. 1154). In addition to that, Bowles et al. (2001) reported that there is no time trend in the size of the coefficients between the ye</context>

Although it is sometimes claimed in popular press and textbooks that intelligence has no relationship to important real-life outcomes (see Barrett &amp;Depinet, 1991, for a review of such claims), the scientific research on the topic leaves little doubt that people with higher scores on IQ tests are better educated, hold more prestigious occupations, and earn higher incomes than people with lower scores (Gottfredson, 1997, 2003; Jensen, 1980, 1998; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Thus, the existence of an overall positive correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success is beyond doubt. But quite surprisingly, the mere existence of this correlation seems to be the only fact that is established beyond doubt after many decades of research. Several major questions are still without example in recent decades; see Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Fischer et al., 1996). First, what is the approximate size of the correlation between intelligence and success? Is it large enough to be of any practical importance? While some researchers have </context>

Although some researchers have contended that achievement tests can also be treated as measures of general ability (Boudreau, Boswell, Judge, &amp; Bretz, 2001), and even everyday life can be interpreted as an IQ test (Gordon, 1997), the present study took a more conservative approach and included only those tests that are generally regarded as tests of intelligence (see e.g., Anastasi &amp; Urbina, 1997; Jensen, 1980, chapter 7, for a discussion and classification of different tests). There are numerous “classical” tests (e.g., Henmon– Nelson, Lorge–Thorndike, Otis–Lennon, Raven Progressive Matrices, Stanford–Binet, Wechsler tests) for which there seems to be a general consensus that these are indeed tests of general mental ability. Such multiple aptitude test batteries as Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery or General Aptitude Test Battery are also often treated as measures of general ability. The most problematic ones are the tests that are specifically constructed for use in a single data set. S</context>

But on the other hand, if we assume that the test scores of older individuals are more “contaminated” by genetic influences, then it would mean that genes make a contribution to this correlation. Yet another explanation would be that IQ scores of children are simply less reliable and the predictive validity of childhood IQ was, therefore, underestimated. But contrary to this explanation, preliminary examination of some evidence on the stability of intelligence among children (e.g., Burchinal, Campbell, Bryant, Wasik, &amp; Ramey, 1997; Jensen, 1980: 279) suggested that the test–retest coefficients among children below 10 are, on the whole, rather similar to the test–retest coefficients among older individuals.

Intelligence Intelligence, or general mental ability, of an individual was measured by a score on a test of intelligence. It is not always easy, however, to decide if a given test is a test of intelligence. The definitions of intelligence state that it is an abstract ability that is not tied to any specific domain of knowledge. Therefore, only the tests that are designed to measure such ability should be used in the meta-analysis. If we take the traditional threefold distinction between ability, aptitude, and achievement tests (Jensen, 1981), then the present study should use only ability and aptitude test scores.

The ideas of The Bell Curve have been severely criticized for a number of reasons. Fischer et al. (1996) argued that Herrnstein and Murray used an inappropriate measure of parental SES and, therefore, underestimated its importance. Hauser and Huang (1997) argued that the claim about the growing importance of intelligence is simply a misinterpretation of previous research. Other researchers have, however, supported the ideas of The Bell Curve (Gottfredson, 2003; Jensen, 1998) saying that its central claims have T. Strenze / Intelligbeen convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459).At the same time in Great Britain, a similar discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who, analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from Great Britain, found that intelligence is a better predictor of occupational attainment than is parental SES and concluded that England is, to a large extent, a meritocratic society (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999; Saunders, 1997, 2002).

This cannot be the only aim of the present meta-analysis because very few social scientists would doubt that there is a positive correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success. Having acknowledged that, the next logical question is: what is the approximate size of the correlation? Answers to this question are far from uniform. Take the correlation between intelligence and income: Jensen has suggested that it is somewhere around .40 (Jensen, 1998: 568) while Bowles et al. (2001) have found that it is only about .15. That is why the first aim of the present meta-analysis is to estimate the approximate sizes of the correlations between intelligence and measures of success. The importance of the correlations can be evaluated using Cohen&amp;apos;s classification scheme which classifies correlations as small if they are below .30, medium-sized if they are between .30 and .50, and large if they are over .50 (Cohen, 1988).

The fact that IQ scores predict socioeconomic success does not, in itself, tell us whether the effect of intelligence can be attributed to genes or environment. On the one hand, there is clear evidence that children&amp;apos;s IQ scores are correlated with parental SES (White, 1982), this result together with the fact that parental SES predicts socioeconomic success (see Table 1) can be interpreted as showing that environment is the “final cause” of one&amp;apos;s success or failure. This conclusion has been criticized for ignoring the genetic influences on parental SES (Jensen, 1998). On the other hand, the evidence on the heritability of intelligence (Devlin, Daniels, &amp; Roeder, 1997) and socioeconomic success (Rowe, Vesterdal, &amp; Rodgers, 1999) together with the evidence on the relationship between intelligence and success (see Table 1) can be taken as proof that parents&amp;apos; and children&amp;apos;s social status are both determined by the genes for intelligence that run in the family.

Intelligence When correcting for unreliability in the test scores, test–retest alternate-form reliability (the correlation between parallel forms of the same test administered on two separate occasions) is generally considered to be the most appropriate form of reliability (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1999). But since these coefficients are rarely available, simple test–retest reliability is often taken as the second best option in meta-analytic studies of the predictive power of IQ scores (Judge, Colbert, &amp; Ilies, 2004; Salgado, Anderson, Moscoso, Bertua, &amp; Fruyt, 2003). Because test–retest reliability coefficients were reported in only a few studies, an average test–retest coefficient, obtained from the meta-analysis of Salgado et al. (2003), was used for most of the studies. Salgado et al. averaged 31 test–retest correlations of different general mental ability tests (the mean interval between test and retest being 6 months) and obtained an average coefficient of .83. This value is similar to average test– retest correlations obtained in other reviews: e.g., .82 in Parker, Hanson, and Hunsley (1988) or .8</context>

Several studies have correlated intelligence with success at different points in people&amp;apos;s life course. Some of them have found that the correlations indeed increase with age as predicted by the gravitational hypothesis (Brown &amp; Reynolds, 1975; Deary et al., 2005; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996), others have found no clear trend (Hauser, Warren, Huang, &amp; Carter, 1996; Warren, Sheridan, &amp; Hauser, 2002). The reviews by Hulin, Henry, and Noon (1990) and Keil and Cortina (2001) found support for the declining validity thesis but it should be noted that many of the studies reviewed in these papers used specific laboratory tasks as dependent variables and are, therefore, not directly comparable to the studies reviewed in the present paper. 4.3.3.

This reasoning has been used to support the idea that intellectual differences cumulate over life course and become progressively more important (see Gottfredson, 2003; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996). Other researchers have suggested that exactly the opposite is true: the predictive validity of IQ scores should decline as time goes by because less able people have time to accumulate skills to compensate for their initial lack of ability (Ackerman, 1987; Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001). These opposing views can be reconciled by saying that the idea of declining importance of IQ applies to the performance of specific tasks that become automatic after some practice and the idea of growing importance applies complex long term activities, such as attaining and maintaining social status, that never cease to be cognitively demanding. But so far as socioeconomic success can depend on the performance of specific work tasks, the possibility of declining validity of IQ is not completely ruled out.

But as for educational attainment, the negative impact of age at success on the IQeducation correlation in Table 3 provides some support for the declining validity hypothesis and suggests that, in educational career, intellectual differences might indeed become somewhat less important as people get older.

The first row in every section of Table 1 presents the general results for intelligence as a predictor of success. The phrase “all studies” in parentheses indicates that all the studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria are included in these analyses. As expected, intelligence is positively correlated with education, occupation, and income; the sample size weighted and corrected correlations ( p) are .56, .43, and .20, respectively. The fact that the 95% credibility intervals exceed 0.11 suggests the presence of moderators according to Koslowsky and Sagie (1993). Comparing the three averages (r, rw, and p) in every row to one another demonstrates that weighting the correlations by sample size tends to reduce the average. This means that larger studies produced smaller correlations indicating in turn that smaller, and potentially less representative, samples 8 Note that these figures apply to the data sets that contain information on intelligence and success.

To prevent that, all the samples with the size over 7000 individuals (about 5% of the samples in this study) were set equal to 7000 for the weighting procedure. In order to estimate the variability of the correlations, the standard deviation of original correlations and corrected standard deviation of corrected correlations (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 126) were calculated. The 95% credibility intervals of sample size weighted corrected correlations were calculated to assess the presence of moderators. Moderators are present if the credibility intervals are large (over 0.11 according to Koslowsky &amp; Sagie, 1993) or include zero (see Whitener, 1990). Finally, 95% confidence intervals of the sample size weighted corrected correlations were calculated using the formula for heterogeneous studies (Whitener, 1990: 317). Confidence intervals can be used to assess the significance of the correlations (correlation is signifi5 (2007) 401–426cantly different from zero if the confidence intervals do not include zero) as well as to compare correlations (according to a simple and conservative rule of thumb, two correlations are significantly different from one T.

I also excluded the correlation if the range of one (or both) of the correlated variables was deliberately restricted by the research design. For example, in the study of gifted children by Terman and Oden (1947), the range of intelligence was severely restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs over 135; in the Polish study by Firkowska-Mankiewicz (2002), the range of intelligence was restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs below 86 or over 130. The correlations obtained from Fergusson, Horwood, and Ridder (2005) and Kuh and Wadsworth (1991) were the only ones that had to be corrected for dichotomization. 5.5.

Students&amp;apos; selfreports on their GPA or rank are, of course, not perfectly reliable.

First, the present study used only three measures of social background (parental education, occupation, and income) and therefore, could have underestimated its importance. Although these three have always been the central indicators of social advantages, several additional measures of social background could have an independent effect on career success (Fischer et al., 1996). Future metaanalyses could, therefore, benefit from considering other variables, such as neighborhood quality (Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000), number of siblings (Blake, 1989), or parental divorce (Amato &amp; Keith, 1991), to get a more comprehensive picture T. Strenze / Intelligof the effects of social background. Second, the useof grade point average and class rank as the only measures of academic performance can be criticized for ignoring between-school differences; i.e., the same average grade or rank can have different meanings in different schools depending on the quality of the schools (Bassiri &amp; Schulz, 2003).

The third source of information on parental SES is objective data (e.g., tax records of income) that was assumed to have a reliability of 1. Internal consistency method (Cronbach alpha) was used to correct for unreliability in the SES index. This method was recommended by Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 438) for composite variables.

A brief history Longitudinal studies on the relationship between intelligence and career success have been conducted since the first decades of the 20th century (Ball, 1938; Thorndike et al., 1934). And these studies have invariably uncovered a positive relationship. The early studies, however, did not consider other possible determinants of success, most importantly parental SES. Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that considered several determinants of success at the same time (Duncan, 1968; Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp; Ohlendorf, 1970). But it was with the publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the question of intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to public attention. Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray found that intellige</context>
<context citStr="McClelland, 1973" endWordPosition="4154" position="20644" startWordPosition="4153">ts) or the things one has learned at school and motivation to learn (as measured by school grades)? Not many studies have explicitly compared the predictive power of IQ scores and school grades (e.g., Taubman &amp; Wales, 1974, chapter 3). But the more general question about the usefulness of grades as predictors of success has been the object of considerable debate (see Roth, BeVier, Switzer, &amp; Schippmann, 1996; Roth &amp; Clark, 1998). The meta-analysis by Roth and Clark (1998), for instance, found an average correlation of .28 between grades and salary. Thus, contrary to some earlier claims (e.g., McClelland, 1973), grades have turned out to be good predictors of success. This literature is somewhat limited by being almost exclusively restricted to college grades. If the purpose is to compare grades and IQ test scores as predictors of career success, then high school grades would be a better choice because college students constitute a rather selected group that does not represent the full range of career attainments in society. High school grades have been meta-analytically related to job performance (Dye &amp; Reck, 1988) and college grades (Robbins et al., 2004) but there is currently no meta-analysis ab</context>

The reasonable conclusion is rather modest: while intelligence is one of the central 4155 (2007) 401–426determinants of one&amp;apos;s socioeconomic success, parental ence 3SES and academic performance also play an important role in the process of status attainment. Despite the modest conclusion, these results are important because they falsify a claim often made by the critics of the “testing movement”: that the positive relationship between intelligence and success is just the effect of parental SES or academic performance influencing them both (see Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; Fischer et al., 1996; McClelland, 1973). If the correlation between intelligence and success was a mere byproduct of the causal effect of parental SES or academic performance, then parental SES and academic performance should have outcompeted intelligence as predictors of success; but this was clearly not so. These results confirm that intelligence is an independent causal force among the determinants of success; in other words, the fact that intelligent people are successful is not completely explainable by the fact that intelligent people have wealthy parents and are doing better at school.

One limitation concerns the metaanalytic database. Although the present meta-analysis is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive review of the longitudinal research on intelligence and socioeconomic success, it does not cover all the existing data. I am aware of several additional longitudinal data sets that contain information on intelligence and success but from which I have been unable to obtain necessary data (see Jæger &amp; Holm, 2003; Meghir &amp; Palme, 2005; Nyborg &amp; Jensen, 2001; Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1994). There are probably others. Efforts to collect information about the existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been studied in conti</context>

Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation between intelligence and success with the correlation between parental SES and success. To accomplish that, the present paper will include a meta-analysis of the relationship between the different aspects of parental SES (parental education, occupation, and income) and socioeconomic success. Research on this relationship is, of course, voluminous and several narrative and quantitative reviews of it are available (see Ganzeboom, Luijkx, &amp; Treiman, 1989; Haveman &amp; Wolf, 1995; Mulligan, 1999). Ganzeboom et al.

Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded that “the main point seems beyond dispute” (1994: 52) and some studies have found support for this point (Murnane, Willett, &amp; Levy, 1995), there are still serious reasons to doubt that the importance of intelligence is or has been growing.

Intelligence versus parental SES The question about the relative importance of intelligence and parental SES in predicting success is one of the central questions of status attainment research. This is a question about the nature of the society we live in: whether a typical western society rewards people for their own abilities or their social background (Saunders, 1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a definite answer to this question. Some authors have found that intelligence outcompetes parental SES as a predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998; Saunders, 1997). Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a better predictor (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important aspects of parental status (most importantly, parental income) among the predictors (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996).

Fourth, their meta-analysis mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The distinction between cross-sectional and longitudinal study design is vital in the present context because only the latter can answer questions about the causal impact of intelligence on career success. Another, more recent, meta-analysis was conducted by Ng, Eby, Sorensen, and Feldman (2005) who collected 8 studies and found an average correlation of .27 between intelligence and salary. The meta-analysis of Ng et al. (2005) was, unlike the one by Bowles et al., based on zero-order correlations and avoided the use of non-independent samples but it failed to separate crosssectional and longitudinal studies. 4. Topics addressed in the present paper 4.1. The size of the correlation between intelligence and success Meta-analyses are often conducted with the aim to determine if a statistical relationship between two variables is significantly different from zero. This cannot be the only aim of the present meta-analysis because very few social scientists would doubt that there is a positive correlation between intellig</context>

Two of the correlations – with education and occupation – are of substantial magnitude according to the usual standards of social science (Cohen, 1988); the correlation with education even surpasses the wellestablished correlation of .51 between intelligence and T. Strenze / Intelligjob performance (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998). Thecorrelation with income is considerably lower, perhaps even disappointingly low, being about the average of the previous meta-analytic estimates (.15 by Bowles et al., 2001; and .27 by Ng et al., 2005). But it should be noted that other predictors, studied in this paper, are not doing any better in predicting income, which demonstrates that financial success is difficult to predict by any variable. This claim is further corroborated by the meta-analysis of Ng et al. (2005) where the best predictor of salary was educational level with a correlation of only .29. It should also be noted that the correlation of .23 is about the size of the average meta-analytic result in psychology (Hemphill, 2003) and cannot, therefore, be treated as insignificant. The second aim of the meta-analysis was to co</context>

The ideas of The Bell Curve have been severely criticized for a number of reasons. Fischer et al. (1996) argued that Herrnstein and Murray used an inappropriate measure of parental SES and, therefore, underestimated its importance. Hauser and Huang (1997) argued that the claim about the growing importance of intelligence is simply a misinterpretation of previous research. Other researchers have, however, supported the ideas of The Bell Curve (Gottfredson, 2003; Jensen, 1998) saying that its central claims have T. Strenze / Intelligbeen convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459).At the same time in Great Britain, a similar discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who, analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from Great Britain, found that intelligence is a better predictor of occupational attainment than is parental SES and concluded that England is, to a large extent, a meritocratic society (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999; Saunders, 1997, 2002). These conclusions were challenged by Breen and Goldthorpe (1999, 2001) who argued that Saunders greatly overestimated the importance of intelligence by using inappropriate analytic techniques. 3.

One limitation concerns the metaanalytic database. Although the present meta-analysis is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive review of the longitudinal research on intelligence and socioeconomic success, it does not cover all the existing data. I am aware of several additional longitudinal data sets that contain information on intelligence and success but from which I have been unable to obtain necessary data (see Jæger &amp; Holm, 2003; Meghir &amp; Palme, 2005; Nyborg &amp; Jensen, 2001; Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1994). There are probably others. Efforts to collect information about the existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been studied in continental Europe (see e.g.</context>

The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. is a valuable contribution but it suffers from several shortcomings. First, it considered only one measure of success, income, thereby ignoring education and occupation. Second, the meta-analytic estimate of .15 was not derived from zero-order correlations as is usually required by the textbooks of meta-analysis (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 475) but from regression equations that included several predictors in addition to intelligence. Peterson and Brown (2005) have recently suggested that the use of partial effect sizes, instead of zero-order ones, does not affect the meta-analytic results very much but it is nevertheless obvious that the use of disparate studies makes the results difficult to interpret. Third, the metaanalysis of Bowles et al. was not based on independent samples. The authors stated that they used 65 estimates 4035 (2007) 401–426from 24 studies (p. 1154) but neither of these figures ence 3represents the number of independent samples.

Thus, contrary to some earlier claims (e.g., McClelland, 1973), grades have turned out to be good predictors of success. This literature is somewhat limited by being almost exclusively restricted to college grades. If the purpose is to compare grades and IQ test scores as predictors of career success, then high school grades would be a better choice because college students constitute a rather selected group that does not represent the full range of career attainments in society. High school grades have been meta-analytically related to job performance (Dye &amp; Reck, 1988) and college grades (Robbins et al., 2004) but there is currently no meta-analysis about the relationship between high school grades and general socioeconomic success (as measured by education, occupation, and income). The present paper will, thus, conduct such a meta-analysis. 4.3. Moderators of the correlation between intelligence and success In order to further clarify the role of intelligence in people&amp;apos;s career, the effects of three moderator variables 1 Ganzeboom et al.

In order to take account of this possibility, I conducted multiple linear regression analyses using the moderator variables as independent variables and the correlations between intelligence and measures of success as dependent variables. Such meta-regression analysis is a common meta-analytic tool (see Ganzeboom et al., 1989; Robbins et al., 2004). The analyses that follow differ from the preceding moderator analyses in an important respect: in order to use all the available information, I gave up the requirement of independent data and included all the available correlations. If mental ability or socioeconomic success was measured repeatedly for the same sample, then all the correlations were included making it possible for one sample to contribute more than one correlation to the analysis.10 Naturally, this strategy results in some samples providing much more correlations than others.

It is a question of what really matters for career success: is it one&amp;apos;s general ability (as measured by IQ tests) or the things one has learned at school and motivation to learn (as measured by school grades)? Not many studies have explicitly compared the predictive power of IQ scores and school grades (e.g., Taubman &amp; Wales, 1974, chapter 3). But the more general question about the usefulness of grades as predictors of success has been the object of considerable debate (see Roth, BeVier, Switzer, &amp; Schippmann, 1996; Roth &amp; Clark, 1998). The meta-analysis by Roth and Clark (1998), for instance, found an average correlation of .28 between grades and salary. Thus, contrary to some earlier claims (e.g., McClelland, 1973), grades have turned out to be good predictors of success. This literature is somewhat limited by being almost exclusively restricted to college grades. If the purpose is to compare grades and IQ test scores as predictors of career success, then high school grades would be a better choice because college students constitute a rather selected group that does not represent the full range of ca</context>

On the one hand, there is clear evidence that children&amp;apos;s IQ scores are correlated with parental SES (White, 1982), this result together with the fact that parental SES predicts socioeconomic success (see Table 1) can be interpreted as showing that environment is the “final cause” of one&amp;apos;s success or failure. This conclusion has been criticized for ignoring the genetic influences on parental SES (Jensen, 1998). On the other hand, the evidence on the heritability of intelligence (Devlin, Daniels, &amp; Roeder, 1997) and socioeconomic success (Rowe, Vesterdal, &amp; Rodgers, 1999) together with the evidence on the relationship between intelligence and success (see Table 1) can be taken as proof that parents&amp;apos; and children&amp;apos;s social status are both determined by the genes for intelligence that run in the family. This conclusion has been challenged by Bowles and Gintis (2002) who argued that, although socioeconomic success might be heritable, the genetic inheritance of IQ, in particular, plays only a very minor part in this process.

It is, therefore, appropriate to limit the current meta-analysis to representative studies and exclude the studies that exhibit signs of considerable range restriction.6 More specifically, I excluded the studies that sampled only (a) college students or individuals with a college degree (e.g., Eckland, 1965), (b) employees of a single organization (e.g., Dreher &amp; Bretz, 1991), or (c) representatives of one specific occupational group (such as engineers or managers; see e.g., Sackett, Gruys, &amp; Ellingson, 1998).7 These criteria exclude much of the personnel selection research, which is the kind of research where the problem of range restriction is particularly serious (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004). I also excluded the correlation if the range of one (or both) of the correlated variables was deliberately restricted by the research design. For example, in the study of gifted children by Terman and Oden (1947), the range of intelligence was severely restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs over 135; in the Polish study by Firkowska-Mankiewicz (2002), the range of intelligence was restricted by </context>

Strenze / Intelligbeen convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459).At the same time in Great Britain, a similar discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who, analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from Great Britain, found that intelligence is a better predictor of occupational attainment than is parental SES and concluded that England is, to a large extent, a meritocratic society (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999; Saunders, 1997, 2002). These conclusions were challenged by Breen and Goldthorpe (1999, 2001) who argued that Saunders greatly overestimated the importance of intelligence by using inappropriate analytic techniques. 3. Previous reviews There have been surprisingly few attempts to systematically review the literature on intelligence and socioeconomic success. Reviewers typically cite only a couple of studies (see e.g., Brody, 1997; Farkas, 2003; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004).

Including them in this paper will, consequently, allow us to better evaluate the role of intelligence in people&amp;apos;s career. 4.2.1. Intelligence versus parental SES The question about the relative importance of intelligence and parental SES in predicting success is one of the central questions of status attainment research. This is a question about the nature of the society we live in: whether a typical western society rewards people for their own abilities or their social background (Saunders, 1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a definite answer to this question. Some authors have found that intelligence outcompetes parental SES as a predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998; Saunders, 1997). Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a better predictor (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important aspects of parenta</context>

One limitation concerns the metaanalytic database. Although the present meta-analysis is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive review of the longitudinal research on intelligence and socioeconomic success, it does not cover all the existing data. I am aware of several additional longitudinal data sets that contain information on intelligence and success but from which I have been unable to obtain necessary data (see Jæger &amp; Holm, 2003; Meghir &amp; Palme, 2005; Nyborg &amp; Jensen, 2001; Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1994). There are probably others. Efforts to collect information about the existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been studied in continental Europe (see e.g., Flynn, 1987; Sternberg,</context>

These results demonstrate that intelligence, when it is measured before most individuals have finished their schooling, is a powerful predictor of career success 12 or more years later when most individuals have already entered stable careers. Two of the correlations – with education and occupation – are of substantial magnitude according to the usual standards of social science (Cohen, 1988); the correlation with education even surpasses the wellestablished correlation of .51 between intelligence and T.

Thecorrelation with income is considerably lower, perhaps even disappointingly low, being about the average of the previous meta-analytic estimates (.15 by Bowles et al., 2001; and .27 by Ng et al., 2005). But it should be noted that other predictors, studied in this paper, are not doing any better in predicting income, which demonstrates that financial success is difficult to predict by any variable.

Intelligence When correcting for unreliability in the test scores, test–retest alternate-form reliability (the correlation between parallel forms of the same test administered on two separate occasions) is generally considered to be the most appropriate form of reliability (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1999). But since these coefficients are rarely available, simple test–retest reliability is often taken as the second best option in meta-analytic studies of the predictive power of IQ scores (Judge, Colbert, &amp; Ilies, 2004; Salgado, Anderson, Moscoso, Bertua, &amp; Fruyt, 2003). Because test–retest reliability coefficients were reported in only a few studies, an average test–retest coefficient, obtained from the meta-analysis of Salgado et al.

Although it is sometimes claimed in popular press and textbooks that intelligence has no relationship to important real-life outcomes (see Barrett &amp;Depinet, 1991, for a review of such claims), the scientific research on the topic leaves little doubt that people with higher scores on IQ tests are better educated, hold more prestigious occupations, and earn higher incomes than people with lower scores (Gottfredson, 1997, 2003; Jensen, 1980, 1998; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Thus, the existence of an overall positive correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success is beyond doubt. But quite surprisingly, the mere existence of this correlation seems to be the only fact that is established beyond doubt after many decades of research. Several major questions are still without example in recent decades; see Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Fischer et al., 1996). First, what is the approximate size of the correlation between intelligence and success? Is it large enough to be of any practical importance?

Such unique tests have been used in several large and influential data sets (e.g., National Child Development Study, National Longitudinal Survey of High School Class 1972, Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Project Talent). In these cases I consulted the manuals of the data sets and studies that are based on the data. If the test was derived from other IQ tests or if it was described as a test of intelligence, then I included it in my study. Studies using well-known achievement tests, such as Iowa Test of Basic Skills (Smokowski, Mann, Reynolds, &amp; Fraser, 2004), were excluded. The names of all the IQ tests used in this paper are listed in the Appendix. 5.1.3. Parental SES Five measures of parental socioeconomic status (SES) were used in this paper; the first four were father&amp;apos;s education, mother&amp;apos;s education, father&amp;apos;s occupation, and parental income. The measurement of these variables was similar to the measurement of responT. Strenze / Intelligdent&amp;apos;s own education, occupation, and income (seeabove).

Efforts to collect information about the existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been studied in continental Europe (see e.g., Flynn, 1987; Sternberg, 2004; Weinert &amp; Schneider, 1999) but I have not been able to find suitable data for the present study. The present study can also be criticized for underestimating the importance of the predictors of success; arguments can be offered for any of the three predictors (intelligence, parental SES, or academic performance) as to why their importance was underestimated. First, the present study used only three measures of social background (parental education, occupation, and income) and therefore, could have underestimated its importance.

Intelligence versus academic performance The question about the relative importance of mental ability and academic performance in predicting success has also been recognized as important (see Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1999). It is a question of what really matters for career success: is it one&amp;apos;s general ability (as measured by IQ tests) or the things one has learned at school and motivation to learn (as measured by school grades)? Not many studies have explicitly compared the predictive power of IQ scores and school grades (e.g., Taubman &amp; Wales, 1974, chapter 3). But the more general question about the usefulness of grades as predictors of success has been the object of considerable debate (see Roth, BeVier, Switzer, &amp; Schippmann, 1996; Roth &amp; Clark, 1998). The meta-analysis by Roth and Clark (1998), for instance, found an average correlation of .28 between grades and salary. Thus, contrary to some earlier claims (e.g., McClelland, 1973), grades have turned out to be good predictors of success. This literature is somewhat limited by being almost exclusively restricted to college grades. If the purpose is to compare grades and IQ test scor</context>

The present paper will address these questions by conducting a meta-analysis of the longitudinal research on the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. I will concentrate on longitudinal studies (where intelligence is measured before the actual success) because only longitudinal research design allows us to make conclusions about the possible causal impact of intelligence on success. 2. A brief history Longitudinal studies on the relationship between intelligence and career success have been conducted since the first decades of the 20th century (Ball, 1938; Thorndike et al., 1934). And these studies have invariably uncovered a positive relationship. The early studies, however, did not consider other possible determinants of success, most importantly parental SES. Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that considered several deter</context>

Intelligence versus parental SES The question about the relative importance of intelligence and parental SES in predicting success is one of the central questions of status attainment research. This is a question about the nature of the society we live in: whether a typical western society rewards people for their own abilities or their social background (Saunders, 1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a definite answer to this question. Some authors have found that intelligence outcompetes parental SES as a predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998; Saunders, 1997). Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a better predictor (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important aspects of parental status (most </context>

But so far as socioeconomic success can depend on the performance of specific work tasks, the possibility of declining validity of IQ is not completely ruled out. Several studies have correlated intelligence with success at different points in people&amp;apos;s life course. Some of them have found that the correlations indeed increase with age as predicted by the gravitational hypothesis (Brown &amp; Reynolds, 1975; Deary et al., 2005; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996), others have found no clear trend (Hauser, Warren, Huang, &amp; Carter, 1996; Warren, Sheridan, &amp; Hauser, 2002). The reviews by Hulin, Henry, and Noon (1990) and Keil and Cortina (2001) found support for the declining validity thesis but it should be noted that many of the studies reviewed in these papers used specific laboratory tasks as dependent variables and are, therefore, not directly comparable to the studies reviewed in the present paper. 4.3.3.

Efforts to collect information about the existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been studied in continental Europe (see e.g., Flynn, 1987; Sternberg, 2004; Weinert &amp; Schneider, 1999) but I have not been able to find suitable data for the present study. The present study can also be criticized for underestimating the importance of the predictors of success; arguments can be offered for any of the three predictors (intelligence, parental SES, or academic performance) as to why their importance was underestimated. First, the present study used only three measures of social background (parental education, occupation, and income) and therefore, could have underestimated its importance. Although these three have always been the central indicators of social advantages, several a</context>

Parental income refers to father&amp;apos;s income or total income of parents. Because too few studies reported data on mother&amp;apos;s occupation, this variable was not included. In addition to these four, I also used a general index of SES, which combines several parental characteristics into one variable. A number of studies have used a composite index on the assumption that it is a better indicator of social advantages than any of the single variables that make up the index and, therefore, also a better predictor of success (see White, 1982, for supporting evidence). A correlation with SES index was included in the present metaanalysis if the index was composed of the following components — parental education (education of one or both parents), parental occupation (occupation of one or both parents), and material well-being of the parental home. The latter was measured by parental income or by a “possession index” which indicates how many of the valued items (e.g., a car, TV set, computer) were present at home. If a study did not use an index of SES but presented intercorrelations among the necessary variables, then I used the f</context>

As a possible limitation and implication for future research, it should also be noted that one of the big questions that looms behind every paper that deals with intelligence and success, the question of genetic versus environmental influences on IQ and social status, was not directly addressed in this paper. The fact that IQ scores predict socioeconomic success does not, in itself, tell us whether the effect of intelligence can be attributed to genes or environment. On the one hand, there is clear evidence that children&amp;apos;s IQ scores are correlated with parental SES (White, 1982), this result together with the fact that parental SES predicts socioeconomic success (see Table 1) can be interpreted as showing that environment is the “final cause” of one&amp;apos;s success or failure. This conclusion has been criticized for ignoring the genetic influences on parental SES (Jensen, 1998). On the other hand, the evidence on the heritability of intelligence (Devlin, Daniels, &amp; Roeder, 1997) and socioeconomic success (Rowe, Vesterdal, &amp; Rodgers, 1999) together with the evidence on the relationship between intelligence and success (see Table 1) can be taken as proof that parents&amp;apos; and ch</context>

In order to estimate the variability of the correlations, the standard deviation of original correlations and corrected standard deviation of corrected correlations (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 126) were calculated. The 95% credibility intervals of sample size weighted corrected correlations were calculated to assess the presence of moderators. Moderators are present if the credibility intervals are large (over 0.11 according to Koslowsky &amp; Sagie, 1993) or include zero (see Whitener, 1990). Finally, 95% confidence intervals of the sample size weighted corrected correlations were calculated using the formula for heterogeneous studies (Whitener, 1990: 317). Confidence intervals can be used to assess the significance of the correlations (correlation is signifi5 (2007) 401–426cantly different from zero if the confidence intervals do not include zero) as well as to compare correlations (according to a simple and conservative rule of thumb, two correlations are significantly different from one T.

According to the so-called gravitational hypothesis, the correlation between intelligence and success should grow stronger as individuals grow older because (as a result of selfselection and competition) individuals “gravitate” towards the positions that correspond to their ability levels as they progress in their careers. This reasoning has been used to support the idea that intellectual differences cumulate over life course and become progressively more important (see Gottfredson, 2003; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996). Other researchers have suggested that exactly the opposite is true: the predictive validity of IQ scores should decline as time goes by because less able people have time to accumulate skills to compensate for their initial lack of ability (Ackerman, 1987; Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001). These opposing views can be reconciled by saying that the idea of declining importance of IQ applies to the performance of specific tasks that become automatic after some practice and the idea of growing importance applies complex long term activities, such as attaining and maintaining social status, that never cease</context>
