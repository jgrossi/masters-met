			<abstract>
				<p>The processing of facial identity and emotion in schizophrenia and its relation with these patients' cognitive and social functioning has been extensively studied over the last 25 years. In this paper, the results of 32 studies indexed in the PubMed database and published between 2001 and 2005 are analyzed and synthesized. Following the description of the problem and presentation of current hypotheses, methodological aspects and findings concerning the processing of facial emotion and identity are discussed. The analysis shows that, despite the growing attention dedicated to the theme and the provision of more specific results, the question of dependence/ independence between the two processes-emotion and identity recognition-and between these and the pervasive cognitive deficits found in schizophrenia remains unanswered.</p>

In spite of these negative results, most of the studies (84.4%) found differences in the processing of facial emotion in schizophrenics. With the development of the research in the field, the results of these studies may be analyzed separately, according to their specificity. Schizophrenia, cognition and social functioning A study involving samples of schizophrenic patients with single and multiple episodes found that the recognition of facial emotion correlates with social and cognitive functioning in schizophrenia (Addington, Saeedi, &amp; Addington, 2006). Additionally, other studies showed that men and women are differentially impaired in social contact, with males being the most affected (Hooker &amp; Park, 2002; Scholten et al., 2005). This difference between genders, also observed in healthy people, remains unchanged in schizophrenia. Results show that the impairment in emotion recognition may be related to cognitive deficits in different domains such as verbal memory, language processing and attention (Combs &amp; Gouvier, 2004; Bozikas et al., 2004; Sachs et al., 2004).

In practice, schizophrenics do not ‘see’ the face as healthy people do, fixating more on peripheral and less important zones than on the facial features that transmit information about identity. Curiously, an attenuated form of these abnormal patterns was also observed in first-degree relatives of schizophrenic patients. The results of two other studies lie within an intermediate zone, indicating that schizophrenic patients have problems in the performance of affect matching tasks in different facial identities (Baudouin, Martin, Tiberghien, Verlut, &amp; Franck, 2002; Martin, Baudouin, Tiberghien, &amp; Franck, 2005). The proposed explanation is that these individuals’ inability to disregard irrelevant information for the execution of the task is correlated with negative symptoms.

Such a complex ability to decode important facial information in the environment, emotional or identityrelated, will rely on the harmonic functioning of strategies learned throughout development and the neural systems underlying the processing of facial information. Identity and emotion Though apparently indistinct at first sight, evidence suggests that the processing of facial identity and facial affect relies on diverse and interconnected, systems.

Besides identity, the structural features of the face still transmit information on the individual’s gender and age, participating in the regulation of a broader social contact. The dynamic features of the face refer to the multiple possibilities of organization of the face’s internal elements (eyes, mouth, eyebrows, etc.) as to create different facial expressions, indicators of the emotional context elicited by the environment. The importance of the face in human interaction has drawn the attention of researchers for over a century. Darwin (1872) carried out a deep study on affect manifestations in humans and animals, suggesting that facial expressions represent innate and automatic behavioral patterns. According to this idea, it is reasonable to suppose that the human capacity to quickly and precisely decode facial expressions such as fear, for instance, has been selected throughout evolution due to its adaptive value.

With the development of the research in the field, the results of these studies may be analyzed separately, according to their specificity. Schizophrenia, cognition and social functioning A study involving samples of schizophrenic patients with single and multiple episodes found that the recognition of facial emotion correlates with social and cognitive functioning in schizophrenia (Addington, Saeedi, &amp; Addington, 2006). Additionally, other studies showed that men and women are differentially impaired in social contact, with males being the most affected (Hooker &amp; Park, 2002; Scholten et al., 2005). This difference between genders, also observed in healthy people, remains unchanged in schizophrenia. Results show that the impairment in emotion recognition may be related to cognitive deficits in different domains such as verbal memory, language processing and attention (Combs &amp; Gouvier, 2004; Bozikas et al., 2004; Sachs et al., 2004). Martin et al.

According to this idea, it is reasonable to suppose that the human capacity to quickly and precisely decode facial expressions such as fear, for instance, has been selected throughout evolution due to its adaptive value. Following Darwin’s steps, other researchers found evidence that led them to propose that facial expressions are automatic representations derived from the individual’s emotional experience. Hence, the informative value of such expressions is not their essential function, but a secondary effect of an internal and individual emotional experience (Izard &amp; Malatesta, 1987; Ekman, 1997). In contrast, Blair (2003) suggests that facial expressions of emotion mainly serve a communicational purpose, where the individual can transmit information on the emotional valence of objects and situations to observers of the same species. Therefore, the conditions for an emotional representation require not only an emotional event, but also a potential observer. Consistent with this, empirical evidence suggests that emotional expressions are not the automatic result of an internal emotional condition, but depend on the social context or even on the deliberate action of the pe</context>

Given the small number of participants in each condition, specific information on gender and age are unimportant. Tasks A series of differences among the experimental designs adopted by each study was observed. Most authors adopted tasks specifically developed for their studies, despite the existence of consolidated tasks to evaluate facial information processing [e.g. Benton Facial Recognition Test (BFRT – Benton, Hamsher, Varney &amp; Spreen, 1983), Kinney’s Affect Matching Task (KAMT – Kinney, 1995)]. The different tasks used may be divided into four general categories, according to their requirements: 1) Emotion recognition: labeling of facial emotions using predefined categories or subjective judgment. 2) Emotion discrimination: response based on emotional face presented previously or simultaneously to a target stimulus. 3) Emotional intensity determination: response based on differences of emotional intensity represented in the stimulus. Stimuli The same diversity in the tasks chosen was observed in the stimuli that were used. The most used stimuli (9 studies) were, as expected, the s</context>

All the 32 studies investigated facial affect recognition, but only 50% also investigated non-emotional aspects, included in the category “identity.” Among the 16 studies that investigated identity processing, seven (43.75%) found no differences between schizophrenics and healthy controls in this function. Schizophrenic patients with and without hearing impairment and healthy controls did not differ in BFRT performance (Kubota et al., 2003). The same procedure and results were found in a study by Scholten, Aleman, Montagne and Kahn (2005), comparing facial recognition abilities in male and female schizophrenics. Gur et al. (2002), using an age estimation paradigm, also failed to find differences between a group of patients and healthy controls.

In that condition the individual is unable to identify familiar faces, resorting to other clues (voice, gestures, etc.) in order to recognize people. Despite such impairment, however, the capacity to interpret facial emotions may remain perfectly healthy in these individuals. Besides prosopagnosia, which refers more specifically to the dysfunction in face identification, several studies have also supplied evidence of impaired facial emotion recognition in psychiatric conditions such as depression, social phobia, panic </context>

Pathology and facial information processing Despite the above proposition that the human ability to decode faces is innate and results from successful adaptation, that ability likely improves after birth, throughout the developmental process. Additionally facial decoding may be subject to the same risks of failure observed in other cognitive and neuropsychological functions. Part of the healthy development of facial information processing involves the capacity to modulate and respond properly to the environment’s social requirements. Saarni (1984) observed that facial disappointment expressed by a young child who receives a poorer than expected gift is much more easily perceived than the same feeling expressed by an older child.

This difference between genders, also observed in healthy people, remains unchanged in schizophrenia. Results show that the impairment in emotion recognition may be related to cognitive deficits in different domains such as verbal memory, language processing and attention (Combs &amp; Gouvier, 2004; Bozikas et al., 2004; Sachs et al., 2004). Martin et al.

In this study, patients had problems matching photographs of the same emotion represented by distinct facial identities.

(2006) found no differences in emotional intensity judgments using a six-point Likert scale. Comparing patients with their first-degree relatives and healthy controls, Bölte and Poustka (2003), found similar performance in all three groups. Gur et al.

Lastly, Baudouin at al. (2002) propose that variations in emotional expressions do not affect the recognition of facial identity. In spite of these negative results, most of the studies (84.4%) found differences in the processing of facial emotion in schizophrenics.
