speculation about the reasons for sex differences in careers in science and
mathematics, we present a consensus statement that is based on the best available
scientific evidence. Sex differences in science and math achievement and ability are
smaller for the mid-range of the abilities distribution than they are for those with
the highest levels of achievement and ability. Males are more variable on most
measures of quantitative and visuospatial ability, which necessarily results in more
males at both high- and low-ability extremes; the reasons why males are often more
variable remain elusive. Successful careers in math and science require many types of
cognitive abilities. Females tend to excel in verbal abilities, with large
differences between females and males found when assessments include writing samples.
High-level achievement in science and math requires the ability to communicate
effectively and comprehend abstract ideas, so the female advantage in writing should
be helpful in all academic domains. Males outperform females on most measures of
visuospatial abilities, which have been implicated as contributing to sex differences
on standardized exams in mathematics and science. An evolutionary account of sex
differences in mathematics and science supports the conclusion that, although sex
differences in math and science performance have not directly evolved, they could be
indirectly related to differences in interests and specific brain and cognitive
systems. We review the brain basis for sex differences in science and mathematics,
describe consistent effects, and identify numerous possible correlates. Experience
alters brain structures and functioning, so causal statements about brain differences
and success in math and science are circular. A wide range of sociocultural forces
contribute to sex differences in mathematics and<component x="45.01" y="112.83"

biological factors, educational policy, and cultural context affect the number of
women and men who pursue advanced study in science and math and that these effects
add and interact in complex ways. There are no single or simple answers to the
complex questions about sex differences in science and mathematics.<component

(2003) sounded an alarm about critical workforce shortages in jobs that require
high-level mathematical and science skills. Their fears about a dwindling pool of
mathematicians and scientists has fueled concern that the United States will not be
able to maintain its leadership in science and technology, which translates directly
to an inability to fill positions that are essential to homeland security. A similar
call to arms had been made by leading economists, who warned that the shortage of
workers with science and math skills is dampening our economic growth and posing a
major threat to our economic well-being. In the 2000 Biennial Report to the United
States Congress (Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering, 2000,
section 5), experts predicted that the overall rise in employment opportunities in
the coming decade would be around 14%, with employment opportunities in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (commonly abbreviated STEM) expected to
increase by over 50%. Despite the serious need for a workforce with high-level skills
in science and mathematics, data from the National Science Foundation show that
''Women made up almost one-fourth (24 percent) of the [science and engineering]
workforce but close to one-half (46 percent) of the U.S. workforce, in 1999''
(National Science Foundation, 2002b). Making fuller use of the female talent pool
could go a long way toward addressing workforce shortages. Women are also
underrepresented in academic positions at research universities, especially in
science and mathematics. A recent review found that women in science, engineering,
and technology are less likely to obtain tenure (29% of women compared to 58% of men
in full-time, ranked academic positions at 4-year colleges) and are less likely to
achieve the rank of full professor (23% of women compared to 50% of men; Ginther
&amp; Kahn, 2006). Why are women underrepresented in high-level careers in math and
science? Questions about sex differences in the cognitive abilities needed for
success in science and mathematics have a long history in scientific psychology.
Helen Bradford Thompson's The Mental Traits (later Woolley) 1903 doctoral
dissertation, of the Sexes , began with this sentence: ''The object of the present
monograph is to furnish some accurate information on the muchdiscussed question of
the psychology of the sexes'' (p. 1). Thompson's carefully controlled comparisons of
males and females on various ''intellectual faculties'' is a perfect introduction to
many of the underlying assumptions in explanations that were offered over the ensuing
century for the unequal outcomes for men and women in academic careers in mathematics
and science. It shows both how much and how little the science of sex differences has
advanced in the last 100 years. Thompson had almost no empirical work to build upon,
whereas contemporary psychologists have an extensive base of empirical studies to
inform our conclusions; yet, in many ways, we are still asking the same basic
questions. In this report, we present a summary of what is known about sex
differences in mathematics and science achievement and abilities based on a review
and evaluation of the best available scientific evidence. The topic of unequal
outcomes for men and women in science and math areas in academia was brought to the
consciousness of the general public a few years ago, when Lawrence Summers (2005),
then president of Harvard University, remarked publicly on these discrepancies. He
offered three possible explanations for the low percentage of women in academic
positions in science in mathematics. He raised the possibility that women are
unwilling to reduce their time with family to work the long hours required to achieve
the status of high-level academic scientists, which requires a near total commitment
to one's work. He rhetorically asked, ''Who wants to do high-powered intense work?''
Summers also discussed the possibility that sex-related differences in socialization
or discrimination during hiring or promotion could be barriers to female success in
science, mathematics, and engineering, but he said he did not believe that these
mechanisms contributed much to keeping women as minorities in these fields. His main
hypothesis focused on the finding that there are many fewer females than males at the
upper end of advanced mathematical achievement and ability tests, which led him to
infer that fewer females than males have the ''innate ability'' to succeed in
academic disciplines that require advanced mathematical abilities. Summers reasoned
that it was the scarcity of females with exceptional mathematical talent that
explains the disparate ratios of females and males in mathematics, engineering, and
the natural sciences. Psychological Science in the Public Interest This issue of was
organized in direct response to the heated controversies generated by Summers'
remarks. There is a large research literature on the topic of whether and when (in
the life span) there are differences between females and males in cognitive abilities
needed for successful careers in STEM. The research literature directly addresses
questions about the extent to which sex differences can be attributed to ''innate''
explanations, socialization, or the way these two types of influences reciprocally
affect each other. Questions about the ways in which males and females differ are
controversial because conclusions may have implications for public policies and for
the way people think about education, career choices, and ''natural'' roles for males
and females in society. We recognize that all social-science research is conducted in
a cultural context that influences the nature of the questions that may be asked and
the evidence that is accepted as valid. Science can never be free of all biases, but
it is the best method available for finding answers to politically charged questions.
In addressing questions about sex differences in mathematics and science, we rely on
findings that have been replicated and on the relative transparency of the scientific
method. We also recognize that science is a cumulative process, so that the
conclusions that are drawn today may change as additional data are collected over
time, as society and people change, and as our understanding of the phenomena being
studied evolves.<component x="303.02" y="65.44" width="246.09" height="297.94"

report to describe constructs and the way we discuss and explain results are
important in conveying our understanding of controversial phenomena. We do not want
to become enmeshed in cultural struggles over ''correct'' terminology. Thus, we first
clarify our usage of terms. Sex and Gender sex One area of contention concerns the
use of the terms and gender sex . Some authors prefer to refer to biological
distinctions gender between people, such as genitals and chromosomes, and to refer to
those male and female differences that are thought to arise from social or
environmental influences. On one side of this issue, there are psychologists who
believe that using the term ''gender differences'' in research that compares females
and males is preferable because it does not imply the origin of the differences or it
conveys a more pro-nurture origin (Caplan &amp; Caplan, 2005); other authors, writing
in outlets such as the National Women's Studies Association Journal , have suggested
sex that the distinction between and gendermay have outlived its usefulness, because
biology cannot be separated from its cultural influences and the continued use of two
separate terms perpetuates the westernized view of mind-body dualism (Severin &amp;
Wyer, 2000). Those who oppose the restrictive use of sex for biological distinctions
and genderfor social or environmental ones further note that the dichotomy is often
artificial. When studying cognitive abilities, it is extremely difficult to separate
biological influences from environmental ones because the two influences are
reciprocal. Halpern (2000, 2004) and others have advocated a biopsychosocial model
(sometimes called a psychobiosocial model) that emphasizes the complex influences of
biological and social/environmental variables on cognitive abilities. Consider, for
example, brain development. As we describe in a later section, there are differences
between female and male brains that are influenced initially by prenatal hormones and
later by other hormones over the course of life, but human brain development is also
altered by life experiences, including the prenatal environment. Similarly,
high-performing students report that the subjects they like the most in school
correspond to the academic disciplines in which they achieve high scores on
standardized tests of knowledge and ability. Not surprisingly, they engage in more
activities that relate to areas that they like (e.g., reading, math clubs, science
competitions), thus further increasing their knowledge and abilities in these areas
(reviewed in Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2007). It is difficult to know whether high
ability leads to increased interest and additional activities in an academic domain
or whether high interest in an academic domain and engaging in activities that
develop expertise in that domain lead to high ability. The distinction between sex
and gender is entangled in the debate about what is biologically determined and what
is environmentally determined. For these reasons, we have chosen- sex perhaps
arbitrarily but for the sake of clarity-to use the term throughout our report.
Biological and Innate biological Terms like andinnate are often misunderstood. Humans
are both biological and social beings shaped by the complex interaction of biology
and environment. When psychologists use innate the term , they are referring to a
potential that is ''ready'' for development in a supportive environment. Innatedoes
not mean immutable or unchangeable. Hormones, for example, are chemicals, secreted by
endocrine glands, that affect a wide variety of behaviors and brain development, yet
hormonal secretions change in response to environmental events such as social
victories or defeats (Schultheiss et al., 2005). Learning is both a biological and an
environmental process, and the brain remains plastic into very old age, changing in
response to learning and environmental events. Abilities and Achievement Abilities
achievement and are terms used in assessment, and although they are theoretically
different, in practice they are often difficult to separate. An achievement test is a
test of what an individual knows at a particular time. A high score on an achievement
test in calculus, for example, is interpreted to mean that the test taker learned
calculus and was willing and able to demonstrate that learning by solving the
problems on the test. Achievement tests are usually written to reflect a curriculum.
Two people could have the same low score on a mathematics achievement test and differ
widely in their mathematical ability. One of these individuals could have had several
years of mathematics instruction and learned very little and the other could have had
no mathematics instruction. Ability is a more abstract construct; ability tests
assess an individual's likelihood to benefit from instruction or, alternatively, how
much instruction might be needed to reach a level of competence. Although the term
abilityconnotes a ''raw'' or undeveloped talent, ability assessments usually test
content information that was taught in school (except for projects that identify
precocious talent). Unfortunately, one cannot measure ability without also measuring
achievement to some extent, so the distinction between these two constructs is
somewhat blurred. We use the term abilityas it was defined by Fleishman (1972): a
general trait of an individual that is the product of learning and development. (Some
psychologists have suggested abilities that the term be replaced with more neutral
terms like skills performance or ; Sherman, 1977.) Humans are born with innate
abilities, such as the ability to learn a language, but the language they learn, if
any, depends largely on their experience. Similarly, they are born with the innate
ability to count and discern quantities, but how they develop those abilities depends
on their environment and learning experiences. Abilities are developed in supportive
environments. In this report, we shall refer to abilities in this broad and
environmentally dependent way. Intelligence and IQ Intelligence is another abstract
construct in assessment. It is usually summarized with a single score known as IQ,
which stands for ''intelligence quotient.'' It was originally derived from a quotient
that included an individual's test score divided by the score that would be obtained
by an average person of the same age (then multiplied by 100 so average scores at any
age are 100). The most commonly used intelligence tests have been designed so that
there are no overall sex differences in IQ scores (Brody, 1992). When items are
selected for inclusion in standardized intelligence tests, items that show an
advantage for either males or females are either discarded during test construction
or balanced with items that show an equal advantage for the other sex. Hence,
overall, there are no sex differences in IQ scores for the most commonly used tests.
Thus, we cannot turn to standardized intelligence tests to determine if there is a
''smarter sex.'' The Grade-Test Disparity In general, females receive higher grades
in school in every subject, including mathematics and science, so the question is not
whether females can learn advanced concepts in mathematics and science; class grades
show that they can and do (Dwyer &amp; Johnson, 1997; Kimball, 1989). Women
constitute a substantial majority of college enrollments in the United States and
many other countries. American women have received more college degrees than men
every year since 1982, with the female advantage widening every year. Among women
between 25 and 34 years old, 33% have completed college, compared to 29% of men (Bae,
Choy, Geddes, Sable, &amp; Snyder, 2000). Despite these successes, females score
significantly lower on many (though not all) ''high stakes'' standardized tests used
for admissions to college and graduate school, including both the Verbal and
Mathematics sections of the SAT (previously called the Scholastic Aptitude Test) and
the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Females also score lower than males, on
average, in science and mathematics when the tests are not closely related to
material that has been taught in school (despite getting higher grades in
school-based exams), and males and females participate in different subfields of
mathematics and science at different rates (Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997). Thus, there
is a grade-test disparity in successful achievement in mathematics and science for
males and females, with females achieving better grades in school and males achieving
higher scores on tests designed for admissions to colleges, universities, and
graduate programs. A corollary of this discrepancy is the finding that standardized
tests slightly underpredict college and graduate school performance for women and
overpredict performance for men (Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997). There are many laws of
cognitive psychology that are as certain as the law of gravity. Here is one: All
cognitive abilities will improve with learning and practice. This is the reason we
have schools: to provide instruction in math, science, and the other STEM areas and
abilities covered in this review. Even when we conclude that there are meaningful
differences between males and females, this conclusion leaves open the possibility
that the performance gap could be narrowed or closed with appropriate instruction,
just as it could be widened. Ceci and Papierno (2005) make the point that
interventions often widen achievement gaps between groups because higher-ability
groups can usually achieve greater gains than lower-ability groups can. The questions
addressed in this report are about two groups of females and males, those with
average abilities and those at the highest ability levels, and the possible origins
of the differences within and between these two groups. We are not addressing the
question of whether males and females are similar or different in their mathematics
and science abilities and achievement levels, because the answer is that males and
females are both similar and different. The similarities between males and females
are so numerous and obvious that we tend to overlook them and take them for granted.
We need to heed the caveats that the overemphasis on studies of differences can
distort the countless findings of ''no significant differences'' that routinely are
ignored or unreported. Hyde (2005) has reviewed numerous areas of research on sex
differences among females and males of average ability and concluded that ''males and
females are similar on most, but not all, psychological variables'' (p. 581). There
are many critical research-design issues to consider when evaluating research on sex
differences in math and science abilities, but most critical is the inability to ever
''prove'' the null hypothesis that there is no difference between any groups using
standard research methods. So when differences are not found, we are careful to avoid
conclusions that would affirm the null hypothesis, although we can rely on aggregate
analyses across multiple studies to decide if an effect size or average group
difference is large enough to be meaningful in real-world contexts. The Size of an
Effect When researchers say ''males are better at X'' or ''females are better at Y,''
it is important to know the magnitude of the difference claimed. If a nationally
normed vocabulary test showed that females scored statistically significantly higher
than males, this result might sound impressive, but what if it turned out to mean
that, on average, females know 1.5 more vocabulary words than males? Such a small
difference might be statistically but not practically meaningful. How many words, on
average, would the difference need to be before it became meaningful? There are
statistical formulas for computing effect sizes, but deciding when a difference is
large enough to be important in everyday life is a matter of judgment, and reasonable
people often disagree. There are several statistical ways to present the size of the
difference between two (or more) groups. Because we are often comparing results among
several studies in which the dependent variables (what is measured) could be test
scores like the SATs, reaction time to respond to a target, or accuracy in
responding, a common metric is needed. The most widely used measure d is (Cohen,
1977): ( ( rffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi X X (
m f d&#xBC; 2 2 SD SD &#xFE; m f 2 ( ( X X is the mean for the female group and is
the mean for where f m the male group, and SD and SD are the respective standard f m
deviations for females and males. Either group mean could be subtracted from the
other, but when females are subtracted from males, positive values indicate a ''male
advantage,'' and d negative values indicate a ''female advantage.'' Thus, provides a
measure of how far apart the means of the two distributions d are in standard
deviation units. The value of can range from 0-meaning no difference was found
between the means for the groups being compared-to values as large as 2 or 3 (or -2
to -3, which signify the same distance between the means as the positive values).
Large values mean that there is very little overlap in scores between the two groups.
There is no theoretical d limit to the size of , but practically .8 is generally
considered a large difference. Any value of dcan be mathematically converted into a
correlation or another indicator of percentage of ''explained variance'' (Rosenthal,
Rosnow, &amp; Rubin, 2000). It is important to understand effect sizes, because they
are often used to label a difference between males and females as large or small.
Rosenthal et al. (2000) weighed in on this critical matter: d ''Mechanically labeling
. . . s automatically as small medium, , large and can lead to later difficulties.
The reason is that small even effects can turn out to be practically important'' (pp.
15-16). According to Rosenthal and Rubin (1982), an effect that accounts for only 4%
of the variance (variability among scores) is associated with a difference of 60%
versus 40% of a group's performance above average; for example, on a test designed
such that an individual must attain at least an average score to qualify for
admission to a graduate program, then, with this effect size, 60% of one group and
40% of the other group would qualify. Thus, although effect sizes may sometimes seem
''small,'' they can have substantial real-world consequences. In Valian's (1998)
analysis of females' slow advancement in academia and other professions, she showed
how smaller disparities were compounded over time to create larger ones, so the
seemingly small 4% of variance accounted for can be meaningful, depending on the
context and variable being assessed. Meta-analyses are used to assess effect sizes
across multiple studies. As the term suggests, a meta-analysis is an analysis of
previous analyses, or an analysis of many individual research results. The need for
meta-analysis is obvious in a research area in which the size of the literature can
be measured in linear yards or pounds of paper generated. Meaningful integrations of
research findings are the best way to interpret the voluminous literature.
Meta-analysis allows us to take a broad overview in summarizing research results
(Hyde &amp; Linn, 1988).<component x="321.05" y="276.51" width="246.04"

differences in mathematical and science achievements is really a set of embedded
questions, because the answer depends on (a) which mathematical and science
achievements are studied, (b) how those achievements are assessed, (c) when in the
life span they are assessed, (d) which portion of the achievement/ability
distribution is investigated, and (e) the context in which achievement is assessed.
The majority of the literature on sex differences in mathematics and science has
investigated differences in three different, broadly defined, but core cognitive
abilities: verbal, visuospatial, and quantitative abilities (e.g., Carroll, 1992;
Snow &amp; Lohman, 1989). These types of abilities are linked in various ways,
because they are used together and, sometimes, compensate for each other. All are
necessary in learning and doing science and mathematics. Terms like verbal
visuospatial,, andquantitativeare category headings used to organize and study
cognition. They are not unitary constructs. Verbal abilities for example, apply to
all the components of language usage, including skills like word fluency, grammar,
spelling, reading, vocabulary, verbal analogies, and language comprehension. Verbal
abilities also apply to tasks used by cognitive psychologists in laboratory settings,
such as tasks measuring speed of lexical access, a reaction-time measure usually
reported in fractions of a second, or those measuring working-memory span, such as
the number of items an individual can maintain in memory while also engaged in a
verbal processing task (e.g., a task of verbal reasoning). Examples of items used to
assess verbal abilities include tasks such as (a) choosing which in a group of words
are most nearly the same in meaning, (b) solving verbal analogies, (c) answering
questions about complex passages just read (reading comprehension), (d) answering
simple grammar questions, and (e) writing in response to prompts or other
instructions. These tasks do not tap the same skills even though they all involve
language, and males and females do not differ in the same way on all of these
measures. Thus, different combinations of these measures give different answers to
the question about sex differences in verbal abilities. Visuospatial abilities are
also not unitary. In a recent review of the literature, Halpern and Collaer (2005)
described the multiple components of visuospatial information processing, including
the many different combinations of retrieval from long-term memory; the generation,
maintenance, transformation, and scanning of images; and the interplay among verbal,
spatial, and pictorial mental representations. Visuospatial abilities are central to
the work of architects, chemists, dentists, designers, artists, engineers,
decorators, mechanics, taxi drivers, and many other professions. All of these fields
rely heavily on the ability to maintain a visual image while simultaneously deciding
what it would look like if it were viewed from another perspective, moved to another
location, moved through space at various speeds, or physically altered in some way.
Quantitative abilities are also heterogeneous. Consider the differences among tasks
like simple rote multiplication, word problems, and other more advanced mathematical
tasks (some of which are visuospatial in nature) like calculus, topology, and
geometry. Although the initial impetus for this review was the comment by Lawrence
Summers, former president of Harvard, about the innate abilities of females to be
scientists or professors of science, there are no ''science abilities'' per se. The
cognitiveabilities literature lists different hierarchically organized abilities,
which usually include verbal abilities; quantitative abilities; visuospatial
abilities; and some combination of perceptual speed, mechanical reasoning (which
often shares variance with visuospatial abilities), general reasoning, working
memory, and other abilities (e.g., Carroll, 1993). The abilities needed for success
in advanced and academic science are diverse and include verbal and social abilities
such as communicating clearly, comprehending complex texts, working with people,
writing journal articles and books, persuading granting agencies to fund one's work,
attracting graduate students, and functioning in a bureaucratic structure (usually a
university or other large institution); visuospatial abilities in imaging data and
models and translating words to visuospatial formats; and mathematical abilities in
solving equations and modeling scientific phenomena with mathematical properties.
''Science'' is a rubric for domains that use a common method of inquiry- similar in
this regard to ''history'' or ''literature,'' which are not thought of as cognitive
abilities.<component x="45.01" y="65.44" width="246.05" height="184.95" page="5"

of scientists and mathematicians- not just the ones seen in the media accepting the
highest prizes in their disciplines. Society needs people with a broad range of
skills to advance and support the fields of science and math. On average, do males
and females differ in the skills and abilities needed to pursue careers in these
complex disciplines? We begin to answer that question by first looking at average
differences early in development, then examining mean differences during later stages
of development and in the development of excellence in math and science. Cognitive
Sex Differences in Infancy Psychologists often look for sex differences very early in
life as clues to the relative contribution of biological and environmental factors.
The reasoning is that newborns have had fewer social interactions, so the earlier
that sex differences are reliably found, the more likely they may be assumed to be
biological in origin. It does not necessarily follow, however, that differences found
later in life are caused by social or environmental factors, because there are
developmental timelines for biological processes, including the timing of puberty,
the development of the forebrain, and the aging processes, all of which are also
influenced by the environment. And the assumption about early sex differences
reflecting biological differences may be questionable itself. Across species it is
common for there to be few sex differences early in life, even when substantial
differences emerge with reproductive maturation (Darwin, 1871). It may seem
impossible to assess cognitive abilities in newborns, but psychologists who study
cognitive development in infants have developed a variety of techniques to infer
when, in early life, babies comprehend language, maintain a persisting mental
representation of objects (memory), show interest in people and objects, make
inferences about the paths of motion and rates of speed of moving objects, have basic
''number sense,'' and understand that an adult who looks at an object is likely to
reach for it (Kotovsky &amp; Baillargeon, 1998; Phillips, Wellman, &amp; Spelke,
2002; Xu, Spelke, &amp; Goodard, 2005). The usual finding, from many studies
conducted by many researchers in different laboratories and across a range of tasks,
is that boys and girls develop early cognitive skills relating to quantitative
thinking and knowledge of objects in the environment equally well (Spelke, 2005). It
usually requires very large samples to detect differences in infancy or the toddler
years. For example, a study with over 3,000 2-year-old twins found that girls scored
significantly higher than boys ( p&lt;.0001) on measures of both verbal and nonverbal
cognitive ability, but sex accounted for only 3% of the variance in verbal ability
and 1% of the variance in nonverbal ability (Galsworthy, Dionne, Dale, &amp; Plomin,
2000).<component x="62.99" y="427.2" width="246.09" height="122.19" page="6"

abilities are essential for success in mathematics and science, given the densely
written technical articles to comprehend, the need for clear communication skills,
and the general language demands found in any advanced field of learning, even if
they differ somewhat in qualitative ways from those that might be required in the
humanities. Verbal abilities comprise different components, and the size of the sex
differences between males and females is not the same across all of them. Based on a
review of 24 large data sets (including several large representative samples of U.S.
students, working adults, and military personnel), Willingham and Cole (1997)
concluded that differences are small in the elementary school grades, with only
writing, language use, and reading having &gt; d .2, favoring females at fourth
grade. In the United States, by the end of high school, the largest differences,
again favoring d females, are found for writing ( between .5 and .6) and language d
usage ( between .4 and .5). In a report published by the U.S. Department of Education
(Bae et al., 2000), titled ''Trends in Educational Equity of Girls and Women,'' the
data on reading and writing achievement are described this way: ''Females have
consistently outperformed males in writing achievement at the 4th, 8th, and 11th
grade levels between 1988 and 1996. Differences in male and female writing
achievement were relatively large. The writing scores of female 8th graders were
comparable with those of 11th grade males'' (p. 18). In a meta-analytic review of the
research literature, Hedges and Nowell (1995) reported that ''the large sex
differences in writing . . . are alarming. The data imply that males are, on average,
at a rather profound disadvantage in the performance of this basic skill'' (p. 45).
Thus, the advantage for females on tests of writing is large and robust by the middle
to end of secondary school. If an assessment of verbal abilities is heavily weighted
with writing, and language-usage items cover topics that females are familiar with,
sex differences favoring females will be much larger than they will be in an
assessment of verbal abilities lacking these components. This is the case in the
review of sex differences in a recently published review conducted in the United
Kingdom (Strand, Deary, &amp; Smith, 2006). The SAT-Verbal (SAT-V) test has (up
through 2004) contained many verbalanalogy questions-a question type that is
conceptually closer to mapping relationships than it is to other types of verbal
usage, and one that often shows an advantage to males. Therefore, it is not
surprising that the SAT-V test, despite being labeled a ''verbal'' test, does not tap
the same verbal abilities as do tests of writing or other language areas in which
females excel; nor is it surprising that males score higher than females on the SAT-V
test. The female advantage in several specific verbal abilities, such as reading, is
international. The data in Figure 1 were taken from the Progress in International
Reading Literacy Study of 2001 (Mullis, Martin, Gonzalez, &amp; Kennedy, 2003; Ogle
et al., 2003). Fourth-grade females scored higher than fourth-grade males in every
participating country. The advantage for females in reading literacy is replicated
and is comparable in size for 15-year-olds in each of the 25 countries that
participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (National Center for
Education Statistics, 2002; data not shown). Similar to sex differences in verbal
abilities, sex differences in memory depend on the type of memory system examined.
Most psychologists divide memory into qualitatively different subsystems, with two
broad major classifications: working (or short-term) memory and long-term memory.
Long-term memory is further divided into multiple types, one of which is episodic
memory, or memory for events that are personally experienced and recalled with
information about time and place. Given the female advantage on some verbal
abilities, it might be expected that they also are better able than males to describe
personal memories. In a recent review of the literature, Herlitz and Rehnman (2007)
summarized multiple studies showing that females are better at episodic-memory tasks
than males are. For example, they describe a large population-based study of adults
(35-80 years old) in which sex differences were found on episodic-memory tasks that
required participants to remember previously presented words, objects, or activities
(Herlitz, &#xA8; Nilsson, &amp; Backman, 1997). Across multiple studies, differences
between men and women on such tasks are typically small &#xA8; to medium sized (e.g.,
Herlitz, Airaksinen, &amp; Nordstrom, 1999). There is also an advantage for females
in the ability to recognize faces, and this difference is found across the age span
with both children and adults (e.g., Lewin &amp; Herlitz, 2002; Lewin, Wolgers, &amp;
Herlitz, 2001). Perhaps the most surprising finding is that girls and women are most
accurate when recognizing female faces-their own sex bias. This ability of girls and
women to recognize female faces better than male faces and to perform better than
males on all measures of face recognition has been replicated cross-culturally.
Herlitz and Rehman attribute these results to differential attention paid by females
to female faces. These findings provide ancillary support for the hypothesis that
females are more ''people oriented'' than males are and thus choose careers and
courses of study, such as teaching and social work, that involve greater social
interaction, instead of careers that are more ''thing oriented,'' such as physics and
engineering (Lippa, 1998). Variability in Verbal Abilities In Strand et al.'s (2006)
sample of over 320,000 students aged 11 to 12 years, there was a greater percentage
of females in the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th stanines than males on the
verbal-abilities test that they used. (Stanines are standard scores indicating which
1/9 of a sample from a normal or bell-shaped population contains certain scores. A
score in the 1st stanine is among the lowest 4% of all scores and a score in the 9th
stanine is among the highest 4% of all scores; the 5th stanine corresponds to the
middle portion of scores and comprises 20% of all scores.) The female mean was higher
than the male mean, which explains the finding that there were more females in the
upper tail. Thus, differences in mean scores between females and males and/or
differences in variability will result in disproportionately more females or males in
the upper tail of a distribution, with the advantage going to the group with the
higher mean, greater variability, or both. The 2006 SAT data for college-bound
seniors on the writing test show a similar pattern. The female mean was higher than
the male mean (502 vs. 491) for the writing test, with 58.7% of the top 1% of all
test takers being female. The 2006 SAT data for college-bound seniors in the (new)
test of Critical Reading show a different pattern. The male mean is slightly higher
than the female mean (505 vs. 502), but 53.04% of test takers in the top 1% are
female, which runs counter to the usual conclusion that males are more variable in
all cognitiveability domains. The males in Strand et al.'s sample were more variable
on the quantitative and nonverbal reasoning ability tests, and the SAT data for
college-bound seniors for the math test showed that males are more variable in math,
suggesting that the male-variability hypothesis-or a higher proportion of males in
the upper tail-extends across multiple measures of quantitative abilities but not to
all cognitive-ability tests. Visuospatial Abilities A large body of research
conducted over the last 25 years has revealed substantial sex differences for some,
but not all, of the measures that reflect visuospatial information processing. These
differences begin to emerge around the time children enter kindergarten or begin
first grade, which may be as early as children can reliably perform tasks that assess
visuospatial abilities. The preschool literature on sex differences in spatial skills
was reviewed by Levine, Huttenlocher, Taylor, and Langrock (1999). They found that,
on average, preschool boys are more accurate than girls at spatial tasks 5 d that
measure accuracy of spatial transformations ( .31) and score higher on the Mazes
subtest of the Wechsler Preschool d5 and Primary Scale of Intelligence ( .30). They
concluded that sex differences in favor of boys are present on spatial tasks by 1 age
4 . 2 There is a large research literature on visuospatial tasks with young adults
(i.e., college students). Effect sizes vary considerably with the type of task,
ranging from small and fragile (i.e., not worth talking about, although still
favoring males when an effect size is found; e.g., Voyer, Voyer, &amp; Bryden, 1995)
for a commonly used task that involves imagining what a folded paper would look like
if it had a hole punched in it and then was unfolded-a fairly simple task-to larger
and more robust effects. Results using tasks that require generating an image and
maintaining it in memory while ''working'' on it (i.e., mentally folding and
unfolding it) vary depending on the complexity of the image to be generated and the
specific nature of the task, with 5 d observed differences that range between d5.63
and .77 (Loring-Meier &amp; Halpern, 1999). Mental rotation tasks that require
maintaining a three-dimensional figure in working memory while simultaneously
transforming it show very large sex differences, somewhere between .9 to 1.0 standard
deviations (Masters &amp; Sanders, 1993; Nordvik &amp; Amponsah, 1998), although some
researchers have reported smaller effect sizes (Voyer et al., 1995). The largest
differences are probably found with spatiotemporal tasks (judgments about moving
objects), but there are not enough studies with spatiotemporal tasks to allow a
reliable estimate of the effect size (Law, Pelligrino, &amp; Hunt, 1993). For
example, studies that used ''time to collision'' estimates that also involve
spatiotemporal abilities found that males made more accurate estimates (McLeod, &amp;
Ross, 1983). Similar results were found with a Chinese sample that made
time-tocollision estimates under varying conditions. The authors concluded that males
were better than females in judgment accuracy with this task (Liu, &amp; Huang,
1999). Thus, although the number of studies that examined spatiotemporal abilities is
small, results consistently point to a male advantage. An example of a mental
rotation task is shown in Figure 2. The task for the participant is to determine if
the two figures labeled A and the two figures labeled B could be made identical by
rotating them in space. Visuospatial Skills and Computer Games With the meteoric rise
of online games, there has been a great deal of interest in navigating through
virtual space. The popularity of online learning has led to the creation of a large
number of online simulations of real-world events in which learners can ''practice''
a wide variety of tasks, such as surgery or navigating through unknown territory in
preparation for military excursions (Macedonia, 2002; Wrobel, 2005). The 3-D virtual
environment literature consistently shows that males outperform females (e.g.,
Cutmore, Hine, Maberly, Langford, &amp; Grant, 2000), although some accommodations,
such as very large displays, can reduce or eliminate this effect (Tan, Czerwinsk,
&amp; Robertson, 2006). The results with virtual environments parallel those that are
often found in real-world way-finding tasks. An important variable in such tasks
involves the use of maps. In one study, participants were given a map that they were
to use to give directions to a stranger (L.N. Brown, Lahar, &amp; Mosley, 1998).
Males were generally more accurate than females in the directions that they gave, and
males were also more likely to use compass headings (North, South, East, West) when
giving directions; females used landmarks more often when giving directions. This
study, like many others, suggests that when women learn a route, either from a map or
from direct experience, they tend to rely on landmarks to find their way, whereas men
are more likely to attend to and keep track of the compass direction in which they
are traveling (Lawton, 1994). Similarly, when adults learned a route from a map, the
men made fewer errors in getting to a destination, but the women had better recall
for landmarks along the way (Galea &amp; Kimura, 1993). Visuospatial Abilities and
Mathematics It has been suggested that certain visuospatial sex differences
contribute to observed sex differences in some aspects of mathematical performance.
For example, Casey, Nuttall, Pezaris, and Benbow (1995) found that the sex difference
on the Mathematics portion of the SAT (SAT-M) was eliminated in several samples when
the effects of mental rotation ability were statistically removed. This suggests that
rotational skill may mediate the sex differences in certain high-level mathematical
abilities or, at the least, that these two abilities tend to covary. Linkage of
mathematical and visuospatial skill has important consequences, because high levels
of both of these skills are required for careers in fields such as physics and
engineering in which women are typically underrepresented. However, the precise
relation between these variables is complex, varying with the specific visuospatial
and mathematical measures considered (Tartre, 1990). In addition, these two variables
appear to be more strongly linked in females than males, suggesting that females may
be particularly hampered in mathematical domains if they have reduced visuospatial
skill. Quantitative Abilities Of all of the sex differences in cognitive abilities,
differences in quantitative abilities have received the most media attention because
of the large sex differences at the highest end of the distribution among those who
take the SAT-M test and other high-stakes mathematics tests. Differences depend on
the portion of the distribution that is examined, and because males are more variable
in quantitative and visuospatial abilities there are more males at both high- and
low-ability ends (a phenomenon we explore more fully in a later section). The reasons
why males show more variability are not known, but given the higher variability, even
small mean differences between females and males will result in a disproportionately
large number of males in both the high- and low-ability ends of the distribution.
There is no large-scale examination that assesses writing in a comparable way to the
SAT-M. If there were, we expect it would show the female advantage in verbal
abilities in secondary school and throughout adulthood because females have higher
mean scores on tests of writing. Researchers have identified mathematically
precocious preschoolers (scoring one to two standard deviations above the norm) and
have concluded that males are overrepresented in this precocious group even at this
young age (Robinson, Abbott, Berninger, &amp; Busse, 1996). Sex differences in
quantitative abilities do not follow a predictable developmental schedule, in that
they vary by the type of quantitative task examined. In fact, on average, females get
higher grades in school in math classes at all grade levels (Kimball, 1989;
Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997) and do slightly better on international assessments in
algebra (National Center for Education Statistics, 2005), possibly because of
algebra's language-like structure, but tend to score lower on quantitative tests when
the content is not directly related to what is taught in their own curriculum
(reviewed in Geary, 1996; Halpern, 2000). The differences between boys and girls in
mathematical abilities in elementary school tend to be small and to favor girls.
Abilities are assessed in elementary school mostly with school grades, which reflect
other factors, including behavior and turning in assignments on time. Girls are
slightly better at computational tasks in 4th grade and remain at the same advantage
relative to males through 12th d grade ( between .1 and .2; Willingham &amp; Cole,
1997; but see Royer, Tronsky, Can, Jackson, &amp; Marchant, 1999). Thus, we see
advantages for females in the early primary-school years, when mathematics consists
of computational knowledge and speed; little or no sex difference through the rest of
the primary-school years; and then a male advantage when the mathematical concepts
require more reasoning and are more spatial in nature, in the context of solving
problems in geometry and calculus, subjects typically taught in the higher
secondary-school grades (Geary, 1996; Hyde, Fennema, &amp; Lamon, 1990). The National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is regularly given to a representative
sample of U.S. students and differs from the international assessments and the SAT-M
test in that it is more closely aligned with curriculum. There is essentially no
difference between males and females on the mathematics test of the NAEP (Coley,
2001). In fact, when the international assessments from the Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS; standardized across 33 countries) are compared
for the final year of secondary school for math, science, and reading literacy, the
female advantage in reading and the male advantage in science are considerably larger
and more reliable than the male advantage found in mathematics. In order to achieve
in science, learners need good mathematical abilities, but they also need verbal and
visuospatial abilities, so science achievement cannot be explained by math scores
alone. This conclusion is in accord with Hedges and Nowell's (1995) meta-analytic
review, in which they concluded that ''average sex differences in most measured
abilities are small, with the possible exception of science, writing, and
stereotypical vocational aptitudes'' (p. 45). It seems that for the large-scale
quantitative assessments they reviewed, sex differences were smaller in mathematical
abilities than they were in these other areas, although the authors did not compare
specific types of mathematical skills in their review. Trends Over Time in Average
Abilities The question of whether sex differences have been decreasing over time
depends on which data are examined. In a meta-analysis, Hyde, Fennema, and Lamon
(1990) concluded that sex differences in some mathematical skills were decreasing.
But different sorts of data give different answers, probably because mathematics is
not a unitary domain and neither are the competencies assessed across studies. Hedges
and Nowell (1995), in their meta-analysis, conclude that ''differences do not appear
to be decreasing ... across the 32 year period'' (p. 45). Despite all of the interest
focused on the superior-ability tail of the SAT-M test as it relates to scientists,
it is instructive to consider average male-female performance on this test over time,
as shown in Figure 3. The average difference between males and females on the SAT-M
test has remained unchanged for over 35 years, despite the large increase in the
number of females entering fields that require mathematics. Logically, as more girls
take advanced coursework in mathematics, their mean score on the SAT-M would be
expected to increase, but this has not happened. Another possibility is that the
large increase in the number of females taking the SAT-M test has been lowering the
average scores (i.e., because an overall less select group of females is taking the
test). Racial and Ethnic Differences in Average Abilities In thinking about sex
differences in math and science abilities, one important question is the extent to
which various races, ethnic groups, and peoples around the world show the same
patterns of results. To answer this question, racial and ethnic groups were compared
in terms of education and work in the United States (Coley, 2001). Large racial and
ethnic group differences appear overall, and the size of the differences between
females and males within each racial and ethnic group differs somewhat. Sex-typed
cognitive patterns do not vary much among racial and ethnic groups, with a few
exceptions. For example, Blacks are the only group in which females score higher than
males on the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT-V), but the
few-point difference on this test is too small to be meaningful (Coley, 2001). Prior
to 2005, the SAT-V contained a large proportion of verbal analogies, and it did not
have a writing component; therefore, despite being labeled a ''verbal'' test, it did
not contain the components of verbal language in which females excel. Results from
the NAEP showed that females scored higher, on average, in all racial or ethnic
groups and across all ages, in reading, writing, and civics. The graduate admissions
tests (the GRE and the Graduate Management Admission Test, GMAT, which is used for
admissions to business schools) show that males score higher across all racial/ethnic
groups, with the largest differences in quantitative areas. But White, Black, and
Hispanic females are more likely than their male counterparts to graduate from
college, an advantage that does not translate into higher earnings. The relationship
between education and career success (when assessed with earnings) is moderated by
sex and race in many job categories. The moderating variables may explain a portion
of the sex differences in career success in math and science fields as
well.<component x="321.05" y="65.45" width="246.06" height="486.15" page="6"

abilities and career achievement are complicated, but the fact that there are some
tests and some areas of mathematics and science in which females, across all racial
and ethnic groups, tend to excel, and some in which males, across all racial and
ethnic groups, tend to excel, makes it difficult for any single theory such as
motivation, learning, biology, or test-related anxiety to explain the difference. The
consistency of the sex-related cognitive pattern of results is consistent with
predictions based on an evolutionary perspective (Geary, 1998), but as we note later,
there are many researchers who raise objections to evolutionary explanations for
science and math data. A Cognitive-Process Taxonomy of Average Abilities Halpern
(2000, 2004) offered a solution to the mismatch in outcomes for males and females of
school grades-outcomes that are based, at least in part, on tests that reflect school
curricula, as well as on scores on standardized tests that are comprised of questions
that are novel or unrelated to the school curriculum. By considering the underlying
cognitive processes used in solving different sorts of math problems, Halpern
proposed a taxonomy in which math problems that were spatial in nature would be
advantageous to males and those that did not require visuospatial abilities would
show either no sex differences or an advantage to females. In a series of studies,
Gallagher and her colleagues (Gallagher &amp; DeLisi, 1994; Gallagher, Levin, &amp;
Cahalan, 2002) examined cognitive patterns of sex differences on GRE math problems.

with a spatially based solution strategy, but not when solution strategies were more
verbal in nature or were similar to the ones presented in popular mathematics
textbooks. They also found that there were no sex differences for GRE math problems
when solutions required multiple algorithmic steps (i.e., differences were not due to
the ability to hold information in working memory), but the usual male advantage was
found with math problems that had multiple possible solution paths. Thus, some
portion of the performance differences between males and females on GRE math problems
lies in the recognition and/or selection of a solution strategy that may be novel.
Gallagher et al. found that the usual male advantage on standardized mathematics
tests can be minimized, equated for women and men, or maximized by altering the way
problems are presented and emphasizing the particular types of cognitive processes
that lead to the optimal solution. What is unknown is how these manipulations of test
items affect the validity of the GRE in predicting grades in graduate school or
success after graduation. Gallagher's research on verbal and visuospatial
representation of quantitative problems on the GRE is an exciting advance because it
allows researchers to identify the locus of the sex difference and also shows that
identical mathematical content can be presented in ways that are advantageous to
males or females. In reviewing each problem on the quantitative portion of the GRE,
she found that some problems had an optimal solution strategy; for other problems,
different strategies were equally fast in yielding the correct answer. Research has
shown that visuospatial training leads to improvement in a variety of tasks
(Newcombe, 2002), so we can expect that training with multiple problem
representations may have the same effects (Johnson, 1984). Recent meta-analyses have
shown that children and adults can improve their visuospatial skills with training
(Maruli, Liu, Warren, Uttal, &amp; Newcombe, 2007). The overall mean effect size
(mean of 13 effect sizes) is d5.52. The researchers explained that the effect size
for visuospatial-skills training was moderated because control groups that did not
receive the training also showed improvement. Recall that research by Casey et al.
(1995) found that sex differences on the SAT-M could be eliminated when the effect of
mental-rotation ability was removed. One possible educational intervention for
females and males would be to teach them multiple ways to solve problems using both
verbal and visuospatial solution strategies, thereby allowing for more flexibility in
overall problem solving. In the most comprehensive test of the hypothesis that women
can learn to enhance their visuospatial skills and thereby enjoy greater success in
STEM fields, Sorby and Baartmans (2000) created a special course designed to enhance
three-dimensional spatial skills. The skills that were targeted for instruction were
those that are needed by students in engineering, architecture, and other fields in
which success frequently depends on the use of visuospatial abilities. All students
with low scores on a test of visuospatial ability were encouraged to enroll in a
course to improve these skills. This course has been offered for many years for both
women and men at Michigan Technological University. As Sorby and Baartmans explain,
there are many theories to explicate the finding that men tend to have more highly
developed spatial skills than women. One promising theory suggests that sketching
three-dimensional objects is a significant factor (but not the only factor) in the
development of these skills. Sorby and Baartmans designed and implemented a course to
improve the spatial visualization skills of first-year engineering students. They
measured improvement in spatial skills with standardized testing instruments in each
of the 7 years of the project so far. The gains made by students on these
spatial-skills tests as a result of participation in their course were statistically
and materially significant. Both men and women who initially scored low on
visuospatial tests benefitted from the instruction. This improvement in spatial
skills resulted in improved performance in subsequent graphics courses, as measured
by final grades in the courses, and better retention in engineering programs, which
suggests that the effects lasted over time and were of practical
significance.<component x="303.02" y="65.56" width="246.09" height="373.23" page="11"

mathematical and scientific abilities by examining differences at the population mean
is useful but can lead to misleading conclusions if the distribution of test scores
is not similar for males and females (Feingold, 1995). This is particularly the case
when the focus is on populations characterized by high abilities and the potential to
become future mathematics or science professionals (Wise, Steel, &amp; MacDonald,
1979). Differences in population variance, as well as potential skew in these
distributions, could lead to overrepresentation of one sex over the other at the
extremes. Sex Differences in Distributions and Variances Feingold (1992) and Hedges
and Friedman (1993) examined the results from available test-norming studies to
assess the possible effects of sex differences in both mean test scores and
variances. There were differences in variances (males were more variable), and, when
combined with mean differences, these two effects produced more males at the high end
of the distribution. Drawing from data on abilities that were measured in six
national surveys over a 32-year interval, Hedges and Nowell (1995) found that, in
addition to the (small) mean differences in mathematical and science abilities
favoring males (science: 5 d .32; math:d5.16), the test scores of males were more
variable than were those of females, with variance ratios differing between 3% and
20% (Hedges &amp; Nowell, 1995), with little change over the 32-year interval
sampled. Similarly, Strand et al. (2006) found many more males than females in the
top stanines in mathematics and nonverbal reasoning (also see Deary, Thorpe, Wilson,
Starr, &amp; Whalley, 2003, fig. 1, p. 537). In the 9th stanine (top 4% of all
scores) of the quantitative test, 60% were males; in the 9th stanine of the nonverbal
reasoning test, 54% were males. Similar results were reported by Stanley, Benbow,
Brody, Dauber, and Lupkowski (1992) in their study of 86 nationally standardized
achievement and aptitude tests (obtained from 1982 to 1987) and by Feingold (1995)
with the Differential Aptitude Test. Thus, differences in mathematical and science
abilities that are large enough to be of practical importance are found at the high
end of the ability distribution (Humphreys, 1988; Hyde et al., 1990). Data from the
Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) exemplifies this phenomenon. In their
first article on the topic, Benbow and Stanley (1980) observed sex differences in
mathematical reasoning ability among 9,927 intellectually talented 12- to
14-year-olds who had taken the SATseveral years before the typical age. The sex
difference on the SAT-M, which is a test of mathematical reasoning ability especially
when administered to the precocious in the seventh and eighth grades, d5 favored the
males and averaged .40. There were essentially no differences on the SAT-V. Table 1,
which is from another SMPY sample of precocious youth, illustrates these sex
differences with four different samples. In a follow-up to the first study, Benbow
and Stanley (1983) reported SAT data on another 40,000 young, intellectually talented
adolescents, and the findings in the first studies were reaffirmed. No differences of
any significance were found on the SAT-V, but the SAT-M revealed sex differences
favoring males.<component x="62.99" y="65.44" width="246.1" height="46.91" page="12"

graphically (Benbow, 1988), the male and female SAT-V distributions were found to be
isomorphic. However, the male SAT-M distribution, in contrast to the female SAT-M
distribution, manifested a higher mean and larger variance, along with a skew,
resulting in an exponential intensification of the ratio of males to females in the
upper tail of the distribution. The male:female ratio was 2:1 for young adolescents
with SAT-M scores of 500 or more, 4:1 for those with scores of at least 600, and 13:1
for those with scores of at least 700 (Benbow &amp; Stanley, 1983). Because the
Hedges and Nowell (1995) data showed that high sex ratios (5:1 among the top 3% and
7:1 among the top 1%) are found in the upper tails of the ability distributions of
nationally representative samples, those authors concluded that the high sex ratios
found in some highly talented samples like that of the SMPY need not be attributed to
differential selection by sex. Since the initial Benbow and Stanley studies were
published in the 1980s, several million seventh and eighth graders have taken the SAT
(or the American College Test, ACT) through annual talent searches (Benbow &amp;
Stanley, 1996; Van Tassel-Baska, 1996). Sex differences in the distributions of SAT-M
scores among intellectually talented 12- to 14-year-olds have persisted and are also
observed on the ACT-Math (Benbow &amp; Stanley, 1996; Stanley, 1994). For reasons
that are not well understood, current ratios of males to females at the high end

earlier studies, with male:female ratios among those scoring 700 or more on the SAT-M
before age 13 now being less than 4:1 (Blackburn, personal communication, August 4,
2005). Stanley, who studied mathematically precocious youth for decades, explained
that 25 years ago there were 13 boys for every girl who scored above 700 on the SAT-M
at age 13. Now the ratio is only 2.8:1, which is a precipitous drop that has not been
widely reported in the news media. According to Stanley, ''It's gone way down as
women have had the opportunity to take their math earlier'' (quoted in Monastersky, z
2005, 45). There are no studies exploring the reasons for the decline, although
possible reasons include that fact that high-school mathematics coursework for boys
and girls has become more similar and more girls are getting more encouragement in
the form of special programs and mentoring to encourage their participation in
higher-level math courses. Regardless, these results suggest that the male advantage
for mathematical skills may be limited to the upper end of the ability distribution.
Sex Differences in Mathematical Reasoning in Gifted Students Mills, Ablard, and
Strumpf (1993) documented sex differences d as early as second grade (average among
intellectually gifted students in mathematical reasoning 5.43). Robinson et al.
(1996) reported sex differences in mathematical precocity before kindergarten
(average d5.37). More significantly, these latter sex differences were maintained
following exposure to mathematical enrichment opportunities aimed at both males and
females. Males gained more than females did on quantitative and visuospatial measures
after an average of 28 biweekly intervention sessions (Robinson, Abbott, Berninger,
Busse, &amp; Mukhopadhyah, 1997). The implications of these differences, and
especially of the disparate ratios at the top for the math-science education
pipeline, are clear: Given an early advantage in these fundamental quantitative
skills, a greater number of males than females will qualify for advanced training in
disciplines that place a premium on mathematical reasoning. As Hedges and Nowell
(1995) stated, ''Sex differences in variance and mean lead to substantially fewer
females than males who score in the upper tails of the mathematics and science
distributions and hence are poised to succeed in the sciences. The achievement of
fair representation of women in science will be much more difficult if there are only
one-half to oneseventh as many women as men who excel in the relevant abilities'' (p.
45). Other cognitive and noncognitive sex differences expand our understanding of the
factors that influence the way precocious youth develop in math. Table 1 contains
data on abilities and values of gifted students in the Midwest who were identified by
SMPY from 1988 to 1991 and who attended a special summer program (Lubinski &amp;
Benbow, 1992). Again, sex differences in mathematical reasoning ability were
consistently observed (average d5.84), but sex differences in the SAT-V were not
observed. Table 1 includes other cognitive measures of general intelligence and
specific abilities. No meaningful differences were observed among scores on the
Advanced Raven Progressive Matrices (Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 1992), which is a
nonverbal measure of general intelligence. There were, however, substantial
differences in spatial and mechanical reasoning abilities (average d5.92). In
addition to these differences in specific abilities, there were also sex differences
in vocational interests and values. Table 1 presents the differences in values. As
can be seen, males are higher on theoretical values, and females are higher on social
values, among other trends. Strongly held theoretical values are characteristic of
physical scientists, while social values are negatively correlated with interests in
the physical sciences (Achter, Lubinski, Benbow, &amp; Eftekhari-Sanjani, 1999).
Similar preference distinctions between males and females have been found using the
Strong Interest Inventory (Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2006), with the SMPY males having
stronger investigative and realistic interests and the SMPY females having stronger
social interests (Achter, Lubinski, &amp; Benbow, 1996, Appendix B, p. 76). Thus, it
appears that early differences in mathematical skills may occur along with other
factors relevant to the development of scientific expertise.<component x="303.02"

Browne, 2002), however, give a more nuanced look at this trend and reveal that there
are substantial differences among subdisciplines in addition to the differences among
disciplines. In engineering, for example, women are scarce in mining/mineral and
mechanical engineering (0% and 6%, respectively) but not in environmental health and
bioengineering (25%). Among physics doctorates, 17% of acoustics but only 4% of
particle physics degrees are earned by women. In biology, 22% of the entomology
degrees went to women, in comparison to 68% of those in the nutritional sciences.
And, in psychology, where 64% of the doctoral degrees went to women in 1995,
physiological psychology attracted 38% women, in contrast to developmental
psychology, which attracted 80% women. Finally, in the social sciences as a whole,
fewer women chose statistics and economics (23% and 24%, respectively) than chose
anthropology and sociology (58% and 53%; Browne, 2002). It is tempting to ask whether
these differences in higher education emanate from sex differences in abilities, but
the combination of native ability, socioeconomic context, personal interests, and
cultural influence is remarkably complex. For example, while women do not complete
their doctorates in natural sciences and engineering at the same rates as men, the
difference disappears when mathematical ability is adjusted for (J.C. Baker, 1998).
Moreover, while sex differences in mathematical ability are associated with sex
differences in occupational status and income (Paglin &amp; Rufolo, 1990), sex
differences in interests-such as a preference for working with people-are also
important in explaining educational and career choice. Sex Differences in Career
Development Choices Xie and Shauman (2003) noted that the best understanding of the
engagement of males and females in science is likely to emerge from studies that take
a life-course perspective. The SMPY has collected longitudinal information on a large
number of high-ability males and females to investigate their career<component

Benbow, 2006). (The very oldest individuals in the study were born in 1959 and the
youngest in the early 1980s.) Over 4,000 intellectually talented individuals,
identified according to their performance on the SAT during seventh or eighth grade,
have been tracked for over three decades in four separate cohorts (along with a
comparison group of 714 nonprecocious individuals). There is no comparable study of
its kind. Students were invited to take the SAT in the seventh or eighth grade if
they had scored in the top percentiles on a standardized achievement test
administered by their school. The first cohort comprised seventh and eighth graders
from the Greater Baltimore Area who were identified in the early 1970s as
representing the top 1% in mathematical ability. The second cohort included seventh
graders from the Mid-Atlantic region who scored in the top .5% in mathematical
ability, verbal ability, or both. The third cohort included seventh and eighth
graders from across the nation who were identified in the early 1980s as being in the
top .01% in mathematical ability, verbal ability, or both. The fourth cohort, drawn
from the Midwest in the late 1980s and early to mid 1990s, comprised two groups: One
represented the top .5% in mathematic ability, verbal ability, or both, and the other
represented individuals who scored at least at the 97th percentile on any subtest of
an achievement test administered by their schools. Participants completed
comprehensive surveys and inventories providing a detailed view of their development
and educational/ career trajectories. The last survey of this group occurred when
participants were in their mid 30s, with earlier data collection points occurring at
ages 13, 18, and 23. Because it is likely that not all future talent for mathematics
and science can be identified using the SAT at age 13, the SMPY decided to form a
fifth cohort to determine the generalizability of its findings. Cohort five comprised
714 individuals, educated in the United States, who were enrolled in the top 15 U.S.
graduate programs in mathematics and science. Because an equal sample of men and
women was needed in departments where the male:female ratios often exceeded 3:1, the
women were oversampled (i.e., more women were included in the sample than their
proportional enrollment in graduate programs). This cohort was studied
retrospectively, concurrently, and prospectively (age 33 and beyond; Lubinski,
Benbow, Shea, Eftekhari-Sanjani, &amp; Halvorson 2001; Lubinski, Benbow, Webb, &amp;
Bleske-Rechek, 2006). As in other studies, no statistically significant sex
differences in overall general intelligence were found for the SMPY samples, but
differences were found in certain specific abilities. Individuals who were assessed
by age 13 as being in the top 1% in mathematical reasoning ability (cohorts 1 and 2)
became highly educated: Over 90% earned a bachelor's degree, and over 25% earned a
doctorate, with essentially no sex differences in degrees earned (Benbow, Lubinski,
Shea, &amp; Eftekhari-Sanjani, 2000). About 50% earned at least one postsecondary
degree in math and science areas, with 64% of the top .5% in<component x="303.02"

at least one postsecondary math or science degree (Benbow et al., 2000). The men were
at least twice as likely to earn degrees in the inorganic sciences and engineering as
the women, with the men earning almost five times as many doctorates in these areas
as the women. As shown in Figure 4, more women than men earned doctoral degrees in
the life sciences and medicine (Benbow et al., 2000). Not surprisingly, the
subsequent career choices of these mathematically talented individuals mirror the
pattern seen for degree specialization. In a subsequent study to Benbow et al.
(2000), mathematically talented individuals in cohorts 1 and 2 who had planned on
majoring in mathematical or scientific areas when they entered college were studied
in more depth at approximately age 33, to better understand the factors that
differentiated those who remained in mathematics or science and earned such degrees
from those who opted to pursue undergraduate degrees in other areas (Webb et al.,
2002). More males had declared an intention to pursue a mathematics or science degree
than females, as shown in Tables 5 and 6, and there was greater attrition from the
mathematical or scientific disciplines by females than there was by males (26% vs.
17%). High-school educational experiences, abilities, and interests predicted whether
an undergraduate degree was attained in mathematics or science or the individual left
to pursue other areas of study. The ones persisting with mathematics or science
degrees had higher SAT-M scores and more high-school course work in mathematics and
science, and they more often reported a mathematics or science course as their
favorite course. They also had congruent occupational interests as measured by the
Study of Values and Holland Occupational codes. Once these variables had been entered
into the discriminant function analysis (a statistical procedure for determining
which variables are important in differentiating two or more groups), sex added
essentially no explanatory power. (By itself, sex yielded a squared multiple
correlation-a measure of the amount of variance that can be explained by or
attributed to a variable-of only .01, independent of the other variables.) These
results underscore the complex set of explanatory variables needed to predict career
success in mathematics and science. In other words, among highly gifted individuals,
those who pursued careers in science and mathematics also took more related
coursework in high school, rated math and science courses as their favorites, and
were interested in math and science. More of the highly gifted males than the females
had these patterns of experiences and attitudes that were predictive of career
choices in science and mathematics. To pursue further the role of mathematical
reasoning ability in math and science achievement, individuals in cohort 1 who by age
13 had scored in the top quartile of the top 1% were compared with those in the
bottom quartile of the top 1% (Benbow, 1992; Wai, Lubinski, &amp; Benbow, 2005). On
37 math/science achievement variables assessed at age 23 (these variables went well
beyond grades), statistically and substantively significant effect sizes were
observed favoring the top versus the bottom quartile on 34 of the variables (Benbow,
1992). (Effect sizes averaged d5.97 for continuous variables 5 d and .57 for
categorical variables from the high-school years, 5 5 d d .47 for the continuous
variables and .39 for the d categorical variables from the college years, and 5.41
from the early stages of graduate school.) Although sex differences were found in
these analyses, they were smaller than the differences between the top and bottom
quartiles, and they were not observed in the relation between mathematical ability
and academic achievement. At age 33, the same pattern emerged for the highly gifted
individuals in Cohort 1 when the following variables were studied: secured
doctorates, math/science PhDs, income, patents, and tenure-track positions at top
U.S. universities (Wai et al., 2005). These results provide evidence against the
''threshold'' hypothesis, which maintains that there is some (high) level of ability
needed for career success in cognitively demanding occupations and that scoring
beyond that level will not increase the probability of success in those fields. What
is missing from predictions based on the threshold hypothesis is an understanding
that there is a great deal of variability in the extreme tails of ability
distributions, such that the top quarter of the top 1% could be very far from the
bottom quarter of the top 1% (with actual distances depending on the specific

visualized by imagining a bell-shaped curve with the tails never quite touching the
horizontal axis. The results of this study contrast with a conclusion drawn by the
Science authors of a letter published in (Muller et al., 2005), who claimed:
''[T]here is little evidence that those scoring at the top of the range in
standardized tests are likely to have more successful careers in the sciences. Too
many other factors are involved'' (p. 1043). Yet ability is not everything. A
congruent preference pattern is also a good predictor of the discipline in which one
is likely to earn a four-year degree (Achter et al., 1999) and one's occupational
setting at age 33 (Wai et al., 2005). Preference patterns add incremental
(additional) validity beyond abilities, and the effect holds for both males and
females. Visuospatial Ability and Mathematics and Science Careers All of the above
studies speak to the power of mathematical reasoning ability in predicting subsequent
math/science achievement. Yet prediction can be improved if one considers
visuospatial ability and the relative strength of mathematical ability compared to
verbal ability within a given individual, both of which display sex differences.
Individual differences in the relative strength of verbal, mathematical, and
quantitative abilities that are identified at an early age can predict differences in
developmental trajectories and occupational pursuits (Achter et al., 1999; Lubinski,
Webb, Morelock, &amp; Benbow, 2001). We discuss both sets of findings next.
Proficiency in visuospatial ability has long been associated with success in
cognitively demanding educational tracks and occupations such as engineering,
architecture, physics, chemistry, and surgery (Smith, 1964; Snow &amp; Yalow, 1982;
Sorby, &amp; Baartmans, 2000) and is a salient characteristic of physical scientists
(Gohm, Humphreys, &amp; Yao, 1998; Humphreys, Lubinski, &amp; Yao, 1993). Yet,
visuospatial ability is not routinely taught or assessed by schools and thus is not
often developed and assessed in ways that influence students' educational and career
plans.<component x="45.01" y="361.66" width="246.06" height="159.84" page="17"

precocious males and 170 precocious females, Shea, Lubinski, and Benbow (2001)
employed multivariate statistical methods (i.e., methods that use multiple dependent
measures), using age-13 SAT-M, SAT-V, and visuospatial-ability scores for
top-.5%-ability individuals, to predict a series of developmentally sequenced
educational/ vocational outcomes: (a) favorite and least favorite high-school course,
(b) field of undergraduate degree, (c) field of graduate degree, and (d) occupation
at age 33. Visuospatial ability added incremental validity to SAT-M and SAT-V
assessments in predicting educational/vocational outcomes over 20 years, an effect
shown in Figure 5. Perusal of Figure 5 will show, for example, that students who
reported that their favorite highschool subjects were in the humanities or social
sciences tended to be above the mean on the SAT-V (above the horizontal axis), below
the mean on the SAT-M (to the left of the vertical axis), and below the mean on
spatial ability (indicated with an arrow facing left). The other three graphs in
Figure 5, which show the profile for their least-favorite high-school courses,
college majors, and occupations, can be read in the same way. It is not surprising,
given these findings, that Humphreys et al.'s (1993) 13-year longitudinal study of
400,000 high-school students, assessed on mathematical, visuospatial, and verbal
abilities, concluded that mathematics and science disciplines appear to be losing
many talented individuals because selection for these educational tracks is limited
to mathematical and verbal abilities. Intellectually talented adolescents with
stronger visuospatial ability relative to verbal ability (determined
intraindividually) were more likely to be found in engineering, computer science, and
mathematical fields, whereas those with the inverse ability pattern tended to
gravitate toward humanities, social science, organic science, medical arts such as
nursing, and legal fields (Shea et al., 2001). A similar pattern also emerged for
relative intraindividual strengths in quantitative versus verbal abilities, with
visuospatial ability exhibiting somewhat greater overall discriminative power. That
is, students who are relatively more verbally than quantitatively or spatially
talented gravitate toward the humanities and social sciences, whereas those with the
opposite ability pattern lean more toward engineering and the physical sciences.
Webb, Lubinski, and Benbow (in press) obtained similar results with an independent
sample of 1,060 high-ability adolescents tracked for 5 years. These findings held for
both males and females. In a more definitive study, Lubinski, Webb, et al. (2001)
found that among profoundly gifted individuals (top 1 in 10,000 in ability and who
are disproportionately male), those whose ability strength was mathematical compared
to verbal but nonetheless had very high verbal ability reported mathematics and
science courses as their favorites in high school and college, and disproportionately
pursued educational credentials in mathematics and science, reporting three times as
many awards and special accomplishments in science and technology as compared to the
humanities and arts. Those with the inverse ability &gt; pattern (i.e., V M) reported
the humanities to be their favorite courses in high school and in college,
disproportionately pursued educational credentials in the humanities and law, and
reported twice as many awards and special accomplishments in the humanities and arts
compared to sciences and technology. Those with relatively flat profiles fell
somewhere in between. It must be acknowledged that the attribute of having a ''tilt''
favoring mathematical and visuospatial abilities compared to &gt; verbal (i.e., M V),
regardless of level of ability, is more frequently exhibited by males than by females
across the four cohorts in the SMPY study. Females tend to be more balanced in their
ability profile (i.e., M V) and this leads them to choose ' mathematics, engineering,
or physical-science careers less frequently than their male counterparts do. In other
words, these data show that having better math abilities relative to one's own verbal
abilities is associated with selecting careers in mathematics and science and that
this tilt is more frequently found in high-ability males than it is in high-ability
females. When making career choices, highly gifted individuals consider their own
pattern of abilities and not whether they have the absolute level of ability needed
to pursue a career in a demanding field of study. They seem to be implicitly asking,
''What am I better at?'' and not asking ''Am I smart enough to succeed in a
particular career?'' The above studies illustrate how sex differences in mathematical
and visuospatial abilities detected by age 13 have consequences that can be seen 20
years later. These sex differences in abilities and preferences predict differences
in participation and achievement in mathematics and science for individuals in their
mid 30s. Sharper predictive power is obtained if abilities are combined with
preferences, which also display sex differences by age 13 (Achter et al., 1996, p.
76; Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2006). Males more frequently than females display
preference patterns that are conducive to pursuing science and mathematics careers
and that, when coupled with abilities, form aptitude complexes (Corno et al., 2002;
Cronbach &amp; Snow, 1977), vocational taxons (Dawis &amp; Lofquist, 1984), or trait
clusters (Ackerman, 1996; Ackerman &amp; Heggestad, 1997) that contribute to the
development of scientific skills. The finding that highly gifted individuals prefer
academic areas in which they are most able further exacerbates discrepancies at the
high levels of achievement, as do any differences in self-competency beliefs, with
their effect on task values and, thus, engagement in science (Jacobs, Lanza, Osgood,
Eccles, &amp; Wigfield, 2002). High-ability males were found in one study to have
unrealistically high self-competency beliefs; no such effect was found for females,
whose beliefs also were high but were more accurate predictors of future performance
(e.g., r5.38 for males vs.r5.61 for females; Gibbons, Benbow, &amp; Gerrard, 1994).
Additional Factors Influencing Sex Differences in Career Choices of High-Ability
Individuals Occupational choices are not made in isolation or independently of other
life decisions such as marrying, having children, or living close to relatives
(Benbow et al., 2000; Eccles, 1994). There are trade-offs, and for many successful
women there exists considerable conflict between the traditionally feminine values
and goals in life (e.g., child-care responsibilities) and the expectations from
traditionally male highly competitive achievement activities (Browne, 2002; Eccles,
1994). Indeed, intellectually talented men in their mid 30s are on average more d
career focused ( s of .21 - .76), work longer hours, and are willing to work longer
hours than women of the same age whose reports indicate that they tend to prefer a
more balanced life approach with regard to career, family, and friends (Benbow et
al., 2000; Lubinski, 2004, Webb et al., 2002). If these sex differences continue over
a sustained time frame, women's additional family responsibilities may help explain
some of the underrepresentation of women in science careers (Eccles, 1994) and at the
highest levels of various professional careers. That is, if men remain more career
focused and spend more hours working, for whatever the reasons, then, in all
likelihood, men will accomplish more than their female counterparts and will likely
be seen as more successful in the world of work. Already, men in the SMPY sample
reported higher incomes, a difference that disappeared when hours worked was
controlled (Benbow et al., 2000). This does not mean, however, that men are more
successful in life or more personally satisfied: On all indicators examined, these
talented men and women in their mid 30s reported feeling equally good about
themselves and about their achieved success. Xie and Shauman (2003), when studying
women in science, found that most of the observed sex differences in research
productivity could be attributed to personal characteristics and the structural
features of the employment setting. Having children was one factor associated with
less engagement in mathematical and science careers for women but not for men. Sex
differences in mathematical and science careers are indeed extremely complex and are
surely influenced by the social structures in which individuals are situated, the
neighborhood resources, and the networks of interaction in which they participate
(Eccles, 1994; Entwistle, Alexander, &amp; Olsson, 1994; Farmer, Wardrop, Anderson,
&amp; Risinger, 1995; Xie &amp; Shuman, 2003). The fact that social and environmental
variables are important determinants of career success, however, does not mean that
we cannot draw conclusions about the role of abilities, preferences, and other
factors that may be responsible for producing sex disparities in participation,
engagement, and achievement in the quantitative disciplines at the very highest
levels. The SMPY studies clearly demonstrate that sex differences in mathematical and
visuospatial abilities, the male tilt compared to female balance in ability profiles,
and differing preferences and educational experiences all contribute to the sex
differences in outcomes among the highly gifted.<component x="303.02" y="65.45"

for examining the origins and meaning of sex differences in science and mathematical
achievement. In psychology, evolutionary theory emphasizes the adaptive value of
behaviors and mental processes that have developed throughout the entire history of a
species. Answering questions about sex differences in academic and cognitive domains
from an evolutionary perspective is complicated because the knowledge bases,
technical skills, and insights that are needed to achieve in math and science are
rooted in the poorly understood interaction of cognitive and motivational factors and
culture-specific educational goals and opportunities to master these academic
domains. Most of the competencies that compose modern math and science are not the
direct result of evolution (Geary, 1996). Studying advanced topics in mathematics and
science, for example, are recent activities for humans, so they may be better thought
of as being built upon earlier adaptive solutions for functioning in a specific
cultural context rather than as direct reflections of the history of our species
(Gazzaniga &amp; Heatherton, 2006; Geary, 2007). Nonetheless, an evolutionary
perspective can contribute to our understanding of sex differences in math and
science by providing a way to understand proximate biological correlates (e.g., sex
hormones) of these differences, and a perspective for simultaneously considering
developmental and social correlates. A detailed consideration of potential indirect
evolutionary influences on sex differences in math and science is beyond the scope of
this monograph and, in fact, may not be possible given our current state of knowledge
in these areas. Our goals are to provide examples of how an evolutionary perspective
can be used to frame our understanding of current empirical findings and to generate
hypotheses for future study. Sexual Selection Darwin (1871) proposed that many sex
differences have evolved by means of sexual selection. The mechanisms involve
competition with members of the same sex over mates and discriminative choice of
mating partners. The most frequently studied dynamics are male-male competition over
access to mates and female choice of mating partners. It is clear that female
competition and male choice occur in many species. Whatever the pattern, the most
common result is the evolutionary elaboration of physical, behavioral, or cognitive
traits that facilitate competition and choice. In recent decades, the study of
sexually selected sex differences has emerged as a vibrant area in the biological
sciences and has yielded insights into the evolution and proximate expression of
these differences across hundreds of species (Andersson, 1994; Andersson &amp;
Simmons, 2006). Although the results of these studies strongly confirm the importance
of sexual selection, some sex differences may have evolved that are unrelated to
sexual selection (Isaac, 2005). Even for traits related to sexual selection, many
issues remain to be resolved regarding the nuances of competition and choice and the
interaction of these dynamics (Andersson &amp; Simmons, 2006). Sex Hormones The
proximate expression of many of the traits that have evolved by means of sexual
selection are influenced by prenatal and postnatal exposure to sex hormones,
particularly androgens in mammals (e.g., Adkins-Regan, 2005; Morris, Jordan, &amp;
Breedlove, 2004). Androgens and other hormones can influence sex differences in
cognition and behavior through early prenatal organization of associated brain areas,
activation of these areas by postnatal exposure to androgens, or some combination.
The influences of sex hormones are, however, complex and sometimes very subtle, and
often interact reciprocally with genetic sex, physical health, and social and
ecological context (Arnold et al., 2004; McEwen et al., 1997). As an example, these
reciprocal relations are important for understanding how androgens interact with male
health and social context in the expression (or not) of evolved sex differences.
Within-Sex Variation The processes that are at work in sexual selection can also
exaggerate within-sex variation (Houle, 1992; Pomiankowski ( ( &amp; M ller, 1995).
Pomiankowski's and M ller's cross-species review and analysis suggest that within-sex
variation can occur when competition or choice favors traits toward the phenotypic
extreme (observable traits such as the peacock's tail). Although much remains to be
learned, it appears that selection that favors extreme traits can result in the
evolution of genetic mechanisms that result in exaggerated within-sex variation as
well as the evolution of condition-dependent traits. As a way of understanding
condition-dependent traits, consider for example, how the combination of the physical
demands of maintaining a larger body size-a common result of male-male competition,
with the advantage going to larger members of a species (Andersson, 1994)-and
potential interactions between sex hormones and immune functioning may make males
more vulnerable to infestation with parasites, fluctuations in food supply, or other
ecological conditions (Moore &amp; Wilson, 2002; Muehlenbein &amp; Bribiescas, 2005).
Infestation with parasites can lead to an increase in immune system activity, which
can suppress the secretion of testosterone. The decline in testosterone will result
in poorly developed secondary sexual characteristics, placing the male at a
disadvantage in terms of female choice or male-male competition (Folstad &amp;
Karter, 1992). The result is that the least healthy males suffer the most under
difficult ecological conditions and this exaggerates within-sex variation among
males. A similar process may occur in species in which females are larger than males
and compete more and parent less; age-specific mortality is higher in females of
these species (Moore &amp; Wilson, 2002), and lifespan is shorter (Allman, Rosin,
Kumar, &amp; Hasenstaub, 1998). Development From an evolutionary perspective, nature
and nurture are integrally and reciprocally linked and cannot be separated. The
developmental process (e.g., length of infancy) and the responsiveness of the
developing trait to experiences are evolved phenotypes (West-Eberhard, 2003). It is
particularly important to consider the developmental patterns for slowly developing
and highly social species; these species tend to have large brains and may be the
most ''plastic'' in terms of learning and social behavior (e.g., Dunbar &amp; Bever,
1998; Joffe, 1997). Sex differences in life-history patterns (e.g., age of
maturation, life span) are common and, depending on the species, are influenced by a
combination of organizational and activational effects of sex hormones, as well as by
nutritional status and social context (Adkins-Regan, 2005; Stearns &amp; Koella,
1986). In many species, male-male competition and female choice result not only in
larger males but also sex differences in lifehistory development. In these species,
males often physically mature at a later age, reproduce later (if at all), engage in
more risky and aggressive behaviors, and have a shorter life span (Allman et al.,
1998; Leigh, 1996). Social and behavioral differences that may provide practice for
adult reproductive activities also may emerge during development. Rough-andtumble
play among males is common in primates in which there is male-male competition in
adulthood (Fagen, 1981), and females of many primate species often play parent with a
sibling or other young member of the group (Nicholson, 1987). Even in these species,
there is typically overlap in the play behaviors of the two sexes. However they are
manifested, sex differences are often small early in development and become larger as
individuals approach reproductive maturation, a finding that was originally noted by
Darwin (1871). An Evolutionary Understanding of Human Sex Differences Evolutionary
theory applies as well to human sex differences as it does to those of other species.
However, the twin foundations of sexual selection-male competition and female
choice-are nuanced, in humans, by the existence of female competition and male
choice; the two latter components follow from male investment in children. The
combination is predicted to result in more subtle and perhaps smaller sex differences
in humans than for many other species. Sexual Selection Human sex differences in
physical size, upper-body musculature, rate and pattern of physical development, and
other traits are consistent with the view that sexual selection has contributed to
some currently observed sex differences (Tanner, 1990). However, the relative
importance of evolutionary (including sexual-selection) and cultural influences on
cognitive, behavioral, and social sex differences is the subject of vigorous debate
(Geary, 1998; Newcombe, 2002; Wood &amp; Eagly, 2002). It has been proposed by some
evolutionary psychologists and anthropologists that male-male competition has been an
important part of human evolutionary history and has contributed to some currently
observed sex differences. In traditional societies, this competition includes
coordinated group-level conflict for control of ecologically rich territories and for
social and political influence (e.g., Chagnon, 1988), which is often manifested by
low-level but frequent raiding, warfare, and political manipulation (Keeley, 1996).
Within-group competition is seen in the formation of dominance hierarchies and
control of in-group politics. Maintaining groups' territorial borders, tribal
warfare, and large-game hunting-all of which are almost exclusively male activities
(Murdock, 1981)-involve movement across large ranges. Because warring males needed to
move across large-scale space, it is only a short leap for evolutionary psychologists
to hypothesize that this resulted in an evolutionary process that supports brain
development for large-scale navigation in males. Contemporary manifestations can be
seen today when males obtain much higher scores on some visuospatial tasks,
particularly mental rotation and three-dimensional simulations. The male activities
of hunting and warfare involve the construction and use of projectile weapons that
require the ability to track movement in 3-D space. Even though there are many
nuances to the proposal that the contemporary male advantage in spatial abilities is
a result of their roles as hunters and fighters-and the proposal itself has been
questioned by many social scientists whose critiques are presented at the end of this
section (e.g., Wood &amp; Eagly, 2002)-these patterns are nonetheless consistent with
predictions derived from sexual selection, and thus they merit some consideration. In
the following sections, we provide just a few illustrations of how this perspective
might broaden and enrich our understanding of currently found sex differences related
to math and science achievement in the 21st century. Sex Hormones and Cognitive Sex
Differences The male advantage in visuospatial abilities appears to contribute to the
male advantage in some areas of mathematics and engineering, as discussed earlier
(Sorby &amp; Baartmans, 2000). It has been hypothesized that sex differences in
visuospatial cognition have been influenced by male-male competition and other sex
differences during human evolutionary history (Ecuyer-Dab &amp; Robert, 2004; Geary,
1998; Sherry &amp; Hampson, 1997). If the male advantage in visuospatial abilities
and in some other areas of spatial cognition are related to sexual selection, then
the proximate expression of these sex differences is predicted to be related to
prenatal or postnatal exposure to sex hormones, particularly androgens. One method to
test such hypotheses is to study individuals with disorders that were caused by
prenatal exposure to sex hormones that are not typical for their sex (Berenbaum,
1999). With one such disorder, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), individuals are
prenatally exposed to excess androgens. Women born with CAH show masculine play
behaviors, but findings about later-life behaviors and abilities are difficult to
confirm because these children are treated with drugs for this condition as soon
after birth as it is detected and as soon as treatment can be administered. It is
also possible, even likely, that parents and other important adults in their lives
treat them in ways that might exaggerate pressures for feminine behaviors because the
adults know that the CAH girls were exposed to masculinizing hormonal influences in
utero. The evidence is mixed with respect to the visuospatial and related abilities
of these women; some studies show an advantage of women with CAH and others do not,
or the advantage is found on some but not other spatial tasks (Hampson, Rovet,
Altmann, 1998; Hines et al., 2003; Resnick, Berenbaum, Gottesman, &amp; Bouchard,
1986). Thus, the data on the cognitive patterns of girls who were exposed prenatally
to masculinizing hormones do not provide the conclusive evidence we need to link
prenatal sex hormones directly to cognitive abilities. The potential activational
effects of sex hormones can also be studied in humans by assessing any cognitive
changes that might follow hormonal therapy for female-to-male and male-to-female
transsexuals. Female-to-male transsexuals are treated with testosterone, and
male-to-female transsexuals are treated with a combination of androgen-suppressing
drugs and estrogens to prepare them for their new life as either a male or female.
Van Goozen and her colleagues found that performance on a spatial-ability measure
improved after androgen administration for the female-to-male transsexuals, although
they did not administer a measure of visuospatial ability (Van Goozen,
Cohen-Kettenis, Gooren, Frijda, &amp; Van de Poll, 1994, 1995). Performance on a test
of the ability to rotate images in 2-D space-which typically show smaller sex
differences than tests of 3-D spatial cognition (Voyer et al., 1995)-improved
significantly ( d50.56) for a group of individuals after undergoing only 3 months of
androgen treatment as part of their preparation for female-to-male sex-change
surgery. In a followup study, Slabbekoorn and colleagues confirmed this effect, but
only for a measure of 3-D spatial cognition (Slabbekoorn, Van Goozen, Megens, Gooren,
&amp; Cohen-Kettenis, 1999); the change on the 2-D measure was not significant. The
improvement in performance on the 3-D spatial-ability test for these individuals
following only 3 months of androgen treatment was very large (d 51.2). The magnitude
of this effect did not increase with further treatment over the next 7 months, and
the improved spatial abilities of these (new) men did not decline 5 weeks after
stopping the hormonal treatment. Androgen suppression did not result in a decline in
3-D spatial performance for male-to-female transsexuals, suggesting some prenatal
organizational effects on these abilities. The overall results across the different
types of studies are consistent with postnatal activational influences on the
expression of some aspects of spatial abilities. Within-Sex Variation In nonhuman
species, sex differences in patterns of competition and choice are often associated
with increased within-sex variation for the traits related to competition and choice,
and in many species this is accompanied with an increase in disease risk and early
mortality for the sex experiencing the most intense competition. Although much
remains to be learned about these patterns, they do seem to hold for humans. As would
be predicted, human males are more vulnerable to many diseases and suffer higher
mortality at all ages, especially in unstable social &#xA8;&#xA8; contexts
(Moller-Leimkuhler, 2003), and the increased mortality for males is in part due to
the tendency to engage in more risky and aggressive behaviors associated with
male-male aggression and status displays (Minino, Anderson, Fingerhut, Boudreault,
&amp; Warner, 2006; Wilson &amp; Daly, 1985). With respect to the sex differences in
math and science, there are two predictions that highlight the potential utility of
an evolutionary perspective. The first is that there will be greater within-sex
variation in the 3-D spatial abilities of males, and the second is that males growing
up in difficult circumstances will be more strongly affected behaviorally and
cognitively than females growing up in the same circumstances. With respect to the
latter, one corollary prediction is that the 3-D spatial abilities of these males
will be lower than those of males growing up in better environments and that there
will be no sex difference or a reversal of the sex difference for individuals growing
up in the more difficult environments. This is the pattern found for height: The sex
differences are largest in the healthiest populations and smallest for populations
under nutritional stress (Gaulin &amp; Boster, 1992). In other words, poverty and its
correlates prevent children from reaching their full physical potential. The same
appears to be true for cognitive potential. The results from multiple large-scale
studies have confirmed greater variability among males than among females in many
cognitive domains, including on measures of mathematics, science, and spatial
abilities, as noted earlier (Feingold, 1992; Hedges &amp; Nowell, 1995; Strand et
al., 2006; Stumpf &amp; Stanley, 1998). As we described earlier, across two studies
that included about 100,000 high school students in the United States, Hedges and
Nowell found 27% more variation in the spatial-ability scores of males than in those
of females. Feingold's examination of national norms for several ability measures and
across a variety of ages and cohorts found that males were always more variable on
measures of spatial cognition, with a mean effect of about 20% more variance in male
samples. Unfortunately, these studies did not distinguish among the different facets
of spatial ability, and the meta-analyses that have separated these facets do not
report within-sex variances (Voyer et al., 1995). In the just-described study of
female-to-male transsexuals, the postandrogen increase in 3-D spatial ability was
accompanied by a 54% increase in within-group variation on this test (Slabbekoorn et
al., 1999). Levine and colleagues assessed a sample of 547 children from high-,
middle-, and low-income backgrounds across the second and third grades on two spatial
tasks (2-D rotation and an aerial map) and a syntax comprehension test (Levine,
Vasilyeva, Lourenco, Newcombe, &amp; Huttenlocher, 2005). There were no sex
differences on the syntax test, as expected, but males d5 outperformed females on
both spatial tasks ( s .35, .23) but only for children from high- and middle-income
families. There were no sex differences for the low-income children. In other words,
the low income level of the family was associated with lower scores for both males
and females on all three tests, but, in comparison to same-sex peers, the scores of
males seemed to be more strongly affected by poverty, especially for the spatial
tasks. The results are consistent with evolutionary predictions regarding the
influence of environmental circumstance on within-sex variation in traits that are
potentially related to sexual selection. Further studies are needed to confirm this
pattern and to more explicitly test the prediction that males growing up in difficult
circumstances will be more strongly affected for traits predicted to be related to
sexual selection (e.g., 3-D spatial cognition, which is needed to travel long
distances for warfare and for hunting-both primarily male activities) than for other
traits (e.g., grammatical structure of utterances). Development When they are found,
sex differences in developmental activities are predicted to mirror sex differences
in patterns of competition and choice that have evolved by means of sexual selection,
and the proximate expression is predicted to be influenced by prenatal and postnatal
exposure to sex hormones, as well as by social context (Geary, 1998; Pellegrini,
2004). Testing these predictions is complicated by the influence of early and current
experiences on within-sex variation, and thus there is the potential for the
magnitude of any sex differences to vary with context. Moreover, it is not always
clear when in development an evolved sex difference might be expressed. As mentioned
earlier, in many species, sex differences are small or nonexistent early in life and
increase in magnitude as individuals approach reproductive maturation. But the
developmental sex differences in behavior or cognition can emerge early if they
provide practice for adult activities. With humans, early sex differences have been
found in many domains, ranging from play and toy preferences (Golombok &amp; Rust,
1993) to peer relationships (Rose &amp; Rudolph, 2006), but the relation of these
behaviors to sexual selection remains to be explored. In keeping with the focus on
spatial abilities, and as described earlier, a male advantage on some spatial tasks
emerges in childhood (e.g., Johnson &amp; Meade, 1987) and perhaps during the
preschool years (Levine et al., 1999). Levine et al. found an 1 advantage of 4 - to
7-year-old males on a test that involved the 2 rotation or transformation of 2-D
shapes; unlike results for adults, the females were slightly more variable as a
group. Voyer et al.'s (1995) meta-analysis revealed a male advantage in d5 childhood
for a measure of 3-D spatial cognition ( .33) that was about the same magnitude as
that found by Levine et al. By adulthood, the magnitude of the male advantage doubled
d ( 5.66). Voyer et al.'s (1995) analysis is informative, but it is based largely on
cross-sectional data. Longitudinal studies of this emerging sex difference and
potential contributing mechanisms are needed. If these sex differences are a
reflection of human evolutionary history, then the mechanisms should include a
combination of prenatal and postnatal exposure to sex hormones and a sex difference
in spatial-related activity preferences. At the same time, it must be emphasized that
any such influences do not preclude cultural and socialization effects; and in fact,
cultural and social effects are expected to have greater effects on a slow-developing
and highly social species such as humans than they would on faster-developing
species. In any case, data about the relation between prenatal exposure to androgens
and sex differences in spatial abilities are mixed and difficult to interpret,
especially in light of the complexity of assessing spatial abilities in very young
children and in determining levels of prenatal hormone exposure (Cohen-Bendahan, van
de Beek, Berenbaum, 2005; Hines et al., 2003). Moreover, there is a postnatal surge
in androgens in males, but we do not know if or how it is related to the development
of spatial cognition. It is also possible that the relation between prenatal hormone
exposure and spatial cognition is indirect and mediated by hormone-influenced sex
differences in activity preferences, which in turn would result in a gradually
emerging sex difference in spatial abilities. Following the preschool years in both
industrial and traditional societies, males' play ranges (size of area in which they
are permitted to roam during play) are 1.5 to 3.0 times the size of females' play
ranges; in general, parents are more restrictive of the play ranges of females. But
sex differences emerge in the absence of these restrictions (Matthews, 1992; Whiting
&amp; Edwards, 1988). Although the relation between these activities and the widening
male advantage on spatial measures remains to be convincingly demonstrated, it is an
intriguing possibility that merits further study. Critiques of Evolutionary
Explanations of Sex Differences in Science and Math Although the explanations offered
by psychologists with an evolutionary perspective are congruent with many research
findings, numerous thoughtful critiques that provide alternative explanations have
been offered. For example, Newcombe (2007) and others (Halpern, 2000) have countered
the underlying argument that males in their role as hunters in early societies needed
navigational skills to traverse large distances with the fact that women also needed
to travel large distances in their role as gatherers. Although vegetation remains
stationary, women needed to travel long distances to gather edible plants that
ripened in different seasons of the year, escape from predators, and move their
living sites with the seasons. Many of the tasks that females in traditional
societies engaged in also required spatial skills, such as weaving (baskets were
essential for gathering food) and making pots and other vessels for the household.
These critiques are important to consider, as is the proposal that the male advantage
in spatial abilities may be more strongly related to tribal warfare than to hunting,
and that activities such as weaving emerged more recently than tool construction
(e.g., weapons), which is almost exclusively a male activity (Murdock, 1981).
Newcombe also raises the fact that the relationship between testosterone levels and
spatial ability is not linear. Males with lower levels of testosterone and women with
higher levels of testosterone have the best visuospatial abilities, a finding that
some have argued is inconsistent with evolutionary theory (Moffat &amp; Hampson,
1996). A response to this concern is that it does not necessarily follow that male
behaviors and cognitions associated with sexual selection will be linearly related to
testosterone or any other hormone. There are potential costs to prolonged exposure to
high levels of testosterone (e.g., premature death). In addition, circulating hormone
levels do not provide information about the effects of prenatal hormone exposure.
Several investigators have found that spatial abilities vary over the menstrual
cycle, with high scores on mental-rotation tests during the menstrual phase and low
scores during the midluteal phase ( d5.85; Halpern, &amp; Tan, 2001; Hausmann, &#xA8;
&#xA8; &#xA8; Slabbekoorn, Van Goozen, Cohen-Kettenis, &amp; Gunturkun, 2000).
Evolutionary theories also would have difficulty explaining monthly variations in
spatial abilities for women (but see Sherry &amp; Hampson, 1997). Different
approaches to explaining data that pertain to cognitive sex differences in humans
have led to heated debates among proponents of different positions. We leave it to
readers to weigh the reasoning and evidence on all sides of these debates. The
authors of this report differ in the extent to which they attribute contemporary
cognitive sex differences to evolutionary history, with evolutionary psychologists
maintaining that the male brain is naturally better prepared to perform some spatial
tasks and others who feel that the weight of the evidence is clearly on the
environmental side. Some psychologists have taken a more middle-of-the-road position
by accepting the importance of evolution in shaping reproductive-related behaviors
but emphasizing the principle that human behavior adapts to the context in which it
develops. So while modern humans owe an evolutionary debt to our hunterand-gatherer
ancestors, the requirements of modern living may play a greater role in understanding
how females and males develop their cognitive abilities. In thinking about the
evolutionary heritage, it is important to keep in mind the fact that our ancestors
did not engage in the prolonged study of advanced topics in science and math (Geary,
2007). Other perspectives stress the importance of sex differences in life
experiences.<component x="62.99" y="65.44" width="246.1" height="385.81" page="20"

ultimately expressed in tissue structure and function, and efforts to understand the
biological substrates of sex differences in cognition require an examination of brain
anatomy and physiology. Because our focus is on math and science abilities, our most
direct data necessarily involve humans; however, ethical and technical considerations
prevent rigorous experimental work of the kind possible in nonhuman species.
Furthermore, when examining the neurobiology of behavior within a species, it is
important to consider the additional complexity of age effects. Beginning in the
early 1980s, several safe methods for obtaining reliable measures of brain structure
and function became available, and there have since been several large-scale efforts
to examine sex differences in brain anatomy and physiology. The basic aim in these
studies is to understand how the brain's activity relates to its structures and
functions. A thorough review of this literature is beyond our scope. Instead, we
briefly describe the main findings from neuroimaging in which sex differences in the
brain and behavior have been established. Notably, because of their expense, most
studies using neuroimaging have been conducted for purposes other than examining sex
differences in the healthy brain. Nonetheless, several largescale prospective samples
have produced consistent findings. These findings support some hypotheses relating to
the neural substrates for sex differences in science and mathematical abilities and
suggest future directions for research. Sex Differences in Brain Structure When it
became possible for researchers to peer into healthy living brains while individuals
were engaged in cognitive tasks, one of the first questions they asked was whether
there are reliable differences between women and men in areas of the brain that are
involved in the cognitive tasks in which sex differences are usually found. This
question led investigators to focus specifically on the overall size of the brain;
the frontal and temporal regions that regulate language and memory; and the corpus
callosum, a key structure for integrating brain activity across the cerebral
hemispheres. Sex Differences in Cerebral Volume The first studies to reveal new sex
differences in the human brain used a noninvasive procedure to measure the proportion
of tissue with fast blood flow-presumably, gray matter. Gray matter refers to areas
of the brain where cell bodies and their immediate dendrites are closely packed.
These studies showed substantial sex differences in the proportion of gray matter, as
well as higher rates of blood flow, which suggests a greater proportion of gray
matter, in women (R.C. Gur et al., 1982; R.E. Gur &amp; Gur, 1990). The current
method for studying brain anatomy in humans is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Structural MRI studies can be used to segment tissue into gray matter, both cortical
and deep; white matter (areas of long axons covered with a fatty-hence
''white''-myelin sheath that aids in the rapid conductance of nerve impulses); and
cerebrospinal fluid (that both nourishes and cushions the brain), as illustrated in
Figure 6, which shows these basic brain structures. Replicating the earlier findings,
neuroimaging studies found a higher percentage of gray matter in females, but with
MRI it was possible to establish also that males had higher volumes of white matter
and cerebrospinal fluid (Blatter et al., 1995; Coffey et al., 1998; Filipek,
Richelme, Kennedy, &amp; Caviness, 1994; R.C. Gur et al., 1999; Passe et al., 1997;
Pfefferbaum et al., 1994). Thus, on average, White females (who were used for these
studies) have a smaller cranial volume (head size) than White males do. The higher
proportion of gray matter in females and greater amount of white matter and
cerebrospinal fluid in males results in similar absolute volumes of gray matter in
men and women. It is noteworthy that life-span developmental sex differences have
been found in the brain, with consistent reports that, with normal aging, brain
volume, especially gray matter, declines faster in men than in women in middle to
late adulthood (Coffey et al., 1998; Good et al., 2001; R.C. Gur et al., 1991). Sex
differences in hemispheric asymmetries also have been documented, with greater
asymmetries in the percentage of gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid in males
compared to females (Coffey et al., 1998; R.C. Gur et al., 1999). As shown in Figure
7, for males, the percentage of gray matter was higher in the left hemisphere, the
percentage of white matter was symmetric, and the percentage of cerebrospinal fluid
was higher on the right. No asymmetries were significant in females, and the
differences in laterality between males and females were significant. These
hemispheric differences were, however, quite small in absolute terms, and did not
overshadow the main sex differences in cerebral volume. Thus, although males had a
higher percentage of gray matter in the left relative to the right hemisphere and
females had more symmetric gray matter, females still had a higher percentage of gray
matter than males in both hemispheres. Anatomic differences between the brains of
males and those of females can provide information about the neural substrates for
sex differences in cognition only if the differences in brain anatomies correlate
with performance on cognitive tasks. R.C. Gur et al. (1999) first examined whether a
sample of males and females showed the reported sex difference of better verbal
relative to spatial performance in females compared to males. As expected, the males
and females did not differ in the Global (mean of Verbal and Spatial) performance
score, but the Verbal Superiority index (Verbal minus Spatial) was positive in
females and negative in males. Furthermore, performance correlated with intracranial
volumes, for the whole sample as well as for males and females considered separately.
While these correlations were moderate, scatter-plots suggested that relationships
were quite uniform across the range of brain volumes and performance values for both
gray and white matter, whereas the correlations with cerebrospinal-fluid volumes were
nil (within this age range of adults less than 50 years of age). Consistent with
these findings, Haier and colleagues (Colom, Jung, &amp; Haier 2006; Haier, Jung,
Yeo, Head, &amp; Alkire, 2005) reported that gg5 higher -loadings ( general
intelligence) of individual tests were associated with increased gray-matter volume
throughout the brain. It should be noted that despite the significant sex difference
in spatial performance, most women in R.C. Gur et al.'s (1999) study performed
comparably to the men on the spatial tests. As suggested in several sections of this
monograph, it is possible that (some) females may achieve high levels of spatial
performance using different strategies than males and possibly by using different
regions of the brain. Haier et al. (2005) also found that males and females may solve
some complex problems, such as items on IQ tests, differently, with females showing a
greater use of language-related brain regions and males showing greater use of
spatial-related brain regions. Specifically, the researchers used an advanced method
(voxel-based morphometry) for comparing the gray matter in two groups of
participants; they reported that, on average, compared to men, ''women show more
white matter and fewer gray matter areas related to intelligence. In men IQ/gray
matter correlations are strongest in frontal and parietal lobes (regions BA [Brodmann
area] 8, 9, 39, 40), whereas, the strongest correlations in women are in the frontal
lobe (region BA10) along with Broca's area'' (p. 320). Broca's area of the brain has
long been known to underlie language production. Thus, based on these analyses of the
brain, the evidence suggests that, on average, women's performance on measures of
intelligence may be more related to language centers than is men's performance on
these same measures. Sex Differences in Corpus Callosum Structure In contrast to
overall lower white-matter volume in females, there is some controversial evidence
that the largest whitematter structure in the brain, the corpus callosum, is more
bulbous in females. The corpus callosum is the primary means of communication between
the two cerebral hemispheres, prompting investigators to hypothesize that differences
in callosal size exist between males and females and that female brains may be more
bilaterally organized for language. Because the corpus callosum has an irregular
shape, there have been many controversies over how best to measure its size or
volume. Most investigators have examined the shape and size of the mid-sagittal
section of the callosum as a surrogate for the structure's overall shape. To date,
however, no consensus has been reached on the presence of sex-based differences in
the callosum. De Lacoste-Utamsing and Holloway (1982) reported that the female
splenium (a portion of the corpus callosum) was more bulbous than the tubual male
splenium. Follow-up studies by De Lacoste-Utamsing, Holloway, and Woodward (1986;
Yoshi et al., 1986; Allen, Richey, Chai, &amp; Gorski, 1991) all found increased size
in the female splenium. In contrast, Going and Dixson (1990) and Witelson (1985)
reported no such differences between the callosa of males and females. A possible
reason for this continuing controversy is a general lack of standards for callosal
analysis. While cross-sectional area and callosal length are the more traditional
indices reported in sex-difference investigations, there is little agreement over how
to normalize these indices. Furthermore, gross dimensional measures will miss
regional shape variations in callosa. Some investigators have divided the callosum
into partitions and compared the areas of corresponding partitions between study
groups (Witelson, 1985). This approach does not solve the problem of normalization,
and the exact partitions used are arbitrary. Furthermore, partitioning schemes may
still miss regional morphologic differences. Template deformation morphometry (TDM)
avoids many of the pitfalls associated with more traditional methods for measuring
the callosum. By comparing each subject to a template callosum, TDM avoids the issue
of normalizing callosal measurements to some arbitrary index of overall brain size.
Davatzikos and Resnick (1998) used TDM and demonstrated that the splenium was larger
in females than it was in males. Dubb, Gur, Avants, and Gee's (2003) TDM analysis
likewise demonstrated sexual dimorphism in the splenium of the corpus callosum, with
larger volumes in females. They also found relatively larger genu (the anterior part
of the callosum) in males. The reason for the intense debate over the corpus callosum
is that a larger callosum in women supports the idea of greater connectivity between
the two hemispheres, and a host of predictions, such as faster access to nonverbal
information, might result from such a difference. It may also explain females' better
retention of language skills following unilateral brain damage, because language
functions would be more likely to occur in both hemispheres. The Need for
Developmental and Longitudinal Studies Studies of young infants and children
(Matsuzawa et al., 2001), and especially longitudinal studies (Giedd et al., 1999),
may help explain the causal direction and the development of sex differences in the
relation between brain neuroanatomy and cognitive performance. Giedd et al.
demonstrated sex differences in the pattern of gray- and white-matter development.
The curves that represented gray- and white-matter development were similar for girls
and boys but tended to peak at different ages. The peaks tended to be earlier (e.g.,
in terms of peak gray-matter volume for the frontal cortex) for females than they
were for males, except for the temporal cortex, where females peaked at a slightly
older age. A notable pattern was that occipital gray matter had not yet peaked for
males by age 22 but peaked around age 13 for females. White matter increased for both
sexes from 4 to 22 years, but at a higher rate for males than for females. The
increased brain-development period for males, especially with respect to white matter
and occipital gray matter, is intriguing given that these correlate with spatial
performance in adults. The extended developmental period also makes male brain
development more vulnerable to environmental conditions: Good health and nutrition
are needed by males for a longer period of time to achieve their full potential,
because brain development takes place over a longer period of time for males than it
does for females. More recent studies have noted that correlations between regional
brain structure and measures of cognitive performance evolve with development, and
the sex differences seen in adult samples could be absent in childhood (Shaw et al.,
2006). To summarize the anatomic studies: Some sex differences are evident across the
age range. In general, females have a higher percentage of tissue devoted to neuronal
cell bodies and their immediate dendritic connections (gray matter), while males have
a higher volume of connecting white-matter tissue. An exception is the splenium of
the corpus callosum, a white-matter region that may be more bulbous in females than
males. Furthermore, male brains seem to show greater volumetric asymmetries than
female brains do. The higher white-matter volume may be associated with better
spatial performance in males. A hypothesis suggested by these neuroanatomic data is
that male brains are optimized for enhanced connectivity within hemispheres, as
afforded by overall higher white-matter volumes, while female brains are optimized
for communication between the hemispheres-especially in language-processing and
posterior brain regions, as indicated by the larger callosal splenia (R.E. Gur &amp;
Gur, 2004). In the near future, this hypothesis will be able to be tested directly
using a more advanced MRI method for imaging white-matter integrity, called diffusion
tensor imaging (e.g., Huang et al., 2005; Nucifora, Verma, Melhem, 2005; Salat et
al., 2005). Sex Differences in Brain Function An alternative approach to
investigating sex differences in the anatomy of brain structures is to examine
possible differences in how male and female brains respond to different cognitive
tasks. This approach focuses on functions rather than on structural differences. Sex
Differences in Cerebral Blood Flow Sex differences have not been examined as
extensively with functional as with structural imaging. Using early noninvasive
methods, R.C. Gur et al. (1982) reported that females had higher rates of resting
cerebral blood flow than males did, across all ages (R.C. Gur, Gur, Obrist, Skolnick,
&amp; Reivich, 1987). The basic idea in measuring the rate of blood flow is that
blood is expected to flow fastest in areas of the brain where neurons are most
active. These findings were replicated with positron emission tomography (PET)
studies (Esposito, VanHorn, Weinberger, &amp; Berman, 1996; Kastrup, Li, Glover,
Kruger, &amp; Moseley, 1999; Ragland, Coleman, Gur, Glahn, &amp; Gur, 2000). The
areas of the brain that are active during the performance of cognitive tasks are
sometimes similar across different types of tasks, and sometimes they are
task-related (for discussions see Kastrup et al., 1999). Greater bilateral activation
for language tasks was reported in females. One hypothesis about sex differences in
brain structure and function is that female brains are more bilaterally organized for
language, which means that they rely on brain structures in both hemispheres for
language tasks (e.g., speaking, comprehending), while males are more reliant on brain
structures in one hemisphere (usually the left hemisphere) for the same language
tasks (Shaywitz et al., 1995). For spatial tasks, the better performance of males on
difficult items was associated with more focal activation of right visual-association
areas, again supporting the hypothesis of more lateralization of cognitive abilities
(reliance on one hemisphere) for males (R.C. Gur et al., 2000). In contrast, females
recruited additional regions bilaterally for the more difficult spatial task. This
finding was replicated and extended to mental rotation and numeric calculation by
Kucian, Loenneker, Dietrich, Martin, and von Aster (2005), who also reported more
distributed and bilateral recruitment of brain regions in females than in males as
the complexity of the task increased. &#xA8; Similarly, Gron, Wunderlich, Spitzer,
Tomczak, and Riepe (2000) suggested that males and females used different brain
regions when performing tasks in a 3-D virtual maze. Females demonstrated more
parietal and prefrontal activation (the latter suggesting it was an effortful task),
whereas the males relied more on the hippocampus, suggesting a more automatic
retrieval of geometric-navigation cues. The importance of incorporating a
neurodevelopmental perspective is underscored by several recent studies.
Investigators report substantial developmental changes in the distribution, extent,
and laterality of task-related activation, as well as sex-by-age interactions in
areas of brain activation. It appears that, as with the neuroanatomic measures, adult
patterns of sex differences in brain function are absent or more subtle in children
(Plante, Schmithorst, Holland, &amp; Byars, 2006; Schmithorst &amp; Holland, 2006;
Szaflarski et al., 2006). Here too, longitudinal studies would help us understand the
factors that affect the development of sex differences. Sex Differences in Cerebral
Glucose Metabolism Areas of the brain that are high in metabolic activity ''take up''
(metabolize) more glucose. So one way of studying areas of the brain that underlie
different cognitive domains is to track which regions are metabolizing more glucose
and determine whether these regions differ between women and men. Resting cerebral
metabolic rates for glucose are equal in males and females (Andreason, Zametkin, Guo,
Baldwin, &amp; Cohen, 1994; R.C. Gur et al., 1995; Murphy et al., 1996). Sex
differences are evident in the regional distribution of metabolic activity, with
males showing higher metabolic glucose rates in all motor basal ganglia regions and
the cerebellum, as well as all subcallosal limbic regions, and females showing higher
metabolic glucose rates in the cingulate gyrus, a limbic region closer to language
areas. Females showed more symmetric glucose utilization than males did, which
provides additional evidence to the MRI data for the hypothesis that females are more
bilateralized in the brain structures that underlie cognition than males are (R.C.
Gur et al., 1995; Murphy et al., 1996). Sex Differences in Neurotransmitter Function
Another set of physiological parameters that can be measured with functional
neuroimaging is neurotransmitter function. Depending on the specific
neurotransmitter, the abundance or scarcity of receptors available to respond to any
particular neurotransmitter will facilitate or inhibit different brain functions. Few
studies have included sufficiently large samples to examine sex differences in
neurotransmitter function. Of these, Adams et al. (2004) reported no sex differences
in serotonin binding. However, sex differences were found in dopamine function.
Recent investigations of the relationship between cognition and dopamine transporter
availability in males and females found that females and younger participants had
higher dopamine availability in the caudate nucleus and that these groups also
performed better on verbal learning tasks (Mozley, Gur, Mozley, &amp; Gur, 2001).
Furthermore, dopamine transporter availability was correlated with learning
performance within groups. Relationships between dopamine availability and executive
and motor functioning were observed in females but not in males. These results
provide further evidence for age effects and sex differences in the influences of
dopamine on human behavior. Brain Imaging, Mathematics, and Science To date, there
are only a few brain imaging studies of sciencerelated abilities (e.g., Fugelsang
&amp; Dunbar, 2005), and research on the brain systems involved in even a basic
understanding of mathematics is still in the early stages. Most of the latter
research has focused on representations of number and quantity or the process of
solving simple arithmetic problems (Chochon, Cohen, van de Moortele, &amp; Dehaene,
1999; Dehaene, Spelke, Pinel, Stanescu, &amp; Tsivkin, 1999; Gruber, Indefrey,
Steinmetz, &amp; Kleinschmidt, 2001; Halgren, Boujon, Clarke, Wang, &amp; Chauvel,
2002; Pinel, Piazza, Le Bihan, &amp; Dehaene, 2004; Rickard et al., 2000; Rivera,
Reiss, Eckert, &amp; Menon, 2005; Temple &amp; Posner, 1998; Zorzi, Priftis, &amp;
Umilta, 2002). Except for a tendency of females to use more language-based counting
strategies to solve arithmetic problems and for males to have a small advantage on
estimation tasks, sex differences are not typically found for these basic numerical
domains (M. Carr &amp; Jessup, 1997; Jordan, Hanich, &amp; Kaplan, 2003). Thus, the
current studies are not sufficient for making judgments about sex differences in
brain activity during the processing of mathematical information. It has been
consistently found that magnitude comparison (Dehaene et al., 1999; Temple &amp;
Posner, 1998), mental number line (Zorzi et al., 2002), and many arithmetic tasks
(Chochon et al., 1999; Rivera et al., 2005) bilaterally engage a structure in the
inferior parietal lobe, the intraparietal sulcus, although other regions are also
engaged (e.g., frontal regions associated with working memory; Rivera et al., 2005).
The intraparietal sulcus is also active in nonhuman animals when they engage in
numerical activities (Sawamura, Shima, &amp; Tanji, 2002; R.F. Thompson, Mayers,
Robertson, &amp; Patterson, 1970), and it is anatomically very near to the
visual-spatial and posterior spatial-attentional systems that are engaged when
navigating and when mentally simulating how objects can be used as tools (Hodges,
Spatt, &amp; Patterson, 1999; Vanduffel et al., 2002). In fact, Pinel et al. (2004)
found that the brain regions that represent numerical magnitude also represent
spatial magnitude, and Zorzi et al. (2002) found that individuals with injury to the
right parietal cortex showed deficits in spatial orientation and number-line
estimation. Dehaene et al. (1999) showed adults' computational estimation also may be
dependent on a similar parietal-spatial system that supports generation of a mental
number line. On the basis of a structural MRI study, Goldstein et al. (2001) found
the inferior parietal lobe was 25% larger in males than in females in absolute terms,
and 20% larger when an adjustment was made for the sex difference in overall brain
volume; this region also has a high density of sex-hormone receptors during prenatal
development, at least in some species. Whether these areas are part of a system of
biologically primary quantitative abilities or evolved for other functions is
currently debated (e.g., Dehaene, 2003; Geary, in press; Pinel et al., 2004). Either
way, children's intuitive understanding of quantity, magnitude, and simple addition
and subtraction appear to provide the core for their learning of mathematics in
school (Geary, 1995; Gelman, 1990; Spelke, 2000), and the supporting brain systems
may bias how children represent and understand biologically secondary (school-taught)
forms of mathematics. Geary, for instance, argued that the brain and cognitive
systems that evolved to support navigation have implicit geometric knowledge built
into their organization, because the function of these systems is to respond to and
manipulate geometric features of physical space (Dehaene, Izard, Pica, &amp; Spelke,
2006; Shepard, 1994). In an fMRI study of humans and monkeys, Vanduffel et al. (2002)
found that the intraparietal sulcus was engaged when humans, but not monkeys,
understood that geometric forms were three-dimensional based on movement cues. They
concluded that ''under evolutionary pressure, parietal but not earlier regions
adapted to implement human-specific abilities such as excellent motiondependent 3D
vision for manipulating fine tools'' (p. 415). The studies conducted to date are not
conclusive, but they provide converging evidence that the same brain regions that
support early and possibly biologically primary quantitative abilities-or, at the
very least, regions anatomically adjacent to them-are also involved in aspects of
spatial cognition, complex object representation, and tool use. If these regions
provide a core for early learning of biologically secondary mathematical knowledge,
such as place value (i.e., three digits signifies hundreds, two digits signifies
tens, and so on), then children might be biased such that this knowledge would be
more readily learned when represented spatially (e.g., a mental number line). To the
extent that these areas are larger in males than in females, a male advantage is
predicted in (a) the tendency to rely on spatial representations for solving
mathematical problems, (b) intuitive knowledge of certain features of geometry, and
(c) ease of learning mathematics when it is presented in a spatial format.
Alternatively, given the advantage of females in language domains, a female bias in
the tendency to represent mathematical problems in a verbal format is predicted and,
as discussed earlier, is found for solving the types of problems on standardized
mathematicalabilities tests such as the GRE (Gallagher et al., 2002). Moreover, a
male advantage in engineering and science tasks that involve object manipulation or
generating complex 3-D images is predicted, as is a male advantage for integrating
mathematical knowledge into spatially based science and engineering tasks, to the
extent the intraparietal and adjacent regions are engaged with these tasks.
Speculative Hypotheses on the Relation of Neural Structures to Science and
Mathematics The state of knowledge on the neurobiology of sex differences does not
permit strong statements, predictions, or recommendations. Especially lacking are
large-scale studies in which science and mathematics abilities are rigorously
measured and related to brain anatomy and physiology. Nonetheless, several tentative
hypotheses can be proposed. Anatomically, male brains appear to be optimized for
connectivity within the hemispheres, while female brains appear to have better
interhemispheric connectivity. For females, better interhemispheric communication
confers an advantage in language and the ability to better integrate
verbal-analytical (left-hemispheric) with spatial-holistic (right-hemispheric) modes
of information processing. Biologically, females have higher cerebral blood flow, and
the metabolic glucose rates show differences for women and men that vary with brain
region. Activation studies support the notion that females perform better on tasks
such as language processing that require bilateral activation, while males excel in
tasks requiring focal activation of the visual association cortex. Studies by
O'Boyle, Gill, Benbow, and Alexander (1994) found that the right hemisphere may play
a role in linguistic processing for mathematically precocious youth, a population
that, as we discussed earlier, displays sex differences in mathematical and
visuospatial abilities. Single-Sex Schools None of the data regarding brain structure
or function suggest that girls and boys learn differently or that either sex would
benefit from single-sex schools, yet that is exactly the claim that is driving a
rapid increase in such schools. According to Sax (cited in MSNBC, 2006), who is the
director of the National Association for Single-Sex Schools, at least 223 public
schools across the country already offer some single-sex classrooms- up from 4 in
1998. Those who support single-sex schools have argued that new information about
brain differences for girls and boys should change how we think about single-sex
education and that each sex should be taught in a way that is compatible with its
brain. Others who favor single-sex education provide social reasons for their
support. Their argument is based on the idea that girls and boys spend too much time
impressing each other when they are in the same classes and that, by separating them,
each sex will be more focused on school work. As already noted, girls get better
grades in school in every subject and are now attending college at substantially
higher rates than boys are. These data, which represent increased academic and career
success over the decades when the number of single-sex schools declined, do not
support the reasoning behind such schooling. The relative success of girls in
academic settings has been labeled a ''boy crisis'' in the popular media (e.g., Tyre,
2006). Thus, one reason for proposing single-sex schools is to stem the loss of boys
from higher education. But boys score higher than girls on standardized tests in math
and science from the end of secondary school through graduate school, so it is not
true that boys are failing to learn in coeducational schools-each sex is showing
superior performance on different types of measures of learning. The question of
whether grades in school or scores on standardized tests are better or more valid
measures is a matter of considerable dispute. Some critics have argued that the
grade-test disparity shows that schools are biased against boys; while others have
argued that standardized tests are biased against girls. The data show different
patterns of achievement on different types of assessments, so it could also be argued
that, given an appropriate assessment, both sexes show evidence of learning in math
and science. Several different meta-analyses have examined the data in support of the
claim that single-sex education is advantageous for either girls or boys. In a
conceptual overview of single-sex education, Salomone (2006) asks: ''Is there any
evidence that separating students on the basis of sex might make a positive
difference in academic performance and achievement or social adjustment, at least for
some students?'' (p. 791). She considers a range of possible advantages, including
those that are motivational, social, and educational. Salomone concludes that ''the
evidence is undeniably inadequate'' (p. 791). The Campbell Collaboration (2001) is a
nonprofit organization that aims to help people make well-informed decisions about
the effects of interventions in the social, behavioral, and educational arenas. They
commission reviews that ''synthesize evidence on social and behavioural interventions
and public policy, including education, criminal justice, and social welfare, among
other areas. The primary concern is with evidence on overall intervention or policy
effectiveness and how effectiveness is influenced by variations in process and
implementation, intervention components and recipients, as well as other factors''
(The Campbell Collaboration, 2001). In two separate reviews of single-sex education,
the conclusions were the same. In the words of one of the reviews: ''The paradox of
single-sex and co-education is that the beliefs are so strong and the evidence is so
weak'' (Smithers &amp; Robinson, 2006, p 31).<component x="321.05" y="162.61"

applying the findings about brain structures and function to cognitive sex
differences, it is important to keep in mind the fact that the environment also
shapes the brain. Consider these two examples: A study of London cab drivers found
that they had enlarged portions of their right posterior hippocampus relative to a
control group of adults whose employment required less use of spatial skills. The cab
drivers showed a positive correlation between the size of the region of the
hippocampus that is activated during recall of complex routes and the number of years
they worked in this occupation (Maguire, Frackowiak, &amp; Frith, 1997; Maguire et
al., 2000). The finding that the size of the hippocampus varied as a function of
years spent driving taxis makes it likely that it was a lifetime of complex
way-finding that caused the brain structure used in certain visuospatial tasks to
increase in size, although other explanations also are possible. In a second recent
study, a 3-month period of juggling practice led to an increase in greymatter density
in the putative motion-processing region of the temporal cortex (MT/V5; Draganski et
al., 2004), showing a direct relationship between behavior and brain morphology (the
brain area also changed back when the juggling practice stopped). These findings are
consistent with many studies of nonhuman species and demonstrate that experience can
alter the biological underpinnings of behavior and cognition-including the size of
brain structures-making the nature-nurture distinction difficult to resolve. These
data are important because they suggest that sex differences in structures or
functions of the<component x="321.05" y="65.44" width="246.07" height="335.58"

lateness="0.6862745098039216" reference_score="19.18">The evidence for social and
cultural influences on sex differences in math and science performance is plentiful
and varied. First, we consider five categories of evidence: (a) research on family,
neighborhood, peer, and school influences; (b) research on stereotype threat; (c)
training studies; (d) cross-cultural analyses; and (e) trends over time. Then, we
shift to the question of occupational choice and examine sociocultural influences on
that process. Finally, we review the evidence on the impact of sex discrimination and
women's roles. Family, Neighborhood, Peer, and School Influences There are multiple
influences of parents, peers, and the schools on children's development (e.g.,
Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 1998; Vandell, 2000). Here we focus on these influences
specifically in the domains of abilities, academic performance, and self-efficacy
beliefs. A limitation to some of these studies is that they simply report a
correlation, for example, between parents' estimates of their children's mathematics
ability and the children's scores on a standardized test. From this correlation, we
cannot infer the direction of causality. We cannot tell whether the parents' beliefs
in their children influence the children's performance or whether the opposite
process occurs-that children's test scores influence their parents' estimates of
their abilities. Moreover, it may be that both processes occur in reciprocal fashion.
Some researchers have used more advanced designs, such as longitudinal research or
controlling for ability at the time of the first measurement, to try to sort out
these issues; most recently, reciprocal-effects modeling has been applied &#xA8;
&#xA8; (Marsh, Trautwein, Ludtke, Koller, &amp; Baumert, 2005). We note the studies
that use these more advanced methods. Similarly, when researchers find evidence of
correlations between afterschool activities (e.g., participation in a computer club)
and math performance, it is difficult to know whether participation improves math
performance or whether youth with stronger math skills choose to participate in such
activities. The latter follows from the expectation that, to some extent, children
will create their own environments and seek niches consistent with their interests
and abilities (Scarr, 1996; Scarr &amp; McCartney, 1983). Numerous studies have
confirmed the finding that parents' expectations for their children's academic
abilities and success are correlated with the children's self-concept of their own
ability and their subsequent performance (e.g., Bleeker &amp; Jacobs, 2004; Parsons,
Adler, &amp; Kaczala, 1982). Parents' level of education correlates with their
children's mathematics achievement, even when children's math ability and attitudes
are controlled, an effect that holds across cultures (Schiller, Khmelkov, &amp; Wang,
2002). Higher levels of parental involvement with their children's education is
correlated with higher levels of children's performance in mathematics (Muller,
1998), although Raymond and Benbow (1986) found that parents were equally supportive
of their mathematically talented sons and daughters. Parental involvement also
covaries with successful placement of students in higher-ability mathematics groups
(Useem, 1992). More specific studies are needed to determine whether parents show
sex-differentiated treatment of their children in important matters such as
intervening to have them placed in high-math-ability classes. Lytton and Romney
(1991) conducted a meta-analysis of studies of parents' differential socialization of
boys versus girls in western cultures. Although overall they found evidence of
similarity in treatment of boys and girls (e.g., warmth d5(.07, discipline d5.07),
the studies may not be relevant to the questions addressed in this report. Parents
treated males and females similarly in encouraging achievement ( d5.02), but this
measure did not differentiate areas, such as language arts or mathematics, in which
achievement was encouraged. The notable exception to this pattern of similar
treatment was encouragement of sex-typed activities and sex-typed perceptions of the
child, which was sex-differentiated ( d50.34 for mothers, d50.49 for fathers). That
is, parents, especially fathers, encouraged sex-typed behavior-particularly, fathers
discouraged their sons from playing with dolls. The question, then, is the extent to
which these sex-typed experiences may contribute to sex differences in math and
science abilities. Sociologists and psychologists have also studied neighborhood
effects-that is, effects outside the home that have an impact on children (e.g.,
Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2004). One well-sampled study of children in
kindergarten and first grade found that boys' gains in math reasoning were more
sensitive to neighborhood resources than were those of girls (Entwistle, Alexander,
&amp; Olson, 1994), which is consistent with the earlier suggestion that male
development is more sensitive to environmental conditions. The effect was to create
more variability among males in their math performance. By middle school, when
children were tracked for math classes, males in the high track were outscoring
females in the high track, even though sex differences were not significant in the
full sample. The researchers traced this greater variability for males to their early
sensitivity to neighborhood effects. In the Entwistle et al. study, there were
reports that boys in the summer after first grade were more likely than girls to be
monitored less closely by their parents, go to recreation centers, and play organized
sports, whereas girls were more likely to play in the house and thus had less freedom
to move about the neighborhood. Similar patterns continued in middle school. These
differential experiences may give boys more spatial experience and, in complex games,
more spatial and mathematical experience. Consistent with this idea, Matthews (1986,
1987) found that, by age 11, boys show greater spatial knowledge than girls do-as
demonstrated, for example, by making a map of a familiar area-and attributed this
difference to girls' lesser experience of roaming over their environment, which in
turn may be related to parents' greater restrictions placed on girls as well as by
child-initiated sex differences in size of the play range, suggesting that girls may
opt for activities that include less roaming than those chosen by boys. Children and
adolescents are strongly influenced by peers (Harris, 1995; Rubin, Bukowski, &amp;
Parker, 1998). Here we focus on peer influence on academic performance and
motivation. Children's math grades are correlated with the average verbal and math
skills of the children in their peer group (Kurdek &amp; Sinclair, 2000). Children
tend to become part of peer groups who are similar to them in regard to academic
motivation or academic performance, making cause-and-effect inferences difficult
(Altermatt &amp; Pomerantz, 2003; Kindermann, 1993; Crosnoe, Cavanagh, &amp; Elder,
2003). Nonetheless, children appear to stereotype mathematics as masculine. In one
study, girls rated men as liking mathematics more and being better at mathematics
than women, although the girls rated boys and girls as equal on these variables (J.
Steele, 2003; see also Heyman &amp; Legare, 2004). In a Finnish study, second-,
fourth-, and sixth-grade children were asked to identify the child who was best in
their class in language arts and in &#xA8; mathematics (Raty, Kasanen, Kiiskinen,
&amp; Nykky, 2004). In language arts, boys and girls were nominated evenly. However,
in mathematics, the boys nominated only boys from the second grade on, and the girls
began nominating more boys than girls beginning in fourth grade. By middle
adolescence, girls generally receive less peer support for science activities than
boys do (Stake &amp; Nickens, 2005). Science enrichment programs can be helpful in
counteracting these effects, by giving girls a science-supportive peer network (Stake
&amp; Nickens, 2005). Peer influence, of course, is not limited to childhood and
adolescence. Holland and Eisenhart (1990) conducted an ethnographic study of females
entering college-at either a southern, predominantly White university or a southern,
historically Black college-who were planning to major in mathEducated in Romance
ematics or science. The title of their book, , reflects their finding that these
young women lost their way on the science path during college, being swept away by
the search for a romantic partner, which reduced their career ambitions. Holland and
Eisenhart concluded that faculty and administrators actually had little impact on the
women's choices of career and major; the guiding forces came from peer relationships.
It remains to be seen whether female students would be swept away at universities
such as MIT or CalTech or whether female students who enter these science-intensive
environments differ from women who enter other universities. In either case, the peer
environment, as well as women's own preferences, during the undergraduate years may
result in a loss of women who are prepared to enter graduate training in science and
mathematics. Herzig's (2004) analysis of women choosing or leaving doctoral programs
in mathematics also emphasized peer and other contextual influences. To persist in
their doctoral program, students must feel integrated into their community of
practice, which means that they must not feel isolated, as women may if they are
small in number in a graduate program in mathematics, physics, or engineering. Men,
in contrast, may not need as much peer support and social integration to persist in
these programs. Schools may exert an influence in multiple ways, including via
teachers' attitudes and behaviors, curricula, ability groupings, and sex composition
of classrooms (Roeser, Eccles, &amp; Sameroff, 2000). For example, ability grouping
in mathematics tends to benefit high-ability students (Colangelo, Assouline, &amp;
Gross, 2004; Mulkey, Catsambis, Steelman, &amp; Crain, 2005). When combined with
implicit instruction (e.g., questioning of students' experimental results) or
explicit instruction (e.g,. Klahr &amp; Nigam, 2004; Kuhn &amp; Dean, 2005), hands-on
laboratory experiences are especially important for learning in the physical sciences
in middle school and high school. An important point for this report is that,
although laboratory experiences do not improve the physical-science achievement of
boys, they do improve the achievement of girls, thereby helping to close the gender
gap in these areas (Burkam, Lee, &amp; Smerdon, 1997; Lee &amp; Burkam, 1996). A
complementary set of studies has investigated whether boys and girls do, in fact,
experience different learning environments relevant to mathematics and science, both
in school and out of school. In science and mathematics classes, teachers are more
likely to encourage boys to ask questions and to explain concepts (American
Association of University Women, 1995; Jones &amp; Wheatley, 1990; Kelly, 1988). In
one study of high-school geometry classrooms, teachers directed 61% of their praise
comments and 55% of their high-level open questions to boys (Becker, 1981).
Experiences such as these are thought to give children a deeper conceptual knowledge
of, and more interest in, science, although this relation has not been fully
established. Moreover, as Kelly (1988) noted, even an apparently small difference
between teachers spending 44% of their time with girls and 56% with boys could
translate-via extrapolation-to 1,800 more hours with males over a child's school
career of 15,000 hours. Science-education researchers refer to out-of-school learning
as informal learning. The quality of students' informal learning environments
correlates with their performance on tests of scientific reasoning ability (Gerber,
Carvallo, &amp; Marek, 2001). For example, presence of a computer in the home for
educational purposes and use of a home computer predict performance on standardized
tests of mathematics (Downey &amp; Yuan, 2005). Compared with high-school girls,
high-school boys are more likely to have computers in their homes for educational
purposes and are more likely to use them (Downey &amp; Yuan, 2005). When engaged in a
science task-playing with magnets-mothers talk about the science process (e.g., they
use explanations and generate hypotheses) more with boys than with girls (Tenenbaum,
Snow, Roach, &amp; Kurland, 2005). Moreover, the amount of mothers' science-process
talk predicts children's comprehension of readings about science 2 years later. When
parents and children use interactive science exhibits at a museum, parents are three
times more likely to explain science to boys than to girls (Crowley, Callanan,
Tenenbaum, &amp; Allen, 2001). High-school boys are more likely to have participated
in a math or science fair and, as with the activities noted above, this activity
affects standardized mathematics test performance (Downey &amp; Yuan, 2005). Thus,
informal learning environments relevant to mathematics and science appear to differ
for boys and girls. However, it is not clear to what extent these relations are due
to parental assumptions of the interests and abilities of boys and girls, to
differences in the responsiveness of boys and girls to these activities, or to some
combination. Of course, schools do not exert absolute power over students, and
students are not passive recipients of their experiences. Students exercise choice in
school activities and in informal learning. Crucial to this discussion is students'
choice in high school to take advanced mathematics and science courses. The gender
gap in mathematics course enrollment has narrowed over the last several decades, so
that by 1998 girls were as likely as boys to have taken advanced mathematics courses,
including Advanced Placement calculus (National Science Foundation, 2005). Girls were
actually slightly more likely than males to take advanced biology (40.8% of females
vs. 33.8% of males), Advanced Placement biology (5.8% vs. 5.0%), and chemistry (59.2%
vs. 53.3%). Boys, however, were more likely to take Advanced Placement chemistry
(3.3% of males vs. 2.6% of females) and physics (31.0% vs. 26.6%) and were twice as
likely to take Advanced Placement physics (2.3% vs. 1.2%; National Science
Foundation, 2005). The science pipeline heading toward physics, then, begins to leak
early, as fewer girls than boys take the necessary high-school courses to prepare
themselves for college-level physics. Stereotype Threat Stereotype threat is an
influence that has been demonstrated in laboratory settings and may occur in real
testing situations. It was initially identified and theorized to explain differences
in test performance between talented Black and White college students (C.M. Steele,
1997). C.M. Steele proposed that a negative stereotype about one's group leads to
self-doubt and other processes that can then undermine academic performance, perhaps
by impairing working memory. This concept was quickly extended from stereotypes about
Blacks' intellectual inferiority to stereotypes about females' deficiencies in
mathematics (R.P. Brown &amp; Josephs, 1999; Quinn &amp; Spencer, 2001; Spencer,
Steele, &amp; Quinn, 1999; Walsh, Hickey, &amp; Duffy, 1999). In one experiment, male
and female college students with equivalent math backgrounds were tested (Spencer et
al., 1999). Half were told that the math test had shown sex differences in the past,
and half were told that the test had been shown to be gender fair. Among those who
were led to believe that the test was unbiased, there were no sex differences in
performance, but among those who believed it showed sex differences, women performed
worse than men. The stereotype-threat effect on males' and females' performance on
math tests has been replicated numerous times (e.g., Ben-Zeev, Fein, &amp; Inzlicht,
2005; Cadinu, Maass, Rosabianca, &amp; Kiesner, 2005; Ford, Ferguson, Brooks, &amp;
Hagadone, 2004; Inzlicht &amp; Ben-Zeev, 2000; Johns, Schmader, &amp; Martens, 2005;
Keller &amp; Dauenheimer, 2003, in a naturalistic setting; Marx, Stapel, &amp;
Muller, 2005; Quinn &amp; Spencer, 2001; Schmader, Johns, &amp; Barquissau, 2004),
although there are occasional failures to replicate, including one in a more typical
test-taking setting that used test questions taken from standardized exams (Cullen,
Hardison, &amp; Sackett, 2004). Importantly, most of these studies have been
conducted with high-math-ability females- precisely those who are most capable of
succeeding at careers in mathematics and science. We note here the heated exchange
between Sackett, Hardison, and Cullen (2004a, 2004b), who were concerned about the
mischaracterization of stereotype threat by the media, and C.M. Steele and Aronson
(2004), who responded to their critique. Sackett et al. also raised concerns about
the use of covariates and other statistical procedures used to demonstrate stereotype
threat. Steele and Aronson responded to the concerns raised by Sackett et al. by
referring to the large number of studies that found evidence for stereotype threat
and by pointing out that many of these studies do not rely on the use of covariates
to demonstrate the effect. This exchange, which was published in one of psychology's
leading journals, shows the disagreement over the concept of stereotype threat and
its importance in real-life settings. No one has yet conducted a meta-analysis of
these stereotype-threat studies, so the size of the effect is unknown, but some
studies show large effects d ( 5.67, Quinn &amp; Spencer, 2001; 1.35, Johns et al.,
2005).d5 It is also unknown how altering test scores by removing stereotype threat
from the testing setting affects the validity of the scores in predicting grades or
other indicators of success. Additional research has elaborated the processes
involved in stereotype threat. For example, when solving difficult math problems,
females' ability to formulate problem-solving strategies is reduced under
high-stereotype-threat conditions compared with low-stereotype-threat conditions
(Quinn &amp; Spencer, 2001). Exposure to sex-stereotyped television commercials
reduces females' math performance (Davies, Spencer, Quinn, &amp; Gerhardstein, 2002),
providing evidence of the media as one of the pervasive sociocultural sources of
stereotype threat. And females who endorse stereotypes about mathematics as masculine
show larger stereotype-threat effects on their math performance than do females who
do not endorse these stereotypes (Schmader et al., 2004). The presence of a
math-competent female role model eliminates the stereotype-threat effect on females'
math performance (Marx &amp; Roman, 2002). The stereotype-threat research carries two
important implications: First, if a simple manipulation of instructions can produce
or eliminate sex differences in performance on a mathematics exam, the notion of
fixed sex differences in mathematics ability is called into serious question.
Stereotype threat remains a somewhat contentious topic, and some would argue that
this is a straw argument because no one really believes that mathematical ability is
some fixed or permanent attribute of an individual, so the first concern is not
valid. Second, stereotype threat is a result of cultural factors-specifically,
stereotypes about female inferiority at mathematics-and thus provides evidence of
sociocultural influence on sex differences in mathematics performance. Most of the
research on stereotype threat has been conducted in laboratory settings. Does the
effect occur in real-world settings with high-stakes tests? To answer this question,
Stricker and Ward (2004) collected information about sex and race either before or
after high-school students took an Advanced Placement test in calculus. Students who
score 3 or above in this exam are often given college credit for calculus, so it is
an important test. Stricker and Ward set their criteria for deciding if stereotype
threat was operating in this real-world setting using a standard alpha level of .05
(indicating that the obtained results would occur by chance when the groups really
did not differ in fewer than 5 out of 100 replications) and by deciding that they 5 d
would only consider effect sizes larger than .20. They concluded that they found no
evidence of deleterious effects of stereotype threat on female performance on
quantitative tests. In a reanalysis of their data, Danaher and Crandall (in press)
refuted the conclusion that stereotype threat was unimportant in real high-stakes
testing. They countered that effect sizes need to be considered within a context and
that d&lt;.20 is large and meaningful in this context. They calculated that 5.9%
additional females and 4.7% fewer males would achieve a passing score of 3 or higher
if sex and race were indicated after students take the test instead of before. The
result would be 2,789 more females starting college with credit already achieved for
calculus. Thus, stereotype threat has been found to have significant consequences,
even though the effect size is small. Training Studies Environmental input is
essential to the development of spatial and mathematical abilities (Baenninger &amp;
Newcombe, 1995; Newcombe, 2002). Babies are not born knowing how to work calculus
problems. Children acquire these skills through schooling and other experiences
(Geary, 1995, 2006). Here we review the evidence from training and schooling studies.
A meta-analysis found that spatial ability can indeed be improved d5 with training,
with effect sizes ranging between 0.4 and 5 d 0.8, depending on the length and
specificity of the training (Baenninger &amp; Newcombe, 1989). A more recent
meta-analysis of the effects of training and experience on spatial skills confirms
the earlier findings (Marulis et al., 2007). The effects of training were similar for
males and females; that is, both groups benefited about equally from the training,
and there was little evidence that the gap was closed or widened by training. Vasta,
Knott, and Gaze (1996), however, showed that the difference could be eliminated by
carefully conceptualized training. Unfortunately, most school curricula contain
little or no emphasis on spatial learning. Girls, especially, could benefit greatly
from such a curriculum. The most recent development is multimedia software that
provides training in three-dimensional spatial-visualization skills (Gerson, Sorby,
Wysocki, &amp; Baartmans, 2001). As described earlier, training in such skills has
been used successfully with first-year engineering students. Importantly, there were
improvements in the retention of female engineering students who took the
spatial-visualization course; without the course, the retention rate for females was
47%, whereas with the course it was 77%. These results have held up across multiple
years of training with different cohorts. Studies of the effects of schooling are
difficult in the United States because schooling is nearly universal. One design,
though, has compared children's growth during the school year with their growth
during summers. A study of kindergartners and first graders, for example, found that
growth in spatial skills was much more rapid from October to April (when children are
in school most of the time) than it was from April to October (when children are in
school less of the time; Huttenlocher, Levine, &amp; Vevea, 1998). Importantly, this
effect did not occur for all measures; for example, memory performance improved as
much over the April-to-October period as it did from October to April, suggesting
specificity of the effects of schooling on spatial skills. Similar results for
schooling have been found for mathematics (e.g., Downey, von Hippel, &amp; Broh,
2004).<component x="45.01" y="411.66" width="246.07" height="109.61" page="31"

consistent with Eagly and Wood's (1999) social-structural theory of psychological sex
differences. Sociocultural Influences on Occupational Choice To understand sex
differences in occupational preferences and choices, one must understand the multiple
pathways and psychological processes to those choices. A well-tested model of these
choices has been proposed by Eccles, using an expectancy-value theory (Eccles, 1983,
1994; Meece, EcclesParsons, Kaczala, Goff, &amp; Futterman, 1982). According to
Eccles' model (Fig. 9), individuals choose a particular occupation and, before that,
take the necessary academic courses in high school and college, as a function of two
factors: (a) expectations for success (i.e., individuals take on challenges when they
expect that they can succeed at them) and (b) perceptions of task value (i.e.,
individuals take on a challenge when they value the task, perhaps because they
intrinsically enjoy the task, perhaps because it has utility value such as a good
salary, or for other reasons). Costs are estimated as well (e.g., joining the
after-school science club might require giving up cheerleading). Expectations for
success are shaped by the individual's task-specific beliefs (self-concept of ability
in the relevant domain, perceptions of the difficulty of the task), which in turn are
shaped by past events (e.g., grades in school in that subject, standardized test
scores), and also by the person's interpretation of those past events (e.g., high
grades in mathematics as a result of ability or of effort). Perceptions of task value
are shaped by the individual's long-term goals (e.g., becoming a mathematics
professor) and short-term goals (e.g., taking the right sequence of undergraduate
mathematics courses to qualify for a PhD program in mathematics). These perceptions
of task value are shaped in turn by the individual's perceptions of the attitudes and
expectations of important socializers (parents, teachers, peers) and the larger
cultural milieu (such as the mass media and gender segregation in the occupation).
Dozens of studies have provided evidence supporting the model's proposed links,
although it has been criticized for not including a measure of ability (e.g., Eccles,
Vida, &amp; Barber, 2004; Fredricks &amp; Eccles, 2002; Frome &amp; Eccles, 1998;
Jodl, Michael, Malanchuk, Eccles, &amp; Sameroff, 2001; Meece et al., 1982; reviewed
by Eccles, 1994). How does the model of achievement proposed by Eccles help us
understand sex differences in choice of academic courses in high school, major in
college, and occupation? At the simplest level, if males and females differ in their
expectations for success at math- and science-related tasks, or if they attach
different values to success at these tasks, then sex differences in choices will
occur. Research has documented sex differences in expected task value and expected
success in the areas of science and mathematics, as well as sociocultural forces that
influence those expectations. In general, children's math-competence beliefs decline
from 1st to 12th grade (Jacobs et al., 2002). Although boys start out with greater
math-competence beliefs than girls, by 12th grade there is no sex difference in these
beliefs, at least in recent studies (Fredricks &amp; Eccles, 2002; Jacobs et al.,
2002; see Wilkins, 2004, for international comparisons; and see Hyde, Fennema, Ryan,
Frost, &amp; Hopp, 1990, for a meta-analysis of earlier studies). Reciprocal-effects
modeling with longitudinal data indicates that math-competence beliefs predict later
standardized-test performance much more strongly than test scores predict competence
beliefs (Marsh et al., 2005). Children's valuing of mathematics also declines from
1st to 12th grade, but there are no sex differences in valuing math. What we do not
know from these studies is what the sex differences look like in college-age samples,
when serious decisions about occupations are made, or how sex differences in
interests may interact with these beliefs in determining long-term career choices.
One relevant study examined ninth graders' intentions to enroll in math courses
(Crombie et al., 2005). Although many of the predictors of intentions were the same
for boys and girls, the direct path from math competence beliefs to enrollment
intentions was significant for girls but not for boys, suggesting that girls may be
more influenced by their math self-concept. Research within this expectancy-value
theory has also documented the relation between parents' sex-stereotyped beliefs and
children's sense of competence and achievement in mathematics and science. In one
longitudinal study, mothers' estimates of their sixth-grade children's likelihood of
success in mathematics predicted the children's actual math career choices at ages 24
to 25 years (controlling for children's ability); importantly, mothers' sixth-grade
estimates of their children's math-career success were significantly higher for boys
than for girls, although there was no control for ability in this study and the
authors acknowledge that less subjective measures, such as achievement tests, might
have yielded different relations with career choice (Bleeker &amp; Jacobs, 2004). In
another study, parents who held stereotypic beliefs about male superiority in
mathematics gave significantly higher math-ability estimates to sons than they did to
daughters, controlling for the children's actual grades (Jacobs, 1991; see also
Jacobs &amp; Eccles, 1992). Parents' perceptions of their children's math ability may
have a stronger influence on children's beliefs in their own ability than their math
grades do (Frome &amp; Eccles, 1998). This is a finding that needs to be replicated
and studied further. Similar results have been found for the influence of teachers.
For example, teachers' perceptions of students' math talent early in the school year
predict the students' later math achievementtest scores, even when earlier measures
of ability are controlled (Jussim &amp; Eccles, 1992). In short, the Eccles research
demonstrates the potential importance of key socializers-especially parents and
teachers-in shaping children's self-concepts of their ability, their course choices,
and their occupational choices. When the socializers hold stereotypic beliefs about
male superiority in mathematics and science, these beliefs can translate to daughters
with lower self-concepts of their math and science ability who choose not to pursue
careers in science and mathematics. Correll's (2004) sociological model is similar to
that of Eccles, but Correll's model emphasizes a broader principle: that cultural
beliefs about sex differences affect the emerging career aspirations of males and
females. In a laboratory experiment, participants were told that they were being
tested for a (fictitious) ability, ''contrast sensitivity,'' which was said to be
very important for graduate school and employment success. In one condition,
participants were told that, on average, males perform better on these tests
(male-advantage, MA, condition), and in the other condition, participants were told
that there were no gender differences (NGD condition). The task was in fact
ambiguous, and all participants were told that they were correct on 13 of 20 items.
Afterward, males in the MA condition gave themselves significantly higher
contrast-sensitivity ratings than did females in that condition; in the NGD
condition, there were no sex differences in ability ratings. Perhaps most
importantly, compared with females in the MA condition, males in the MA condition
rated themselves as significantly more likely to apply to graduate programs and for
jobs requiring high levels of contrastsensitivity ability; this differences was not
found in the NGD condition. Another line of evidence comes from cross-cultural
analyses indicating that sex-stereotypic patterns of course choice and occupational
choice vary from one nation to another. For example, female enrollment in 12th-grade
math classes ranges from 22% in Japan to 52% in Thailand (Hanson, Schaub, &amp;
Baker, 1996; see also Davenport et al., 1998). Female enrollment in physics classes
ranges from 13% in Japan to 52% in Thailand, with the United States at 22% (Hanson et
al., 1996). For students planning to major in mathematics or science in college, the
range is from 13% female in Japan to 38% female in Canada, with the United States at
28%. These variations closely parallel the proportion of women employed as scientists
in those countries. Sex Discrimination and Occupational Success Psychological
scientists have studied sex discrimination in a number of ways. Social psychologists
agree that the old-fashioned, overt sexism that existed several decades ago in the
United modern States may have been replaced by unconscious, covert, sexism neosexism
orin some situations (Jackson, Esses, &amp; Burris, 2001; Masser &amp; Abrams, 1999;
Swim &amp; Cohen, 1997). Studies investigating sex bias generally use one of two
methodological approaches: (a) experimental studies, in which a work product (e.g.,
an article) is submitted to raters for evaluation of its quality and half of the
raters see it with a stereotypic male name as author and the other half see the same
work product but with a stereotypic female name as author; and (b) naturalistic
studies examining experiences of sexism or evaluations or hiring of males and females
in real work settings. The experimental studies have the advantage of experimental
control but may lack external validity; the naturalistic studies supply the latter,
and therefore these studies are perceived to be complementary. A meta-analysis of
studies using the experimental paradigm found that, when job applications were
evaluated, sex bias d5 occurred ( ( (.13 to .25; Swim, Borgida, Maruyama, &amp;
Myers, 1989; the negative value indicates that the female applicant was rated lower
than the male). The effect size does not represent a performance difference between
males and females but rather a difference in evaluating the work of a male stimulus
person compared with that of a female stimulus person. A metaanalysis of experimental
research conducted in simulated employment contexts (e.g., when hiring or
compensation decisions were measured) found that sex bias in ratings depended on
whether the job in question was traditionally sex-typed as male or female (Davison
&amp; Burke, 2000). When the job was male d5 sex-typed, males received higher ratings
( .33) even though identical qualifications had been presented in the experiment.
When the job was female sex-typed, females received higher d5 ratings ( (.26). This
pattern suggests that raters' beliefs about applicants' future performance may have
influenced their ratings. A meta-analysis of field studies of sex bias in ratings of
job performance found, overall, little evidence of bias; however, d5 a substantial
pro-male bias ( .32) appeared when only males served as raters (Bowen, Swim, &amp;
Jacobs, 2000). The Davison and Burke (2000) meta-analysis, however, did not find male
d raters to be more biased than female raters ( 5.24 and .34, respectively).
Therefore, it is an open question as to whether males are more biased in their
ratings than females are. One study investigated fourth-year medical students'
experiences of sex discrimination and sexual harassment (Stratton, McLaughlin, Witte,
Fosson, &amp; Nora, 2005). Compared with men, women who had been exposed to
discrimination or harassment were significantly more likely to report that the
experience influenced their choice of specialty (45% vs. 16%) and residency rankings
(25% vs. 11%). General surgery was the area in which women were most likely to
experience discrimination or harassment during the residency selection process. This
study, n5 based on a large sample ( 1,314), documents the frequency of talented
professional women's exposure to discrimination and the extent to which it affects
their career choices. A related study of women in academic medicine found that 40% of
the respondents ranked sex discrimination first out of 11 possible factors hindering
their careers in that field (P.L. Carr, Szalacha, Barnett, Caswell, &amp; Inui,
2003). Focusing on earlier stages of the career process, another study surveyed 477
first-year and 324 final-year undergraduates in male-dominated fields (math, science,
engineering) and femaledominated fields (arts, education, humanities, social science;
J. Steele, James, &amp; Barnett, 2002). Women in the math, science, and engineering
fields reported significantly more sex discrimination than men reported in their
fields and than women reported in female-dominated fields. Moreover, they also
anticipated experiencing more sex discrimination in the future if they went into a
career in that field. Women in the math, science, and engineering fields were also
the most likely to report thinking about changing their major. There has been only
one study of sexism in the scientific peerreview process that was based on an
analysis of peer-review scores (Wenneras &amp; Wold, 1997). In an investigation of
the reasons why women in Sweden are less likely to succeed in science and
mathematics, two investigators studied the peerreview process that is used to award
postdoctoral fellowships. Sweden has been named as the ''leading country in the world
with respect to equal opportunities for men and women'' (p. 343), so it is likely
that if sexism were found in their peer-review process, it exists in other countries
as well. Scientific peer review is shrouded in secrecy. When the investigators
requested the data on peer review from the Swedish Medical Review Council, they were
denied access. Similar requests to the National Science Foundation in the United
States were met with the response that the data are not available in a format that
allows comparisons of women and men (Ceci, Wiliams, &amp; Barnett, 2007). However,
the Swedish Freedom of Press Act grants public access to all government documents,
except those classified as secret for reasons related to national security. An
Administrative Court granted the investigators access to the documents relating to
peer review. The investigators found that female applicants for postdoctoral
fellowships received lower mean scores in all three of the areas in which they were
evaluated: scientific competence, quality of proposed methodology, and relevance of
the research proposal. Because final scores are computed by multiplying all three
scores, small differences are enlarged with this procedure for computing total
scores. Of course, lower mean scores are not evidence of sexism, as it is possible
that the women applicants were, in fact, less qualified. To test this possibility,
the investigators computed scientific productivity indices six different ways, using
variables such as number of publications, number of first-author publications, impact
factors as indicators of the quality of each publication, and number of scientific
citations. In the authors' own words: ''Did men and women with equal scientific
productivity receive the same competence rating by the MRC reviewers? No!'' (p. 387).
The most productive group of female researchers (total of more than 100 total impact
points) were rated as comparable in ability to the least productive male researchers
(total impact points less than 20). All other women were rated below all of the men.
Wenneras and Wold (1997) found that being affiliated with a committee member (what
they call a ''friendship bonus'') and being male were the two most important factors
in determining how research applicants were rated. The effect of having a personal
relationship with members of the review committee- which included being a student of
a member or working on a project with a committee member-was significant even though
committee members with relationships with applicants recused themselves from rating
these applicants. Still, those relationships were known among the other members of
the committee, who apparently were influenced by that knowledge. The authors of this
study conclude that the peer-review process in what is arguably the most gender-equal
nation in the world is rife with nepotism and sexism. In Sweden, women receive 44% of
biomedical doctoral degrees but hold only 25% of postdoctoral positions and 7% of
professional positions. The authors believe that some portion of these discrepancies
is caused by sexism. The policy of secrecy has prevented similar investigations into
the peer-review process in other countries. Even if nepotism and sexism operate
without conscious awareness, they are no less insidious. At a time when the United
States and other countries are facing serious shortages of scientists and
mathematicians, we can only wonder if biases in the peer-review process are
contributing to the loss of talented women in these areas. There are no reasons to
believe that scientists in the United States would be any more immune to prejudice
and nepotism than those in Sweden; these results provide strong reasons for making
the peer-review process more transparent and open for peer review. Women's Roles
Although there has been a major shift over the last several decades toward equalizing
men's and women's roles in the home, employed women still spend significantly more
time with their children than men do (Sandberg &amp; Hofferth, 2001). Achieving high
levels of success in a math or science career requires substantially more than 40
hours of work per week. In thinking about future careers, women may believe that such
a career would interfere with family life, particularly with having children. And,
once in a math or science career, women who have children may find themselves
choosing between time with children and the extra hours needed to perform
brilliantly. Women with engineering degrees, for example, are more likely than their
male peers to be working part time, and the most common reason given for the
part-time work is family (Morgan, 2000). Women who choose nontraditional careers, for
example in math or science, may be penalized in the marriage market. For instance,
women portrayed as being in a traditionally masculine occupation (e.g., orthopedic
surgeon, chemical engineer) are rated as less attractive than women in traditionally
feminine occupations (Badgett &amp; Folbre, 2003). Women engineers are less likely to
be married and more likely to be childless than men engineers are (Jagacinski, 1987).
Thus, it appears that women entering careers in science and engineering face more
difficult life trade-offs than their male peers do. One study pitted several of these
explanations against each other, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth, a national probability sample of 12,686 young men and women who ranged in age
from 14 to 21 in 1979 and who were<component x="62.99" y="693.43" width="246.06"

state of the evidence for cognitive and interest differences between the sexes and
their putative biological, evolutionary, and social/environmental origins, we have
presented a summary of what is known about sex differences and similarities in
mathematical and science abilities based on the best available scientific evidence.
The popular media have sensationalized findings of sex differences, often presenting
the latest finding without assessing the quality of the research that it was based on
or using ''person on the street interviews'' about beliefs about sex differences as
though they were as valid as a carefully executed program of research (e.g., Conlin,
2003). This monograph represents a consensus of expert opinion, from a group of
scientists with diverse backgrounds, to the questions about sex and math and science
achievement. We addressed questions concerning whether and when (in the life span)
there are differences between males and females in the cognitive abilities that are
important for success in careers requiring aptitude for and achievement in
mathematics and science, and the extent to which sex differences in math and science
abilities can be attributed to ''innate'' explanations, socialization, or the way
these two types of influences reciprocally influence each other. In this review, we
have focused on a wide range of research in which reasonable data have accumulated
that address these issues, which we summarize and draw conclusions from below.
Average Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities Psychologists often look for sex
differences very early in life as clues to the relative contribution of biological
and environmental contributions, reasoning that newborns have had fewer social
interactions, so the earlier that sex differences are reliably found, the more likely
they are assumed to be biological in origin. This assumption is not fully supported
by the biological literature because, for many species, sex differences are not
evident in infancy and often do not emerge until the age of reproductive maturation.
The simple distinction between cognitive sex differences that emerge early in life
and those that emerge later does not rule out environmental effects, because the
uterine environment affects the development of a fetus. The role of prenatal
environmental factors is an excellent example of the interaction of biological and
environmental variables, which often become indistinguishable in their effects. It
does not necessarily follow that differences found later in life are caused by social
or environmental factors, because there are developmental timelines for biological
processes, including the timing of puberty, the development of the forebrain, and the
aging processes, all of which are also influenced by the environment. Moreover, the
tasks that infants can handle may be qualitatively different from tasks designed for
adolescents, even if they are both labeled the same. For example, a verbal or spatial
task for an infant is qualitatively different than a verbal or spatial task for an
adolescent. With these caveats in mind, the usual finding across tasks is that males
and females develop equally well in early cognitive skills that relate to
quantitative thinking and knowledge of objects in the environment. By the end of
grade school and beyond, females perform better on assessments of verbal abilities
when assessments are heavily weighted with writing and the language-usage items cover
topics with which females are familiar; sex differences favoring females are much
larger in these conditions than when assessments of verbal abilities do not including
writing. In contrast, males excel on certain visuospatial-ability measures. Yet, of
all the sex differences in cognitive abilities, differences in quantitative abilities
have received the most attention because of the marked differences favoring males at
the highest end of the ability distribution and because of their importance in so
many occupations. Male performance is more variable than that of females in
quantitative and visuospatial abilities, which means that there are also more males
at the low-ability end of these distributions. Because males tend to be more
variable, the average difference in performance between females and males for most
assessments is smaller than it is at the high- and low-ability tails of the
distributions, and the size of the average between-sex difference is larger for tests
such as the GRE that are administered to selective samples than it is for less
selective tests such as the SAT or a high-school admissions test. The fact that
females achieve higher grades in school-based math and science tests and lower
average scores on standardized exams used for college admissions and graduate school
may point to differences in the strategies males and females use to solve novel
problems (Gallagher &amp; Cahalan, in press) and to the tendency of females to do
better in most school contexts (Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997). Of course, the factors
that enter into earning a high grade in a class are also different from those leading
to high test scores on a standardized test. Sex Differences in Math and Science
Performance in the Tails of the Distribution Substantial evidence suggests that the
male advantage in mathematics is largest at the upper end of the ability
distribution, a result that could provide important clues to the origin of this sex
difference. In addition, a ''tilt'' favoring visuospatial or mathematical abilities
compared to verbal, regardless of level of ability, is more frequently exhibited by
males than by females. Females tend to be more balanced in their ability profiles,
which may lead them to choose mathematics or science careers less frequently than
their male counterparts do. These differences can be seen as early as adolescence,
and, therefore, a greater number of males than females may qualify for advanced
training in disciplines that place a premium on mathematical reasoning and/or
visuospatial abilities. Any differences that exist are increased if interests and
activities that are correlated with abilities are considered. An Evolutionary Account
of Sex Differences in Mathematics and Science From an evolutionary perspective, sex
differences in advanced math and science have not evolved in any direct way but could
be indirectly related to differences in interests and to specific brain and cognitive
systems that differ for females and males. Evolutionary theories predict sex
differences that arise from patterns of intrasexual competitions (for both males and
females) and intersexual choice (for both females and males), including pressures
that accompany the male-biased activities of hunters and warriors who traveled long
distances in novel territory. Although a large body of data was presented that
supports this theory, numerous criticisms have been raised as well. Many of its
predictions remain to be tested, although several patterns are consistent with
observed differences in interest and ability profiles. Sex Differences in Brain
Structure and Function Studies of brain structure and function have suggested some
potential biological mechanisms for the observed sex differences in ability. In
general, females have a higher percentage of gray-matter brain tissue, whereas males
have a higher volume of connecting white-matter tissue-with the exception of the
splenium of the corpus callosum, which is more bulbous and, thus, larger in females
than in males. Furthermore, male brains show greater volumetric asymmetries than
female brains do. The higher white-matter volume seems associated with better spatial
performance in males, while the greater bilateral symmetry seems associated with
better language processing in females. Although the advent of noninvasive techniques
for functional brain imaging has allowed a rapid increase in the number of studies
investigating sex differences in the regional functional specialization for
cognition, these studies are in their infancy. Future research of this type should
involve larger and more carefully selected sample populations to avoid strong and
potentially confounding cohort effects, and should employ longitudinal designs.
Finally, hormones have been documented to affect cognition through their organizing
effects on the brain.<component x="303.02" y="65.44" width="246.09" height="285.35"

including a definition of the problem and the systems of variables that make us both
social and biological animals. There are caveats to these conclusions because of
methodological limitations of individual studies. Nonetheless, they are based on
sound science, and we relied on meta-analyses of large bodies of research, when those
were available. There is no single factor by itself that has been shown to determine
sex differences in science and math. Early experience, biological constraints,
educational policy, and cultural context each have effects, and these effects add and
interact in complex and sometimes unpredictable ways. Support for this report was

speculation about the reasons for sex differences in careers in science and
mathematics, we present a consensus statement that is based on the best available
scientific evidence. Sex differences in science and math achievement and ability are
smaller for the mid-range of the abilities distribution than they are for those with
the highest levels of achievement and ability. Males are more variable on most
measures of quantitative and visuospatial ability, which necessarily results in more
males at both high- and low-ability extremes; the reasons why males are often more
variable remain elusive. Successful careers in math and science require many types of
cognitive abilities. Females tend to excel in verbal abilities, with large
differences between females and males found when assessments include writing samples.
High-level achievement in science and math requires the ability to communicate
effectively and comprehend abstract ideas, so the female advantage in writing should
be helpful in all academic domains. Males outperform females on most measures of
visuospatial abilities, which have been implicated as contributing to sex differences
on standardized exams in mathematics and science. An evolutionary account of sex
differences in mathematics and science supports the conclusion that, although sex
differences in math and science performance have not directly evolved, they could be
indirectly related to differences in interests and specific brain and cognitive
systems. We review the brain basis for sex differences in science and mathematics,
describe consistent effects, and identify numerous possible correlates. Experience
alters brain structures and functioning, so causal statements about brain differences
and success in math and science are circular. A wide range of sociocultural forces
contribute to sex differences in mathematics and<component x="45.01" y="112.83"

(2003) sounded an alarm about critical workforce shortages in jobs that require
high-level mathematical and science skills. Their fears about a dwindling pool of
mathematicians and scientists has fueled concern that the United States will not be
able to maintain its leadership in science and technology, which translates directly
to an inability to fill positions that are essential to homeland security. A similar
call to arms had been made by leading economists, who warned that the shortage of
workers with science and math skills is dampening our economic growth and posing a
major threat to our economic well-being. In the 2000 Biennial Report to the United
States Congress (Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering, 2000,
section 5), experts predicted that the overall rise in employment opportunities in
the coming decade would be around 14%, with employment opportunities in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (commonly abbreviated STEM) expected to
increase by over 50%. Despite the serious need for a workforce with high-level skills
in science and mathematics, data from the National Science Foundation show that
''Women made up almost one-fourth (24 percent) of the [science and engineering]
workforce but close to one-half (46 percent) of the U.S. workforce, in 1999''
(National Science Foundation, 2002b). Making fuller use of the female talent pool
could go a long way toward addressing workforce shortages. Women are also
underrepresented in academic positions at research universities, especially in
science and mathematics. A recent review found that women in science, engineering,
and technology are less likely to obtain tenure (29% of women compared to 58% of men
in full-time, ranked academic positions at 4-year colleges) and are less likely to
achieve the rank of full professor (23% of women compared to 50% of men; Ginther
&amp; Kahn, 2006). Why are women underrepresented in high-level careers in math and
science? Questions about sex differences in the cognitive abilities needed for
success in science and mathematics have a long history in scientific psychology.
Helen Bradford Thompson's The Mental Traits (later Woolley) 1903 doctoral
dissertation, of the Sexes , began with this sentence: ''The object of the present
monograph is to furnish some accurate information on the muchdiscussed question of
the psychology of the sexes'' (p. 1). Thompson's carefully controlled comparisons of
males and females on various ''intellectual faculties'' is a perfect introduction to
many of the underlying assumptions in explanations that were offered over the ensuing
century for the unequal outcomes for men and women in academic careers in mathematics
and science. It shows both how much and how little the science of sex differences has
advanced in the last 100 years. Thompson had almost no empirical work to build upon,
whereas contemporary psychologists have an extensive base of empirical studies to
inform our conclusions; yet, in many ways, we are still asking the same basic
questions. In this report, we present a summary of what is known about sex
differences in mathematics and science achievement and abilities based on a review
and evaluation of the best available scientific evidence. The topic of unequal
outcomes for men and women in science and math areas in academia was brought to the
consciousness of the general public a few years ago, when Lawrence Summers (2005),
then president of Harvard University, remarked publicly on these discrepancies. He
offered three possible explanations for the low percentage of women in academic
positions in science in mathematics. He raised the possibility that women are
unwilling to reduce their time with family to work the long hours required to achieve
the status of high-level academic scientists, which requires a near total commitment
to one's work. He rhetorically asked, ''Who wants to do high-powered intense work?''
Summers also discussed the possibility that sex-related differences in socialization
or discrimination during hiring or promotion could be barriers to female success in
science, mathematics, and engineering, but he said he did not believe that these
mechanisms contributed much to keeping women as minorities in these fields. His main
hypothesis focused on the finding that there are many fewer females than males at the
upper end of advanced mathematical achievement and ability tests, which led him to
infer that fewer females than males have the ''innate ability'' to succeed in
academic disciplines that require advanced mathematical abilities. Summers reasoned
that it was the scarcity of females with exceptional mathematical talent that
explains the disparate ratios of females and males in mathematics, engineering, and
the natural sciences. Psychological Science in the Public Interest This issue of was
organized in direct response to the heated controversies generated by Summers'
remarks. There is a large research literature on the topic of whether and when (in
the life span) there are differences between females and males in cognitive abilities
needed for successful careers in STEM. The research literature directly addresses
questions about the extent to which sex differences can be attributed to ''innate''
explanations, socialization, or the way these two types of influences reciprocally
affect each other. Questions about the ways in which males and females differ are
controversial because conclusions may have implications for public policies and for
the way people think about education, career choices, and ''natural'' roles for males
and females in society. We recognize that all social-science research is conducted in
a cultural context that influences the nature of the questions that may be asked and
the evidence that is accepted as valid. Science can never be free of all biases, but
it is the best method available for finding answers to politically charged questions.
In addressing questions about sex differences in mathematics and science, we rely on
findings that have been replicated and on the relative transparency of the scientific
method. We also recognize that science is a cumulative process, so that the
conclusions that are drawn today may change as additional data are collected over
time, as society and people change, and as our understanding of the phenomena being
studied evolves.<component x="303.02" y="65.44" width="246.09" height="297.94"

report to describe constructs and the way we discuss and explain results are
important in conveying our understanding of controversial phenomena. We do not want
to become enmeshed in cultural struggles over ''correct'' terminology. Thus, we first
clarify our usage of terms. Sex and Gender sex One area of contention concerns the
use of the terms and gender sex . Some authors prefer to refer to biological
distinctions gender between people, such as genitals and chromosomes, and to refer to
those male and female differences that are thought to arise from social or
environmental influences. On one side of this issue, there are psychologists who
believe that using the term ''gender differences'' in research that compares females
and males is preferable because it does not imply the origin of the differences or it
conveys a more pro-nurture origin (Caplan &amp; Caplan, 2005); other authors, writing
in outlets such as the National Women's Studies Association Journal , have suggested
sex that the distinction between and gendermay have outlived its usefulness, because
biology cannot be separated from its cultural influences and the continued use of two
separate terms perpetuates the westernized view of mind-body dualism (Severin &amp;
Wyer, 2000). Those who oppose the restrictive use of sex for biological distinctions
and genderfor social or environmental ones further note that the dichotomy is often
artificial. When studying cognitive abilities, it is extremely difficult to separate
biological influences from environmental ones because the two influences are
reciprocal. Halpern (2000, 2004) and others have advocated a biopsychosocial model
(sometimes called a psychobiosocial model) that emphasizes the complex influences of
biological and social/environmental variables on cognitive abilities. Consider, for
example, brain development. As we describe in a later section, there are differences
between female and male brains that are influenced initially by prenatal hormones and
later by other hormones over the course of life, but human brain development is also
altered by life experiences, including the prenatal environment. Similarly,
high-performing students report that the subjects they like the most in school
correspond to the academic disciplines in which they achieve high scores on
standardized tests of knowledge and ability. Not surprisingly, they engage in more
activities that relate to areas that they like (e.g., reading, math clubs, science
competitions), thus further increasing their knowledge and abilities in these areas
(reviewed in Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2007). It is difficult to know whether high
ability leads to increased interest and additional activities in an academic domain
or whether high interest in an academic domain and engaging in activities that
develop expertise in that domain lead to high ability. The distinction between sex
and gender is entangled in the debate about what is biologically determined and what
is environmentally determined. For these reasons, we have chosen- sex perhaps
arbitrarily but for the sake of clarity-to use the term throughout our report.
Biological and Innate biological Terms like andinnate are often misunderstood. Humans
are both biological and social beings shaped by the complex interaction of biology
and environment. When psychologists use innate the term , they are referring to a
potential that is ''ready'' for development in a supportive environment. Innatedoes
not mean immutable or unchangeable. Hormones, for example, are chemicals, secreted by
endocrine glands, that affect a wide variety of behaviors and brain development, yet
hormonal secretions change in response to environmental events such as social
victories or defeats (Schultheiss et al., 2005). Learning is both a biological and an
environmental process, and the brain remains plastic into very old age, changing in
response to learning and environmental events. Abilities and Achievement Abilities
achievement and are terms used in assessment, and although they are theoretically
different, in practice they are often difficult to separate. An achievement test is a
test of what an individual knows at a particular time. A high score on an achievement
test in calculus, for example, is interpreted to mean that the test taker learned
calculus and was willing and able to demonstrate that learning by solving the
problems on the test. Achievement tests are usually written to reflect a curriculum.
Two people could have the same low score on a mathematics achievement test and differ
widely in their mathematical ability. One of these individuals could have had several
years of mathematics instruction and learned very little and the other could have had
no mathematics instruction. Ability is a more abstract construct; ability tests
assess an individual's likelihood to benefit from instruction or, alternatively, how
much instruction might be needed to reach a level of competence. Although the term
abilityconnotes a ''raw'' or undeveloped talent, ability assessments usually test
content information that was taught in school (except for projects that identify
precocious talent). Unfortunately, one cannot measure ability without also measuring
achievement to some extent, so the distinction between these two constructs is
somewhat blurred. We use the term abilityas it was defined by Fleishman (1972): a
general trait of an individual that is the product of learning and development. (Some
psychologists have suggested abilities that the term be replaced with more neutral
terms like skills performance or ; Sherman, 1977.) Humans are born with innate
abilities, such as the ability to learn a language, but the language they learn, if
any, depends largely on their experience. Similarly, they are born with the innate
ability to count and discern quantities, but how they develop those abilities depends
on their environment and learning experiences. Abilities are developed in supportive
environments. In this report, we shall refer to abilities in this broad and
environmentally dependent way. Intelligence and IQ Intelligence is another abstract
construct in assessment. It is usually summarized with a single score known as IQ,
which stands for ''intelligence quotient.'' It was originally derived from a quotient
that included an individual's test score divided by the score that would be obtained
by an average person of the same age (then multiplied by 100 so average scores at any
age are 100). The most commonly used intelligence tests have been designed so that
there are no overall sex differences in IQ scores (Brody, 1992). When items are
selected for inclusion in standardized intelligence tests, items that show an
advantage for either males or females are either discarded during test construction
or balanced with items that show an equal advantage for the other sex. Hence,
overall, there are no sex differences in IQ scores for the most commonly used tests.
Thus, we cannot turn to standardized intelligence tests to determine if there is a
''smarter sex.'' The Grade-Test Disparity In general, females receive higher grades
in school in every subject, including mathematics and science, so the question is not
whether females can learn advanced concepts in mathematics and science; class grades
show that they can and do (Dwyer &amp; Johnson, 1997; Kimball, 1989). Women
constitute a substantial majority of college enrollments in the United States and
many other countries. American women have received more college degrees than men
every year since 1982, with the female advantage widening every year. Among women
between 25 and 34 years old, 33% have completed college, compared to 29% of men (Bae,
Choy, Geddes, Sable, &amp; Snyder, 2000). Despite these successes, females score
significantly lower on many (though not all) ''high stakes'' standardized tests used
for admissions to college and graduate school, including both the Verbal and
Mathematics sections of the SAT (previously called the Scholastic Aptitude Test) and
the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Females also score lower than males, on
average, in science and mathematics when the tests are not closely related to
material that has been taught in school (despite getting higher grades in
school-based exams), and males and females participate in different subfields of
mathematics and science at different rates (Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997). Thus, there
is a grade-test disparity in successful achievement in mathematics and science for
males and females, with females achieving better grades in school and males achieving
higher scores on tests designed for admissions to colleges, universities, and
graduate programs. A corollary of this discrepancy is the finding that standardized
tests slightly underpredict college and graduate school performance for women and
overpredict performance for men (Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997). There are many laws of
cognitive psychology that are as certain as the law of gravity. Here is one: All
cognitive abilities will improve with learning and practice. This is the reason we
have schools: to provide instruction in math, science, and the other STEM areas and
abilities covered in this review. Even when we conclude that there are meaningful
differences between males and females, this conclusion leaves open the possibility
that the performance gap could be narrowed or closed with appropriate instruction,
just as it could be widened. Ceci and Papierno (2005) make the point that
interventions often widen achievement gaps between groups because higher-ability
groups can usually achieve greater gains than lower-ability groups can. The questions
addressed in this report are about two groups of females and males, those with
average abilities and those at the highest ability levels, and the possible origins
of the differences within and between these two groups. We are not addressing the
question of whether males and females are similar or different in their mathematics
and science abilities and achievement levels, because the answer is that males and
females are both similar and different. The similarities between males and females
are so numerous and obvious that we tend to overlook them and take them for granted.
We need to heed the caveats that the overemphasis on studies of differences can
distort the countless findings of ''no significant differences'' that routinely are
ignored or unreported. Hyde (2005) has reviewed numerous areas of research on sex
differences among females and males of average ability and concluded that ''males and
females are similar on most, but not all, psychological variables'' (p. 581). There
are many critical research-design issues to consider when evaluating research on sex
differences in math and science abilities, but most critical is the inability to ever
''prove'' the null hypothesis that there is no difference between any groups using
standard research methods. So when differences are not found, we are careful to avoid
conclusions that would affirm the null hypothesis, although we can rely on aggregate
analyses across multiple studies to decide if an effect size or average group
difference is large enough to be meaningful in real-world contexts. The Size of an
Effect When researchers say ''males are better at X'' or ''females are better at Y,''
it is important to know the magnitude of the difference claimed. If a nationally
normed vocabulary test showed that females scored statistically significantly higher
than males, this result might sound impressive, but what if it turned out to mean
that, on average, females know 1.5 more vocabulary words than males? Such a small
difference might be statistically but not practically meaningful. How many words, on
average, would the difference need to be before it became meaningful? There are
statistical formulas for computing effect sizes, but deciding when a difference is
large enough to be important in everyday life is a matter of judgment, and reasonable
people often disagree. There are several statistical ways to present the size of the
difference between two (or more) groups. Because we are often comparing results among
several studies in which the dependent variables (what is measured) could be test
scores like the SATs, reaction time to respond to a target, or accuracy in
responding, a common metric is needed. The most widely used measure d is (Cohen,
1977): ( ( rffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi X X (
m f d&#xBC; 2 2 SD SD &#xFE; m f 2 ( ( X X is the mean for the female group and is
the mean for where f m the male group, and SD and SD are the respective standard f m
deviations for females and males. Either group mean could be subtracted from the
other, but when females are subtracted from males, positive values indicate a ''male
advantage,'' and d negative values indicate a ''female advantage.'' Thus, provides a
measure of how far apart the means of the two distributions d are in standard
deviation units. The value of can range from 0-meaning no difference was found
between the means for the groups being compared-to values as large as 2 or 3 (or -2
to -3, which signify the same distance between the means as the positive values).
Large values mean that there is very little overlap in scores between the two groups.
There is no theoretical d limit to the size of , but practically .8 is generally
considered a large difference. Any value of dcan be mathematically converted into a
correlation or another indicator of percentage of ''explained variance'' (Rosenthal,
Rosnow, &amp; Rubin, 2000). It is important to understand effect sizes, because they
are often used to label a difference between males and females as large or small.
Rosenthal et al. (2000) weighed in on this critical matter: d ''Mechanically labeling
. . . s automatically as small medium, , large and can lead to later difficulties.
The reason is that small even effects can turn out to be practically important'' (pp.
15-16). According to Rosenthal and Rubin (1982), an effect that accounts for only 4%
of the variance (variability among scores) is associated with a difference of 60%
versus 40% of a group's performance above average; for example, on a test designed
such that an individual must attain at least an average score to qualify for
admission to a graduate program, then, with this effect size, 60% of one group and
40% of the other group would qualify. Thus, although effect sizes may sometimes seem
''small,'' they can have substantial real-world consequences. In Valian's (1998)
analysis of females' slow advancement in academia and other professions, she showed
how smaller disparities were compounded over time to create larger ones, so the
seemingly small 4% of variance accounted for can be meaningful, depending on the
context and variable being assessed. Meta-analyses are used to assess effect sizes
across multiple studies. As the term suggests, a meta-analysis is an analysis of
previous analyses, or an analysis of many individual research results. The need for
meta-analysis is obvious in a research area in which the size of the literature can
be measured in linear yards or pounds of paper generated. Meaningful integrations of
research findings are the best way to interpret the voluminous literature.
Meta-analysis allows us to take a broad overview in summarizing research results
(Hyde &amp; Linn, 1988).<component x="321.05" y="276.51" width="246.04"

differences in mathematical and science achievements is really a set of embedded
questions, because the answer depends on (a) which mathematical and science
achievements are studied, (b) how those achievements are assessed, (c) when in the
life span they are assessed, (d) which portion of the achievement/ability
distribution is investigated, and (e) the context in which achievement is assessed.
The majority of the literature on sex differences in mathematics and science has
investigated differences in three different, broadly defined, but core cognitive
abilities: verbal, visuospatial, and quantitative abilities (e.g., Carroll, 1992;
Snow &amp; Lohman, 1989). These types of abilities are linked in various ways,
because they are used together and, sometimes, compensate for each other. All are
necessary in learning and doing science and mathematics. Terms like verbal
visuospatial,, andquantitativeare category headings used to organize and study
cognition. They are not unitary constructs. Verbal abilities for example, apply to
all the components of language usage, including skills like word fluency, grammar,
spelling, reading, vocabulary, verbal analogies, and language comprehension. Verbal
abilities also apply to tasks used by cognitive psychologists in laboratory settings,
such as tasks measuring speed of lexical access, a reaction-time measure usually
reported in fractions of a second, or those measuring working-memory span, such as
the number of items an individual can maintain in memory while also engaged in a
verbal processing task (e.g., a task of verbal reasoning). Examples of items used to
assess verbal abilities include tasks such as (a) choosing which in a group of words
are most nearly the same in meaning, (b) solving verbal analogies, (c) answering
questions about complex passages just read (reading comprehension), (d) answering
simple grammar questions, and (e) writing in response to prompts or other
instructions. These tasks do not tap the same skills even though they all involve
language, and males and females do not differ in the same way on all of these
measures. Thus, different combinations of these measures give different answers to
the question about sex differences in verbal abilities. Visuospatial abilities are
also not unitary. In a recent review of the literature, Halpern and Collaer (2005)
described the multiple components of visuospatial information processing, including
the many different combinations of retrieval from long-term memory; the generation,
maintenance, transformation, and scanning of images; and the interplay among verbal,
spatial, and pictorial mental representations. Visuospatial abilities are central to
the work of architects, chemists, dentists, designers, artists, engineers,
decorators, mechanics, taxi drivers, and many other professions. All of these fields
rely heavily on the ability to maintain a visual image while simultaneously deciding
what it would look like if it were viewed from another perspective, moved to another
location, moved through space at various speeds, or physically altered in some way.
Quantitative abilities are also heterogeneous. Consider the differences among tasks
like simple rote multiplication, word problems, and other more advanced mathematical
tasks (some of which are visuospatial in nature) like calculus, topology, and
geometry. Although the initial impetus for this review was the comment by Lawrence
Summers, former president of Harvard, about the innate abilities of females to be
scientists or professors of science, there are no ''science abilities'' per se. The
cognitiveabilities literature lists different hierarchically organized abilities,
which usually include verbal abilities; quantitative abilities; visuospatial
abilities; and some combination of perceptual speed, mechanical reasoning (which
often shares variance with visuospatial abilities), general reasoning, working
memory, and other abilities (e.g., Carroll, 1993). The abilities needed for success
in advanced and academic science are diverse and include verbal and social abilities
such as communicating clearly, comprehending complex texts, working with people,
writing journal articles and books, persuading granting agencies to fund one's work,
attracting graduate students, and functioning in a bureaucratic structure (usually a
university or other large institution); visuospatial abilities in imaging data and
models and translating words to visuospatial formats; and mathematical abilities in
solving equations and modeling scientific phenomena with mathematical properties.
''Science'' is a rubric for domains that use a common method of inquiry- similar in
this regard to ''history'' or ''literature,'' which are not thought of as cognitive
abilities.<component x="45.01" y="65.44" width="246.05" height="184.95" page="5"

of scientists and mathematicians- not just the ones seen in the media accepting the
highest prizes in their disciplines. Society needs people with a broad range of
skills to advance and support the fields of science and math. On average, do males
and females differ in the skills and abilities needed to pursue careers in these
complex disciplines? We begin to answer that question by first looking at average
differences early in development, then examining mean differences during later stages
of development and in the development of excellence in math and science. Cognitive
Sex Differences in Infancy Psychologists often look for sex differences very early in
life as clues to the relative contribution of biological and environmental factors.
The reasoning is that newborns have had fewer social interactions, so the earlier
that sex differences are reliably found, the more likely they may be assumed to be
biological in origin. It does not necessarily follow, however, that differences found
later in life are caused by social or environmental factors, because there are
developmental timelines for biological processes, including the timing of puberty,
the development of the forebrain, and the aging processes, all of which are also
influenced by the environment. And the assumption about early sex differences
reflecting biological differences may be questionable itself. Across species it is
common for there to be few sex differences early in life, even when substantial
differences emerge with reproductive maturation (Darwin, 1871). It may seem
impossible to assess cognitive abilities in newborns, but psychologists who study
cognitive development in infants have developed a variety of techniques to infer
when, in early life, babies comprehend language, maintain a persisting mental
representation of objects (memory), show interest in people and objects, make
inferences about the paths of motion and rates of speed of moving objects, have basic
''number sense,'' and understand that an adult who looks at an object is likely to
reach for it (Kotovsky &amp; Baillargeon, 1998; Phillips, Wellman, &amp; Spelke,
2002; Xu, Spelke, &amp; Goodard, 2005). The usual finding, from many studies
conducted by many researchers in different laboratories and across a range of tasks,
is that boys and girls develop early cognitive skills relating to quantitative
thinking and knowledge of objects in the environment equally well (Spelke, 2005). It
usually requires very large samples to detect differences in infancy or the toddler
years. For example, a study with over 3,000 2-year-old twins found that girls scored
significantly higher than boys ( p&lt;.0001) on measures of both verbal and nonverbal
cognitive ability, but sex accounted for only 3% of the variance in verbal ability
and 1% of the variance in nonverbal ability (Galsworthy, Dionne, Dale, &amp; Plomin,
2000).<component x="62.99" y="427.2" width="246.09" height="122.19" page="6"

abilities are essential for success in mathematics and science, given the densely
written technical articles to comprehend, the need for clear communication skills,
and the general language demands found in any advanced field of learning, even if
they differ somewhat in qualitative ways from those that might be required in the
humanities. Verbal abilities comprise different components, and the size of the sex
differences between males and females is not the same across all of them. Based on a
review of 24 large data sets (including several large representative samples of U.S.
students, working adults, and military personnel), Willingham and Cole (1997)
concluded that differences are small in the elementary school grades, with only
writing, language use, and reading having &gt; d .2, favoring females at fourth
grade. In the United States, by the end of high school, the largest differences,
again favoring d females, are found for writing ( between .5 and .6) and language d
usage ( between .4 and .5). In a report published by the U.S. Department of Education
(Bae et al., 2000), titled ''Trends in Educational Equity of Girls and Women,'' the
data on reading and writing achievement are described this way: ''Females have
consistently outperformed males in writing achievement at the 4th, 8th, and 11th
grade levels between 1988 and 1996. Differences in male and female writing
achievement were relatively large. The writing scores of female 8th graders were
comparable with those of 11th grade males'' (p. 18). In a meta-analytic review of the
research literature, Hedges and Nowell (1995) reported that ''the large sex
differences in writing . . . are alarming. The data imply that males are, on average,
at a rather profound disadvantage in the performance of this basic skill'' (p. 45).
Thus, the advantage for females on tests of writing is large and robust by the middle
to end of secondary school. If an assessment of verbal abilities is heavily weighted
with writing, and language-usage items cover topics that females are familiar with,
sex differences favoring females will be much larger than they will be in an
assessment of verbal abilities lacking these components. This is the case in the
review of sex differences in a recently published review conducted in the United
Kingdom (Strand, Deary, &amp; Smith, 2006). The SAT-Verbal (SAT-V) test has (up
through 2004) contained many verbalanalogy questions-a question type that is
conceptually closer to mapping relationships than it is to other types of verbal
usage, and one that often shows an advantage to males. Therefore, it is not
surprising that the SAT-V test, despite being labeled a ''verbal'' test, does not tap
the same verbal abilities as do tests of writing or other language areas in which
females excel; nor is it surprising that males score higher than females on the SAT-V
test. The female advantage in several specific verbal abilities, such as reading, is
international. The data in Figure 1 were taken from the Progress in International
Reading Literacy Study of 2001 (Mullis, Martin, Gonzalez, &amp; Kennedy, 2003; Ogle
et al., 2003). Fourth-grade females scored higher than fourth-grade males in every
participating country. The advantage for females in reading literacy is replicated
and is comparable in size for 15-year-olds in each of the 25 countries that
participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (National Center for
Education Statistics, 2002; data not shown). Similar to sex differences in verbal
abilities, sex differences in memory depend on the type of memory system examined.
Most psychologists divide memory into qualitatively different subsystems, with two
broad major classifications: working (or short-term) memory and long-term memory.
Long-term memory is further divided into multiple types, one of which is episodic
memory, or memory for events that are personally experienced and recalled with
information about time and place. Given the female advantage on some verbal
abilities, it might be expected that they also are better able than males to describe
personal memories. In a recent review of the literature, Herlitz and Rehnman (2007)
summarized multiple studies showing that females are better at episodic-memory tasks
than males are. For example, they describe a large population-based study of adults
(35-80 years old) in which sex differences were found on episodic-memory tasks that
required participants to remember previously presented words, objects, or activities
(Herlitz, &#xA8; Nilsson, &amp; Backman, 1997). Across multiple studies, differences
between men and women on such tasks are typically small &#xA8; to medium sized (e.g.,
Herlitz, Airaksinen, &amp; Nordstrom, 1999). There is also an advantage for females
in the ability to recognize faces, and this difference is found across the age span
with both children and adults (e.g., Lewin &amp; Herlitz, 2002; Lewin, Wolgers, &amp;
Herlitz, 2001). Perhaps the most surprising finding is that girls and women are most
accurate when recognizing female faces-their own sex bias. This ability of girls and
women to recognize female faces better than male faces and to perform better than
males on all measures of face recognition has been replicated cross-culturally.
Herlitz and Rehman attribute these results to differential attention paid by females
to female faces. These findings provide ancillary support for the hypothesis that
females are more ''people oriented'' than males are and thus choose careers and
courses of study, such as teaching and social work, that involve greater social
interaction, instead of careers that are more ''thing oriented,'' such as physics and
engineering (Lippa, 1998). Variability in Verbal Abilities In Strand et al.'s (2006)
sample of over 320,000 students aged 11 to 12 years, there was a greater percentage
of females in the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th stanines than males on the
verbal-abilities test that they used. (Stanines are standard scores indicating which
1/9 of a sample from a normal or bell-shaped population contains certain scores. A
score in the 1st stanine is among the lowest 4% of all scores and a score in the 9th
stanine is among the highest 4% of all scores; the 5th stanine corresponds to the
middle portion of scores and comprises 20% of all scores.) The female mean was higher
than the male mean, which explains the finding that there were more females in the
upper tail. Thus, differences in mean scores between females and males and/or
differences in variability will result in disproportionately more females or males in
the upper tail of a distribution, with the advantage going to the group with the
higher mean, greater variability, or both. The 2006 SAT data for college-bound
seniors on the writing test show a similar pattern. The female mean was higher than
the male mean (502 vs. 491) for the writing test, with 58.7% of the top 1% of all
test takers being female. The 2006 SAT data for college-bound seniors in the (new)
test of Critical Reading show a different pattern. The male mean is slightly higher
than the female mean (505 vs. 502), but 53.04% of test takers in the top 1% are
female, which runs counter to the usual conclusion that males are more variable in
all cognitiveability domains. The males in Strand et al.'s sample were more variable
on the quantitative and nonverbal reasoning ability tests, and the SAT data for
college-bound seniors for the math test showed that males are more variable in math,
suggesting that the male-variability hypothesis-or a higher proportion of males in
the upper tail-extends across multiple measures of quantitative abilities but not to
all cognitive-ability tests. Visuospatial Abilities A large body of research
conducted over the last 25 years has revealed substantial sex differences for some,
but not all, of the measures that reflect visuospatial information processing. These
differences begin to emerge around the time children enter kindergarten or begin
first grade, which may be as early as children can reliably perform tasks that assess
visuospatial abilities. The preschool literature on sex differences in spatial skills
was reviewed by Levine, Huttenlocher, Taylor, and Langrock (1999). They found that,
on average, preschool boys are more accurate than girls at spatial tasks 5 d that
measure accuracy of spatial transformations ( .31) and score higher on the Mazes
subtest of the Wechsler Preschool d5 and Primary Scale of Intelligence ( .30). They
concluded that sex differences in favor of boys are present on spatial tasks by 1 age
4 . 2 There is a large research literature on visuospatial tasks with young adults
(i.e., college students). Effect sizes vary considerably with the type of task,
ranging from small and fragile (i.e., not worth talking about, although still
favoring males when an effect size is found; e.g., Voyer, Voyer, &amp; Bryden, 1995)
for a commonly used task that involves imagining what a folded paper would look like
if it had a hole punched in it and then was unfolded-a fairly simple task-to larger
and more robust effects. Results using tasks that require generating an image and
maintaining it in memory while ''working'' on it (i.e., mentally folding and
unfolding it) vary depending on the complexity of the image to be generated and the
specific nature of the task, with 5 d observed differences that range between d5.63
and .77 (Loring-Meier &amp; Halpern, 1999). Mental rotation tasks that require
maintaining a three-dimensional figure in working memory while simultaneously
transforming it show very large sex differences, somewhere between .9 to 1.0 standard
deviations (Masters &amp; Sanders, 1993; Nordvik &amp; Amponsah, 1998), although some
researchers have reported smaller effect sizes (Voyer et al., 1995). The largest
differences are probably found with spatiotemporal tasks (judgments about moving
objects), but there are not enough studies with spatiotemporal tasks to allow a
reliable estimate of the effect size (Law, Pelligrino, &amp; Hunt, 1993). For
example, studies that used ''time to collision'' estimates that also involve
spatiotemporal abilities found that males made more accurate estimates (McLeod, &amp;
Ross, 1983). Similar results were found with a Chinese sample that made
time-tocollision estimates under varying conditions. The authors concluded that males
were better than females in judgment accuracy with this task (Liu, &amp; Huang,
1999). Thus, although the number of studies that examined spatiotemporal abilities is
small, results consistently point to a male advantage. An example of a mental
rotation task is shown in Figure 2. The task for the participant is to determine if
the two figures labeled A and the two figures labeled B could be made identical by
rotating them in space. Visuospatial Skills and Computer Games With the meteoric rise
of online games, there has been a great deal of interest in navigating through
virtual space. The popularity of online learning has led to the creation of a large
number of online simulations of real-world events in which learners can ''practice''
a wide variety of tasks, such as surgery or navigating through unknown territory in
preparation for military excursions (Macedonia, 2002; Wrobel, 2005). The 3-D virtual
environment literature consistently shows that males outperform females (e.g.,
Cutmore, Hine, Maberly, Langford, &amp; Grant, 2000), although some accommodations,
such as very large displays, can reduce or eliminate this effect (Tan, Czerwinsk,
&amp; Robertson, 2006). The results with virtual environments parallel those that are
often found in real-world way-finding tasks. An important variable in such tasks
involves the use of maps. In one study, participants were given a map that they were
to use to give directions to a stranger (L.N. Brown, Lahar, &amp; Mosley, 1998).
Males were generally more accurate than females in the directions that they gave, and
males were also more likely to use compass headings (North, South, East, West) when
giving directions; females used landmarks more often when giving directions. This
study, like many others, suggests that when women learn a route, either from a map or
from direct experience, they tend to rely on landmarks to find their way, whereas men
are more likely to attend to and keep track of the compass direction in which they
are traveling (Lawton, 1994). Similarly, when adults learned a route from a map, the
men made fewer errors in getting to a destination, but the women had better recall
for landmarks along the way (Galea &amp; Kimura, 1993). Visuospatial Abilities and
Mathematics It has been suggested that certain visuospatial sex differences
contribute to observed sex differences in some aspects of mathematical performance.
For example, Casey, Nuttall, Pezaris, and Benbow (1995) found that the sex difference
on the Mathematics portion of the SAT (SAT-M) was eliminated in several samples when
the effects of mental rotation ability were statistically removed. This suggests that
rotational skill may mediate the sex differences in certain high-level mathematical
abilities or, at the least, that these two abilities tend to covary. Linkage of
mathematical and visuospatial skill has important consequences, because high levels
of both of these skills are required for careers in fields such as physics and
engineering in which women are typically underrepresented. However, the precise
relation between these variables is complex, varying with the specific visuospatial
and mathematical measures considered (Tartre, 1990). In addition, these two variables
appear to be more strongly linked in females than males, suggesting that females may
be particularly hampered in mathematical domains if they have reduced visuospatial
skill. Quantitative Abilities Of all of the sex differences in cognitive abilities,
differences in quantitative abilities have received the most media attention because
of the large sex differences at the highest end of the distribution among those who
take the SAT-M test and other high-stakes mathematics tests. Differences depend on
the portion of the distribution that is examined, and because males are more variable
in quantitative and visuospatial abilities there are more males at both high- and
low-ability ends (a phenomenon we explore more fully in a later section). The reasons
why males show more variability are not known, but given the higher variability, even
small mean differences between females and males will result in a disproportionately
large number of males in both the high- and low-ability ends of the distribution.
There is no large-scale examination that assesses writing in a comparable way to the
SAT-M. If there were, we expect it would show the female advantage in verbal
abilities in secondary school and throughout adulthood because females have higher
mean scores on tests of writing. Researchers have identified mathematically
precocious preschoolers (scoring one to two standard deviations above the norm) and
have concluded that males are overrepresented in this precocious group even at this
young age (Robinson, Abbott, Berninger, &amp; Busse, 1996). Sex differences in
quantitative abilities do not follow a predictable developmental schedule, in that
they vary by the type of quantitative task examined. In fact, on average, females get
higher grades in school in math classes at all grade levels (Kimball, 1989;
Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997) and do slightly better on international assessments in
algebra (National Center for Education Statistics, 2005), possibly because of
algebra's language-like structure, but tend to score lower on quantitative tests when
the content is not directly related to what is taught in their own curriculum
(reviewed in Geary, 1996; Halpern, 2000). The differences between boys and girls in
mathematical abilities in elementary school tend to be small and to favor girls.
Abilities are assessed in elementary school mostly with school grades, which reflect
other factors, including behavior and turning in assignments on time. Girls are
slightly better at computational tasks in 4th grade and remain at the same advantage
relative to males through 12th d grade ( between .1 and .2; Willingham &amp; Cole,
1997; but see Royer, Tronsky, Can, Jackson, &amp; Marchant, 1999). Thus, we see
advantages for females in the early primary-school years, when mathematics consists
of computational knowledge and speed; little or no sex difference through the rest of
the primary-school years; and then a male advantage when the mathematical concepts
require more reasoning and are more spatial in nature, in the context of solving
problems in geometry and calculus, subjects typically taught in the higher
secondary-school grades (Geary, 1996; Hyde, Fennema, &amp; Lamon, 1990). The National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is regularly given to a representative
sample of U.S. students and differs from the international assessments and the SAT-M
test in that it is more closely aligned with curriculum. There is essentially no
difference between males and females on the mathematics test of the NAEP (Coley,
2001). In fact, when the international assessments from the Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS; standardized across 33 countries) are compared
for the final year of secondary school for math, science, and reading literacy, the
female advantage in reading and the male advantage in science are considerably larger
and more reliable than the male advantage found in mathematics. In order to achieve
in science, learners need good mathematical abilities, but they also need verbal and
visuospatial abilities, so science achievement cannot be explained by math scores
alone. This conclusion is in accord with Hedges and Nowell's (1995) meta-analytic
review, in which they concluded that ''average sex differences in most measured
abilities are small, with the possible exception of science, writing, and
stereotypical vocational aptitudes'' (p. 45). It seems that for the large-scale
quantitative assessments they reviewed, sex differences were smaller in mathematical
abilities than they were in these other areas, although the authors did not compare
specific types of mathematical skills in their review. Trends Over Time in Average
Abilities The question of whether sex differences have been decreasing over time
depends on which data are examined. In a meta-analysis, Hyde, Fennema, and Lamon
(1990) concluded that sex differences in some mathematical skills were decreasing.
But different sorts of data give different answers, probably because mathematics is
not a unitary domain and neither are the competencies assessed across studies. Hedges
and Nowell (1995), in their meta-analysis, conclude that ''differences do not appear
to be decreasing ... across the 32 year period'' (p. 45). Despite all of the interest
focused on the superior-ability tail of the SAT-M test as it relates to scientists,
it is instructive to consider average male-female performance on this test over time,
as shown in Figure 3. The average difference between males and females on the SAT-M
test has remained unchanged for over 35 years, despite the large increase in the
number of females entering fields that require mathematics. Logically, as more girls
take advanced coursework in mathematics, their mean score on the SAT-M would be
expected to increase, but this has not happened. Another possibility is that the
large increase in the number of females taking the SAT-M test has been lowering the
average scores (i.e., because an overall less select group of females is taking the
test). Racial and Ethnic Differences in Average Abilities In thinking about sex
differences in math and science abilities, one important question is the extent to
which various races, ethnic groups, and peoples around the world show the same
patterns of results. To answer this question, racial and ethnic groups were compared
in terms of education and work in the United States (Coley, 2001). Large racial and
ethnic group differences appear overall, and the size of the differences between
females and males within each racial and ethnic group differs somewhat. Sex-typed
cognitive patterns do not vary much among racial and ethnic groups, with a few
exceptions. For example, Blacks are the only group in which females score higher than
males on the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT-V), but the
few-point difference on this test is too small to be meaningful (Coley, 2001). Prior
to 2005, the SAT-V contained a large proportion of verbal analogies, and it did not
have a writing component; therefore, despite being labeled a ''verbal'' test, it did
not contain the components of verbal language in which females excel. Results from
the NAEP showed that females scored higher, on average, in all racial or ethnic
groups and across all ages, in reading, writing, and civics. The graduate admissions
tests (the GRE and the Graduate Management Admission Test, GMAT, which is used for
admissions to business schools) show that males score higher across all racial/ethnic
groups, with the largest differences in quantitative areas. But White, Black, and
Hispanic females are more likely than their male counterparts to graduate from
college, an advantage that does not translate into higher earnings. The relationship
between education and career success (when assessed with earnings) is moderated by
sex and race in many job categories. The moderating variables may explain a portion
of the sex differences in career success in math and science fields as
well.<component x="321.05" y="65.45" width="246.06" height="486.15" page="6"

abilities and career achievement are complicated, but the fact that there are some
tests and some areas of mathematics and science in which females, across all racial
and ethnic groups, tend to excel, and some in which males, across all racial and
ethnic groups, tend to excel, makes it difficult for any single theory such as
motivation, learning, biology, or test-related anxiety to explain the difference. The
consistency of the sex-related cognitive pattern of results is consistent with
predictions based on an evolutionary perspective (Geary, 1998), but as we note later,
there are many researchers who raise objections to evolutionary explanations for
science and math data. A Cognitive-Process Taxonomy of Average Abilities Halpern
(2000, 2004) offered a solution to the mismatch in outcomes for males and females of
school grades-outcomes that are based, at least in part, on tests that reflect school
curricula, as well as on scores on standardized tests that are comprised of questions
that are novel or unrelated to the school curriculum. By considering the underlying
cognitive processes used in solving different sorts of math problems, Halpern
proposed a taxonomy in which math problems that were spatial in nature would be
advantageous to males and those that did not require visuospatial abilities would
show either no sex differences or an advantage to females. In a series of studies,
Gallagher and her colleagues (Gallagher &amp; DeLisi, 1994; Gallagher, Levin, &amp;
Cahalan, 2002) examined cognitive patterns of sex differences on GRE math problems.
They found the usual sex differences favoring males when there was an<component

with a spatially based solution strategy, but not when solution strategies were more
verbal in nature or were similar to the ones presented in popular mathematics
textbooks. They also found that there were no sex differences for GRE math problems
when solutions required multiple algorithmic steps (i.e., differences were not due to
the ability to hold information in working memory), but the usual male advantage was
found with math problems that had multiple possible solution paths. Thus, some
portion of the performance differences between males and females on GRE math problems
lies in the recognition and/or selection of a solution strategy that may be novel.
Gallagher et al. found that the usual male advantage on standardized mathematics
tests can be minimized, equated for women and men, or maximized by altering the way
problems are presented and emphasizing the particular types of cognitive processes
that lead to the optimal solution. What is unknown is how these manipulations of test
items affect the validity of the GRE in predicting grades in graduate school or
success after graduation. Gallagher's research on verbal and visuospatial
representation of quantitative problems on the GRE is an exciting advance because it
allows researchers to identify the locus of the sex difference and also shows that
identical mathematical content can be presented in ways that are advantageous to
males or females. In reviewing each problem on the quantitative portion of the GRE,
she found that some problems had an optimal solution strategy; for other problems,
different strategies were equally fast in yielding the correct answer. Research has
shown that visuospatial training leads to improvement in a variety of tasks
(Newcombe, 2002), so we can expect that training with multiple problem
representations may have the same effects (Johnson, 1984). Recent meta-analyses have
shown that children and adults can improve their visuospatial skills with training
(Maruli, Liu, Warren, Uttal, &amp; Newcombe, 2007). The overall mean effect size
(mean of 13 effect sizes) is d5.52. The researchers explained that the effect size
for visuospatial-skills training was moderated because control groups that did not
receive the training also showed improvement. Recall that research by Casey et al.
(1995) found that sex differences on the SAT-M could be eliminated when the effect of
mental-rotation ability was removed. One possible educational intervention for
females and males would be to teach them multiple ways to solve problems using both
verbal and visuospatial solution strategies, thereby allowing for more flexibility in
overall problem solving. In the most comprehensive test of the hypothesis that women
can learn to enhance their visuospatial skills and thereby enjoy greater success in
STEM fields, Sorby and Baartmans (2000) created a special course designed to enhance
three-dimensional spatial skills. The skills that were targeted for instruction were
those that are needed by students in engineering, architecture, and other fields in
which success frequently depends on the use of visuospatial abilities. All students
with low scores on a test of visuospatial ability were encouraged to enroll in a
course to improve these skills. This course has been offered for many years for both
women and men at Michigan Technological University. As Sorby and Baartmans explain,
there are many theories to explicate the finding that men tend to have more highly
developed spatial skills than women. One promising theory suggests that sketching
three-dimensional objects is a significant factor (but not the only factor) in the
development of these skills. Sorby and Baartmans designed and implemented a course to
improve the spatial visualization skills of first-year engineering students. They
measured improvement in spatial skills with standardized testing instruments in each
of the 7 years of the project so far. The gains made by students on these
spatial-skills tests as a result of participation in their course were statistically
and materially significant. Both men and women who initially scored low on
visuospatial tests benefitted from the instruction. This improvement in spatial
skills resulted in improved performance in subsequent graphics courses, as measured
by final grades in the courses, and better retention in engineering programs, which
suggests that the effects lasted over time and were of practical
significance.<component x="303.02" y="65.56" width="246.09" height="373.23" page="11"

mathematical and scientific abilities by examining differences at the population mean
is useful but can lead to misleading conclusions if the distribution of test scores
is not similar for males and females (Feingold, 1995). This is particularly the case
when the focus is on populations characterized by high abilities and the potential to
become future mathematics or science professionals (Wise, Steel, &amp; MacDonald,
1979). Differences in population variance, as well as potential skew in these
distributions, could lead to overrepresentation of one sex over the other at the
extremes. Sex Differences in Distributions and Variances Feingold (1992) and Hedges
and Friedman (1993) examined the results from available test-norming studies to
assess the possible effects of sex differences in both mean test scores and
variances. There were differences in variances (males were more variable), and, when
combined with mean differences, these two effects produced more males at the high end
of the distribution. Drawing from data on abilities that were measured in six
national surveys over a 32-year interval, Hedges and Nowell (1995) found that, in
addition to the (small) mean differences in mathematical and science abilities
favoring males (science: 5 d .32; math:d5.16), the test scores of males were more
variable than were those of females, with variance ratios differing between 3% and
20% (Hedges &amp; Nowell, 1995), with little change over the 32-year interval
sampled. Similarly, Strand et al. (2006) found many more males than females in the
top stanines in mathematics and nonverbal reasoning (also see Deary, Thorpe, Wilson,
Starr, &amp; Whalley, 2003, fig. 1, p. 537). In the 9th stanine (top 4% of all
scores) of the quantitative test, 60% were males; in the 9th stanine of the nonverbal
reasoning test, 54% were males. Similar results were reported by Stanley, Benbow,
Brody, Dauber, and Lupkowski (1992) in their study of 86 nationally standardized
achievement and aptitude tests (obtained from 1982 to 1987) and by Feingold (1995)
with the Differential Aptitude Test. Thus, differences in mathematical and science
abilities that are large enough to be of practical importance are found at the high
end of the ability distribution (Humphreys, 1988; Hyde et al., 1990). Data from the
Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) exemplifies this phenomenon. In their
first article on the topic, Benbow and Stanley (1980) observed sex differences in
mathematical reasoning ability among 9,927 intellectually talented 12- to
14-year-olds who had taken the SATseveral years before the typical age. The sex
difference on the SAT-M, which is a test of mathematical reasoning ability especially
when administered to the precocious in the seventh and eighth grades, d5 favored the
males and averaged .40. There were essentially no differences on the SAT-V. Table 1,
which is from another SMPY sample of precocious youth, illustrates these sex
differences with four different samples. In a follow-up to the first study, Benbow
and Stanley (1983) reported SAT data on another 40,000 young, intellectually talented
adolescents, and the findings in the first studies were reaffirmed. No differences of
any significance were found on the SAT-V, but the SAT-M revealed sex differences
favoring males.<component x="62.99" y="65.44" width="246.1" height="46.91" page="12"

graphically (Benbow, 1988), the male and female SAT-V distributions were found to be
isomorphic. However, the male SAT-M distribution, in contrast to the female SAT-M
distribution, manifested a higher mean and larger variance, along with a skew,
resulting in an exponential intensification of the ratio of males to females in the
upper tail of the distribution. The male:female ratio was 2:1 for young adolescents
with SAT-M scores of 500 or more, 4:1 for those with scores of at least 600, and 13:1
for those with scores of at least 700 (Benbow &amp; Stanley, 1983). Because the
Hedges and Nowell (1995) data showed that high sex ratios (5:1 among the top 3% and
7:1 among the top 1%) are found in the upper tails of the ability distributions of
nationally representative samples, those authors concluded that the high sex ratios
found in some highly talented samples like that of the SMPY need not be attributed to
differential selection by sex. Since the initial Benbow and Stanley studies were
published in the 1980s, several million seventh and eighth graders have taken the SAT
(or the American College Test, ACT) through annual talent searches (Benbow &amp;
Stanley, 1996; Van Tassel-Baska, 1996). Sex differences in the distributions of SAT-M
scores among intellectually talented 12- to 14-year-olds have persisted and are also
observed on the ACT-Math (Benbow &amp; Stanley, 1996; Stanley, 1994). For reasons
that are not well understood, current ratios of males to females at the high end

earlier studies, with male:female ratios among those scoring 700 or more on the SAT-M
before age 13 now being less than 4:1 (Blackburn, personal communication, August 4,
2005). Stanley, who studied mathematically precocious youth for decades, explained
that 25 years ago there were 13 boys for every girl who scored above 700 on the SAT-M
at age 13. Now the ratio is only 2.8:1, which is a precipitous drop that has not been
widely reported in the news media. According to Stanley, ''It's gone way down as
women have had the opportunity to take their math earlier'' (quoted in Monastersky, z
2005, 45). There are no studies exploring the reasons for the decline, although
possible reasons include that fact that high-school mathematics coursework for boys
and girls has become more similar and more girls are getting more encouragement in
the form of special programs and mentoring to encourage their participation in
higher-level math courses. Regardless, these results suggest that the male advantage
for mathematical skills may be limited to the upper end of the ability distribution.
Sex Differences in Mathematical Reasoning in Gifted Students Mills, Ablard, and
Strumpf (1993) documented sex differences d as early as second grade (average among
intellectually gifted students in mathematical reasoning 5.43). Robinson et al.
(1996) reported sex differences in mathematical precocity before kindergarten
(average d5.37). More significantly, these latter sex differences were maintained
following exposure to mathematical enrichment opportunities aimed at both males and
females. Males gained more than females did on quantitative and visuospatial measures
after an average of 28 biweekly intervention sessions (Robinson, Abbott, Berninger,
Busse, &amp; Mukhopadhyah, 1997). The implications of these differences, and
especially of the disparate ratios at the top for the math-science education
pipeline, are clear: Given an early advantage in these fundamental quantitative
skills, a greater number of males than females will qualify for advanced training in
disciplines that place a premium on mathematical reasoning. As Hedges and Nowell
(1995) stated, ''Sex differences in variance and mean lead to substantially fewer
females than males who score in the upper tails of the mathematics and science
distributions and hence are poised to succeed in the sciences. The achievement of
fair representation of women in science will be much more difficult if there are only
one-half to oneseventh as many women as men who excel in the relevant abilities'' (p.
45). Other cognitive and noncognitive sex differences expand our understanding of the
factors that influence the way precocious youth develop in math. Table 1 contains
data on abilities and values of gifted students in the Midwest who were identified by
SMPY from 1988 to 1991 and who attended a special summer program (Lubinski &amp;
Benbow, 1992). Again, sex differences in mathematical reasoning ability were
consistently observed (average d5.84), but sex differences in the SAT-V were not
observed. Table 1 includes other cognitive measures of general intelligence and
specific abilities. No meaningful differences were observed among scores on the
Advanced Raven Progressive Matrices (Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 1992), which is a
nonverbal measure of general intelligence. There were, however, substantial
differences in spatial and mechanical reasoning abilities (average d5.92). In
addition to these differences in specific abilities, there were also sex differences
in vocational interests and values. Table 1 presents the differences in values. As
can be seen, males are higher on theoretical values, and females are higher on social
values, among other trends. Strongly held theoretical values are characteristic of
physical scientists, while social values are negatively correlated with interests in
the physical sciences (Achter, Lubinski, Benbow, &amp; Eftekhari-Sanjani, 1999).
Similar preference distinctions between males and females have been found using the
Strong Interest Inventory (Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2006), with the SMPY males having
stronger investigative and realistic interests and the SMPY females having stronger
social interests (Achter, Lubinski, &amp; Benbow, 1996, Appendix B, p. 76). Thus, it
appears that early differences in mathematical skills may occur along with other
factors relevant to the development of scientific expertise.<component x="303.02"

Browne, 2002), however, give a more nuanced look at this trend and reveal that there
are substantial differences among subdisciplines in addition to the differences among
disciplines. In engineering, for example, women are scarce in mining/mineral and
mechanical engineering (0% and 6%, respectively) but not in environmental health and
bioengineering (25%). Among physics doctorates, 17% of acoustics but only 4% of
particle physics degrees are earned by women. In biology, 22% of the entomology
degrees went to women, in comparison to 68% of those in the nutritional sciences.
And, in psychology, where 64% of the doctoral degrees went to women in 1995,
physiological psychology attracted 38% women, in contrast to developmental
psychology, which attracted 80% women. Finally, in the social sciences as a whole,
fewer women chose statistics and economics (23% and 24%, respectively) than chose
anthropology and sociology (58% and 53%; Browne, 2002). It is tempting to ask whether
these differences in higher education emanate from sex differences in abilities, but
the combination of native ability, socioeconomic context, personal interests, and
cultural influence is remarkably complex. For example, while women do not complete
their doctorates in natural sciences and engineering at the same rates as men, the
difference disappears when mathematical ability is adjusted for (J.C. Baker, 1998).
Moreover, while sex differences in mathematical ability are associated with sex
differences in occupational status and income (Paglin &amp; Rufolo, 1990), sex
differences in interests-such as a preference for working with people-are also
important in explaining educational and career choice. Sex Differences in Career
Development Choices Xie and Shauman (2003) noted that the best understanding of the
engagement of males and females in science is likely to emerge from studies that take
a life-course perspective. The SMPY has collected longitudinal information on a large
number of high-ability males and females to investigate their career<component

Benbow, 2006). (The very oldest individuals in the study were born in 1959 and the
youngest in the early 1980s.) Over 4,000 intellectually talented individuals,
identified according to their performance on the SAT during seventh or eighth grade,
have been tracked for over three decades in four separate cohorts (along with a
comparison group of 714 nonprecocious individuals). There is no comparable study of
its kind. Students were invited to take the SAT in the seventh or eighth grade if
they had scored in the top percentiles on a standardized achievement test
administered by their school. The first cohort comprised seventh and eighth graders
from the Greater Baltimore Area who were identified in the early 1970s as
representing the top 1% in mathematical ability. The second cohort included seventh
graders from the Mid-Atlantic region who scored in the top .5% in mathematical
ability, verbal ability, or both. The third cohort included seventh and eighth
graders from across the nation who were identified in the early 1980s as being in the
top .01% in mathematical ability, verbal ability, or both. The fourth cohort, drawn
from the Midwest in the late 1980s and early to mid 1990s, comprised two groups: One
represented the top .5% in mathematic ability, verbal ability, or both, and the other
represented individuals who scored at least at the 97th percentile on any subtest of
an achievement test administered by their schools. Participants completed
comprehensive surveys and inventories providing a detailed view of their development
and educational/ career trajectories. The last survey of this group occurred when
participants were in their mid 30s, with earlier data collection points occurring at
ages 13, 18, and 23. Because it is likely that not all future talent for mathematics
and science can be identified using the SAT at age 13, the SMPY decided to form a
fifth cohort to determine the generalizability of its findings. Cohort five comprised
714 individuals, educated in the United States, who were enrolled in the top 15 U.S.
graduate programs in mathematics and science. Because an equal sample of men and
women was needed in departments where the male:female ratios often exceeded 3:1, the
women were oversampled (i.e., more women were included in the sample than their
proportional enrollment in graduate programs). This cohort was studied
retrospectively, concurrently, and prospectively (age 33 and beyond; Lubinski,
Benbow, Shea, Eftekhari-Sanjani, &amp; Halvorson 2001; Lubinski, Benbow, Webb, &amp;
Bleske-Rechek, 2006). As in other studies, no statistically significant sex
differences in overall general intelligence were found for the SMPY samples, but
differences were found in certain specific abilities. Individuals who were assessed
by age 13 as being in the top 1% in mathematical reasoning ability (cohorts 1 and 2)
became highly educated: Over 90% earned a bachelor's degree, and over 25% earned a
doctorate, with essentially no sex differences in degrees earned (Benbow, Lubinski,
Shea, &amp; Eftekhari-Sanjani, 2000). About 50% earned at least one postsecondary
degree in math and science areas, with 64% of the top .5% in<component x="303.02"

at least one postsecondary math or science degree (Benbow et al., 2000). The men were
at least twice as likely to earn degrees in the inorganic sciences and engineering as
the women, with the men earning almost five times as many doctorates in these areas
as the women. As shown in Figure 4, more women than men earned doctoral degrees in
the life sciences and medicine (Benbow et al., 2000). Not surprisingly, the
subsequent career choices of these mathematically talented individuals mirror the
pattern seen for degree specialization. In a subsequent study to Benbow et al.
(2000), mathematically talented individuals in cohorts 1 and 2 who had planned on
majoring in mathematical or scientific areas when they entered college were studied
in more depth at approximately age 33, to better understand the factors that
differentiated those who remained in mathematics or science and earned such degrees
from those who opted to pursue undergraduate degrees in other areas (Webb et al.,
2002). More males had declared an intention to pursue a mathematics or science degree
than females, as shown in Tables 5 and 6, and there was greater attrition from the
mathematical or scientific disciplines by females than there was by males (26% vs.
17%). High-school educational experiences, abilities, and interests predicted whether
an undergraduate degree was attained in mathematics or science or the individual left
to pursue other areas of study. The ones persisting with mathematics or science
degrees had higher SAT-M scores and more high-school course work in mathematics and
science, and they more often reported a mathematics or science course as their
favorite course. They also had congruent occupational interests as measured by the
Study of Values and Holland Occupational codes. Once these variables had been entered
into the discriminant function analysis (a statistical procedure for determining
which variables are important in differentiating two or more groups), sex added
essentially no explanatory power. (By itself, sex yielded a squared multiple
correlation-a measure of the amount of variance that can be explained by or
attributed to a variable-of only .01, independent of the other variables.) These
results underscore the complex set of explanatory variables needed to predict career
success in mathematics and science. In other words, among highly gifted individuals,
those who pursued careers in science and mathematics also took more related
coursework in high school, rated math and science courses as their favorites, and
were interested in math and science. More of the highly gifted males than the females
had these patterns of experiences and attitudes that were predictive of career
choices in science and mathematics. To pursue further the role of mathematical
reasoning ability in math and science achievement, individuals in cohort 1 who by age
13 had scored in the top quartile of the top 1% were compared with those in the
bottom quartile of the top 1% (Benbow, 1992; Wai, Lubinski, &amp; Benbow, 2005). On
37 math/science achievement variables assessed at age 23 (these variables went well
beyond grades), statistically and substantively significant effect sizes were
observed favoring the top versus the bottom quartile on 34 of the variables (Benbow,
1992). (Effect sizes averaged d5.97 for continuous variables 5 d and .57 for
categorical variables from the high-school years, 5 5 d d .47 for the continuous
variables and .39 for the d categorical variables from the college years, and 5.41
from the early stages of graduate school.) Although sex differences were found in
these analyses, they were smaller than the differences between the top and bottom
quartiles, and they were not observed in the relation between mathematical ability
and academic achievement. At age 33, the same pattern emerged for the highly gifted
individuals in Cohort 1 when the following variables were studied: secured
doctorates, math/science PhDs, income, patents, and tenure-track positions at top
U.S. universities (Wai et al., 2005). These results provide evidence against the
''threshold'' hypothesis, which maintains that there is some (high) level of ability
needed for career success in cognitively demanding occupations and that scoring
beyond that level will not increase the probability of success in those fields. What
is missing from predictions based on the threshold hypothesis is an understanding
that there is a great deal of variability in the extreme tails of ability
distributions, such that the top quarter of the top 1% could be very far from the
bottom quarter of the top 1% (with actual distances depending on the specific

visualized by imagining a bell-shaped curve with the tails never quite touching the
horizontal axis. The results of this study contrast with a conclusion drawn by the
Science authors of a letter published in (Muller et al., 2005), who claimed:
''[T]here is little evidence that those scoring at the top of the range in
standardized tests are likely to have more successful careers in the sciences. Too
many other factors are involved'' (p. 1043). Yet ability is not everything. A
congruent preference pattern is also a good predictor of the discipline in which one
is likely to earn a four-year degree (Achter et al., 1999) and one's occupational
setting at age 33 (Wai et al., 2005). Preference patterns add incremental
(additional) validity beyond abilities, and the effect holds for both males and
females. Visuospatial Ability and Mathematics and Science Careers All of the above
studies speak to the power of mathematical reasoning ability in predicting subsequent
math/science achievement. Yet prediction can be improved if one considers
visuospatial ability and the relative strength of mathematical ability compared to
verbal ability within a given individual, both of which display sex differences.
Individual differences in the relative strength of verbal, mathematical, and
quantitative abilities that are identified at an early age can predict differences in
developmental trajectories and occupational pursuits (Achter et al., 1999; Lubinski,
Webb, Morelock, &amp; Benbow, 2001). We discuss both sets of findings next.
Proficiency in visuospatial ability has long been associated with success in
cognitively demanding educational tracks and occupations such as engineering,
architecture, physics, chemistry, and surgery (Smith, 1964; Snow &amp; Yalow, 1982;
Sorby, &amp; Baartmans, 2000) and is a salient characteristic of physical scientists
(Gohm, Humphreys, &amp; Yao, 1998; Humphreys, Lubinski, &amp; Yao, 1993). Yet,
visuospatial ability is not routinely taught or assessed by schools and thus is not
often developed and assessed in ways that influence students' educational and career
plans.<component x="45.01" y="361.66" width="246.06" height="159.84" page="17"

precocious males and 170 precocious females, Shea, Lubinski, and Benbow (2001)
employed multivariate statistical methods (i.e., methods that use multiple dependent
measures), using age-13 SAT-M, SAT-V, and visuospatial-ability scores for
top-.5%-ability individuals, to predict a series of developmentally sequenced
educational/ vocational outcomes: (a) favorite and least favorite high-school course,
(b) field of undergraduate degree, (c) field of graduate degree, and (d) occupation
at age 33. Visuospatial ability added incremental validity to SAT-M and SAT-V
assessments in predicting educational/vocational outcomes over 20 years, an effect
shown in Figure 5. Perusal of Figure 5 will show, for example, that students who
reported that their favorite highschool subjects were in the humanities or social
sciences tended to be above the mean on the SAT-V (above the horizontal axis), below
the mean on the SAT-M (to the left of the vertical axis), and below the mean on
spatial ability (indicated with an arrow facing left). The other three graphs in
Figure 5, which show the profile for their least-favorite high-school courses,
college majors, and occupations, can be read in the same way. It is not surprising,
given these findings, that Humphreys et al.'s (1993) 13-year longitudinal study of
400,000 high-school students, assessed on mathematical, visuospatial, and verbal
abilities, concluded that mathematics and science disciplines appear to be losing
many talented individuals because selection for these educational tracks is limited
to mathematical and verbal abilities. Intellectually talented adolescents with
stronger visuospatial ability relative to verbal ability (determined
intraindividually) were more likely to be found in engineering, computer science, and
mathematical fields, whereas those with the inverse ability pattern tended to
gravitate toward humanities, social science, organic science, medical arts such as
nursing, and legal fields (Shea et al., 2001). A similar pattern also emerged for
relative intraindividual strengths in quantitative versus verbal abilities, with
visuospatial ability exhibiting somewhat greater overall discriminative power. That
is, students who are relatively more verbally than quantitatively or spatially
talented gravitate toward the humanities and social sciences, whereas those with the
opposite ability pattern lean more toward engineering and the physical sciences.
Webb, Lubinski, and Benbow (in press) obtained similar results with an independent
sample of 1,060 high-ability adolescents tracked for 5 years. These findings held for
both males and females. In a more definitive study, Lubinski, Webb, et al. (2001)
found that among profoundly gifted individuals (top 1 in 10,000 in ability and who
are disproportionately male), those whose ability strength was mathematical compared
to verbal but nonetheless had very high verbal ability reported mathematics and
science courses as their favorites in high school and college, and disproportionately
pursued educational credentials in mathematics and science, reporting three times as
many awards and special accomplishments in science and technology as compared to the
humanities and arts. Those with the inverse ability &gt; pattern (i.e., V M) reported
the humanities to be their favorite courses in high school and in college,
disproportionately pursued educational credentials in the humanities and law, and
reported twice as many awards and special accomplishments in the humanities and arts
compared to sciences and technology. Those with relatively flat profiles fell
somewhere in between. It must be acknowledged that the attribute of having a ''tilt''
favoring mathematical and visuospatial abilities compared to &gt; verbal (i.e., M V),
regardless of level of ability, is more frequently exhibited by males than by females
across the four cohorts in the SMPY study. Females tend to be more balanced in their
ability profile (i.e., M V) and this leads them to choose ' mathematics, engineering,
or physical-science careers less frequently than their male counterparts do. In other
words, these data show that having better math abilities relative to one's own verbal
abilities is associated with selecting careers in mathematics and science and that
this tilt is more frequently found in high-ability males than it is in high-ability
females. When making career choices, highly gifted individuals consider their own
pattern of abilities and not whether they have the absolute level of ability needed
to pursue a career in a demanding field of study. They seem to be implicitly asking,
''What am I better at?'' and not asking ''Am I smart enough to succeed in a
particular career?'' The above studies illustrate how sex differences in mathematical
and visuospatial abilities detected by age 13 have consequences that can be seen 20
years later. These sex differences in abilities and preferences predict differences
in participation and achievement in mathematics and science for individuals in their
mid 30s. Sharper predictive power is obtained if abilities are combined with
preferences, which also display sex differences by age 13 (Achter et al., 1996, p.
76; Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2006). Males more frequently than females display
preference patterns that are conducive to pursuing science and mathematics careers
and that, when coupled with abilities, form aptitude complexes (Corno et al., 2002;
Cronbach &amp; Snow, 1977), vocational taxons (Dawis &amp; Lofquist, 1984), or trait
clusters (Ackerman, 1996; Ackerman &amp; Heggestad, 1997) that contribute to the
development of scientific skills. The finding that highly gifted individuals prefer
academic areas in which they are most able further exacerbates discrepancies at the
high levels of achievement, as do any differences in self-competency beliefs, with
their effect on task values and, thus, engagement in science (Jacobs, Lanza, Osgood,
Eccles, &amp; Wigfield, 2002). High-ability males were found in one study to have
unrealistically high self-competency beliefs; no such effect was found for females,
whose beliefs also were high but were more accurate predictors of future performance
(e.g., r5.38 for males vs.r5.61 for females; Gibbons, Benbow, &amp; Gerrard, 1994).
Additional Factors Influencing Sex Differences in Career Choices of High-Ability
Individuals Occupational choices are not made in isolation or independently of other
life decisions such as marrying, having children, or living close to relatives
(Benbow et al., 2000; Eccles, 1994). There are trade-offs, and for many successful
women there exists considerable conflict between the traditionally feminine values
and goals in life (e.g., child-care responsibilities) and the expectations from
traditionally male highly competitive achievement activities (Browne, 2002; Eccles,
1994). Indeed, intellectually talented men in their mid 30s are on average more d
career focused ( s of .21 - .76), work longer hours, and are willing to work longer
hours than women of the same age whose reports indicate that they tend to prefer a
more balanced life approach with regard to career, family, and friends (Benbow et
al., 2000; Lubinski, 2004, Webb et al., 2002). If these sex differences continue over
a sustained time frame, women's additional family responsibilities may help explain
some of the underrepresentation of women in science careers (Eccles, 1994) and at the
highest levels of various professional careers. That is, if men remain more career
focused and spend more hours working, for whatever the reasons, then, in all
likelihood, men will accomplish more than their female counterparts and will likely
be seen as more successful in the world of work. Already, men in the SMPY sample
reported higher incomes, a difference that disappeared when hours worked was
controlled (Benbow et al., 2000). This does not mean, however, that men are more
successful in life or more personally satisfied: On all indicators examined, these
talented men and women in their mid 30s reported feeling equally good about
themselves and about their achieved success. Xie and Shauman (2003), when studying
women in science, found that most of the observed sex differences in research
productivity could be attributed to personal characteristics and the structural
features of the employment setting. Having children was one factor associated with
less engagement in mathematical and science careers for women but not for men. Sex
differences in mathematical and science careers are indeed extremely complex and are
surely influenced by the social structures in which individuals are situated, the
neighborhood resources, and the networks of interaction in which they participate
(Eccles, 1994; Entwistle, Alexander, &amp; Olsson, 1994; Farmer, Wardrop, Anderson,
&amp; Risinger, 1995; Xie &amp; Shuman, 2003). The fact that social and environmental
variables are important determinants of career success, however, does not mean that
we cannot draw conclusions about the role of abilities, preferences, and other
factors that may be responsible for producing sex disparities in participation,
engagement, and achievement in the quantitative disciplines at the very highest
levels. The SMPY studies clearly demonstrate that sex differences in mathematical and
visuospatial abilities, the male tilt compared to female balance in ability profiles,
and differing preferences and educational experiences all contribute to the sex
differences in outcomes among the highly gifted.<component x="303.02" y="65.45"

for examining the origins and meaning of sex differences in science and mathematical
achievement. In psychology, evolutionary theory emphasizes the adaptive value of
behaviors and mental processes that have developed throughout the entire history of a
species. Answering questions about sex differences in academic and cognitive domains
from an evolutionary perspective is complicated because the knowledge bases,
technical skills, and insights that are needed to achieve in math and science are
rooted in the poorly understood interaction of cognitive and motivational factors and
culture-specific educational goals and opportunities to master these academic
domains. Most of the competencies that compose modern math and science are not the
direct result of evolution (Geary, 1996). Studying advanced topics in mathematics and
science, for example, are recent activities for humans, so they may be better thought
of as being built upon earlier adaptive solutions for functioning in a specific
cultural context rather than as direct reflections of the history of our species
(Gazzaniga &amp; Heatherton, 2006; Geary, 2007). Nonetheless, an evolutionary
perspective can contribute to our understanding of sex differences in math and
science by providing a way to understand proximate biological correlates (e.g., sex
hormones) of these differences, and a perspective for simultaneously considering
developmental and social correlates. A detailed consideration of potential indirect
evolutionary influences on sex differences in math and science is beyond the scope of
this monograph and, in fact, may not be possible given our current state of knowledge
in these areas. Our goals are to provide examples of how an evolutionary perspective
can be used to frame our understanding of current empirical findings and to generate
hypotheses for future study. Sexual Selection Darwin (1871) proposed that many sex
differences have evolved by means of sexual selection. The mechanisms involve
competition with members of the same sex over mates and discriminative choice of
mating partners. The most frequently studied dynamics are male-male competition over
access to mates and female choice of mating partners. It is clear that female
competition and male choice occur in many species. Whatever the pattern, the most
common result is the evolutionary elaboration of physical, behavioral, or cognitive
traits that facilitate competition and choice. In recent decades, the study of
sexually selected sex differences has emerged as a vibrant area in the biological
sciences and has yielded insights into the evolution and proximate expression of
these differences across hundreds of species (Andersson, 1994; Andersson &amp;
Simmons, 2006). Although the results of these studies strongly confirm the importance
of sexual selection, some sex differences may have evolved that are unrelated to
sexual selection (Isaac, 2005). Even for traits related to sexual selection, many
issues remain to be resolved regarding the nuances of competition and choice and the
interaction of these dynamics (Andersson &amp; Simmons, 2006). Sex Hormones The
proximate expression of many of the traits that have evolved by means of sexual
selection are influenced by prenatal and postnatal exposure to sex hormones,
particularly androgens in mammals (e.g., Adkins-Regan, 2005; Morris, Jordan, &amp;
Breedlove, 2004). Androgens and other hormones can influence sex differences in
cognition and behavior through early prenatal organization of associated brain areas,
activation of these areas by postnatal exposure to androgens, or some combination.
The influences of sex hormones are, however, complex and sometimes very subtle, and
often interact reciprocally with genetic sex, physical health, and social and
ecological context (Arnold et al., 2004; McEwen et al., 1997). As an example, these
reciprocal relations are important for understanding how androgens interact with male
health and social context in the expression (or not) of evolved sex differences.
Within-Sex Variation The processes that are at work in sexual selection can also
exaggerate within-sex variation (Houle, 1992; Pomiankowski ( ( &amp; M ller, 1995).
Pomiankowski's and M ller's cross-species review and analysis suggest that within-sex
variation can occur when competition or choice favors traits toward the phenotypic
extreme (observable traits such as the peacock's tail). Although much remains to be
learned, it appears that selection that favors extreme traits can result in the
evolution of genetic mechanisms that result in exaggerated within-sex variation as
well as the evolution of condition-dependent traits. As a way of understanding
condition-dependent traits, consider for example, how the combination of the physical
demands of maintaining a larger body size-a common result of male-male competition,
with the advantage going to larger members of a species (Andersson, 1994)-and
potential interactions between sex hormones and immune functioning may make males
more vulnerable to infestation with parasites, fluctuations in food supply, or other
ecological conditions (Moore &amp; Wilson, 2002; Muehlenbein &amp; Bribiescas, 2005).
Infestation with parasites can lead to an increase in immune system activity, which
can suppress the secretion of testosterone. The decline in testosterone will result
in poorly developed secondary sexual characteristics, placing the male at a
disadvantage in terms of female choice or male-male competition (Folstad &amp;
Karter, 1992). The result is that the least healthy males suffer the most under
difficult ecological conditions and this exaggerates within-sex variation among
males. A similar process may occur in species in which females are larger than males
and compete more and parent less; age-specific mortality is higher in females of
these species (Moore &amp; Wilson, 2002), and lifespan is shorter (Allman, Rosin,
Kumar, &amp; Hasenstaub, 1998). Development From an evolutionary perspective, nature
and nurture are integrally and reciprocally linked and cannot be separated. The
developmental process (e.g., length of infancy) and the responsiveness of the
developing trait to experiences are evolved phenotypes (West-Eberhard, 2003). It is
particularly important to consider the developmental patterns for slowly developing
and highly social species; these species tend to have large brains and may be the
most ''plastic'' in terms of learning and social behavior (e.g., Dunbar &amp; Bever,
1998; Joffe, 1997). Sex differences in life-history patterns (e.g., age of
maturation, life span) are common and, depending on the species, are influenced by a
combination of organizational and activational effects of sex hormones, as well as by
nutritional status and social context (Adkins-Regan, 2005; Stearns &amp; Koella,
1986). In many species, male-male competition and female choice result not only in
larger males but also sex differences in lifehistory development. In these species,
males often physically mature at a later age, reproduce later (if at all), engage in
more risky and aggressive behaviors, and have a shorter life span (Allman et al.,
1998; Leigh, 1996). Social and behavioral differences that may provide practice for
adult reproductive activities also may emerge during development. Rough-andtumble
play among males is common in primates in which there is male-male competition in
adulthood (Fagen, 1981), and females of many primate species often play parent with a
sibling or other young member of the group (Nicholson, 1987). Even in these species,
there is typically overlap in the play behaviors of the two sexes. However they are
manifested, sex differences are often small early in development and become larger as
individuals approach reproductive maturation, a finding that was originally noted by
Darwin (1871). An Evolutionary Understanding of Human Sex Differences Evolutionary
theory applies as well to human sex differences as it does to those of other species.
However, the twin foundations of sexual selection-male competition and female
choice-are nuanced, in humans, by the existence of female competition and male
choice; the two latter components follow from male investment in children. The
combination is predicted to result in more subtle and perhaps smaller sex differences
in humans than for many other species. Sexual Selection Human sex differences in
physical size, upper-body musculature, rate and pattern of physical development, and
other traits are consistent with the view that sexual selection has contributed to
some currently observed sex differences (Tanner, 1990). However, the relative
importance of evolutionary (including sexual-selection) and cultural influences on
cognitive, behavioral, and social sex differences is the subject of vigorous debate
(Geary, 1998; Newcombe, 2002; Wood &amp; Eagly, 2002). It has been proposed by some
evolutionary psychologists and anthropologists that male-male competition has been an
important part of human evolutionary history and has contributed to some currently
observed sex differences. In traditional societies, this competition includes
coordinated group-level conflict for control of ecologically rich territories and for
social and political influence (e.g., Chagnon, 1988), which is often manifested by
low-level but frequent raiding, warfare, and political manipulation (Keeley, 1996).
Within-group competition is seen in the formation of dominance hierarchies and
control of in-group politics. Maintaining groups' territorial borders, tribal
warfare, and large-game hunting-all of which are almost exclusively male activities
(Murdock, 1981)-involve movement across large ranges. Because warring males needed to
move across large-scale space, it is only a short leap for evolutionary psychologists
to hypothesize that this resulted in an evolutionary process that supports brain
development for large-scale navigation in males. Contemporary manifestations can be
seen today when males obtain much higher scores on some visuospatial tasks,
particularly mental rotation and three-dimensional simulations. The male activities
of hunting and warfare involve the construction and use of projectile weapons that
require the ability to track movement in 3-D space. Even though there are many
nuances to the proposal that the contemporary male advantage in spatial abilities is
a result of their roles as hunters and fighters-and the proposal itself has been
questioned by many social scientists whose critiques are presented at the end of this
section (e.g., Wood &amp; Eagly, 2002)-these patterns are nonetheless consistent with
predictions derived from sexual selection, and thus they merit some consideration. In
the following sections, we provide just a few illustrations of how this perspective
might broaden and enrich our understanding of currently found sex differences related
to math and science achievement in the 21st century. Sex Hormones and Cognitive Sex
Differences The male advantage in visuospatial abilities appears to contribute to the
male advantage in some areas of mathematics and engineering, as discussed earlier
(Sorby &amp; Baartmans, 2000). It has been hypothesized that sex differences in
visuospatial cognition have been influenced by male-male competition and other sex
differences during human evolutionary history (Ecuyer-Dab &amp; Robert, 2004; Geary,
1998; Sherry &amp; Hampson, 1997). If the male advantage in visuospatial abilities
and in some other areas of spatial cognition are related to sexual selection, then
the proximate expression of these sex differences is predicted to be related to
prenatal or postnatal exposure to sex hormones, particularly androgens. One method to
test such hypotheses is to study individuals with disorders that were caused by
prenatal exposure to sex hormones that are not typical for their sex (Berenbaum,
1999). With one such disorder, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), individuals are
prenatally exposed to excess androgens. Women born with CAH show masculine play
behaviors, but findings about later-life behaviors and abilities are difficult to
confirm because these children are treated with drugs for this condition as soon
after birth as it is detected and as soon as treatment can be administered. It is
also possible, even likely, that parents and other important adults in their lives
treat them in ways that might exaggerate pressures for feminine behaviors because the
adults know that the CAH girls were exposed to masculinizing hormonal influences in
utero. The evidence is mixed with respect to the visuospatial and related abilities
of these women; some studies show an advantage of women with CAH and others do not,
or the advantage is found on some but not other spatial tasks (Hampson, Rovet,
Altmann, 1998; Hines et al., 2003; Resnick, Berenbaum, Gottesman, &amp; Bouchard,
1986). Thus, the data on the cognitive patterns of girls who were exposed prenatally
to masculinizing hormones do not provide the conclusive evidence we need to link
prenatal sex hormones directly to cognitive abilities. The potential activational
effects of sex hormones can also be studied in humans by assessing any cognitive
changes that might follow hormonal therapy for female-to-male and male-to-female
transsexuals. Female-to-male transsexuals are treated with testosterone, and
male-to-female transsexuals are treated with a combination of androgen-suppressing
drugs and estrogens to prepare them for their new life as either a male or female.
Van Goozen and her colleagues found that performance on a spatial-ability measure
improved after androgen administration for the female-to-male transsexuals, although
they did not administer a measure of visuospatial ability (Van Goozen,
Cohen-Kettenis, Gooren, Frijda, &amp; Van de Poll, 1994, 1995). Performance on a test
of the ability to rotate images in 2-D space-which typically show smaller sex
differences than tests of 3-D spatial cognition (Voyer et al., 1995)-improved
significantly ( d50.56) for a group of individuals after undergoing only 3 months of
androgen treatment as part of their preparation for female-to-male sex-change
surgery. In a followup study, Slabbekoorn and colleagues confirmed this effect, but
only for a measure of 3-D spatial cognition (Slabbekoorn, Van Goozen, Megens, Gooren,
&amp; Cohen-Kettenis, 1999); the change on the 2-D measure was not significant. The
improvement in performance on the 3-D spatial-ability test for these individuals
following only 3 months of androgen treatment was very large (d 51.2). The magnitude
of this effect did not increase with further treatment over the next 7 months, and
the improved spatial abilities of these (new) men did not decline 5 weeks after
stopping the hormonal treatment. Androgen suppression did not result in a decline in
3-D spatial performance for male-to-female transsexuals, suggesting some prenatal
organizational effects on these abilities. The overall results across the different
types of studies are consistent with postnatal activational influences on the
expression of some aspects of spatial abilities. Within-Sex Variation In nonhuman
species, sex differences in patterns of competition and choice are often associated
with increased within-sex variation for the traits related to competition and choice,
and in many species this is accompanied with an increase in disease risk and early
mortality for the sex experiencing the most intense competition. Although much
remains to be learned about these patterns, they do seem to hold for humans. As would
be predicted, human males are more vulnerable to many diseases and suffer higher
mortality at all ages, especially in unstable social &#xA8;&#xA8; contexts
(Moller-Leimkuhler, 2003), and the increased mortality for males is in part due to
the tendency to engage in more risky and aggressive behaviors associated with
male-male aggression and status displays (Minino, Anderson, Fingerhut, Boudreault,
&amp; Warner, 2006; Wilson &amp; Daly, 1985). With respect to the sex differences in
math and science, there are two predictions that highlight the potential utility of
an evolutionary perspective. The first is that there will be greater within-sex
variation in the 3-D spatial abilities of males, and the second is that males growing
up in difficult circumstances will be more strongly affected behaviorally and
cognitively than females growing up in the same circumstances. With respect to the
latter, one corollary prediction is that the 3-D spatial abilities of these males
will be lower than those of males growing up in better environments and that there
will be no sex difference or a reversal of the sex difference for individuals growing
up in the more difficult environments. This is the pattern found for height: The sex
differences are largest in the healthiest populations and smallest for populations
under nutritional stress (Gaulin &amp; Boster, 1992). In other words, poverty and its
correlates prevent children from reaching their full physical potential. The same
appears to be true for cognitive potential. The results from multiple large-scale
studies have confirmed greater variability among males than among females in many
cognitive domains, including on measures of mathematics, science, and spatial
abilities, as noted earlier (Feingold, 1992; Hedges &amp; Nowell, 1995; Strand et
al., 2006; Stumpf &amp; Stanley, 1998). As we described earlier, across two studies
that included about 100,000 high school students in the United States, Hedges and
Nowell found 27% more variation in the spatial-ability scores of males than in those
of females. Feingold's examination of national norms for several ability measures and
across a variety of ages and cohorts found that males were always more variable on
measures of spatial cognition, with a mean effect of about 20% more variance in male
samples. Unfortunately, these studies did not distinguish among the different facets
of spatial ability, and the meta-analyses that have separated these facets do not
report within-sex variances (Voyer et al., 1995). In the just-described study of
female-to-male transsexuals, the postandrogen increase in 3-D spatial ability was
accompanied by a 54% increase in within-group variation on this test (Slabbekoorn et
al., 1999). Levine and colleagues assessed a sample of 547 children from high-,
middle-, and low-income backgrounds across the second and third grades on two spatial
tasks (2-D rotation and an aerial map) and a syntax comprehension test (Levine,
Vasilyeva, Lourenco, Newcombe, &amp; Huttenlocher, 2005). There were no sex
differences on the syntax test, as expected, but males d5 outperformed females on
both spatial tasks ( s .35, .23) but only for children from high- and middle-income
families. There were no sex differences for the low-income children. In other words,
the low income level of the family was associated with lower scores for both males
and females on all three tests, but, in comparison to same-sex peers, the scores of
males seemed to be more strongly affected by poverty, especially for the spatial
tasks. The results are consistent with evolutionary predictions regarding the
influence of environmental circumstance on within-sex variation in traits that are
potentially related to sexual selection. Further studies are needed to confirm this
pattern and to more explicitly test the prediction that males growing up in difficult
circumstances will be more strongly affected for traits predicted to be related to
sexual selection (e.g., 3-D spatial cognition, which is needed to travel long
distances for warfare and for hunting-both primarily male activities) than for other
traits (e.g., grammatical structure of utterances). Development When they are found,
sex differences in developmental activities are predicted to mirror sex differences
in patterns of competition and choice that have evolved by means of sexual selection,
and the proximate expression is predicted to be influenced by prenatal and postnatal
exposure to sex hormones, as well as by social context (Geary, 1998; Pellegrini,
2004). Testing these predictions is complicated by the influence of early and current
experiences on within-sex variation, and thus there is the potential for the
magnitude of any sex differences to vary with context. Moreover, it is not always
clear when in development an evolved sex difference might be expressed. As mentioned
earlier, in many species, sex differences are small or nonexistent early in life and
increase in magnitude as individuals approach reproductive maturation. But the
developmental sex differences in behavior or cognition can emerge early if they
provide practice for adult activities. With humans, early sex differences have been
found in many domains, ranging from play and toy preferences (Golombok &amp; Rust,
1993) to peer relationships (Rose &amp; Rudolph, 2006), but the relation of these
behaviors to sexual selection remains to be explored. In keeping with the focus on
spatial abilities, and as described earlier, a male advantage on some spatial tasks
emerges in childhood (e.g., Johnson &amp; Meade, 1987) and perhaps during the
preschool years (Levine et al., 1999). Levine et al. found an 1 advantage of 4 - to
7-year-old males on a test that involved the 2 rotation or transformation of 2-D
shapes; unlike results for adults, the females were slightly more variable as a
group. Voyer et al.'s (1995) meta-analysis revealed a male advantage in d5 childhood
for a measure of 3-D spatial cognition ( .33) that was about the same magnitude as
that found by Levine et al. By adulthood, the magnitude of the male advantage doubled
d ( 5.66). Voyer et al.'s (1995) analysis is informative, but it is based largely on
cross-sectional data. Longitudinal studies of this emerging sex difference and
potential contributing mechanisms are needed. If these sex differences are a
reflection of human evolutionary history, then the mechanisms should include a
combination of prenatal and postnatal exposure to sex hormones and a sex difference
in spatial-related activity preferences. At the same time, it must be emphasized that
any such influences do not preclude cultural and socialization effects; and in fact,
cultural and social effects are expected to have greater effects on a slow-developing
and highly social species such as humans than they would on faster-developing
species. In any case, data about the relation between prenatal exposure to androgens
and sex differences in spatial abilities are mixed and difficult to interpret,
especially in light of the complexity of assessing spatial abilities in very young
children and in determining levels of prenatal hormone exposure (Cohen-Bendahan, van
de Beek, Berenbaum, 2005; Hines et al., 2003). Moreover, there is a postnatal surge
in androgens in males, but we do not know if or how it is related to the development
of spatial cognition. It is also possible that the relation between prenatal hormone
exposure and spatial cognition is indirect and mediated by hormone-influenced sex
differences in activity preferences, which in turn would result in a gradually
emerging sex difference in spatial abilities. Following the preschool years in both
industrial and traditional societies, males' play ranges (size of area in which they
are permitted to roam during play) are 1.5 to 3.0 times the size of females' play
ranges; in general, parents are more restrictive of the play ranges of females. But
sex differences emerge in the absence of these restrictions (Matthews, 1992; Whiting
&amp; Edwards, 1988). Although the relation between these activities and the widening
male advantage on spatial measures remains to be convincingly demonstrated, it is an
intriguing possibility that merits further study. Critiques of Evolutionary
Explanations of Sex Differences in Science and Math Although the explanations offered
by psychologists with an evolutionary perspective are congruent with many research
findings, numerous thoughtful critiques that provide alternative explanations have
been offered. For example, Newcombe (2007) and others (Halpern, 2000) have countered
the underlying argument that males in their role as hunters in early societies needed
navigational skills to traverse large distances with the fact that women also needed
to travel large distances in their role as gatherers. Although vegetation remains
stationary, women needed to travel long distances to gather edible plants that
ripened in different seasons of the year, escape from predators, and move their
living sites with the seasons. Many of the tasks that females in traditional
societies engaged in also required spatial skills, such as weaving (baskets were
essential for gathering food) and making pots and other vessels for the household.
These critiques are important to consider, as is the proposal that the male advantage
in spatial abilities may be more strongly related to tribal warfare than to hunting,
and that activities such as weaving emerged more recently than tool construction
(e.g., weapons), which is almost exclusively a male activity (Murdock, 1981).
Newcombe also raises the fact that the relationship between testosterone levels and
spatial ability is not linear. Males with lower levels of testosterone and women with
higher levels of testosterone have the best visuospatial abilities, a finding that
some have argued is inconsistent with evolutionary theory (Moffat &amp; Hampson,
1996). A response to this concern is that it does not necessarily follow that male
behaviors and cognitions associated with sexual selection will be linearly related to
testosterone or any other hormone. There are potential costs to prolonged exposure to
high levels of testosterone (e.g., premature death). In addition, circulating hormone
levels do not provide information about the effects of prenatal hormone exposure.
Several investigators have found that spatial abilities vary over the menstrual
cycle, with high scores on mental-rotation tests during the menstrual phase and low
scores during the midluteal phase ( d5.85; Halpern, &amp; Tan, 2001; Hausmann, &#xA8;
&#xA8; &#xA8; Slabbekoorn, Van Goozen, Cohen-Kettenis, &amp; Gunturkun, 2000).
Evolutionary theories also would have difficulty explaining monthly variations in
spatial abilities for women (but see Sherry &amp; Hampson, 1997). Different
approaches to explaining data that pertain to cognitive sex differences in humans
have led to heated debates among proponents of different positions. We leave it to
readers to weigh the reasoning and evidence on all sides of these debates. The
authors of this report differ in the extent to which they attribute contemporary
cognitive sex differences to evolutionary history, with evolutionary psychologists
maintaining that the male brain is naturally better prepared to perform some spatial
tasks and others who feel that the weight of the evidence is clearly on the
environmental side. Some psychologists have taken a more middle-of-the-road position
by accepting the importance of evolution in shaping reproductive-related behaviors
but emphasizing the principle that human behavior adapts to the context in which it
develops. So while modern humans owe an evolutionary debt to our hunterand-gatherer
ancestors, the requirements of modern living may play a greater role in understanding
how females and males develop their cognitive abilities. In thinking about the
evolutionary heritage, it is important to keep in mind the fact that our ancestors
did not engage in the prolonged study of advanced topics in science and math (Geary,
2007). Other perspectives stress the importance of sex differences in life
experiences.<component x="62.99" y="65.44" width="246.1" height="385.81" page="20"

ultimately expressed in tissue structure and function, and efforts to understand the
biological substrates of sex differences in cognition require an examination of brain
anatomy and physiology. Because our focus is on math and science abilities, our most
direct data necessarily involve humans; however, ethical and technical considerations
prevent rigorous experimental work of the kind possible in nonhuman species.
Furthermore, when examining the neurobiology of behavior within a species, it is
important to consider the additional complexity of age effects. Beginning in the
early 1980s, several safe methods for obtaining reliable measures of brain structure
and function became available, and there have since been several large-scale efforts
to examine sex differences in brain anatomy and physiology. The basic aim in these
studies is to understand how the brain's activity relates to its structures and
functions. A thorough review of this literature is beyond our scope. Instead, we
briefly describe the main findings from neuroimaging in which sex differences in the
brain and behavior have been established. Notably, because of their expense, most
studies using neuroimaging have been conducted for purposes other than examining sex
differences in the healthy brain. Nonetheless, several largescale prospective samples
have produced consistent findings. These findings support some hypotheses relating to
the neural substrates for sex differences in science and mathematical abilities and
suggest future directions for research. Sex Differences in Brain Structure When it
became possible for researchers to peer into healthy living brains while individuals
were engaged in cognitive tasks, one of the first questions they asked was whether
there are reliable differences between women and men in areas of the brain that are
involved in the cognitive tasks in which sex differences are usually found. This
question led investigators to focus specifically on the overall size of the brain;
the frontal and temporal regions that regulate language and memory; and the corpus
callosum, a key structure for integrating brain activity across the cerebral
hemispheres. Sex Differences in Cerebral Volume The first studies to reveal new sex
differences in the human brain used a noninvasive procedure to measure the proportion
of tissue with fast blood flow-presumably, gray matter. Gray matter refers to areas
of the brain where cell bodies and their immediate dendrites are closely packed.
These studies showed substantial sex differences in the proportion of gray matter, as
well as higher rates of blood flow, which suggests a greater proportion of gray
matter, in women (R.C. Gur et al., 1982; R.E. Gur &amp; Gur, 1990). The current
method for studying brain anatomy in humans is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Structural MRI studies can be used to segment tissue into gray matter, both cortical
and deep; white matter (areas of long axons covered with a fatty-hence
''white''-myelin sheath that aids in the rapid conductance of nerve impulses); and
cerebrospinal fluid (that both nourishes and cushions the brain), as illustrated in
Figure 6, which shows these basic brain structures. Replicating the earlier findings,
neuroimaging studies found a higher percentage of gray matter in females, but with
MRI it was possible to establish also that males had higher volumes of white matter
and cerebrospinal fluid (Blatter et al., 1995; Coffey et al., 1998; Filipek,
Richelme, Kennedy, &amp; Caviness, 1994; R.C. Gur et al., 1999; Passe et al., 1997;
Pfefferbaum et al., 1994). Thus, on average, White females (who were used for these
studies) have a smaller cranial volume (head size) than White males do. The higher
proportion of gray matter in females and greater amount of white matter and
cerebrospinal fluid in males results in similar absolute volumes of gray matter in
men and women. It is noteworthy that life-span developmental sex differences have
been found in the brain, with consistent reports that, with normal aging, brain
volume, especially gray matter, declines faster in men than in women in middle to
late adulthood (Coffey et al., 1998; Good et al., 2001; R.C. Gur et al., 1991). Sex
differences in hemispheric asymmetries also have been documented, with greater
asymmetries in the percentage of gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid in males
compared to females (Coffey et al., 1998; R.C. Gur et al., 1999). As shown in Figure
7, for males, the percentage of gray matter was higher in the left hemisphere, the
percentage of white matter was symmetric, and the percentage of cerebrospinal fluid
was higher on the right. No asymmetries were significant in females, and the
differences in laterality between males and females were significant. These
hemispheric differences were, however, quite small in absolute terms, and did not
overshadow the main sex differences in cerebral volume. Thus, although males had a
higher percentage of gray matter in the left relative to the right hemisphere and
females had more symmetric gray matter, females still had a higher percentage of gray
matter than males in both hemispheres. Anatomic differences between the brains of
males and those of females can provide information about the neural substrates for
sex differences in cognition only if the differences in brain anatomies correlate
with performance on cognitive tasks. R.C. Gur et al. (1999) first examined whether a
sample of males and females showed the reported sex difference of better verbal
relative to spatial performance in females compared to males. As expected, the males
and females did not differ in the Global (mean of Verbal and Spatial) performance
score, but the Verbal Superiority index (Verbal minus Spatial) was positive in
females and negative in males. Furthermore, performance correlated with intracranial
volumes, for the whole sample as well as for males and females considered separately.
While these correlations were moderate, scatter-plots suggested that relationships
were quite uniform across the range of brain volumes and performance values for both
gray and white matter, whereas the correlations with cerebrospinal-fluid volumes were
nil (within this age range of adults less than 50 years of age). Consistent with
these findings, Haier and colleagues (Colom, Jung, &amp; Haier 2006; Haier, Jung,
Yeo, Head, &amp; Alkire, 2005) reported that gg5 higher -loadings ( general
intelligence) of individual tests were associated with increased gray-matter volume
throughout the brain. It should be noted that despite the significant sex difference
in spatial performance, most women in R.C. Gur et al.'s (1999) study performed
comparably to the men on the spatial tests. As suggested in several sections of this
monograph, it is possible that (some) females may achieve high levels of spatial
performance using different strategies than males and possibly by using different
regions of the brain. Haier et al. (2005) also found that males and females may solve
some complex problems, such as items on IQ tests, differently, with females showing a
greater use of language-related brain regions and males showing greater use of
spatial-related brain regions. Specifically, the researchers used an advanced method
(voxel-based morphometry) for comparing the gray matter in two groups of
participants; they reported that, on average, compared to men, ''women show more
white matter and fewer gray matter areas related to intelligence. In men IQ/gray
matter correlations are strongest in frontal and parietal lobes (regions BA [Brodmann
area] 8, 9, 39, 40), whereas, the strongest correlations in women are in the frontal
lobe (region BA10) along with Broca's area'' (p. 320). Broca's area of the brain has
long been known to underlie language production. Thus, based on these analyses of the
brain, the evidence suggests that, on average, women's performance on measures of
intelligence may be more related to language centers than is men's performance on
these same measures. Sex Differences in Corpus Callosum Structure In contrast to
overall lower white-matter volume in females, there is some controversial evidence
that the largest whitematter structure in the brain, the corpus callosum, is more
bulbous in females. The corpus callosum is the primary means of communication between
the two cerebral hemispheres, prompting investigators to hypothesize that differences
in callosal size exist between males and females and that female brains may be more
bilaterally organized for language. Because the corpus callosum has an irregular
shape, there have been many controversies over how best to measure its size or
volume. Most investigators have examined the shape and size of the mid-sagittal
section of the callosum as a surrogate for the structure's overall shape. To date,
however, no consensus has been reached on the presence of sex-based differences in
the callosum. De Lacoste-Utamsing and Holloway (1982) reported that the female
splenium (a portion of the corpus callosum) was more bulbous than the tubual male
splenium. Follow-up studies by De Lacoste-Utamsing, Holloway, and Woodward (1986;
Yoshi et al., 1986; Allen, Richey, Chai, &amp; Gorski, 1991) all found increased size
in the female splenium. In contrast, Going and Dixson (1990) and Witelson (1985)
reported no such differences between the callosa of males and females. A possible
reason for this continuing controversy is a general lack of standards for callosal
analysis. While cross-sectional area and callosal length are the more traditional
indices reported in sex-difference investigations, there is little agreement over how
to normalize these indices. Furthermore, gross dimensional measures will miss
regional shape variations in callosa. Some investigators have divided the callosum
into partitions and compared the areas of corresponding partitions between study
groups (Witelson, 1985). This approach does not solve the problem of normalization,
and the exact partitions used are arbitrary. Furthermore, partitioning schemes may
still miss regional morphologic differences. Template deformation morphometry (TDM)
avoids many of the pitfalls associated with more traditional methods for measuring
the callosum. By comparing each subject to a template callosum, TDM avoids the issue
of normalizing callosal measurements to some arbitrary index of overall brain size.
Davatzikos and Resnick (1998) used TDM and demonstrated that the splenium was larger
in females than it was in males. Dubb, Gur, Avants, and Gee's (2003) TDM analysis
likewise demonstrated sexual dimorphism in the splenium of the corpus callosum, with
larger volumes in females. They also found relatively larger genu (the anterior part
of the callosum) in males. The reason for the intense debate over the corpus callosum
is that a larger callosum in women supports the idea of greater connectivity between
the two hemispheres, and a host of predictions, such as faster access to nonverbal
information, might result from such a difference. It may also explain females' better
retention of language skills following unilateral brain damage, because language
functions would be more likely to occur in both hemispheres. The Need for
Developmental and Longitudinal Studies Studies of young infants and children
(Matsuzawa et al., 2001), and especially longitudinal studies (Giedd et al., 1999),
may help explain the causal direction and the development of sex differences in the
relation between brain neuroanatomy and cognitive performance. Giedd et al.
demonstrated sex differences in the pattern of gray- and white-matter development.
The curves that represented gray- and white-matter development were similar for girls
and boys but tended to peak at different ages. The peaks tended to be earlier (e.g.,
in terms of peak gray-matter volume for the frontal cortex) for females than they
were for males, except for the temporal cortex, where females peaked at a slightly
older age. A notable pattern was that occipital gray matter had not yet peaked for
males by age 22 but peaked around age 13 for females. White matter increased for both
sexes from 4 to 22 years, but at a higher rate for males than for females. The
increased brain-development period for males, especially with respect to white matter
and occipital gray matter, is intriguing given that these correlate with spatial
performance in adults. The extended developmental period also makes male brain
development more vulnerable to environmental conditions: Good health and nutrition
are needed by males for a longer period of time to achieve their full potential,
because brain development takes place over a longer period of time for males than it
does for females. More recent studies have noted that correlations between regional
brain structure and measures of cognitive performance evolve with development, and
the sex differences seen in adult samples could be absent in childhood (Shaw et al.,
2006). To summarize the anatomic studies: Some sex differences are evident across the
age range. In general, females have a higher percentage of tissue devoted to neuronal
cell bodies and their immediate dendritic connections (gray matter), while males have
a higher volume of connecting white-matter tissue. An exception is the splenium of
the corpus callosum, a white-matter region that may be more bulbous in females than
males. Furthermore, male brains seem to show greater volumetric asymmetries than
female brains do. The higher white-matter volume may be associated with better
spatial performance in males. A hypothesis suggested by these neuroanatomic data is
that male brains are optimized for enhanced connectivity within hemispheres, as
afforded by overall higher white-matter volumes, while female brains are optimized
for communication between the hemispheres-especially in language-processing and
posterior brain regions, as indicated by the larger callosal splenia (R.E. Gur &amp;
Gur, 2004). In the near future, this hypothesis will be able to be tested directly
using a more advanced MRI method for imaging white-matter integrity, called diffusion
tensor imaging (e.g., Huang et al., 2005; Nucifora, Verma, Melhem, 2005; Salat et
al., 2005). Sex Differences in Brain Function An alternative approach to
investigating sex differences in the anatomy of brain structures is to examine
possible differences in how male and female brains respond to different cognitive
tasks. This approach focuses on functions rather than on structural differences. Sex
Differences in Cerebral Blood Flow Sex differences have not been examined as
extensively with functional as with structural imaging. Using early noninvasive
methods, R.C. Gur et al. (1982) reported that females had higher rates of resting
cerebral blood flow than males did, across all ages (R.C. Gur, Gur, Obrist, Skolnick,
&amp; Reivich, 1987). The basic idea in measuring the rate of blood flow is that
blood is expected to flow fastest in areas of the brain where neurons are most
active. These findings were replicated with positron emission tomography (PET)
studies (Esposito, VanHorn, Weinberger, &amp; Berman, 1996; Kastrup, Li, Glover,
Kruger, &amp; Moseley, 1999; Ragland, Coleman, Gur, Glahn, &amp; Gur, 2000). The
areas of the brain that are active during the performance of cognitive tasks are
sometimes similar across different types of tasks, and sometimes they are
task-related (for discussions see Kastrup et al., 1999). Greater bilateral activation
for language tasks was reported in females. One hypothesis about sex differences in
brain structure and function is that female brains are more bilaterally organized for
language, which means that they rely on brain structures in both hemispheres for
language tasks (e.g., speaking, comprehending), while males are more reliant on brain
structures in one hemisphere (usually the left hemisphere) for the same language
tasks (Shaywitz et al., 1995). For spatial tasks, the better performance of males on
difficult items was associated with more focal activation of right visual-association
areas, again supporting the hypothesis of more lateralization of cognitive abilities
(reliance on one hemisphere) for males (R.C. Gur et al., 2000). In contrast, females
recruited additional regions bilaterally for the more difficult spatial task. This
finding was replicated and extended to mental rotation and numeric calculation by
Kucian, Loenneker, Dietrich, Martin, and von Aster (2005), who also reported more
distributed and bilateral recruitment of brain regions in females than in males as
the complexity of the task increased. &#xA8; Similarly, Gron, Wunderlich, Spitzer,
Tomczak, and Riepe (2000) suggested that males and females used different brain
regions when performing tasks in a 3-D virtual maze. Females demonstrated more
parietal and prefrontal activation (the latter suggesting it was an effortful task),
whereas the males relied more on the hippocampus, suggesting a more automatic
retrieval of geometric-navigation cues. The importance of incorporating a
neurodevelopmental perspective is underscored by several recent studies.
Investigators report substantial developmental changes in the distribution, extent,
and laterality of task-related activation, as well as sex-by-age interactions in
areas of brain activation. It appears that, as with the neuroanatomic measures, adult
patterns of sex differences in brain function are absent or more subtle in children
(Plante, Schmithorst, Holland, &amp; Byars, 2006; Schmithorst &amp; Holland, 2006;
Szaflarski et al., 2006). Here too, longitudinal studies would help us understand the
factors that affect the development of sex differences. Sex Differences in Cerebral
Glucose Metabolism Areas of the brain that are high in metabolic activity ''take up''
(metabolize) more glucose. So one way of studying areas of the brain that underlie
different cognitive domains is to track which regions are metabolizing more glucose
and determine whether these regions differ between women and men. Resting cerebral
metabolic rates for glucose are equal in males and females (Andreason, Zametkin, Guo,
Baldwin, &amp; Cohen, 1994; R.C. Gur et al., 1995; Murphy et al., 1996). Sex
differences are evident in the regional distribution of metabolic activity, with
males showing higher metabolic glucose rates in all motor basal ganglia regions and
the cerebellum, as well as all subcallosal limbic regions, and females showing higher
metabolic glucose rates in the cingulate gyrus, a limbic region closer to language
areas. Females showed more symmetric glucose utilization than males did, which
provides additional evidence to the MRI data for the hypothesis that females are more
bilateralized in the brain structures that underlie cognition than males are (R.C.
Gur et al., 1995; Murphy et al., 1996). Sex Differences in Neurotransmitter Function
Another set of physiological parameters that can be measured with functional
neuroimaging is neurotransmitter function. Depending on the specific
neurotransmitter, the abundance or scarcity of receptors available to respond to any
particular neurotransmitter will facilitate or inhibit different brain functions. Few
studies have included sufficiently large samples to examine sex differences in
neurotransmitter function. Of these, Adams et al. (2004) reported no sex differences
in serotonin binding. However, sex differences were found in dopamine function.
Recent investigations of the relationship between cognition and dopamine transporter
availability in males and females found that females and younger participants had
higher dopamine availability in the caudate nucleus and that these groups also
performed better on verbal learning tasks (Mozley, Gur, Mozley, &amp; Gur, 2001).
Furthermore, dopamine transporter availability was correlated with learning
performance within groups. Relationships between dopamine availability and executive
and motor functioning were observed in females but not in males. These results
provide further evidence for age effects and sex differences in the influences of
dopamine on human behavior. Brain Imaging, Mathematics, and Science To date, there
are only a few brain imaging studies of sciencerelated abilities (e.g., Fugelsang
&amp; Dunbar, 2005), and research on the brain systems involved in even a basic
understanding of mathematics is still in the early stages. Most of the latter
research has focused on representations of number and quantity or the process of
solving simple arithmetic problems (Chochon, Cohen, van de Moortele, &amp; Dehaene,
1999; Dehaene, Spelke, Pinel, Stanescu, &amp; Tsivkin, 1999; Gruber, Indefrey,
Steinmetz, &amp; Kleinschmidt, 2001; Halgren, Boujon, Clarke, Wang, &amp; Chauvel,
2002; Pinel, Piazza, Le Bihan, &amp; Dehaene, 2004; Rickard et al., 2000; Rivera,
Reiss, Eckert, &amp; Menon, 2005; Temple &amp; Posner, 1998; Zorzi, Priftis, &amp;
Umilta, 2002). Except for a tendency of females to use more language-based counting
strategies to solve arithmetic problems and for males to have a small advantage on
estimation tasks, sex differences are not typically found for these basic numerical
domains (M. Carr &amp; Jessup, 1997; Jordan, Hanich, &amp; Kaplan, 2003). Thus, the
current studies are not sufficient for making judgments about sex differences in
brain activity during the processing of mathematical information. It has been
consistently found that magnitude comparison (Dehaene et al., 1999; Temple &amp;
Posner, 1998), mental number line (Zorzi et al., 2002), and many arithmetic tasks
(Chochon et al., 1999; Rivera et al., 2005) bilaterally engage a structure in the
inferior parietal lobe, the intraparietal sulcus, although other regions are also
engaged (e.g., frontal regions associated with working memory; Rivera et al., 2005).
The intraparietal sulcus is also active in nonhuman animals when they engage in
numerical activities (Sawamura, Shima, &amp; Tanji, 2002; R.F. Thompson, Mayers,
Robertson, &amp; Patterson, 1970), and it is anatomically very near to the
visual-spatial and posterior spatial-attentional systems that are engaged when
navigating and when mentally simulating how objects can be used as tools (Hodges,
Spatt, &amp; Patterson, 1999; Vanduffel et al., 2002). In fact, Pinel et al. (2004)
found that the brain regions that represent numerical magnitude also represent
spatial magnitude, and Zorzi et al. (2002) found that individuals with injury to the
right parietal cortex showed deficits in spatial orientation and number-line
estimation. Dehaene et al. (1999) showed adults' computational estimation also may be
dependent on a similar parietal-spatial system that supports generation of a mental
number line. On the basis of a structural MRI study, Goldstein et al. (2001) found
the inferior parietal lobe was 25% larger in males than in females in absolute terms,
and 20% larger when an adjustment was made for the sex difference in overall brain
volume; this region also has a high density of sex-hormone receptors during prenatal
development, at least in some species. Whether these areas are part of a system of
biologically primary quantitative abilities or evolved for other functions is
currently debated (e.g., Dehaene, 2003; Geary, in press; Pinel et al., 2004). Either
way, children's intuitive understanding of quantity, magnitude, and simple addition
and subtraction appear to provide the core for their learning of mathematics in
school (Geary, 1995; Gelman, 1990; Spelke, 2000), and the supporting brain systems
may bias how children represent and understand biologically secondary (school-taught)
forms of mathematics. Geary, for instance, argued that the brain and cognitive
systems that evolved to support navigation have implicit geometric knowledge built
into their organization, because the function of these systems is to respond to and
manipulate geometric features of physical space (Dehaene, Izard, Pica, &amp; Spelke,
2006; Shepard, 1994). In an fMRI study of humans and monkeys, Vanduffel et al. (2002)
found that the intraparietal sulcus was engaged when humans, but not monkeys,
understood that geometric forms were three-dimensional based on movement cues. They
concluded that ''under evolutionary pressure, parietal but not earlier regions
adapted to implement human-specific abilities such as excellent motiondependent 3D
vision for manipulating fine tools'' (p. 415). The studies conducted to date are not
conclusive, but they provide converging evidence that the same brain regions that
support early and possibly biologically primary quantitative abilities-or, at the
very least, regions anatomically adjacent to them-are also involved in aspects of
spatial cognition, complex object representation, and tool use. If these regions
provide a core for early learning of biologically secondary mathematical knowledge,
such as place value (i.e., three digits signifies hundreds, two digits signifies
tens, and so on), then children might be biased such that this knowledge would be
more readily learned when represented spatially (e.g., a mental number line). To the
extent that these areas are larger in males than in females, a male advantage is
predicted in (a) the tendency to rely on spatial representations for solving
mathematical problems, (b) intuitive knowledge of certain features of geometry, and
(c) ease of learning mathematics when it is presented in a spatial format.
Alternatively, given the advantage of females in language domains, a female bias in
the tendency to represent mathematical problems in a verbal format is predicted and,
as discussed earlier, is found for solving the types of problems on standardized
mathematicalabilities tests such as the GRE (Gallagher et al., 2002). Moreover, a
male advantage in engineering and science tasks that involve object manipulation or
generating complex 3-D images is predicted, as is a male advantage for integrating
mathematical knowledge into spatially based science and engineering tasks, to the
extent the intraparietal and adjacent regions are engaged with these tasks.
Speculative Hypotheses on the Relation of Neural Structures to Science and
Mathematics The state of knowledge on the neurobiology of sex differences does not
permit strong statements, predictions, or recommendations. Especially lacking are
large-scale studies in which science and mathematics abilities are rigorously
measured and related to brain anatomy and physiology. Nonetheless, several tentative
hypotheses can be proposed. Anatomically, male brains appear to be optimized for
connectivity within the hemispheres, while female brains appear to have better
interhemispheric connectivity. For females, better interhemispheric communication
confers an advantage in language and the ability to better integrate
verbal-analytical (left-hemispheric) with spatial-holistic (right-hemispheric) modes
of information processing. Biologically, females have higher cerebral blood flow, and
the metabolic glucose rates show differences for women and men that vary with brain
region. Activation studies support the notion that females perform better on tasks
such as language processing that require bilateral activation, while males excel in
tasks requiring focal activation of the visual association cortex. Studies by
O'Boyle, Gill, Benbow, and Alexander (1994) found that the right hemisphere may play
a role in linguistic processing for mathematically precocious youth, a population
that, as we discussed earlier, displays sex differences in mathematical and
visuospatial abilities. Single-Sex Schools None of the data regarding brain structure
or function suggest that girls and boys learn differently or that either sex would
benefit from single-sex schools, yet that is exactly the claim that is driving a
rapid increase in such schools. According to Sax (cited in MSNBC, 2006), who is the
director of the National Association for Single-Sex Schools, at least 223 public
schools across the country already offer some single-sex classrooms- up from 4 in
1998. Those who support single-sex schools have argued that new information about
brain differences for girls and boys should change how we think about single-sex
education and that each sex should be taught in a way that is compatible with its
brain. Others who favor single-sex education provide social reasons for their
support. Their argument is based on the idea that girls and boys spend too much time
impressing each other when they are in the same classes and that, by separating them,
each sex will be more focused on school work. As already noted, girls get better
grades in school in every subject and are now attending college at substantially
higher rates than boys are. These data, which represent increased academic and career
success over the decades when the number of single-sex schools declined, do not
support the reasoning behind such schooling. The relative success of girls in
academic settings has been labeled a ''boy crisis'' in the popular media (e.g., Tyre,
2006). Thus, one reason for proposing single-sex schools is to stem the loss of boys
from higher education. But boys score higher than girls on standardized tests in math
and science from the end of secondary school through graduate school, so it is not
true that boys are failing to learn in coeducational schools-each sex is showing
superior performance on different types of measures of learning. The question of
whether grades in school or scores on standardized tests are better or more valid
measures is a matter of considerable dispute. Some critics have argued that the
grade-test disparity shows that schools are biased against boys; while others have
argued that standardized tests are biased against girls. The data show different
patterns of achievement on different types of assessments, so it could also be argued
that, given an appropriate assessment, both sexes show evidence of learning in math
and science. Several different meta-analyses have examined the data in support of the
claim that single-sex education is advantageous for either girls or boys. In a
conceptual overview of single-sex education, Salomone (2006) asks: ''Is there any
evidence that separating students on the basis of sex might make a positive
difference in academic performance and achievement or social adjustment, at least for
some students?'' (p. 791). She considers a range of possible advantages, including
those that are motivational, social, and educational. Salomone concludes that ''the
evidence is undeniably inadequate'' (p. 791). The Campbell Collaboration (2001) is a
nonprofit organization that aims to help people make well-informed decisions about
the effects of interventions in the social, behavioral, and educational arenas. They
commission reviews that ''synthesize evidence on social and behavioural interventions
and public policy, including education, criminal justice, and social welfare, among
other areas. The primary concern is with evidence on overall intervention or policy
effectiveness and how effectiveness is influenced by variations in process and
implementation, intervention components and recipients, as well as other factors''
(The Campbell Collaboration, 2001). In two separate reviews of single-sex education,
the conclusions were the same. In the words of one of the reviews: ''The paradox of
single-sex and co-education is that the beliefs are so strong and the evidence is so
weak'' (Smithers &amp; Robinson, 2006, p 31).<component x="321.05" y="162.61"

applying the findings about brain structures and function to cognitive sex
differences, it is important to keep in mind the fact that the environment also
shapes the brain. Consider these two examples: A study of London cab drivers found
that they had enlarged portions of their right posterior hippocampus relative to a
control group of adults whose employment required less use of spatial skills. The cab
drivers showed a positive correlation between the size of the region of the
hippocampus that is activated during recall of complex routes and the number of years
they worked in this occupation (Maguire, Frackowiak, &amp; Frith, 1997; Maguire et
al., 2000). The finding that the size of the hippocampus varied as a function of
years spent driving taxis makes it likely that it was a lifetime of complex
way-finding that caused the brain structure used in certain visuospatial tasks to
increase in size, although other explanations also are possible. In a second recent
study, a 3-month period of juggling practice led to an increase in greymatter density
in the putative motion-processing region of the temporal cortex (MT/V5; Draganski et
al., 2004), showing a direct relationship between behavior and brain morphology (the
brain area also changed back when the juggling practice stopped). These findings are
consistent with many studies of nonhuman species and demonstrate that experience can
alter the biological underpinnings of behavior and cognition-including the size of
brain structures-making the nature-nurture distinction difficult to resolve. These
data are important because they suggest that sex differences in structures or
functions of the<component x="321.05" y="65.44" width="246.07" height="335.58"

cultural influences on sex differences in math and science performance is plentiful
and varied. First, we consider five categories of evidence: (a) research on family,
neighborhood, peer, and school influences; (b) research on stereotype threat; (c)
training studies; (d) cross-cultural analyses; and (e) trends over time. Then, we
shift to the question of occupational choice and examine sociocultural influences on
that process. Finally, we review the evidence on the impact of sex discrimination and
women's roles. Family, Neighborhood, Peer, and School Influences There are multiple
influences of parents, peers, and the schools on children's development (e.g.,
Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 1998; Vandell, 2000). Here we focus on these influences
specifically in the domains of abilities, academic performance, and self-efficacy
beliefs. A limitation to some of these studies is that they simply report a
correlation, for example, between parents' estimates of their children's mathematics
ability and the children's scores on a standardized test. From this correlation, we
cannot infer the direction of causality. We cannot tell whether the parents' beliefs
in their children influence the children's performance or whether the opposite
process occurs-that children's test scores influence their parents' estimates of
their abilities. Moreover, it may be that both processes occur in reciprocal fashion.
Some researchers have used more advanced designs, such as longitudinal research or
controlling for ability at the time of the first measurement, to try to sort out
these issues; most recently, reciprocal-effects modeling has been applied &#xA8;
&#xA8; (Marsh, Trautwein, Ludtke, Koller, &amp; Baumert, 2005). We note the studies
that use these more advanced methods. Similarly, when researchers find evidence of
correlations between afterschool activities (e.g., participation in a computer club)
and math performance, it is difficult to know whether participation improves math
performance or whether youth with stronger math skills choose to participate in such
activities. The latter follows from the expectation that, to some extent, children
will create their own environments and seek niches consistent with their interests
and abilities (Scarr, 1996; Scarr &amp; McCartney, 1983). Numerous studies have
confirmed the finding that parents' expectations for their children's academic
abilities and success are correlated with the children's self-concept of their own
ability and their subsequent performance (e.g., Bleeker &amp; Jacobs, 2004; Parsons,
Adler, &amp; Kaczala, 1982). Parents' level of education correlates with their
children's mathematics achievement, even when children's math ability and attitudes
are controlled, an effect that holds across cultures (Schiller, Khmelkov, &amp; Wang,
2002). Higher levels of parental involvement with their children's education is
correlated with higher levels of children's performance in mathematics (Muller,
1998), although Raymond and Benbow (1986) found that parents were equally supportive
of their mathematically talented sons and daughters. Parental involvement also
covaries with successful placement of students in higher-ability mathematics groups
(Useem, 1992). More specific studies are needed to determine whether parents show
sex-differentiated treatment of their children in important matters such as
intervening to have them placed in high-math-ability classes. Lytton and Romney
(1991) conducted a meta-analysis of studies of parents' differential socialization of
boys versus girls in western cultures. Although overall they found evidence of
similarity in treatment of boys and girls (e.g., warmth d5(.07, discipline d5.07),
the studies may not be relevant to the questions addressed in this report. Parents
treated males and females similarly in encouraging achievement ( d5.02), but this
measure did not differentiate areas, such as language arts or mathematics, in which
achievement was encouraged. The notable exception to this pattern of similar
treatment was encouragement of sex-typed activities and sex-typed perceptions of the
child, which was sex-differentiated ( d50.34 for mothers, d50.49 for fathers). That
is, parents, especially fathers, encouraged sex-typed behavior-particularly, fathers
discouraged their sons from playing with dolls. The question, then, is the extent to
which these sex-typed experiences may contribute to sex differences in math and
science abilities. Sociologists and psychologists have also studied neighborhood
effects-that is, effects outside the home that have an impact on children (e.g.,
Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2004). One well-sampled study of children in
kindergarten and first grade found that boys' gains in math reasoning were more
sensitive to neighborhood resources than were those of girls (Entwistle, Alexander,
&amp; Olson, 1994), which is consistent with the earlier suggestion that male
development is more sensitive to environmental conditions. The effect was to create
more variability among males in their math performance. By middle school, when
children were tracked for math classes, males in the high track were outscoring
females in the high track, even though sex differences were not significant in the
full sample. The researchers traced this greater variability for males to their early
sensitivity to neighborhood effects. In the Entwistle et al. study, there were
reports that boys in the summer after first grade were more likely than girls to be
monitored less closely by their parents, go to recreation centers, and play organized
sports, whereas girls were more likely to play in the house and thus had less freedom
to move about the neighborhood. Similar patterns continued in middle school. These
differential experiences may give boys more spatial experience and, in complex games,
more spatial and mathematical experience. Consistent with this idea, Matthews (1986,
1987) found that, by age 11, boys show greater spatial knowledge than girls do-as
demonstrated, for example, by making a map of a familiar area-and attributed this
difference to girls' lesser experience of roaming over their environment, which in
turn may be related to parents' greater restrictions placed on girls as well as by
child-initiated sex differences in size of the play range, suggesting that girls may
opt for activities that include less roaming than those chosen by boys. Children and
adolescents are strongly influenced by peers (Harris, 1995; Rubin, Bukowski, &amp;
Parker, 1998). Here we focus on peer influence on academic performance and
motivation. Children's math grades are correlated with the average verbal and math
skills of the children in their peer group (Kurdek &amp; Sinclair, 2000). Children
tend to become part of peer groups who are similar to them in regard to academic
motivation or academic performance, making cause-and-effect inferences difficult
(Altermatt &amp; Pomerantz, 2003; Kindermann, 1993; Crosnoe, Cavanagh, &amp; Elder,
2003). Nonetheless, children appear to stereotype mathematics as masculine. In one
study, girls rated men as liking mathematics more and being better at mathematics
than women, although the girls rated boys and girls as equal on these variables (J.
Steele, 2003; see also Heyman &amp; Legare, 2004). In a Finnish study, second-,
fourth-, and sixth-grade children were asked to identify the child who was best in
their class in language arts and in &#xA8; mathematics (Raty, Kasanen, Kiiskinen,
&amp; Nykky, 2004). In language arts, boys and girls were nominated evenly. However,
in mathematics, the boys nominated only boys from the second grade on, and the girls
began nominating more boys than girls beginning in fourth grade. By middle
adolescence, girls generally receive less peer support for science activities than
boys do (Stake &amp; Nickens, 2005). Science enrichment programs can be helpful in
counteracting these effects, by giving girls a science-supportive peer network (Stake
&amp; Nickens, 2005). Peer influence, of course, is not limited to childhood and
adolescence. Holland and Eisenhart (1990) conducted an ethnographic study of females
entering college-at either a southern, predominantly White university or a southern,
historically Black college-who were planning to major in mathEducated in Romance
ematics or science. The title of their book, , reflects their finding that these
young women lost their way on the science path during college, being swept away by
the search for a romantic partner, which reduced their career ambitions. Holland and
Eisenhart concluded that faculty and administrators actually had little impact on the
women's choices of career and major; the guiding forces came from peer relationships.
It remains to be seen whether female students would be swept away at universities
such as MIT or CalTech or whether female students who enter these science-intensive
environments differ from women who enter other universities. In either case, the peer
environment, as well as women's own preferences, during the undergraduate years may
result in a loss of women who are prepared to enter graduate training in science and
mathematics. Herzig's (2004) analysis of women choosing or leaving doctoral programs
in mathematics also emphasized peer and other contextual influences. To persist in
their doctoral program, students must feel integrated into their community of
practice, which means that they must not feel isolated, as women may if they are
small in number in a graduate program in mathematics, physics, or engineering. Men,
in contrast, may not need as much peer support and social integration to persist in
these programs. Schools may exert an influence in multiple ways, including via
teachers' attitudes and behaviors, curricula, ability groupings, and sex composition
of classrooms (Roeser, Eccles, &amp; Sameroff, 2000). For example, ability grouping
in mathematics tends to benefit high-ability students (Colangelo, Assouline, &amp;
Gross, 2004; Mulkey, Catsambis, Steelman, &amp; Crain, 2005). When combined with
implicit instruction (e.g., questioning of students' experimental results) or
explicit instruction (e.g,. Klahr &amp; Nigam, 2004; Kuhn &amp; Dean, 2005), hands-on
laboratory experiences are especially important for learning in the physical sciences
in middle school and high school. An important point for this report is that,
although laboratory experiences do not improve the physical-science achievement of
boys, they do improve the achievement of girls, thereby helping to close the gender
gap in these areas (Burkam, Lee, &amp; Smerdon, 1997; Lee &amp; Burkam, 1996). A
complementary set of studies has investigated whether boys and girls do, in fact,
experience different learning environments relevant to mathematics and science, both
in school and out of school. In science and mathematics classes, teachers are more
likely to encourage boys to ask questions and to explain concepts (American
Association of University Women, 1995; Jones &amp; Wheatley, 1990; Kelly, 1988). In
one study of high-school geometry classrooms, teachers directed 61% of their praise
comments and 55% of their high-level open questions to boys (Becker, 1981).
Experiences such as these are thought to give children a deeper conceptual knowledge
of, and more interest in, science, although this relation has not been fully
established. Moreover, as Kelly (1988) noted, even an apparently small difference
between teachers spending 44% of their time with girls and 56% with boys could
translate-via extrapolation-to 1,800 more hours with males over a child's school
career of 15,000 hours. Science-education researchers refer to out-of-school learning
as informal learning. The quality of students' informal learning environments
correlates with their performance on tests of scientific reasoning ability (Gerber,
Carvallo, &amp; Marek, 2001). For example, presence of a computer in the home for
educational purposes and use of a home computer predict performance on standardized
tests of mathematics (Downey &amp; Yuan, 2005). Compared with high-school girls,
high-school boys are more likely to have computers in their homes for educational
purposes and are more likely to use them (Downey &amp; Yuan, 2005). When engaged in a
science task-playing with magnets-mothers talk about the science process (e.g., they
use explanations and generate hypotheses) more with boys than with girls (Tenenbaum,
Snow, Roach, &amp; Kurland, 2005). Moreover, the amount of mothers' science-process
talk predicts children's comprehension of readings about science 2 years later. When
parents and children use interactive science exhibits at a museum, parents are three
times more likely to explain science to boys than to girls (Crowley, Callanan,
Tenenbaum, &amp; Allen, 2001). High-school boys are more likely to have participated
in a math or science fair and, as with the activities noted above, this activity
affects standardized mathematics test performance (Downey &amp; Yuan, 2005). Thus,
informal learning environments relevant to mathematics and science appear to differ
for boys and girls. However, it is not clear to what extent these relations are due
to parental assumptions of the interests and abilities of boys and girls, to
differences in the responsiveness of boys and girls to these activities, or to some
combination. Of course, schools do not exert absolute power over students, and
students are not passive recipients of their experiences. Students exercise choice in
school activities and in informal learning. Crucial to this discussion is students'
choice in high school to take advanced mathematics and science courses. The gender
gap in mathematics course enrollment has narrowed over the last several decades, so
that by 1998 girls were as likely as boys to have taken advanced mathematics courses,
including Advanced Placement calculus (National Science Foundation, 2005). Girls were
actually slightly more likely than males to take advanced biology (40.8% of females
vs. 33.8% of males), Advanced Placement biology (5.8% vs. 5.0%), and chemistry (59.2%
vs. 53.3%). Boys, however, were more likely to take Advanced Placement chemistry
(3.3% of males vs. 2.6% of females) and physics (31.0% vs. 26.6%) and were twice as
likely to take Advanced Placement physics (2.3% vs. 1.2%; National Science
Foundation, 2005). The science pipeline heading toward physics, then, begins to leak
early, as fewer girls than boys take the necessary high-school courses to prepare
themselves for college-level physics. Stereotype Threat Stereotype threat is an
influence that has been demonstrated in laboratory settings and may occur in real
testing situations. It was initially identified and theorized to explain differences
in test performance between talented Black and White college students (C.M. Steele,
1997). C.M. Steele proposed that a negative stereotype about one's group leads to
self-doubt and other processes that can then undermine academic performance, perhaps
by impairing working memory. This concept was quickly extended from stereotypes about
Blacks' intellectual inferiority to stereotypes about females' deficiencies in
mathematics (R.P. Brown &amp; Josephs, 1999; Quinn &amp; Spencer, 2001; Spencer,
Steele, &amp; Quinn, 1999; Walsh, Hickey, &amp; Duffy, 1999). In one experiment, male
and female college students with equivalent math backgrounds were tested (Spencer et
al., 1999). Half were told that the math test had shown sex differences in the past,
and half were told that the test had been shown to be gender fair. Among those who
were led to believe that the test was unbiased, there were no sex differences in
performance, but among those who believed it showed sex differences, women performed
worse than men. The stereotype-threat effect on males' and females' performance on
math tests has been replicated numerous times (e.g., Ben-Zeev, Fein, &amp; Inzlicht,
2005; Cadinu, Maass, Rosabianca, &amp; Kiesner, 2005; Ford, Ferguson, Brooks, &amp;
Hagadone, 2004; Inzlicht &amp; Ben-Zeev, 2000; Johns, Schmader, &amp; Martens, 2005;
Keller &amp; Dauenheimer, 2003, in a naturalistic setting; Marx, Stapel, &amp;
Muller, 2005; Quinn &amp; Spencer, 2001; Schmader, Johns, &amp; Barquissau, 2004),
although there are occasional failures to replicate, including one in a more typical
test-taking setting that used test questions taken from standardized exams (Cullen,
Hardison, &amp; Sackett, 2004). Importantly, most of these studies have been
conducted with high-math-ability females- precisely those who are most capable of
succeeding at careers in mathematics and science. We note here the heated exchange
between Sackett, Hardison, and Cullen (2004a, 2004b), who were concerned about the
mischaracterization of stereotype threat by the media, and C.M. Steele and Aronson
(2004), who responded to their critique. Sackett et al. also raised concerns about
the use of covariates and other statistical procedures used to demonstrate stereotype
threat. Steele and Aronson responded to the concerns raised by Sackett et al. by
referring to the large number of studies that found evidence for stereotype threat
and by pointing out that many of these studies do not rely on the use of covariates
to demonstrate the effect. This exchange, which was published in one of psychology's
leading journals, shows the disagreement over the concept of stereotype threat and
its importance in real-life settings. No one has yet conducted a meta-analysis of
these stereotype-threat studies, so the size of the effect is unknown, but some
studies show large effects d ( 5.67, Quinn &amp; Spencer, 2001; 1.35, Johns et al.,
2005).d5 It is also unknown how altering test scores by removing stereotype threat
from the testing setting affects the validity of the scores in predicting grades or
other indicators of success. Additional research has elaborated the processes
involved in stereotype threat. For example, when solving difficult math problems,
females' ability to formulate problem-solving strategies is reduced under
high-stereotype-threat conditions compared with low-stereotype-threat conditions
(Quinn &amp; Spencer, 2001). Exposure to sex-stereotyped television commercials
reduces females' math performance (Davies, Spencer, Quinn, &amp; Gerhardstein, 2002),
providing evidence of the media as one of the pervasive sociocultural sources of
stereotype threat. And females who endorse stereotypes about mathematics as masculine
show larger stereotype-threat effects on their math performance than do females who
do not endorse these stereotypes (Schmader et al., 2004). The presence of a
math-competent female role model eliminates the stereotype-threat effect on females'
math performance (Marx &amp; Roman, 2002). The stereotype-threat research carries two
important implications: First, if a simple manipulation of instructions can produce
or eliminate sex differences in performance on a mathematics exam, the notion of
fixed sex differences in mathematics ability is called into serious question.
Stereotype threat remains a somewhat contentious topic, and some would argue that
this is a straw argument because no one really believes that mathematical ability is
some fixed or permanent attribute of an individual, so the first concern is not
valid. Second, stereotype threat is a result of cultural factors-specifically,
stereotypes about female inferiority at mathematics-and thus provides evidence of
sociocultural influence on sex differences in mathematics performance. Most of the
research on stereotype threat has been conducted in laboratory settings. Does the
effect occur in real-world settings with high-stakes tests? To answer this question,
Stricker and Ward (2004) collected information about sex and race either before or
after high-school students took an Advanced Placement test in calculus. Students who
score 3 or above in this exam are often given college credit for calculus, so it is
an important test. Stricker and Ward set their criteria for deciding if stereotype
threat was operating in this real-world setting using a standard alpha level of .05
(indicating that the obtained results would occur by chance when the groups really
did not differ in fewer than 5 out of 100 replications) and by deciding that they 5 d
would only consider effect sizes larger than .20. They concluded that they found no
evidence of deleterious effects of stereotype threat on female performance on
quantitative tests. In a reanalysis of their data, Danaher and Crandall (in press)
refuted the conclusion that stereotype threat was unimportant in real high-stakes
testing. They countered that effect sizes need to be considered within a context and
that d&lt;.20 is large and meaningful in this context. They calculated that 5.9%
additional females and 4.7% fewer males would achieve a passing score of 3 or higher
if sex and race were indicated after students take the test instead of before. The
result would be 2,789 more females starting college with credit already achieved for
calculus. Thus, stereotype threat has been found to have significant consequences,
even though the effect size is small. Training Studies Environmental input is
essential to the development of spatial and mathematical abilities (Baenninger &amp;
Newcombe, 1995; Newcombe, 2002). Babies are not born knowing how to work calculus
problems. Children acquire these skills through schooling and other experiences
(Geary, 1995, 2006). Here we review the evidence from training and schooling studies.
A meta-analysis found that spatial ability can indeed be improved d5 with training,
with effect sizes ranging between 0.4 and 5 d 0.8, depending on the length and
specificity of the training (Baenninger &amp; Newcombe, 1989). A more recent
meta-analysis of the effects of training and experience on spatial skills confirms
the earlier findings (Marulis et al., 2007). The effects of training were similar for
males and females; that is, both groups benefited about equally from the training,
and there was little evidence that the gap was closed or widened by training. Vasta,
Knott, and Gaze (1996), however, showed that the difference could be eliminated by
carefully conceptualized training. Unfortunately, most school curricula contain
little or no emphasis on spatial learning. Girls, especially, could benefit greatly
from such a curriculum. The most recent development is multimedia software that
provides training in three-dimensional spatial-visualization skills (Gerson, Sorby,
Wysocki, &amp; Baartmans, 2001). As described earlier, training in such skills has
been used successfully with first-year engineering students. Importantly, there were
improvements in the retention of female engineering students who took the
spatial-visualization course; without the course, the retention rate for females was
47%, whereas with the course it was 77%. These results have held up across multiple
years of training with different cohorts. Studies of the effects of schooling are
difficult in the United States because schooling is nearly universal. One design,
though, has compared children's growth during the school year with their growth
during summers. A study of kindergartners and first graders, for example, found that
growth in spatial skills was much more rapid from October to April (when children are
in school most of the time) than it was from April to October (when children are in
school less of the time; Huttenlocher, Levine, &amp; Vevea, 1998). Importantly, this
effect did not occur for all measures; for example, memory performance improved as
much over the April-to-October period as it did from October to April, suggesting
specificity of the effects of schooling on spatial skills. Similar results for
schooling have been found for mathematics (e.g., Downey, von Hippel, &amp; Broh,
2004).<component x="45.01" y="411.66" width="246.07" height="109.61" page="31"

consistent with Eagly and Wood's (1999) social-structural theory of psychological sex
differences. Sociocultural Influences on Occupational Choice To understand sex
differences in occupational preferences and choices, one must understand the multiple
pathways and psychological processes to those choices. A well-tested model of these
choices has been proposed by Eccles, using an expectancy-value theory (Eccles, 1983,
1994; Meece, EcclesParsons, Kaczala, Goff, &amp; Futterman, 1982). According to
Eccles' model (Fig. 9), individuals choose a particular occupation and, before that,
take the necessary academic courses in high school and college, as a function of two
factors: (a) expectations for success (i.e., individuals take on challenges when they
expect that they can succeed at them) and (b) perceptions of task value (i.e.,
individuals take on a challenge when they value the task, perhaps because they
intrinsically enjoy the task, perhaps because it has utility value such as a good
salary, or for other reasons). Costs are estimated as well (e.g., joining the
after-school science club might require giving up cheerleading). Expectations for
success are shaped by the individual's task-specific beliefs (self-concept of ability
in the relevant domain, perceptions of the difficulty of the task), which in turn are
shaped by past events (e.g., grades in school in that subject, standardized test
scores), and also by the person's interpretation of those past events (e.g., high
grades in mathematics as a result of ability or of effort). Perceptions of task value
are shaped by the individual's long-term goals (e.g., becoming a mathematics
professor) and short-term goals (e.g., taking the right sequence of undergraduate
mathematics courses to qualify for a PhD program in mathematics). These perceptions
of task value are shaped in turn by the individual's perceptions of the attitudes and
expectations of important socializers (parents, teachers, peers) and the larger
cultural milieu (such as the mass media and gender segregation in the occupation).
Dozens of studies have provided evidence supporting the model's proposed links,
although it has been criticized for not including a measure of ability (e.g., Eccles,
Vida, &amp; Barber, 2004; Fredricks &amp; Eccles, 2002; Frome &amp; Eccles, 1998;
Jodl, Michael, Malanchuk, Eccles, &amp; Sameroff, 2001; Meece et al., 1982; reviewed
by Eccles, 1994). How does the model of achievement proposed by Eccles help us
understand sex differences in choice of academic courses in high school, major in
college, and occupation? At the simplest level, if males and females differ in their
expectations for success at math- and science-related tasks, or if they attach
different values to success at these tasks, then sex differences in choices will
occur. Research has documented sex differences in expected task value and expected
success in the areas of science and mathematics, as well as sociocultural forces that
influence those expectations. In general, children's math-competence beliefs decline
from 1st to 12th grade (Jacobs et al., 2002). Although boys start out with greater
math-competence beliefs than girls, by 12th grade there is no sex difference in these
beliefs, at least in recent studies (Fredricks &amp; Eccles, 2002; Jacobs et al.,
2002; see Wilkins, 2004, for international comparisons; and see Hyde, Fennema, Ryan,
Frost, &amp; Hopp, 1990, for a meta-analysis of earlier studies). Reciprocal-effects
modeling with longitudinal data indicates that math-competence beliefs predict later
standardized-test performance much more strongly than test scores predict competence
beliefs (Marsh et al., 2005). Children's valuing of mathematics also declines from
1st to 12th grade, but there are no sex differences in valuing math. What we do not
know from these studies is what the sex differences look like in college-age samples,
when serious decisions about occupations are made, or how sex differences in
interests may interact with these beliefs in determining long-term career choices.
One relevant study examined ninth graders' intentions to enroll in math courses
(Crombie et al., 2005). Although many of the predictors of intentions were the same
for boys and girls, the direct path from math competence beliefs to enrollment
intentions was significant for girls but not for boys, suggesting that girls may be
more influenced by their math self-concept. Research within this expectancy-value
theory has also documented the relation between parents' sex-stereotyped beliefs and
children's sense of competence and achievement in mathematics and science. In one
longitudinal study, mothers' estimates of their sixth-grade children's likelihood of
success in mathematics predicted the children's actual math career choices at ages 24
to 25 years (controlling for children's ability); importantly, mothers' sixth-grade
estimates of their children's math-career success were significantly higher for boys
than for girls, although there was no control for ability in this study and the
authors acknowledge that less subjective measures, such as achievement tests, might
have yielded different relations with career choice (Bleeker &amp; Jacobs, 2004). In
another study, parents who held stereotypic beliefs about male superiority in
mathematics gave significantly higher math-ability estimates to sons than they did to
daughters, controlling for the children's actual grades (Jacobs, 1991; see also
Jacobs &amp; Eccles, 1992). Parents' perceptions of their children's math ability may
have a stronger influence on children's beliefs in their own ability than their math
grades do (Frome &amp; Eccles, 1998). This is a finding that needs to be replicated
and studied further. Similar results have been found for the influence of teachers.
For example, teachers' perceptions of students' math talent early in the school year
predict the students' later math achievementtest scores, even when earlier measures
of ability are controlled (Jussim &amp; Eccles, 1992). In short, the Eccles research
demonstrates the potential importance of key socializers-especially parents and
teachers-in shaping children's self-concepts of their ability, their course choices,
and their occupational choices. When the socializers hold stereotypic beliefs about
male superiority in mathematics and science, these beliefs can translate to daughters
with lower self-concepts of their math and science ability who choose not to pursue
careers in science and mathematics. Correll's (2004) sociological model is similar to
that of Eccles, but Correll's model emphasizes a broader principle: that cultural
beliefs about sex differences affect the emerging career aspirations of males and
females. In a laboratory experiment, participants were told that they were being
tested for a (fictitious) ability, ''contrast sensitivity,'' which was said to be
very important for graduate school and employment success. In one condition,
participants were told that, on average, males perform better on these tests
(male-advantage, MA, condition), and in the other condition, participants were told
that there were no gender differences (NGD condition). The task was in fact
ambiguous, and all participants were told that they were correct on 13 of 20 items.
Afterward, males in the MA condition gave themselves significantly higher
contrast-sensitivity ratings than did females in that condition; in the NGD
condition, there were no sex differences in ability ratings. Perhaps most
importantly, compared with females in the MA condition, males in the MA condition
rated themselves as significantly more likely to apply to graduate programs and for
jobs requiring high levels of contrastsensitivity ability; this differences was not
found in the NGD condition. Another line of evidence comes from cross-cultural
analyses indicating that sex-stereotypic patterns of course choice and occupational
choice vary from one nation to another. For example, female enrollment in 12th-grade
math classes ranges from 22% in Japan to 52% in Thailand (Hanson, Schaub, &amp;
Baker, 1996; see also Davenport et al., 1998). Female enrollment in physics classes
ranges from 13% in Japan to 52% in Thailand, with the United States at 22% (Hanson et
al., 1996). For students planning to major in mathematics or science in college, the
range is from 13% female in Japan to 38% female in Canada, with the United States at
28%. These variations closely parallel the proportion of women employed as scientists
in those countries. Sex Discrimination and Occupational Success Psychological
scientists have studied sex discrimination in a number of ways. Social psychologists
agree that the old-fashioned, overt sexism that existed several decades ago in the
United modern States may have been replaced by unconscious, covert, sexism neosexism
orin some situations (Jackson, Esses, &amp; Burris, 2001; Masser &amp; Abrams, 1999;
Swim &amp; Cohen, 1997). Studies investigating sex bias generally use one of two
methodological approaches: (a) experimental studies, in which a work product (e.g.,
an article) is submitted to raters for evaluation of its quality and half of the
raters see it with a stereotypic male name as author and the other half see the same
work product but with a stereotypic female name as author; and (b) naturalistic
studies examining experiences of sexism or evaluations or hiring of males and females
in real work settings. The experimental studies have the advantage of experimental
control but may lack external validity; the naturalistic studies supply the latter,
and therefore these studies are perceived to be complementary. A meta-analysis of
studies using the experimental paradigm found that, when job applications were
evaluated, sex bias d5 occurred ( ( (.13 to .25; Swim, Borgida, Maruyama, &amp;
Myers, 1989; the negative value indicates that the female applicant was rated lower
than the male). The effect size does not represent a performance difference between
males and females but rather a difference in evaluating the work of a male stimulus
person compared with that of a female stimulus person. A metaanalysis of experimental
research conducted in simulated employment contexts (e.g., when hiring or
compensation decisions were measured) found that sex bias in ratings depended on
whether the job in question was traditionally sex-typed as male or female (Davison
&amp; Burke, 2000). When the job was male d5 sex-typed, males received higher ratings
( .33) even though identical qualifications had been presented in the experiment.
When the job was female sex-typed, females received higher d5 ratings ( (.26). This
pattern suggests that raters' beliefs about applicants' future performance may have
influenced their ratings. A meta-analysis of field studies of sex bias in ratings of
job performance found, overall, little evidence of bias; however, d5 a substantial
pro-male bias ( .32) appeared when only males served as raters (Bowen, Swim, &amp;
Jacobs, 2000). The Davison and Burke (2000) meta-analysis, however, did not find male
d raters to be more biased than female raters ( 5.24 and .34, respectively).
Therefore, it is an open question as to whether males are more biased in their
ratings than females are. One study investigated fourth-year medical students'
experiences of sex discrimination and sexual harassment (Stratton, McLaughlin, Witte,
Fosson, &amp; Nora, 2005). Compared with men, women who had been exposed to
discrimination or harassment were significantly more likely to report that the
experience influenced their choice of specialty (45% vs. 16%) and residency rankings
(25% vs. 11%). General surgery was the area in which women were most likely to
experience discrimination or harassment during the residency selection process. This
study, n5 based on a large sample ( 1,314), documents the frequency of talented
professional women's exposure to discrimination and the extent to which it affects
their career choices. A related study of women in academic medicine found that 40% of
the respondents ranked sex discrimination first out of 11 possible factors hindering
their careers in that field (P.L. Carr, Szalacha, Barnett, Caswell, &amp; Inui,
2003). Focusing on earlier stages of the career process, another study surveyed 477
first-year and 324 final-year undergraduates in male-dominated fields (math, science,
engineering) and femaledominated fields (arts, education, humanities, social science;
J. Steele, James, &amp; Barnett, 2002). Women in the math, science, and engineering
fields reported significantly more sex discrimination than men reported in their
fields and than women reported in female-dominated fields. Moreover, they also
anticipated experiencing more sex discrimination in the future if they went into a
career in that field. Women in the math, science, and engineering fields were also
the most likely to report thinking about changing their major. There has been only
one study of sexism in the scientific peerreview process that was based on an
analysis of peer-review scores (Wenneras &amp; Wold, 1997). In an investigation of
the reasons why women in Sweden are less likely to succeed in science and
mathematics, two investigators studied the peerreview process that is used to award
postdoctoral fellowships. Sweden has been named as the ''leading country in the world
with respect to equal opportunities for men and women'' (p. 343), so it is likely
that if sexism were found in their peer-review process, it exists in other countries
as well. Scientific peer review is shrouded in secrecy. When the investigators
requested the data on peer review from the Swedish Medical Review Council, they were
denied access. Similar requests to the National Science Foundation in the United
States were met with the response that the data are not available in a format that
allows comparisons of women and men (Ceci, Wiliams, &amp; Barnett, 2007). However,
the Swedish Freedom of Press Act grants public access to all government documents,
except those classified as secret for reasons related to national security. An
Administrative Court granted the investigators access to the documents relating to
peer review. The investigators found that female applicants for postdoctoral
fellowships received lower mean scores in all three of the areas in which they were
evaluated: scientific competence, quality of proposed methodology, and relevance of
the research proposal. Because final scores are computed by multiplying all three
scores, small differences are enlarged with this procedure for computing total
scores. Of course, lower mean scores are not evidence of sexism, as it is possible
that the women applicants were, in fact, less qualified. To test this possibility,
the investigators computed scientific productivity indices six different ways, using
variables such as number of publications, number of first-author publications, impact
factors as indicators of the quality of each publication, and number of scientific
citations. In the authors' own words: ''Did men and women with equal scientific
productivity receive the same competence rating by the MRC reviewers? No!'' (p. 387).
The most productive group of female researchers (total of more than 100 total impact
points) were rated as comparable in ability to the least productive male researchers
(total impact points less than 20). All other women were rated below all of the men.
Wenneras and Wold (1997) found that being affiliated with a committee member (what
they call a ''friendship bonus'') and being male were the two most important factors
in determining how research applicants were rated. The effect of having a personal
relationship with members of the review committee- which included being a student of
a member or working on a project with a committee member-was significant even though
committee members with relationships with applicants recused themselves from rating
these applicants. Still, those relationships were known among the other members of
the committee, who apparently were influenced by that knowledge. The authors of this
study conclude that the peer-review process in what is arguably the most gender-equal
nation in the world is rife with nepotism and sexism. In Sweden, women receive 44% of
biomedical doctoral degrees but hold only 25% of postdoctoral positions and 7% of
professional positions. The authors believe that some portion of these discrepancies
is caused by sexism. The policy of secrecy has prevented similar investigations into
the peer-review process in other countries. Even if nepotism and sexism operate
without conscious awareness, they are no less insidious. At a time when the United
States and other countries are facing serious shortages of scientists and
mathematicians, we can only wonder if biases in the peer-review process are
contributing to the loss of talented women in these areas. There are no reasons to
believe that scientists in the United States would be any more immune to prejudice
and nepotism than those in Sweden; these results provide strong reasons for making
the peer-review process more transparent and open for peer review. Women's Roles
Although there has been a major shift over the last several decades toward equalizing
men's and women's roles in the home, employed women still spend significantly more
time with their children than men do (Sandberg &amp; Hofferth, 2001). Achieving high
levels of success in a math or science career requires substantially more than 40
hours of work per week. In thinking about future careers, women may believe that such
a career would interfere with family life, particularly with having children. And,
once in a math or science career, women who have children may find themselves
choosing between time with children and the extra hours needed to perform
brilliantly. Women with engineering degrees, for example, are more likely than their
male peers to be working part time, and the most common reason given for the
part-time work is family (Morgan, 2000). Women who choose nontraditional careers, for
example in math or science, may be penalized in the marriage market. For instance,
women portrayed as being in a traditionally masculine occupation (e.g., orthopedic
surgeon, chemical engineer) are rated as less attractive than women in traditionally
feminine occupations (Badgett &amp; Folbre, 2003). Women engineers are less likely to
be married and more likely to be childless than men engineers are (Jagacinski, 1987).
Thus, it appears that women entering careers in science and engineering face more
difficult life trade-offs than their male peers do. One study pitted several of these
explanations against each other, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth, a national probability sample of 12,686 young men and women who ranged in age
from 14 to 21 in 1979 and who were<component x="62.99" y="693.43" width="246.06"

state of the evidence for cognitive and interest differences between the sexes and
their putative biological, evolutionary, and social/environmental origins, we have
presented a summary of what is known about sex differences and similarities in
mathematical and science abilities based on the best available scientific evidence.
The popular media have sensationalized findings of sex differences, often presenting
the latest finding without assessing the quality of the research that it was based on
or using ''person on the street interviews'' about beliefs about sex differences as
though they were as valid as a carefully executed program of research (e.g., Conlin,
2003). This monograph represents a consensus of expert opinion, from a group of
scientists with diverse backgrounds, to the questions about sex and math and science
achievement. We addressed questions concerning whether and when (in the life span)
there are differences between males and females in the cognitive abilities that are
important for success in careers requiring aptitude for and achievement in
mathematics and science, and the extent to which sex differences in math and science
abilities can be attributed to ''innate'' explanations, socialization, or the way
these two types of influences reciprocally influence each other. In this review, we
have focused on a wide range of research in which reasonable data have accumulated
that address these issues, which we summarize and draw conclusions from below.
Average Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities Psychologists often look for sex
differences very early in life as clues to the relative contribution of biological
and environmental contributions, reasoning that newborns have had fewer social
interactions, so the earlier that sex differences are reliably found, the more likely
they are assumed to be biological in origin. This assumption is not fully supported
by the biological literature because, for many species, sex differences are not
evident in infancy and often do not emerge until the age of reproductive maturation.
The simple distinction between cognitive sex differences that emerge early in life
and those that emerge later does not rule out environmental effects, because the
uterine environment affects the development of a fetus. The role of prenatal
environmental factors is an excellent example of the interaction of biological and
environmental variables, which often become indistinguishable in their effects. It
does not necessarily follow that differences found later in life are caused by social
or environmental factors, because there are developmental timelines for biological
processes, including the timing of puberty, the development of the forebrain, and the
aging processes, all of which are also influenced by the environment. Moreover, the
tasks that infants can handle may be qualitatively different from tasks designed for
adolescents, even if they are both labeled the same. For example, a verbal or spatial
task for an infant is qualitatively different than a verbal or spatial task for an
adolescent. With these caveats in mind, the usual finding across tasks is that males
and females develop equally well in early cognitive skills that relate to
quantitative thinking and knowledge of objects in the environment. By the end of
grade school and beyond, females perform better on assessments of verbal abilities
when assessments are heavily weighted with writing and the language-usage items cover
topics with which females are familiar; sex differences favoring females are much
larger in these conditions than when assessments of verbal abilities do not including
writing. In contrast, males excel on certain visuospatial-ability measures. Yet, of
all the sex differences in cognitive abilities, differences in quantitative abilities
have received the most attention because of the marked differences favoring males at
the highest end of the ability distribution and because of their importance in so
many occupations. Male performance is more variable than that of females in
quantitative and visuospatial abilities, which means that there are also more males
at the low-ability end of these distributions. Because males tend to be more
variable, the average difference in performance between females and males for most
assessments is smaller than it is at the high- and low-ability tails of the
distributions, and the size of the average between-sex difference is larger for tests
such as the GRE that are administered to selective samples than it is for less
selective tests such as the SAT or a high-school admissions test. The fact that
females achieve higher grades in school-based math and science tests and lower
average scores on standardized exams used for college admissions and graduate school
may point to differences in the strategies males and females use to solve novel
problems (Gallagher &amp; Cahalan, in press) and to the tendency of females to do
better in most school contexts (Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997). Of course, the factors
that enter into earning a high grade in a class are also different from those leading
to high test scores on a standardized test. Sex Differences in Math and Science
Performance in the Tails of the Distribution Substantial evidence suggests that the
male advantage in mathematics is largest at the upper end of the ability
distribution, a result that could provide important clues to the origin of this sex
difference. In addition, a ''tilt'' favoring visuospatial or mathematical abilities
compared to verbal, regardless of level of ability, is more frequently exhibited by
males than by females. Females tend to be more balanced in their ability profiles,
which may lead them to choose mathematics or science careers less frequently than
their male counterparts do. These differences can be seen as early as adolescence,
and, therefore, a greater number of males than females may qualify for advanced
training in disciplines that place a premium on mathematical reasoning and/or
visuospatial abilities. Any differences that exist are increased if interests and
activities that are correlated with abilities are considered. An Evolutionary Account
of Sex Differences in Mathematics and Science From an evolutionary perspective, sex
differences in advanced math and science have not evolved in any direct way but could
be indirectly related to differences in interests and to specific brain and cognitive
systems that differ for females and males. Evolutionary theories predict sex
differences that arise from patterns of intrasexual competitions (for both males and
females) and intersexual choice (for both females and males), including pressures
that accompany the male-biased activities of hunters and warriors who traveled long
distances in novel territory. Although a large body of data was presented that
supports this theory, numerous criticisms have been raised as well. Many of its
predictions remain to be tested, although several patterns are consistent with
observed differences in interest and ability profiles. Sex Differences in Brain
Structure and Function Studies of brain structure and function have suggested some
potential biological mechanisms for the observed sex differences in ability. In
general, females have a higher percentage of gray-matter brain tissue, whereas males
have a higher volume of connecting white-matter tissue-with the exception of the
splenium of the corpus callosum, which is more bulbous and, thus, larger in females
than in males. Furthermore, male brains show greater volumetric asymmetries than
female brains do. The higher white-matter volume seems associated with better spatial
performance in males, while the greater bilateral symmetry seems associated with
better language processing in females. Although the advent of noninvasive techniques
for functional brain imaging has allowed a rapid increase in the number of studies
investigating sex differences in the regional functional specialization for
cognition, these studies are in their infancy. Future research of this type should
involve larger and more carefully selected sample populations to avoid strong and
potentially confounding cohort effects, and should employ longitudinal designs.
Finally, hormones have been documented to affect cognition through their organizing
effects on the brain.<component x="303.02" y="65.44" width="246.09" height="285.35"

present a level of complexity that is inherent in understanding complicated questions
about the way people think and behave. We have presented several conclusions,
including a definition of the problem and the systems of variables that make us both
social and biological animals. There are caveats to these conclusions because of
methodological limitations of individual studies. Nonetheless, they are based on
sound science, and we relied on meta-analyses of large bodies of research, when those
were available. There is no single factor by itself that has been shown to determine
sex differences in science and math. Early experience, biological constraints,
educational policy, and cultural context each have effects, and these effects add and
interact in complex and sometimes unpredictable ways. Support for this report was
