intelligence and socioeconomic success has been the source of numerous controversies.
The present paper conducted a meta-analysis of the longitudinal studies that have
investigated intelligence as a predictor of success (as measured by education,
occupation, and income). In order to better evaluate the predictive power of
intelligence, the paper also includes metaanalyses of parental socioeconomic status
(SES) and academic performance (school grades) as predictors of success. The results
demonstrate that intelligence is a powerful predictor of success but, on the whole,
not an overwhelmingly better predictor than parental SES or grades. Moderator
analyses showed that the relationship between intelligence and success is dependent
on the age of the sample but there is little evidence of any historical trend in the
relationship. &#xA9; 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<component x="36.85"

mental abilities have demonstrated that the scores of intelligence tests are
positively correlated with several desirable outcomes and negatively correlated with
several undesirable outcomes. One of the central and personally most relevant
desirable outcomes is socioeconomic success (or career success), which is usually
measured by the educational level, occupational prestige, and income of an individual
in adulthood. Although it is sometimes claimed in popular press and textbooks that
intelligence has no relationship to important real-life outcomes (see Barrett &amp;
Depinet, 1991, for a review of such claims), the scientific research on the topic
leaves little doubt that people with higher scores on IQ tests are better educated,
hold more prestigious occupations, and earn higher incomes than people with lower
scores (Gottfredson, 1997, 2003; Jensen, 1980, 1998; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004).
Thus, the existence of an overall positive correlation between intelligence and
socioeconomic success is beyond doubt. But quite surprisingly, the mere existence of
this correlation seems to be the only fact that is established beyond doubt after
many decades of research. Several major questions are still without definite answers
and continue to arouse heated debates (the debate about The Bell Curve being a
prominent example in recent decades; see Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Fischer et
al., 1996). First, what is the approximate size of the correlation between
intelligence and success? Is it large enough to be of any practical importance? While
some researchers have " said that this correlation is larger than most found in "
psychological research (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004: " 162), others are convinced that
IQ is just not an " important enough determinant of economic success (Bowles &amp;
Gintis, 2002: 12). Second, how does the predictive power of intelligence compare to
the predictive power of other variables, such as parental socioeconomic status (SES)
or school grades? On the " one hand there are studies showing that individual ability
is by far the strongest influence on occupa" tional achievement (Bond &amp; Saunders,
1999: 217). " And yet other studies conclude that the effect of socioeconomic
background on each of the three adult - status variables schooling, income, and
occupa- tional status is greater than the effect of childhood " IQ (Bowles &amp;
Nelson, 1974: 44). Third, are there any age-related or historical changes in the
relationship between intelligence and success? The question of historical changes in
the importance of IQ has been particularly controversial with some authors warning
against increasing cognitive stratification (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) and
others trying to disprove these claims (Hauser &amp; Huang, 1997). The present paper
will address these questions by conducting a meta-analysis of the longitudinal
research on the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. I will
concentrate on longitudinal studies (where intelligence is measured before the actual
success) because only longitudinal research design allows us to make conclusions
about the possible causal impact of intelligence on success.<component x="41.16"

relationship between intelligence and career success have been conducted since the
first decades of the 20th century (Ball, 1938; Thorndike et al., 1934). And these
studies have invariably uncovered a positive relationship. The early studies,
however, did not consider other possible determinants of success, most importantly
parental SES. Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive
relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of
parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At
the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm,
investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement
that considered several determinants of success at the same time (Duncan, 1968;
Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp; Ohlendorf, 1970). But it was with the
publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the
question of intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to public attention.
Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein
and Murray found that intelligence is a better predictor of several desirable
outcomes (e.g., not living in poverty, not being arrested) than is parental SES. They
also found evidence that the role of intelligence in status attainment has been
growing throughout the 20th century and concluded that the social structure of
American society is increasingly based on mental ability. The ideas of The Bell Curve
have been severely criticized for a number of reasons. Fischer et al. (1996) argued
that Herrnstein and Murray used an inappropriate measure of parental SES and,
therefore, underestimated its importance. Hauser and Huang (1997) argued that the
claim about the growing importance of intelligence is simply a misinterpretation of
previous research. Other researchers have, however, supported the ideas of The Bell
Curve (Gottfredson, 2003; Jensen, 1998) saying that its central claims have been
convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459). At the same time in Great Britain, a
similar discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who, analyzing a
representative longitudinal data set from Great Britain, found that intelligence is a
better predictor of occupational attainment than is parental SES and concluded that
England is, to a large extent, a meritocratic society (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999;
Saunders, 1997, 2002). These conclusions were challenged by Breen and Goldthorpe
(1999, 2001) who argued that Saunders greatly overestimated the importance of
intelligence by using inappropriate analytic techniques.<component x="36.85"

lateness="0.19047619047619047" reference_score="6.09">There have been surprisingly
few attempts to systematically review the literature on intelligence and
socioeconomic success. Reviewers typically cite only a couple of studies (see e.g.,
Brody, 1997; Farkas, 2003; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Some of the most
comprehensive reviews have been conducted by Jencks (see Jencks et al., 1972, 1979).
Two meta-analyses have so far addressed the relationship between intelligence and
socioeconomic success. Both of them used income as a measure of success. The more
comprehensive one of the two was conducted by Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001).
They assembled 65 estimates from 24 studies to estimate the relationship between
intelligence and income. The mean standardized regression coefficient of intelligence
on income is .15 according to their study (p. 1154). In addition to that, Bowles et
al. (2001) reported that there is no time trend in the size of the coefficients
between the years 1960 and 1995 and that the age of the sample at the time of ability
testing has no effect on the results. The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. is a
valuable contribution but it suffers from several shortcomings. First, it considered
only one measure of success, income, thereby ignoring education and occupation.
Second, the meta-analytic estimate of .15 was not derived from zero-order
correlations as is usually required by the textbooks of meta-analysis (see Hunter
&amp; Schmidt, 2004: 475) but from regression equations that included several
predictors in addition to intelligence. Peterson and Brown (2005) have recently
suggested that the use of partial effect sizes, instead of zero-order ones, does not
affect the meta-analytic results very much but it is nevertheless obvious that the
use of disparate studies makes the results difficult to interpret. Third, the
metaanalysis of Bowles et al. was not based on independent samples. The authors
stated that they used 65 estimates from 24 studies (p. 1154) but neither of these
figures represents the number of independent samples. Inspection of the appendix (not
published but available from the authors) leaves no doubt that some samples
contributed more than one coefficient to the final meta-analytic estimate thereby
ignoring the requirement of independent data (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004, chapter
10). Fourth, their meta-analysis mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The
distinction between cross-sectional and longitudinal study design is vital in the
present context because only the latter can answer questions about the causal impact
of intelligence on career success. Another, more recent, meta-analysis was conducted
by Ng, Eby, Sorensen, and Feldman (2005) who collected 8 studies and found an average
correlation of .27 between intelligence and salary. The meta-analysis of Ng et al.
(2005) was, unlike the one by Bowles et al., based on zero-order correlations and
avoided the use of non-independent samples but it failed to separate crosssectional
and longitudinal studies.<component x="281.93" y="51.61" width="221.16"

importance of a predictor in isolation; it would be informative to compare the
predictive power of intelligence to the predictive power of other relevant predictors
of socioeconomic success. This paper will, therefore, analyze two additional
predictors -parental SES (e.g., father's occupation) - and academic performance
(e.g., school grades) with the aim to determine if intelligence is a better predictor
of success than the other two variables. Parental SES and academic performance have
often been treated as " " the main competitors of intelligence in predicting career
success because, as explained shortly, they represent different views about a typical
path to success. Including them in this paper will, consequently, allow us to better
evaluate the role of intelligence in people's career. 4.2.1. Intelligence versus
parental SES The question about the relative importance of intelligence and parental
SES in predicting success is one of the central questions of status attainment
research. This is a question about the nature of the society we live in: whether a
typical western society rewards people for their own abilities or their social
background (Saunders, 1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a definite
answer to this question. Some authors have found that intelligence outcompetes
parental SES as a predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998; Saunders,
1997). Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a
better predictor (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly
greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to
correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles &amp; Nelson,
1974) and the failure to include important aspects of parental status (most
importantly, parental income) among the predictors (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974;
Fischer et al., 1996). Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation between
intelligence and success with the correlation between parental SES and success. To
accomplish that, the present paper will include a meta-analysis of the relationship
between the different aspects of parental SES (parental education, occupation, and
income) and socioeconomic success. Research on this relationship is, of course,
voluminous and several narrative and quantitative reviews of it are available (see
Ganzeboom, Luijkx, &amp; Treiman, 1989; Haveman &amp; Wolf, 1995; Mulligan, 1999).
Ganzeboom et al. (1989), for instance, gathered 149 studies from 35 countries to
analyze the association between father's occupation and son's occupation, and
concluded that the association is stronger in non-industrialized societies and has
been weakening during the 20th century. But none of these reviews has presented the
results in a manner that would make them 1 directly usable in this paper, hence the
need for a separate meta-analysis. 4.2.2. Intelligence versus academic performance
The question about the relative importance of mental ability and academic performance
in predicting success has also been recognized as important (see Jencks &amp;
Phillips, 1999). It is a question of what really matters for career success: is it
one's general ability (as measured by IQ tests) or the things one has learned at
school and motivation to learn (as measured by school grades)? Not many studies have
explicitly compared the predictive power of IQ scores and school grades (e.g.,
Taubman &amp; Wales, 1974, chapter 3). But the more general question about the
usefulness of grades as predictors of success has been the object of considerable
debate (see Roth, BeVier, Switzer, &amp; Schippmann, 1996; Roth &amp; Clark, 1998).
The meta-analysis by Roth and Clark (1998), for instance, found an average
correlation of .28 between grades and salary. Thus, contrary to some earlier claims
(e.g., McClelland, 1973), grades have turned out to be good predictors of success.
This literature is somewhat limited by being almost exclusively restricted to college
grades. If the purpose is to compare grades and IQ test scores as predictors of
career success, then high school grades would be a better choice because college
students constitute a rather selected group that does not represent the full range of
career attainments in society. High school grades have been meta-analytically related
to job performance (Dye &amp; Reck, 1988) and college grades (Robbins et al., 2004)
but there is currently no meta-analysis about the relationship between high school
grades and general socioeconomic success (as measured by education, occupation, and
income). The present paper will, thus, conduct such a meta-analysis. 4.3. Moderators
of the correlation between intelligence and success In order to further clarify the
role of intelligence in people's career, the effects of three moderator variables
(age at testing, age at success, and year of success) on - intelligence success
correlation will be studied. These moderator variables have been analyzed in several
studies but with rather conflicting results. 4.3.1. Age at the time of testing The
first moderator analysis concerns age at testing (age of individuals at the time the
IQ test was taken) and how it affects the correlation between intelligence and
success. Analysis of the effect of age at testing reveals something about the
mechanism behind the - intelligence success correlation. If intelligence predicts
success irrespective of the age at which it is measured, then there is reason to
believe that the differences in people's career success are the result of the stable
individual differences measured by IQ tests (Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1999). If
however, the predictive power of IQ tests changes with age, then different
interpretations are possible depending on how we believe the test score to be
affected by genes and environment. According to the standard sociological
interpretation, the test scores of older individuals should be more affected by life
experiences than the scores of children (because older individuals simply have had
more experiences) and consequently, if intelligence tested at an older age should
turn out to be a better predictor career success, then it would mean that the test
scores probably reflect some career-relevant experiences which the older individuals
have had more time to accumulate (Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1999). The other
interpretation is based on behavior genetic research which has found that genetic
influences on IQ scores increase with age and environmental influences decrease
(McCartney, Harris, &amp; Bernieri, 1990); from these results one can conclude that
if the test scores of older individuals are better predictors of success, then it can
be attributed to the growing effect of some 2 career-relevant genes. Empirical
evidence concerning age at testing is rather contradictory. A study by McCall (1977)
found a clear upward trend in the correlations between intelligence and success; that
is, correlations grew stronger as age at testing increased. Some of the studies
reviewed by Jencks and Phillips (1999) have found a similar trend. The meta-analysis
of Bowles et al. (2001), however, found that age at testing has no effect on the
association between intelligence and income. Jencks et al. (1979) reached a similar
conclusion in their review. 4.3.2. Age at the measurement of success A related issue
concerns the age of the individuals at the time their career success is measured.
According to the so-called gravitational hypothesis, the correlation between
intelligence and success should grow stronger as individuals grow older because (as a
result of self" " selection and competition) individuals gravitate towards the
positions that correspond to their ability levels as they progress in their careers.
This reasoning has been used to support the idea that intellectual differences
cumulate over life course and become progressively more important (see Gottfredson,
2003; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996). Other researchers have suggested that exactly the
opposite is true: the predictive validity of IQ scores should decline as time goes by
because less able people have time to accumulate skills to compensate for their
initial lack of ability (Ackerman, 1987; Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001). These opposing
views can be reconciled by saying that the idea of declining importance of IQ applies
to the performance of specific tasks that become automatic after some practice and
the idea of growing importance applies complex long term activities, such as
attaining and maintaining social status, that never cease to be cognitively
demanding. But so far as socioeconomic success can depend on the performance of
specific work tasks, the possibility of declining validity of IQ is not completely
ruled out. Several studies have correlated intelligence with success at different
points in people's life course. Some of them have found that the correlations indeed
increase with age as predicted by the gravitational hypothesis (Brown &amp; Reynolds,
1975; Deary et al., 2005; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996), others have found no clear trend
(Hauser, Warren, Huang, &amp; Carter, 1996; Warren, Sheridan, &amp; Hauser, 2002).
The reviews by Hulin, Henry, and Noon (1990) and Keil and Cortina (2001) found
support for the declining validity thesis but it should be noted that many of the
studies reviewed in these papers used specific laboratory tasks as dependent
variables and are, therefore, not directly comparable to the studies reviewed in the
present paper. 4.3.3. Year of the measurement of success A particularly controversial
issue concerns the historical changes in the relationship between intelligence and
success. It was one of the central claims of The Bell Curve that the association
between mental ability and career success in western societies has been growing
throughout the 20th century (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, - 1994). The logic behind this
idea is similar to the gravitational hypothesis, discussed in the previous section in
both cases individuals are increasingly drawn towards the positions that correspond
to their ability as time goes - by but in this case the gravitation does not take
place during a life course of a single individual but over several generations.
Several studies have investigated changes in the association between intelligence and
success during past decades. Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded " " that the
main point seems beyond dispute (1994: 52) and some studies have found support for
this point (Murnane, Willett, &amp; Levy, 1995), there are still serious reasons to
doubt that the importance of intelligence is or has been growing. Neither the
meta-analysis by Bowles et al. (2001) nor the review by Jencks et al. (1979) found
any clear trend in the correlations between intelligence and success. The same
conclusion was reached by Flynn (2004) and Hauser and Huang (1997). Breen and
Goldthorpe (2001) found that the association between intelligence and occupational
status in England is, if anything, declining.<component x="286.24" y="458.1"

measured by the number of years spent in full time education or the highest level of
education completed. Occupational level was typically measured by such occupational
scales as Duncan Socioeconomic Index, International Socioeconomic Index of
Occupational Status, NORC prestige scale, etc. These scales provide detailed
numerical measures of occupational status (see Ganzeboom &amp; Treiman, 1996a, for a
general discussion). In some studies, less detailed occupational classifications were
used. Irrespective of the level of detail, all the occupational variables in this
paper had a common property of ordering occupations on a single hierarchical
dimension with higher values designating more desirable and prestigious occupations.
Income was measured by salary or total monetary income, which had to refer to the
personal income of an individual, not to family or household income. If possible, I
preferred income measured on a logarithmic scale because logarithmic transformation
removes the skew typically found in income distribution. 5.1.2. Intelligence
Intelligence, or general mental ability, of an individual was measured by a score on
a test of intelligence. It is not always easy, however, to decide if a given test is
a test of intelligence. The definitions of intelligence state that it is an abstract
ability that is not tied to any specific domain of knowledge. Therefore, only the
tests that are designed to measure such ability should be used in the meta-analysis.
If we take the traditional threefold distinction between ability, aptitude, and
achievement tests (Jensen, 1981), then the present study should use only ability and
aptitude test scores. Although some researchers have contended that achievement tests
can also be treated as measures of general ability (Boudreau, Boswell, Judge, &amp;
Bretz, 2001), and even everyday life can be interpreted as an IQ test (Gordon, 1997),
the present study took a more conservative approach and included only those tests
that are generally regarded as tests of intelligence (see e.g., Anastasi &amp;
Urbina, 1997; Jensen, 1980, chapter 7, for a discussion and classification of
different tests). " " - There are numerous classical tests (e.g., Henmon - - Nelson,
Lorge Thorndike, Otis Lennon, Raven Prog- ressive Matrices, Stanford Binet, Wechsler
tests) for which there seems to be a general consensus that these are indeed tests of
general mental ability. Such multiple aptitude test batteries as Armed Services
Vocational Aptitude Battery or General Aptitude Test Battery are also often treated
as measures of general ability. The most problematic ones are the tests that are
specifically constructed for use in a single data set. Such unique tests have been
used in several large and influential data sets (e.g., National Child Development
Study, National Longitudinal Survey of High School Class 1972, Panel Study of Income
Dynamics, Project Talent). In these cases I consulted the manuals of the data sets
and studies that are based on the data. If the test was derived from other IQ tests
or if it was described as a test of intelligence, then I included it in my study.
Studies using well-known achievement tests, such as Iowa Test of Basic Skills
(Smokowski, Mann, Reynolds, &amp; Fraser, 2004), were excluded. The names of all the
IQ tests used in this paper are listed in the Appendix. 5.1.3. Parental SES Five
measures of parental socioeconomic status (SES) were used in this paper; the first
four were father's education, mother's education, father's occupation, and parental
income. The measurement of these variables was similar to the measurement of
respondent's own education, occupation, and income (see above). Parental income
refers to father's income or total income of parents. Because too few studies
reported data on mother's occupation, this variable was not included. In addition to
these four, I also used a general index of SES, which combines several parental
characteristics into one variable. A number of studies have used a composite index on
the assumption that it is a better indicator of social advantages than any of the
single variables that make up the index and, therefore, also a better predictor of
success (see White, 1982, for supporting evidence). A correlation with SES index was
included in the present metaanalysis if the index was composed of the following
components -parental education (education of one or both parents), parental
occupation (occupation of one or both parents), and material well-being of the
parental home. The latter was measured by parental " " income or by a possession
index which indicates how many of the valued items (e.g., a car, TV set, computer)
were present at home. If a study did not use an index of SES but presented
intercorrelations among the necessary variables, then I used the formulas reported by
Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 433) to calculate a composite score correlation between SES
index and success. 5.1.4. Academic performance Academic performance was in most
studies measured by a grade point average (GPA) obtained in high school or the years
preceding high school. In some studies, rank in class (i.e., how well the student
performed in comparison with other students in the class) was used instead of GPA.
Rank is generally used interchangeably with GPA (see Kuncel, Crede, &amp; Thomas,
2005), therefore, these studies were also included.<component x="286.24" y="302.65"

inclusion in the metaanalysis by searching computerized databases (such as " JSTOR,
PsycINFO) using terms like status attain" " ment , educational attainment "
"occupational attain" ment , " "socioeconomic achievement as keywords. Reference
sections of review papers were also searched. To be included in the meta-analysis,
the following general criteria had to be met. First, the measurement of the variables
had to correspond to the descriptions presented in Section 5.1. Second, the data had
to be longitudinal; that is, the predictors (intelligence, parental SES, and academic
performance) had to be measured at an earlier time and career success (education,
occupation, 3 and income) at a later time. Third, the interval between the
measurement of predictors and dependent variables had to be at least 3 years because
studies with shorter intervals would have very little advantage over crosssectional
studies. Fourth, the study had to report a zeroorder correlation between the
variables and another measure of association transformable into a zero-order
correlation. Fifth, majority of individuals in the sample had to be at least 20 years
old at the time the career success was measured because it makes little sense to talk
about the career success of individuals younger than 20. Sixth, majority of
individuals had to be less than 25 years old at the time the IQ test was taken
because, to properly investigate the effect of intelligence on career, intelligence
should be tested before the individuals start a career. Obviously, even individuals
tested in their early twenties might already have started a career, but since these
individuals can be used for comparison with younger individuals, they were included.
Information on parental SES and academic performance had to refer to the time the -
respondents were approximately 12 18 years old (the time these variables presumably
have their greatest impact on subsequent career). Seventh, the study had to be " "
conducted in a western society; that is, in the United States, Canada, Europe,
Australia, or New Zealand. Additional criteria are described in Section 5.4. It is
rather common for published studies not to report the information necessary for
meta-analysis (the lack of zero-order correlations is a typical problem). But
fortunately, the raw data of several well-known data sets (e.g., General Social
Survey, National Longitudinal Survey of Youth) are available for public use. Because
it would be a serious waste of information to leave these sources unused, I decided
to use the available raw data to calculate the correlations if none of the published
sources reported the necessary information or if the information in the published
source was deficient in some way (e.g., if the correlations were reported separately
for men and women but not for the complete<component x="281.93" y="51.6"

the studies had to actually include at least two waves of measurement because one of
the predictors, parental SES, can be measured retrospectively (by asking adult "
respondents questions like what was your father's occupation at the " time you were
16? ). It is important, however, that the information about father's occupation or
parental income obtained from adult respondents refers to parents' past (not current)
occupation or income. The latter requirement was not applied to parental education
because parents' education is unlikely to change while children grow up. In some
studies (e.g. Duncan &amp; Hodge, 1963), father's occupation " " was rather vaguely
referred to as father's usual occupation or " " longest occupation . These studies
were also included.<component x="41.16" y="52.03" width="221.25" height="118.5"

sets had been prepared for public use and contained all the necessary variables in a
ready-to-use form. In some cases, minor statistical procedures were implemented
before calculating the correlations (e.g., summing the standardized scores of
subtests to obtain the score of general intelligence; transforming the original
occupational variable into a more appropriate prestige scale using the methodological
tools provided by Ganzeboom and Treiman (1996b). The raw data sets used in this paper
are listed in the Appendix. Several longitudinal data sets contain data from more
than one follow up. Career success has been measured repeatedly for the same
individuals in these data sets (up to 20 times in some cases). In some data sets, the
predictors (intelligence, parental SES, or academic performance) have also been
measured repeatedly. In order to ascertain that every sample contributed only one
correlation to one analysis, I averaged all the correlations that were derived from
the same sample. If the sample sizes of the averaged correlations were different,
mean sample size was used. The procedures for moderator analyses are described in
Sections 6.3 and 6.4.<component x="286.24" y="398.29" width="221.25" height="272.11"

should be corrected with the reliability coefficients obtained from the same sample
as the correlation that needs to be corrected (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004, chapter
3). However, such reliability coefficients were available for only a small minority
of studies included in the present meta-analysis. The correlations from these studies
were corrected with these reliability coefficients. But for the majority of studies,
mean reliabilities (estimated from various sources, as described below) were used.
Each study was then corrected individually with the appropriate reliability
coefficient. The nature and sources of reliability information are described next.
5.3.1. Socioeconomic success Information on education, occupation, and income can be
obtained from three sources. The first source is institutional record (e.g., tax
records of income). Following the common practice, data from such objective sources
were assumed to have a reliability of 1. The second and by far the most common source
is self-report. Self-reports are not perfectly reliable, however. The amount of error
is usually measured by asking the same individuals to report their socioeconomic
characteristics again after a few months and then correlating the - first and second
reports (producing a test retest correlation). Several estimates of these
correlations, derived from nationally representative samples, are available. Using
the data presented by Bowles (1972) - and Jencks et al. (1979), I calculated the
average test retest correlations for educational level (.89), occupational status
(.88), and income (.83). These values were used to correct the correlations with
self-reported socioeconomic success. The third possibility is to obtain the
information from the spouse, parent, sibling, or child of the focal individual.
Because these sources would introduce unnecessary complications and an unknown degree
of error, the studies using these sources were excluded unless they contained
correlations between intelligence 4 and success (these correlations are too valuable
to be discarded). 5.3.2. Intelligence When correcting for unreliability in the test
scores, - test retest alternate-form reliability (the correlation between parallel
forms of the same test administered on two separate occasions) is generally
considered to be the most appropriate form of reliability (Schmidt &amp; Hunter,
1999). But since these coefficients are rarely - available, simple test retest
reliability is often taken as the second best option in meta-analytic studies of the
predictive power of IQ scores (Judge, Colbert, &amp; Ilies, 2004; Salgado, Anderson,
Moscoso, Bertua, &amp; Fruyt, - 2003). Because test retest reliability coefficients
were - reported in only a few studies, an average test retest coefficient, obtained
from the meta-analysis of Salgado et al. (2003), was used for most of the studies.
Salgado - et al. averaged 31 test retest correlations of different general mental
ability tests (the mean interval between test and retest being 6 months) and obtained
an average - coefficient of .83. This value is similar to average test retest
correlations obtained in other reviews: e.g., .82 in Parker, Hanson, and Hunsley
(1988) or .85 in Kuncel, Hezlett, and Ones (2004). Thus, the reliability of .83 seems
to be a representative estimate and was used in the present study. 5.3.3. Parental
SES The information on parental education, occupation, and income can come from three
sources. First, it can be reported by the parents themselves. If this was the case,
then the correlations were corrected with the same reliability coefficients that were
used for selfreported education, occupation, and income. Second, it can be reported
by the children. Children's reports on parental characteristics are known to suffer
from considerable error. Probably the best estimate of this error is the correlation
between child's report and parent's own report on a given characteristic. Looker
(1989) has presented a comprehensive review of these correlations for father's
education, mother's education, and father's occupation. Using the information in
Table 3 in Looker's paper, I calculated the average correlations between child's
report and parent's report. The average correlations are .80 for father's education,
.79 for mother's education, and .78 for father's occupation. These values were used
to correct the correlations that 5 involved children's reports on parental SES.
Information on the reliability of children's reports on parental income is harder to
find. I could locate two studies (Bell, Senese, &amp; Elliott, 1984; Massagli &amp;
Hauser, 1983) that provided reliability estimates from three samples. The estimates
ranged from .45 to .59. with an average of .51 that was used in the present paper.
The third source of information on parental SES is objective data (e.g., tax records
of income) that was assumed to have a reliability of 1. Internal consistency method
(Cronbach alpha) was used to correct for unreliability in the SES index. This method
was recommended by Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 438) for composite variables. For all
but two studies, the alpha value of the SES index was obtained from the same sample
as the correlation itself. For the remaining two, the average alpha of all the other
studies (.71) was used. 5.3.4. Academic performance If the information on academic
performance (GPA or class rank) was obtained from school records, it was assumed to
have a reliability of 1. Students' selfreports on their GPA or rank are, of course,
not perfectly reliable. The reliability of self-reports is assessed by the
correlation between self-reported GPA (or rank) and GPA (or rank) obtained from
school records. A recent meta-analysis by Kuncel et al. (2005) found that this
correlation is .82 for high school GPA and .77 for high school rank. These values
were used to correct the correlations that involved self-reported GPA or
rank.<component x="286.24" y="207.01" width="221.2" height="152.54" page="8"

range restriction was performed in the present meta-analysis. Instead of that, the
correction was done indirectly by excluding studies with considerable range
restriction. This strategy was preferred because most of the studies that satisfied
the inclusion criteria (see Section 5.2) were based on samples that were fairly
representative of the general population and did not require the correction for range
restriction. It is, therefore, appropriate to limit the current meta-analysis to
representative studies and exclude the studies that 6 exhibit signs of considerable
range restriction. More specifically, I excluded the studies that sampled only (a)
college students or individuals with a college degree (e.g., Eckland, 1965), (b)
employees of a single organization (e.g., Dreher &amp; Bretz, 1991), or (c)
representatives of one specific occupational group (such as engineers or managers;
see e.g., Sackett, Gruys, 7 &amp; Ellingson, 1998). These criteria exclude much of
the personnel selection research, which is the kind of research where the problem of
range restriction is particularly serious (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004). I also
excluded the correlation if the range of one (or both) of the correlated variables
was deliberately restricted by the research design. For example, in the study of
gifted children by Terman and Oden (1947), the range of intelligence was severely
restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs over 135; in the Polish study by
Firkowska-Mankiewicz (2002), the range of intelligence was restricted by sampling
only individuals with IQs below 86 or over 130. The correlations obtained from
Fergusson, Horwood, and Ridder (2005) and Kuh and Wadsworth (1991) were the only ones
that had to be corrected for dichotomization.<component x="41.16" y="230.92"

every sample, included in a particular analysis, is reasonably homogenous in terms of
the moderator variables (i.e., all the individuals in the sample should be of
approximately the same age and studied at the same time). To achieve that, I excluded
a study from a moderator analysis if the range of the moderator variable in question
exceeded 10 years. It should be noted, however, that the majority of the samples that
provided data on intelligence were rather homogenous in terms of all the moderator
variables because longitudinal surveys typically concentrate on a specific cohort.

strength of the relationship between predictors and success, three averages were
calculated: a simple average correlation, a sample size weighted average correlation,
and a sample size weighted average correlation corrected for unreliability and
dichotomization in the correlated variables. The latter constitutes the central
meta-analytic result of the present paper. Other averages can be used for comparison
to see how much the results are affected by weighting and correcting the original
correlations. Because the sample sizes were highly variable (from 60 to 339,951 with
a median of 518), weighting the correlations by sample size would allow the few very
large studies to overly dominate the results. To prevent that, all the samples with
the size over 7000 individuals (about 5% of the samples in this study) were set equal
to 7000 for the weighting procedure. In order to estimate the variability of the
correlations, the standard deviation of original correlations and corrected standard
deviation of corrected correlations (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 126) were
calculated. The 95% credibility intervals of sample size weighted corrected
correlations were calculated to assess the presence of moderators. Moderators are
present if the credibility intervals are large (over 0.11 according to Koslowsky
&amp; Sagie, 1993) or include zero (see Whitener, 1990). Finally, 95% confidence
intervals of the sample size weighted corrected correlations were calculated using
the formula for heterogeneous studies (Whitener, 1990: 317). Confidence intervals can
be used to assess the significance of the correlations (correlation is significantly
different from zero if the confidence intervals do not include zero) as well as to
compare correlations (according to a simple and conservative rule of thumb, two
correlations are significantly different from one another if their confidence
intervals do not intersect).<component x="286.24" y="51.61" width="221.2"

with income the weakest one. The first row in every section of Table 1 presents the
general results for intelligence as a predictor of success. "" The phrase all studies
in parentheses indicates that all the studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria
are included in these analyses. As expected, intelligence is positively correlated
with education, occupation, and income; the sample size weighted and corrected
correlations ( p) are .56, .43, and .20, respectively. The fact that the 95%
credibility intervals exceed 0.11 suggests the presence of moderators according to
Koslowsky and Sagie (1993). Comparing the three averages (r, rw, and p) in every row
to one another demonstrates that weighting the correlations by sample size tends to
reduce the average. This means that larger studies produced smaller correlations
indicating in turn that smaller, and potentially less representative,

between intelligence and success. The results, just described, can be criticized for
including several samples that are somewhat inappropriate for studying the causal
influence of intelligence on success. In some studies, most of the individuals were
already in their early twenties at the time the IQ test was taken. It is possible
that many individuals in these samples had already started a career by that time,
which makes the direction of influence between intelligence and career success rather
ambiguous. Furthermore, in several studies the individuals were still in their
twenties at the time their career success was measured. It seems reasonable to
assume, however, that individuals under 30 cannot yet be reliably classified as more
successful or less successful. Taking these observations into account, the second row
in every section of Table 1, con" " taining the phrase best studies in parentheses,
includes only samples with the average age of less than 19 at testing and over 29 at
the measurement of success. If raw data were used, then the individuals of
inappropriate age were simply excluded. " " Looking at the best studies , we can
observe the corrected sample size weighted correlations of .56, .45, and .23 between
intelligence and education, occupation, and income, respectively. These correlations
can be treated as the most appropriate estimates of the relationship between
intelligence and socioeconomic success. The " " averages of the best studies are
somewhat higher than " " the averages of all studies indicating that the inclusion of
the less appropriate samples among the latter lowers the meta-analytic results. It is
surprising how much the " " number of samples (k) included among the best studies " "
- differs from the number of all studies almost two thirds of the correlations with
education had to be " " excluded for the analysis of the best studies . It shows that
much of the research on intelligence and success is being conducted with samples that
are either too old at the time of testing or too young at the measurement of success.
Having characterized the predictive power of intelligence in general, the next step
is to compare it to the predictive power of parental SES and academic performance.
Table 1 presents the meta-analytic results for the five indicators of parental SES
(father's education, mother's education, father's occupation, parental income, and
the SES index). Not surprisingly, all the correlations are positive but, judging by
the confidence intervals, several of the correlations (e.g., the one between father's
education and education, p = .50, or father's occupation and occupation, p= .35) are
significantly smaller than the respective correlations for intelligence. On the other
hand, none of the parental variables is a significantly stronger predictor than
intelligence. The SES index is the most successful predictor among the parental
variables by not being a significantly weaker predictor than intelligence for any of
the measures 9 of success.<component x="281.93" y="51.61" width="221.29"

useful strategy for comparing the predictive power of two variables would be to look
at the samples that provide information on both predictors and then make comparisons
within each sample. The advantage of such within-sample comparisons would be the
elimination of between-study methodological differences. I used this strategy to
compare the correlations with intelligence and SES index (arguably the best measure
of social background). The significance of the difference between the correlations
was tested with the formula for comparing dependent correlations (Meng, Rosenthal,
&amp; Rubin, 1992: 173). With education as the measure of success, there were 15
samples that provided correlations with both IQ and SES index; in 11 of these
samples, the b correlations were significantly different (p .05, 2-tailed); 8 of the
significant differences were in favor of IQ. With occupation as the measure of
success, 14 comparisons were made; 7 of the differences were significant, all in
favor of IQ. With income as the measure of success, 12 comparisons were made; 5 were
significant, 2 of them in favor of IQ. These results suggest that there seems to be
an overall tendency for IQ to be a better predictor but this tendency is not
consistently found in every occasion.<component x="41.16" y="52.03" width="221.25"

influence of moderator variables, the analysis of subgroups was performed. The
moderator variables were divided into - - the following categories: age at testing
into 1 10, 11 - - - - 15, 16 18, 19 25; age at success into 20 24, 25 29, - - - - 30
34, 35 39, 40 44, 45 49, and over 49; and the - - year of success into pre-1960, 1960
1969, 1970 - 1979, 1980 1989, post-1989. The raw data sets were exploited to the full
extent by dividing the samples into appropriate subgroups by age or year. Every
sample contributed only one correlation to a moderator category. If a sample could
contribute more than one correlation, then the most appropriate of the available
correlations (the one that best fitted into the moderator category) was used. Equally
appropriate correlations were averaged. Table 2 presents the results of the moderator
analysis. The table is divided into three sections with every section presenting the
results for one moderator variable. In the first section of Table 2, age at testing
(i.e., mean age of the sample at the time of ability testing) is used as a moderator
variable. The youngest sample in this analysis was, on average, 3 years old at the
time of testing, the oldest one was 23 years old. The results of the analysis are
quite clear-cut with regard to education and occupation as measures of success: the
correlations increase as age at testing increases. The correlation between
intelligence and income does not exhibit any obvious trend but even here the largest
correlation comes from the oldest group. In the next section of Table 2, the
moderator variable is age at success (i.e., the mean age of the sample at the time of
the measurement of socioeconomic success). Age at success ranges from 20 to 78 in the
present study. The results are rather different<component x="286.24" y="51.61"

success. The correlation between intelligence and education remains more or less
stable. The correlation between intelligence and occupation takes a noticeable upward
leap during the - - twenties from .35 in the 20 24 group to the .44 in - - the 25 29
group and then levels off. The correlation between intelligence and income undergoes
the most dramatic changes: the correlation is - barely above zero in the 20 24 group
but jumps to - the value of .20 in the 25 29 group, and then takes - another jump to
the value of .27 in the 30 34 group; after the age of 40, the correlation appears to
decline again but not as low as the values it had before the age of 30. The influence
of the third moderator variable, year of success (i.e., year of the measurement of
success), is analyzed in the third section of Table 2. Year of success ranges from
1929 to 2003 in the present meta-analysis. Judging by the sample size weighted
corrected correlations ( p), there appears to be no historical trend for any one of
the moderator variables: correlations with education and occupation remain more or
less stable throughout the period under study; correlations with income fluctuate
more but without any obvious direction. Quite surprisingly, if unweighted and
uncorrected correlations ( r) are observed instead, then the correlations with
education and occupation exhibit a declining trend. 6.4. Moderator analysis using
multiple regression Moderator analyses in the previous section can be criticized for
ignoring the fact that the moderator variables might not be completely independent of
each other, which makes it possible to claim that some of the results can be
explained by the intercorrelations among the moderator variables (Steel &amp;
KammeyerMueller, 2002). In order to take account of this possibility, I conducted
multiple linear regression analyses using the moderator variables as independent
variables and the correlations between intelligence and measures of success as
dependent variables. Such meta-regression analysis is a common meta-analytic tool
(see Ganzeboom et al., 1989; Robbins et al., 2004). The analyses that follow differ
from the preceding moderator analyses in an important respect: in order to use all
the available information, I gave up the requirement of independent data and included
all the available correlations. If mental ability or socioeconomic success was
measured repeatedly for the same sample, then all the correlations were included
making it possible for one sample to contribute more than one 10 correlation to the
analysis. Naturally, this strategy results in some samples providing much more
correlations than others. In order to control for the effects of overrepresented
samples, I constructed dummy variables for all the data sets that contributed more
than 2 correlations from the same sample to a given moderator analysis. The dummy
variables were inserted into regression models as independent variables. In some raw
data sets that were large enough, the sample was broken down into smaller samples.
For example, the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women was divided into three
subsamples according to the age at - - -- the start of the survey the 14 17, 18 20,
and 21 - 24 year olds and these subsamples were then used as separate samples in the
regression analyses. This was done to obtain samples that are more homogenous

positive effect on the correlations with occupation and income and a weak negative
effect of the correlation with education. Year of success provides some surprises by
having a weak positive effect of the correlation with education and a strong negative
effect on the correlation with occupation. It is of interest that the U.S.A. dummy is
not significant in any of the regression models indicating that the effect of IQ in
the United States is similar to its effect in other western societies. The raw data
dummy has a highly significant negative effect on the correlation with education and
a barely significant positive effect on the correlation with occupation. Therefore,
it seems that the inclusion of raw data is more likely to introduce a downward
(rather than upward) bias into the meta-analysis thus making the results

of socioeconomic success Intelligence plays an influential and yet controversial role
in people's career (Gottfredson, 1997). In order to investigate this role, the
relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success was analyzed using
meta-analytic techniques. The first aim of the paper was to estimate the strength of
this relationship. The overall correlations were .56 (between intelligence and
education), .43 (between intelligence and occupation), and .20 (between intelligence
and income). Exclusion of the samples that were too old (over 18) at the time of
testing or too young (below 30) at the measurement of success resulted in somewhat
larger correlations: .56, .45, and .23, respectively. These results demonstrate that
intelligence, when it is measured before most individuals have finished their
schooling, is a powerful predictor of career success 12 or more years later when most
individuals have already entered stable careers. Two - - of the correlations with
education and occupation are of substantial magnitude according to the usual
standards of social science (Cohen, 1988); the correlation with education even
surpasses the wellestablished correlation of .51 between intelligence and job
performance (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998). The correlation with income is considerably
lower, perhaps even disappointingly low, being about the average of the previous
meta-analytic estimates (.15 by Bowles et al., 2001; and .27 by Ng et al., 2005). But
it should be noted that other predictors, studied in this paper, are not doing any
better in predicting income, which demonstrates that financial success is difficult
to predict by any variable. This claim is further corroborated by the meta-analysis
of Ng et al. (2005) where the best predictor of salary was educational level with a
correlation of only .29. It should also be noted that the correlation of .23 is about
the size of the average meta-analytic result in psychology (Hemphill, 2003) and
cannot, therefore, be treated as insignificant. The second aim of the meta-analysis
was to compare the predictive power of intelligence to the predictive power of other
prominent predictors of success, parental SES and academic performance. Such
comparisons are informative because different predictors represent different paths to
a successful career: intelligence represents one's general ability, parental SES
represents the social advantages or disadvantages experienced by a person, and
academic performance represents school-related learning and motivation. Meta-analysis
demonstrated that parental SES and academic performance are indeed positively related
to career success but the predictive power of these variables is not stronger than
that of intelligence (see Table 1). In fact, intelligence exhibited several
correlations with the measures of success that were larger than the respective
correlations for other predictors suggesting that intelligence is, after all, a
better predictor of success. Still, the differences in favor of intelligence were not
as overwhelming as one would have expected based on the results of Herrnstein and
Murray (1994). The index of parental SES, arguably the most representative measure of
social background, did not differ significantly from intelligence in its predictive
power (see Table 1). The same is true about the predictive power of academic
performance in relation to education and occupation. It has been observed before that
meta-analyses typically do not provide support for extreme scientific positions
(Lytton &amp; Romney, 1991). This is also true in the present case because the
extreme positions favoring intelligence (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) or parental
SES (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976) were not supported by the results. The reasonable
conclusion is rather modest: while intelligence is one of the central determinants of
one's socioeconomic success, parental SES and academic performance also play an
important role in the process of status attainment. Despite the modest conclusion,
these results are important because they falsify a claim often made by the critics of
the " " testing movement : that the positive relationship between intelligence and
success is just the effect of parental SES or academic performance influencing them
both (see Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; Fischer et al., 1996; McClelland, 1973). If the
correlation between intelligence and success was a mere byproduct of the causal
effect of parental SES or academic performance, then parental SES and academic
performance should have outcompeted intelligence as predictors of success; but this
was clearly not so. These results confirm that intelligence is an independent causal
force among the determinants of success; in other words, the fact that intelligent
people are successful is not completely explainable by the fact that intelligent
people have wealthy parents and are doing better at school. A number of moderator
analyses of the intelli- gence success correlation were also performed with the aim
of further clarifying the relationship between intelligence and success. The effects
of three moder- ator variables age at testing, age at success, and year - of success
were analyzed. With regard to age at testing, the results in Tables 2 and 3 clearly
demonstrate that the test scores of older individuals are better predictors of
success than the scores of younger individuals. As discussed in Section 4.3.1, there
are two conflicting explanations for this result. On the one hand, if we assume that
the test scores of " " older individuals are more contaminated by experiences, then
this result suggests that experiences make a contribution to the correlation between
intelligence and success. But on the other hand, if we assume that " the test scores
of older individuals are more contam" inated by genetic influences, then it would
mean that genes make a contribution to this correlation. Yet another explanation
would be that IQ scores of children are simply less reliable and the predictive
validity of childhood IQ was, therefore, underestimated. But contrary to this
explanation, preliminary examination of some evidence on the stability of
intelligence among children (e.g., Burchinal, Campbell, Bryant, Wasik, &amp; Ramey,
1997; Jensen, 1980: - 279) suggested that the test retest coefficients among children
below 10 are, on the whole, rather similar to - the test retest coefficients among
older individuals. It appears that the age-related changes in the predictive validity
of test scores cannot be explained by differential reliability of the scores.
Analyses of age at success in Tables 2 and 3 demonstrate that correlations with
occupation and income grow stronger as individuals grow older. This result confirms
the ideas of the gravitational hypothesis about intellectual differences cumulating
throughout life course leading people increasingly towards the social positions that
correspond to their ability (Gottfredson, 2003). The fact that declining validity
hypothesis (Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001) received no support for occupational and income
attainment indicates that being successful in these areas is a complex activity that
never ceases to be cognitively demanding. But as for educational attainment, the
negative impact of age at success on the IQeducation correlation in Table 3 provides
some support for the declining validity hypothesis and suggests that, in educational
career, intellectual differences might indeed become somewhat less important as
people get older. The difference between education and other measures of success can
be explained by the fact that climbing the educational ladder is, in a sense, easier
than climbing the occupational or financial ladder (because once you have acquired a
certain level of education, you can never loose it again, which is clearly not the
case with occupation or income). Year of the measurement of success had no obvious
effect on the corrected correlations ( p) between intelligence and success in Table
2. The meta-regression analysis in Table 3 showed that there is a slight tendency for
correlation between intelligence and education to increase over the years. This is
the only bit of evidence there is to support the claims of Herrnstein and Murray
(1994) about the growing importance of mental ability and increasing cognitive
stratification. This evidence is rather weak in comparison with the much stronger
declining trend exhibited by the correlation with occupation in Table 3. It would be
difficult to come up with explanations why intelligence might have become more
important with respect to one criterion and less important with respect to another.
Therefore, the safest conclusion from Tables 2 and 3 seems to be that the correlation
between intelligence and success has not changed in any consistent direction over the
past decades. It should be noted that the present paper analyzed changes in the
absolute importance of intelligence (measured by zero-order correlations); the
results so far discussed do not exclude the possibility of growing relative
importance of intelligence (i.e., importance relative to other predictors). However,
the analyses of Bowles et al. (2001) and Hauser and Huang (1997) found no evidence of
any trend in the relative importance. 7.2. Possible limitations and implications for
future research Like all research, the present meta-analysis contains several
limitations that can be amended in future research. One limitation concerns the
metaanalytic database. Although the present meta-analysis is, to my knowledge, the
most comprehensive review of the longitudinal research on intelligence and
socioeconomic success, it does not cover all the existing data. I am aware of several
additional longitudinal data sets that contain information on intelligence and
success but from which I have been unable to obtain necessary data (see J&#xE6;ger
&amp; Holm, 2003; Meghir &amp; Palme, 2005; Nyborg &amp; Jensen, 2001; Scarr &amp;
Weinberg, 1994). There are probably others. Efforts to collect information about the
existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from
outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the
present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany
or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an
Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other
scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been studied in continental Europe
(see e.g., Flynn, 1987; Sternberg, 2004; Weinert &amp; Schneider, 1999) but I have
not been able to find suitable data for the present study. The present study can also
be criticized for underestimating the importance of the predictors of success;
arguments can be offered for any of the three predictors (intelligence, parental SES,
or academic performance) as to why their importance was underestimated. First, the
present study used only three measures of social background (parental education,
occupation, and income) and therefore, could have underestimated its importance.
Although these three have always been the central indicators of social advantages,
several additional measures of social background could have an independent effect on
career success (Fischer et al., 1996). Future metaanalyses could, therefore, benefit
from considering other variables, such as neighborhood quality (Leventhal &amp;
Brooks-Gunn, 2000), number of siblings (Blake, 1989), or parental divorce (Amato
&amp; Keith, 1991), to get a more comprehensive picture of the effects of social
background. Second, the use of grade point average and class rank as the only
measures of academic performance can be criticized for ignoring between-school
differences; i.e., the same average grade or rank can have different meanings in
different schools depending on the quality of the schools (Bassiri &amp; Schulz,
2003). A more comprehensive study of the importance of academic performance should,
therefore, also take account of the quality of the school the individual is
attending. Third, as already discussed in Section 7.1, the predictive power of
intelligence in younger samples could have been underestimated by using a single -
test retest reliability coefficient for all studies that did not provide reliability
coefficients of their own. Although it was concluded above that the underestimation
was minimal, it would still be desirable to pay more attention to this problem in the
future research. As a possible limitation and implication for future research, it
should also be noted that one of the big questions that looms behind every paper that
deals with intelligence and success, the question of genetic versus environmental
influences on IQ and social status, was not directly addressed in this paper. The
fact that IQ scores predict socioeconomic success does not, in itself, tell us
whether the effect of intelligence can be attributed to genes or environment. On the
one hand, there is clear evidence that children's IQ scores are correlated with
parental SES (White, 1982), this result together with the fact that parental SES
predicts socioeconomic success (see Table 1) can be interpreted as showing that
envi"" ronment is the final cause of one's success or failure. This conclusion has
been criticized for ignoring the genetic influences on parental SES (Jensen, 1998).
On the other hand, the evidence on the heritability of intelligence (Devlin, Daniels,
&amp; Roeder, 1997) and socioeconomic success (Rowe, Vesterdal, &amp; Rodgers, 1999)
together with the evidence on the relationship between intelligence and success (see
Table 1) can be taken as proof that parents' and children's social status are both
determined by the genes for intelligence that run in the family. This conclusion has
been challenged by Bowles and Gintis (2002) who argued that, although socioeconomic
success might be heritable, the genetic inheritance of IQ, in particular, plays only
a very minor part in this process. The results of the present meta-analysis, although
not directly addressing these issues, can be useful in these discussions if combined
with the results from other studies.<component x="36.85" y="350.49" width="221.16"

intelligence and socioeconomic success has been the source of numerous controversies.
The present paper conducted a meta-analysis of the longitudinal studies that have
investigated intelligence as a predictor of success (as measured by education,
occupation, and income). In order to better evaluate the predictive power of
intelligence, the paper also includes metaanalyses of parental socioeconomic status
(SES) and academic performance (school grades) as predictors of success. The results
demonstrate that intelligence is a powerful predictor of success but, on the whole,
not an overwhelmingly better predictor than parental SES or grades. Moderator
analyses showed that the relationship between intelligence and success is dependent
on the age of the sample but there is little evidence of any historical trend in the
relationship. &#xA9; 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<component x="36.85"

mental abilities have demonstrated that the scores of intelligence tests are
positively correlated with several desirable outcomes and negatively correlated with
several undesirable outcomes. One of the central and personally most relevant
desirable outcomes is socioeconomic success (or career success), which is usually
measured by the educational level, occupational prestige, and income of an individual
in adulthood. Although it is sometimes claimed in popular press and textbooks that
intelligence has no relationship to important real-life outcomes (see Barrett &amp;
Depinet, 1991, for a review of such claims), the scientific research on the topic
leaves little doubt that people with higher scores on IQ tests are better educated,
hold more prestigious occupations, and earn higher incomes than people with lower
scores (Gottfredson, 1997, 2003; Jensen, 1980, 1998; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004).
Thus, the existence of an overall positive correlation between intelligence and
socioeconomic success is beyond doubt. But quite surprisingly, the mere existence of
this correlation seems to be the only fact that is established beyond doubt after
many decades of research. Several major questions are still without definite answers
and continue to arouse heated debates (the debate about The Bell Curve being a
prominent example in recent decades; see Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Fischer et
al., 1996). First, what is the approximate size of the correlation between
intelligence and success? Is it large enough to be of any practical importance? While
some researchers have " said that this correlation is larger than most found in "
psychological research (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004: " 162), others are convinced that
IQ is just not an " important enough determinant of economic success (Bowles &amp;
Gintis, 2002: 12). Second, how does the predictive power of intelligence compare to
the predictive power of other variables, such as parental socioeconomic status (SES)
or school grades? On the " one hand there are studies showing that individual ability
is by far the strongest influence on occupa" tional achievement (Bond &amp; Saunders,
1999: 217). " And yet other studies conclude that the effect of socioeconomic
background on each of the three adult - status variables schooling, income, and
occupa- tional status is greater than the effect of childhood " IQ (Bowles &amp;
Nelson, 1974: 44). Third, are there any age-related or historical changes in the
relationship between intelligence and success? The question of historical changes in
the importance of IQ has been particularly controversial with some authors warning
against increasing cognitive stratification (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) and
others trying to disprove these claims (Hauser &amp; Huang, 1997). The present paper
will address these questions by conducting a meta-analysis of the longitudinal
research on the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. I will
concentrate on longitudinal studies (where intelligence is measured before the actual
success) because only longitudinal research design allows us to make conclusions
about the possible causal impact of intelligence on success.<component x="41.16"

lateness="0.14285714285714285" reference_score="7.53">Longitudinal studies on the
relationship between intelligence and career success have been conducted since the
first decades of the 20th century (Ball, 1938; Thorndike et al., 1934). And these
studies have invariably uncovered a positive relationship. The early studies,
however, did not consider other possible determinants of success, most importantly
parental SES. Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive
relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of
parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At
the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm,
investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement
that considered several determinants of success at the same time (Duncan, 1968;
Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp; Ohlendorf, 1970). But it was with the
publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the
question of intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to public attention.
Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein
and Murray found that intelligence is a better predictor of several desirable
outcomes (e.g., not living in poverty, not being arrested) than is parental SES. They
also found evidence that the role of intelligence in status attainment has been
growing throughout the 20th century and concluded that the social structure of
American society is increasingly based on mental ability. The ideas of The Bell Curve
have been severely criticized for a number of reasons. Fischer et al. (1996) argued
that Herrnstein and Murray used an inappropriate measure of parental SES and,
therefore, underestimated its importance. Hauser and Huang (1997) argued that the
claim about the growing importance of intelligence is simply a misinterpretation of
previous research. Other researchers have, however, supported the ideas of The Bell
Curve (Gottfredson, 2003; Jensen, 1998) saying that its central claims have been
convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459). At the same time in Great Britain, a
similar discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who, analyzing a
representative longitudinal data set from Great Britain, found that intelligence is a
better predictor of occupational attainment than is parental SES and concluded that
England is, to a large extent, a meritocratic society (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999;
Saunders, 1997, 2002). These conclusions were challenged by Breen and Goldthorpe
(1999, 2001) who argued that Saunders greatly overestimated the importance of
intelligence by using inappropriate analytic techniques.<component x="36.85"

lateness="0.19047619047619047" reference_score="6.09">There have been surprisingly
few attempts to systematically review the literature on intelligence and
socioeconomic success. Reviewers typically cite only a couple of studies (see e.g.,
Brody, 1997; Farkas, 2003; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Some of the most
comprehensive reviews have been conducted by Jencks (see Jencks et al., 1972, 1979).
Two meta-analyses have so far addressed the relationship between intelligence and
socioeconomic success. Both of them used income as a measure of success. The more
comprehensive one of the two was conducted by Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001).
They assembled 65 estimates from 24 studies to estimate the relationship between
intelligence and income. The mean standardized regression coefficient of intelligence
on income is .15 according to their study (p. 1154). In addition to that, Bowles et
al. (2001) reported that there is no time trend in the size of the coefficients
between the years 1960 and 1995 and that the age of the sample at the time of ability
testing has no effect on the results. The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. is a
valuable contribution but it suffers from several shortcomings. First, it considered
only one measure of success, income, thereby ignoring education and occupation.
Second, the meta-analytic estimate of .15 was not derived from zero-order
correlations as is usually required by the textbooks of meta-analysis (see Hunter
&amp; Schmidt, 2004: 475) but from regression equations that included several
predictors in addition to intelligence. Peterson and Brown (2005) have recently
suggested that the use of partial effect sizes, instead of zero-order ones, does not
affect the meta-analytic results very much but it is nevertheless obvious that the
use of disparate studies makes the results difficult to interpret. Third, the
metaanalysis of Bowles et al. was not based on independent samples. The authors
stated that they used 65 estimates from 24 studies (p. 1154) but neither of these
figures represents the number of independent samples. Inspection of the appendix (not
published but available from the authors) leaves no doubt that some samples
contributed more than one coefficient to the final meta-analytic estimate thereby
ignoring the requirement of independent data (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004, chapter
10). Fourth, their meta-analysis mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The
distinction between cross-sectional and longitudinal study design is vital in the
present context because only the latter can answer questions about the causal impact
of intelligence on career success. Another, more recent, meta-analysis was conducted
by Ng, Eby, Sorensen, and Feldman (2005) who collected 8 studies and found an average
correlation of .27 between intelligence and salary. The meta-analysis of Ng et al.
(2005) was, unlike the one by Bowles et al., based on zero-order correlations and
avoided the use of non-independent samples but it failed to separate crosssectional
and longitudinal studies.<component x="281.93" y="51.61" width="221.16"

importance of a predictor in isolation; it would be informative to compare the
predictive power of intelligence to the predictive power of other relevant predictors
of socioeconomic success. This paper will, therefore, analyze two additional
predictors -parental SES (e.g., father's occupation) - and academic performance
(e.g., school grades) with the aim to determine if intelligence is a better predictor
of success than the other two variables. Parental SES and academic performance have
often been treated as " " the main competitors of intelligence in predicting career
success because, as explained shortly, they represent different views about a typical
path to success. Including them in this paper will, consequently, allow us to better
evaluate the role of intelligence in people's career. 4.2.1. Intelligence versus
parental SES The question about the relative importance of intelligence and parental
SES in predicting success is one of the central questions of status attainment
research. This is a question about the nature of the society we live in: whether a
typical western society rewards people for their own abilities or their social
background (Saunders, 1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a definite
answer to this question. Some authors have found that intelligence outcompetes
parental SES as a predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998; Saunders,
1997). Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a
better predictor (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly
greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to
correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles &amp; Nelson,
1974) and the failure to include important aspects of parental status (most
importantly, parental income) among the predictors (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974;
Fischer et al., 1996). Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation between
intelligence and success with the correlation between parental SES and success. To
accomplish that, the present paper will include a meta-analysis of the relationship
between the different aspects of parental SES (parental education, occupation, and
income) and socioeconomic success. Research on this relationship is, of course,
voluminous and several narrative and quantitative reviews of it are available (see
Ganzeboom, Luijkx, &amp; Treiman, 1989; Haveman &amp; Wolf, 1995; Mulligan, 1999).
Ganzeboom et al. (1989), for instance, gathered 149 studies from 35 countries to
analyze the association between father's occupation and son's occupation, and
concluded that the association is stronger in non-industrialized societies and has
been weakening during the 20th century. But none of these reviews has presented the
results in a manner that would make them 1 directly usable in this paper, hence the
need for a separate meta-analysis. 4.2.2. Intelligence versus academic performance
The question about the relative importance of mental ability and academic performance
in predicting success has also been recognized as important (see Jencks &amp;
Phillips, 1999). It is a question of what really matters for career success: is it
one's general ability (as measured by IQ tests) or the things one has learned at
school and motivation to learn (as measured by school grades)? Not many studies have
explicitly compared the predictive power of IQ scores and school grades (e.g.,
Taubman &amp; Wales, 1974, chapter 3). But the more general question about the
usefulness of grades as predictors of success has been the object of considerable
debate (see Roth, BeVier, Switzer, &amp; Schippmann, 1996; Roth &amp; Clark, 1998).
The meta-analysis by Roth and Clark (1998), for instance, found an average
correlation of .28 between grades and salary. Thus, contrary to some earlier claims
(e.g., McClelland, 1973), grades have turned out to be good predictors of success.
This literature is somewhat limited by being almost exclusively restricted to college
grades. If the purpose is to compare grades and IQ test scores as predictors of
career success, then high school grades would be a better choice because college
students constitute a rather selected group that does not represent the full range of
career attainments in society. High school grades have been meta-analytically related
to job performance (Dye &amp; Reck, 1988) and college grades (Robbins et al., 2004)
but there is currently no meta-analysis about the relationship between high school
grades and general socioeconomic success (as measured by education, occupation, and
income). The present paper will, thus, conduct such a meta-analysis. 4.3. Moderators
of the correlation between intelligence and success In order to further clarify the
role of intelligence in people's career, the effects of three moderator variables
(age at testing, age at success, and year of success) on - intelligence success
correlation will be studied. These moderator variables have been analyzed in several
studies but with rather conflicting results. 4.3.1. Age at the time of testing The
first moderator analysis concerns age at testing (age of individuals at the time the
IQ test was taken) and how it affects the correlation between intelligence and
success. Analysis of the effect of age at testing reveals something about the
mechanism behind the - intelligence success correlation. If intelligence predicts
success irrespective of the age at which it is measured, then there is reason to
believe that the differences in people's career success are the result of the stable
individual differences measured by IQ tests (Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1999). If
however, the predictive power of IQ tests changes with age, then different
interpretations are possible depending on how we believe the test score to be
affected by genes and environment. According to the standard sociological
interpretation, the test scores of older individuals should be more affected by life
experiences than the scores of children (because older individuals simply have had
more experiences) and consequently, if intelligence tested at an older age should
turn out to be a better predictor career success, then it would mean that the test
scores probably reflect some career-relevant experiences which the older individuals
have had more time to accumulate (Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1999). The other
interpretation is based on behavior genetic research which has found that genetic
influences on IQ scores increase with age and environmental influences decrease
(McCartney, Harris, &amp; Bernieri, 1990); from these results one can conclude that
if the test scores of older individuals are better predictors of success, then it can
be attributed to the growing effect of some 2 career-relevant genes. Empirical
evidence concerning age at testing is rather contradictory. A study by McCall (1977)
found a clear upward trend in the correlations between intelligence and success; that
is, correlations grew stronger as age at testing increased. Some of the studies
reviewed by Jencks and Phillips (1999) have found a similar trend. The meta-analysis
of Bowles et al. (2001), however, found that age at testing has no effect on the
association between intelligence and income. Jencks et al. (1979) reached a similar
conclusion in their review. 4.3.2. Age at the measurement of success A related issue
concerns the age of the individuals at the time their career success is measured.
According to the so-called gravitational hypothesis, the correlation between
intelligence and success should grow stronger as individuals grow older because (as a
result of self" " selection and competition) individuals gravitate towards the
positions that correspond to their ability levels as they progress in their careers.
This reasoning has been used to support the idea that intellectual differences
cumulate over life course and become progressively more important (see Gottfredson,
2003; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996). Other researchers have suggested that exactly the
opposite is true: the predictive validity of IQ scores should decline as time goes by
because less able people have time to accumulate skills to compensate for their
initial lack of ability (Ackerman, 1987; Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001). These opposing
views can be reconciled by saying that the idea of declining importance of IQ applies
to the performance of specific tasks that become automatic after some practice and
the idea of growing importance applies complex long term activities, such as
attaining and maintaining social status, that never cease to be cognitively
demanding. But so far as socioeconomic success can depend on the performance of
specific work tasks, the possibility of declining validity of IQ is not completely
ruled out. Several studies have correlated intelligence with success at different
points in people's life course. Some of them have found that the correlations indeed
increase with age as predicted by the gravitational hypothesis (Brown &amp; Reynolds,
1975; Deary et al., 2005; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996), others have found no clear trend
(Hauser, Warren, Huang, &amp; Carter, 1996; Warren, Sheridan, &amp; Hauser, 2002).
The reviews by Hulin, Henry, and Noon (1990) and Keil and Cortina (2001) found
support for the declining validity thesis but it should be noted that many of the
studies reviewed in these papers used specific laboratory tasks as dependent
variables and are, therefore, not directly comparable to the studies reviewed in the
present paper. 4.3.3. Year of the measurement of success A particularly controversial
issue concerns the historical changes in the relationship between intelligence and
success. It was one of the central claims of The Bell Curve that the association
between mental ability and career success in western societies has been growing
throughout the 20th century (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, - 1994). The logic behind this
idea is similar to the gravitational hypothesis, discussed in the previous section in
both cases individuals are increasingly drawn towards the positions that correspond
to their ability as time goes - by but in this case the gravitation does not take
place during a life course of a single individual but over several generations.
Several studies have investigated changes in the association between intelligence and
success during past decades. Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded " " that the
main point seems beyond dispute (1994: 52) and some studies have found support for
this point (Murnane, Willett, &amp; Levy, 1995), there are still serious reasons to
doubt that the importance of intelligence is or has been growing. Neither the
meta-analysis by Bowles et al. (2001) nor the review by Jencks et al. (1979) found
any clear trend in the correlations between intelligence and success. The same
conclusion was reached by Flynn (2004) and Hauser and Huang (1997). Breen and
Goldthorpe (2001) found that the association between intelligence and occupational
status in England is, if anything, declining.<component x="286.24" y="458.1"

investigated the relationship between three measures of socioeconomic success
(educational level, occupational level, and income) and three predictors
(intelligence, parental SES, and academic performance). The operationalization of
these variables is described next. 5.1.1. Socioeconomic success Educational level was
measured by the number of years spent in full time education or the highest level of
education completed. Occupational level was typically measured by such occupational
scales as Duncan Socioeconomic Index, International Socioeconomic Index of
Occupational Status, NORC prestige scale, etc. These scales provide detailed
numerical measures of occupational status (see Ganzeboom &amp; Treiman, 1996a, for a
general discussion). In some studies, less detailed occupational classifications were
used. Irrespective of the level of detail, all the occupational variables in this
paper had a common property of ordering occupations on a single hierarchical
dimension with higher values designating more desirable and prestigious occupations.
Income was measured by salary or total monetary income, which had to refer to the
personal income of an individual, not to family or household income. If possible, I
preferred income measured on a logarithmic scale because logarithmic transformation
removes the skew typically found in income distribution. 5.1.2. Intelligence
Intelligence, or general mental ability, of an individual was measured by a score on
a test of intelligence. It is not always easy, however, to decide if a given test is
a test of intelligence. The definitions of intelligence state that it is an abstract
ability that is not tied to any specific domain of knowledge. Therefore, only the
tests that are designed to measure such ability should be used in the meta-analysis.
If we take the traditional threefold distinction between ability, aptitude, and
achievement tests (Jensen, 1981), then the present study should use only ability and
aptitude test scores. Although some researchers have contended that achievement tests
can also be treated as measures of general ability (Boudreau, Boswell, Judge, &amp;
Bretz, 2001), and even everyday life can be interpreted as an IQ test (Gordon, 1997),
the present study took a more conservative approach and included only those tests
that are generally regarded as tests of intelligence (see e.g., Anastasi &amp;
Urbina, 1997; Jensen, 1980, chapter 7, for a discussion and classification of
different tests). " " - There are numerous classical tests (e.g., Henmon - - Nelson,
Lorge Thorndike, Otis Lennon, Raven Prog- ressive Matrices, Stanford Binet, Wechsler
tests) for which there seems to be a general consensus that these are indeed tests of
general mental ability. Such multiple aptitude test batteries as Armed Services
Vocational Aptitude Battery or General Aptitude Test Battery are also often treated
as measures of general ability. The most problematic ones are the tests that are
specifically constructed for use in a single data set. Such unique tests have been
used in several large and influential data sets (e.g., National Child Development
Study, National Longitudinal Survey of High School Class 1972, Panel Study of Income
Dynamics, Project Talent). In these cases I consulted the manuals of the data sets
and studies that are based on the data. If the test was derived from other IQ tests
or if it was described as a test of intelligence, then I included it in my study.
Studies using well-known achievement tests, such as Iowa Test of Basic Skills
(Smokowski, Mann, Reynolds, &amp; Fraser, 2004), were excluded. The names of all the
IQ tests used in this paper are listed in the Appendix. 5.1.3. Parental SES Five
measures of parental socioeconomic status (SES) were used in this paper; the first
four were father's education, mother's education, father's occupation, and parental
income. The measurement of these variables was similar to the measurement of
respondent's own education, occupation, and income (see above). Parental income
refers to father's income or total income of parents. Because too few studies
reported data on mother's occupation, this variable was not included. In addition to
these four, I also used a general index of SES, which combines several parental
characteristics into one variable. A number of studies have used a composite index on
the assumption that it is a better indicator of social advantages than any of the
single variables that make up the index and, therefore, also a better predictor of
success (see White, 1982, for supporting evidence). A correlation with SES index was
included in the present metaanalysis if the index was composed of the following
components -parental education (education of one or both parents), parental
occupation (occupation of one or both parents), and material well-being of the
parental home. The latter was measured by parental " " income or by a possession
index which indicates how many of the valued items (e.g., a car, TV set, computer)
were present at home. If a study did not use an index of SES but presented
intercorrelations among the necessary variables, then I used the formulas reported by
Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 433) to calculate a composite score correlation between SES
index and success. 5.1.4. Academic performance Academic performance was in most
studies measured by a grade point average (GPA) obtained in high school or the years
preceding high school. In some studies, rank in class (i.e., how well the student
performed in comparison with other students in the class) was used instead of GPA.
Rank is generally used interchangeably with GPA (see Kuncel, Crede, &amp; Thomas,
2005), therefore, these studies were also included.<component x="286.24" y="302.65"

inclusion in the metaanalysis by searching computerized databases (such as " JSTOR,
PsycINFO) using terms like status attain" " ment , educational attainment "
"occupational attain" ment , " "socioeconomic achievement as keywords. Reference
sections of review papers were also searched. To be included in the meta-analysis,
the following general criteria had to be met. First, the measurement of the variables
had to correspond to the descriptions presented in Section 5.1. Second, the data had
to be longitudinal; that is, the predictors (intelligence, parental SES, and academic
performance) had to be measured at an earlier time and career success (education,
occupation, 3 and income) at a later time. Third, the interval between the
measurement of predictors and dependent variables had to be at least 3 years because
studies with shorter intervals would have very little advantage over crosssectional
studies. Fourth, the study had to report a zeroorder correlation between the
variables and another measure of association transformable into a zero-order
correlation. Fifth, majority of individuals in the sample had to be at least 20 years
old at the time the career success was measured because it makes little sense to talk
about the career success of individuals younger than 20. Sixth, majority of
individuals had to be less than 25 years old at the time the IQ test was taken
because, to properly investigate the effect of intelligence on career, intelligence
should be tested before the individuals start a career. Obviously, even individuals
tested in their early twenties might already have started a career, but since these
individuals can be used for comparison with younger individuals, they were included.
Information on parental SES and academic performance had to refer to the time the -
respondents were approximately 12 18 years old (the time these variables presumably
have their greatest impact on subsequent career). Seventh, the study had to be " "
conducted in a western society; that is, in the United States, Canada, Europe,
Australia, or New Zealand. Additional criteria are described in Section 5.4. It is
rather common for published studies not to report the information necessary for
meta-analysis (the lack of zero-order correlations is a typical problem). But
fortunately, the raw data of several well-known data sets (e.g., General Social
Survey, National Longitudinal Survey of Youth) are available for public use. Because
it would be a serious waste of information to leave these sources unused, I decided
to use the available raw data to calculate the correlations if none of the published
sources reported the necessary information or if the information in the published
source was deficient in some way (e.g., if the correlations were reported separately
for men and women but not for the complete<component x="281.93" y="51.6"

the studies had to actually include at least two waves of measurement because one of
the predictors, parental SES, can be measured retrospectively (by asking adult "
respondents questions like what was your father's occupation at the " time you were
16? ). It is important, however, that the information about father's occupation or
parental income obtained from adult respondents refers to parents' past (not current)
occupation or income. The latter requirement was not applied to parental education
because parents' education is unlikely to change while children grow up. In some
studies (e.g. Duncan &amp; Hodge, 1963), father's occupation " " was rather vaguely
referred to as father's usual occupation or " " longest occupation . These studies
were also included.<component x="41.16" y="52.03" width="221.25" height="118.5"

sets had been prepared for public use and contained all the necessary variables in a
ready-to-use form. In some cases, minor statistical procedures were implemented
before calculating the correlations (e.g., summing the standardized scores of
subtests to obtain the score of general intelligence; transforming the original
occupational variable into a more appropriate prestige scale using the methodological
tools provided by Ganzeboom and Treiman (1996b). The raw data sets used in this paper
are listed in the Appendix. Several longitudinal data sets contain data from more
than one follow up. Career success has been measured repeatedly for the same
individuals in these data sets (up to 20 times in some cases). In some data sets, the
predictors (intelligence, parental SES, or academic performance) have also been
measured repeatedly. In order to ascertain that every sample contributed only one
correlation to one analysis, I averaged all the correlations that were derived from
the same sample. If the sample sizes of the averaged correlations were different,
mean sample size was used. The procedures for moderator analyses are described in
Sections 6.3 and 6.4.<component x="286.24" y="398.29" width="221.25" height="272.11"

should be corrected with the reliability coefficients obtained from the same sample
as the correlation that needs to be corrected (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004, chapter
3). However, such reliability coefficients were available for only a small minority
of studies included in the present meta-analysis. The correlations from these studies
were corrected with these reliability coefficients. But for the majority of studies,
mean reliabilities (estimated from various sources, as described below) were used.
Each study was then corrected individually with the appropriate reliability
coefficient. The nature and sources of reliability information are described next.
5.3.1. Socioeconomic success Information on education, occupation, and income can be
obtained from three sources. The first source is institutional record (e.g., tax
records of income). Following the common practice, data from such objective sources
were assumed to have a reliability of 1. The second and by far the most common source
is self-report. Self-reports are not perfectly reliable, however. The amount of error
is usually measured by asking the same individuals to report their socioeconomic
characteristics again after a few months and then correlating the - first and second
reports (producing a test retest correlation). Several estimates of these
correlations, derived from nationally representative samples, are available. Using
the data presented by Bowles (1972) - and Jencks et al. (1979), I calculated the
average test retest correlations for educational level (.89), occupational status
(.88), and income (.83). These values were used to correct the correlations with
self-reported socioeconomic success. The third possibility is to obtain the
information from the spouse, parent, sibling, or child of the focal individual.
Because these sources would introduce unnecessary complications and an unknown degree
of error, the studies using these sources were excluded unless they contained
correlations between intelligence 4 and success (these correlations are too valuable
to be discarded). 5.3.2. Intelligence When correcting for unreliability in the test
scores, - test retest alternate-form reliability (the correlation between parallel
forms of the same test administered on two separate occasions) is generally
considered to be the most appropriate form of reliability (Schmidt &amp; Hunter,
1999). But since these coefficients are rarely - available, simple test retest
reliability is often taken as the second best option in meta-analytic studies of the
predictive power of IQ scores (Judge, Colbert, &amp; Ilies, 2004; Salgado, Anderson,
Moscoso, Bertua, &amp; Fruyt, - 2003). Because test retest reliability coefficients
were - reported in only a few studies, an average test retest coefficient, obtained
from the meta-analysis of Salgado et al. (2003), was used for most of the studies.
Salgado - et al. averaged 31 test retest correlations of different general mental
ability tests (the mean interval between test and retest being 6 months) and obtained
an average - coefficient of .83. This value is similar to average test retest
correlations obtained in other reviews: e.g., .82 in Parker, Hanson, and Hunsley
(1988) or .85 in Kuncel, Hezlett, and Ones (2004). Thus, the reliability of .83 seems
to be a representative estimate and was used in the present study. 5.3.3. Parental
SES The information on parental education, occupation, and income can come from three
sources. First, it can be reported by the parents themselves. If this was the case,
then the correlations were corrected with the same reliability coefficients that were
used for selfreported education, occupation, and income. Second, it can be reported
by the children. Children's reports on parental characteristics are known to suffer
from considerable error. Probably the best estimate of this error is the correlation
between child's report and parent's own report on a given characteristic. Looker
(1989) has presented a comprehensive review of these correlations for father's
education, mother's education, and father's occupation. Using the information in
Table 3 in Looker's paper, I calculated the average correlations between child's
report and parent's report. The average correlations are .80 for father's education,
.79 for mother's education, and .78 for father's occupation. These values were used
to correct the correlations that 5 involved children's reports on parental SES.
Information on the reliability of children's reports on parental income is harder to
find. I could locate two studies (Bell, Senese, &amp; Elliott, 1984; Massagli &amp;
Hauser, 1983) that provided reliability estimates from three samples. The estimates
ranged from .45 to .59. with an average of .51 that was used in the present paper.
The third source of information on parental SES is objective data (e.g., tax records
of income) that was assumed to have a reliability of 1. Internal consistency method
(Cronbach alpha) was used to correct for unreliability in the SES index. This method
was recommended by Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 438) for composite variables. For all
but two studies, the alpha value of the SES index was obtained from the same sample
as the correlation itself. For the remaining two, the average alpha of all the other
studies (.71) was used. 5.3.4. Academic performance If the information on academic
performance (GPA or class rank) was obtained from school records, it was assumed to
have a reliability of 1. Students' selfreports on their GPA or rank are, of course,
not perfectly reliable. The reliability of self-reports is assessed by the
correlation between self-reported GPA (or rank) and GPA (or rank) obtained from
school records. A recent meta-analysis by Kuncel et al. (2005) found that this
correlation is .82 for high school GPA and .77 for high school rank. These values
were used to correct the correlations that involved self-reported GPA or
rank.<component x="286.24" y="207.01" width="221.2" height="152.54" page="8"

range restriction was performed in the present meta-analysis. Instead of that, the
correction was done indirectly by excluding studies with considerable range
restriction. This strategy was preferred because most of the studies that satisfied
the inclusion criteria (see Section 5.2) were based on samples that were fairly
representative of the general population and did not require the correction for range
restriction. It is, therefore, appropriate to limit the current meta-analysis to
representative studies and exclude the studies that 6 exhibit signs of considerable
range restriction. More specifically, I excluded the studies that sampled only (a)
college students or individuals with a college degree (e.g., Eckland, 1965), (b)
employees of a single organization (e.g., Dreher &amp; Bretz, 1991), or (c)
representatives of one specific occupational group (such as engineers or managers;
see e.g., Sackett, Gruys, 7 &amp; Ellingson, 1998). These criteria exclude much of
the personnel selection research, which is the kind of research where the problem of
range restriction is particularly serious (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004). I also
excluded the correlation if the range of one (or both) of the correlated variables
was deliberately restricted by the research design. For example, in the study of
gifted children by Terman and Oden (1947), the range of intelligence was severely
restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs over 135; in the Polish study by
Firkowska-Mankiewicz (2002), the range of intelligence was restricted by sampling
only individuals with IQs below 86 or over 130. The correlations obtained from
Fergusson, Horwood, and Ridder (2005) and Kuh and Wadsworth (1991) were the only ones
that had to be corrected for dichotomization.<component x="41.16" y="230.92"

every sample, included in a particular analysis, is reasonably homogenous in terms of
the moderator variables (i.e., all the individuals in the sample should be of
approximately the same age and studied at the same time). To achieve that, I excluded
a study from a moderator analysis if the range of the moderator variable in question
exceeded 10 years. It should be noted, however, that the majority of the samples that
provided data on intelligence were rather homogenous in terms of all the moderator
variables because longitudinal surveys typically concentrate on a specific cohort.
The moderator analyses were conducted in two steps: first a more conventional
subgroup analysis and then a meta-regression analysis. The details of these analyses

strength of the relationship between predictors and success, three averages were
calculated: a simple average correlation, a sample size weighted average correlation,
and a sample size weighted average correlation corrected for unreliability and
dichotomization in the correlated variables. The latter constitutes the central
meta-analytic result of the present paper. Other averages can be used for comparison
to see how much the results are affected by weighting and correcting the original
correlations. Because the sample sizes were highly variable (from 60 to 339,951 with
a median of 518), weighting the correlations by sample size would allow the few very
large studies to overly dominate the results. To prevent that, all the samples with
the size over 7000 individuals (about 5% of the samples in this study) were set equal
to 7000 for the weighting procedure. In order to estimate the variability of the
correlations, the standard deviation of original correlations and corrected standard
deviation of corrected correlations (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 126) were
calculated. The 95% credibility intervals of sample size weighted corrected
correlations were calculated to assess the presence of moderators. Moderators are
present if the credibility intervals are large (over 0.11 according to Koslowsky
&amp; Sagie, 1993) or include zero (see Whitener, 1990). Finally, 95% confidence
intervals of the sample size weighted corrected correlations were calculated using
the formula for heterogeneous studies (Whitener, 1990: 317). Confidence intervals can
be used to assess the significance of the correlations (correlation is significantly
different from zero if the confidence intervals do not include zero) as well as to
compare correlations (according to a simple and conservative rule of thumb, two
correlations are significantly different from one another if their confidence
intervals do not intersect).<component x="286.24" y="51.61" width="221.2"

with education, occupation, and income; the sample size weighted and corrected

credibility intervals exceed 0.11 suggests the presence of moderators according to
Koslowsky and Sagie (1993). Comparing the three averages (r, rw, and p) in every row

between intelligence and success. The results, just described, can be criticized for
including several samples that are somewhat inappropriate for studying the causal
influence of intelligence on success. In some studies, most of the individuals were
already in their early twenties at the time the IQ test was taken. It is possible
that many individuals in these samples had already started a career by that time,
which makes the direction of influence between intelligence and career success rather
ambiguous. Furthermore, in several studies the individuals were still in their
twenties at the time their career success was measured. It seems reasonable to
assume, however, that individuals under 30 cannot yet be reliably classified as more
successful or less successful. Taking these observations into account, the second row
in every section of Table 1, con" " taining the phrase best studies in parentheses,
includes only samples with the average age of less than 19 at testing and over 29 at
the measurement of success. If raw data were used, then the individuals of
inappropriate age were simply excluded. " " Looking at the best studies , we can
observe the corrected sample size weighted correlations of .56, .45, and .23 between
intelligence and education, occupation, and income, respectively. These correlations
can be treated as the most appropriate estimates of the relationship between
intelligence and socioeconomic success. The " " averages of the best studies are
somewhat higher than " " the averages of all studies indicating that the inclusion of
the less appropriate samples among the latter lowers the meta-analytic results. It is
surprising how much the " " number of samples (k) included among the best studies " "
- differs from the number of all studies almost two thirds of the correlations with
education had to be " " excluded for the analysis of the best studies . It shows that
much of the research on intelligence and success is being conducted with samples that
are either too old at the time of testing or too young at the measurement of success.
Having characterized the predictive power of intelligence in general, the next step
is to compare it to the predictive power of parental SES and academic performance.
Table 1 presents the meta-analytic results for the five indicators of parental SES
(father's education, mother's education, father's occupation, parental income, and
the SES index). Not surprisingly, all the correlations are positive but, judging by
the confidence intervals, several of the correlations (e.g., the one between father's
education and education, p = .50, or father's occupation and occupation, p= .35) are
significantly smaller than the respective correlations for intelligence. On the other
hand, none of the parental variables is a significantly stronger predictor than
intelligence. The SES index is the most successful predictor among the parental
variables by not being a significantly weaker predictor than intelligence for any of
the measures 9 of success.<component x="281.93" y="51.61" width="221.29"

useful strategy for comparing the predictive power of two variables would be to look
at the samples that provide information on both predictors and then make comparisons
within each sample. The advantage of such within-sample comparisons would be the
elimination of between-study methodological differences. I used this strategy to
compare the correlations with intelligence and SES index (arguably the best measure
of social background). The significance of the difference between the correlations
was tested with the formula for comparing dependent correlations (Meng, Rosenthal,
&amp; Rubin, 1992: 173). With education as the measure of success, there were 15
samples that provided correlations with both IQ and SES index; in 11 of these
samples, the b correlations were significantly different (p .05, 2-tailed); 8 of the
significant differences were in favor of IQ. With occupation as the measure of
success, 14 comparisons were made; 7 of the differences were significant, all in
favor of IQ. With income as the measure of success, 12 comparisons were made; 5 were
significant, 2 of them in favor of IQ. These results suggest that there seems to be
an overall tendency for IQ to be a better predictor but this tendency is not
consistently found in every occasion.<component x="41.16" y="52.03" width="221.25"

influence of moderator variables, the analysis of subgroups was performed. The
moderator variables were divided into - - the following categories: age at testing
into 1 10, 11 - - - - 15, 16 18, 19 25; age at success into 20 24, 25 29, - - - - 30
34, 35 39, 40 44, 45 49, and over 49; and the - - year of success into pre-1960, 1960
1969, 1970 - 1979, 1980 1989, post-1989. The raw data sets were exploited to the full
extent by dividing the samples into appropriate subgroups by age or year. Every
sample contributed only one correlation to a moderator category. If a sample could
contribute more than one correlation, then the most appropriate of the available
correlations (the one that best fitted into the moderator category) was used. Equally
appropriate correlations were averaged. Table 2 presents the results of the moderator
analysis. The table is divided into three sections with every section presenting the
results for one moderator variable. In the first section of Table 2, age at testing
(i.e., mean age of the sample at the time of ability testing) is used as a moderator
variable. The youngest sample in this analysis was, on average, 3 years old at the
time of testing, the oldest one was 23 years old. The results of the analysis are
quite clear-cut with regard to education and occupation as measures of success: the
correlations increase as age at testing increases. The correlation between
intelligence and income does not exhibit any obvious trend but even here the largest
correlation comes from the oldest group. In the next section of Table 2, the
moderator variable is age at success (i.e., the mean age of the sample at the time of
the measurement of socioeconomic success). Age at success ranges from 20 to 78 in the
present study. The results are rather different<component x="286.24" y="51.61"

stable. The correlation between intelligence and occupation takes a noticeable upward
leap during the - - twenties from .35 in the 20 24 group to the .44 in - - the 25 29
group and then levels off. The correlation between intelligence and income undergoes
the most dramatic changes: the correlation is - barely above zero in the 20 24 group
but jumps to - the value of .20 in the 25 29 group, and then takes - another jump to
the value of .27 in the 30 34 group; after the age of 40, the correlation appears to
decline again but not as low as the values it had before the age of 30. The influence
of the third moderator variable, year of success (i.e., year of the measurement of
success), is analyzed in the third section of Table 2. Year of success ranges from
1929 to 2003 in the present meta-analysis. Judging by the sample size weighted
corrected correlations ( p), there appears to be no historical trend for any one of
the moderator variables: correlations with education and occupation remain more or
less stable throughout the period under study; correlations with income fluctuate
more but without any obvious direction. Quite surprisingly, if unweighted and
uncorrected correlations ( r) are observed instead, then the correlations with
education and occupation exhibit a declining trend. 6.4. Moderator analysis using
multiple regression Moderator analyses in the previous section can be criticized for
ignoring the fact that the moderator variables might not be completely independent of
each other, which makes it possible to claim that some of the results can be
explained by the intercorrelations among the moderator variables (Steel &amp;
KammeyerMueller, 2002). In order to take account of this possibility, I conducted
multiple linear regression analyses using the moderator variables as independent
variables and the correlations between intelligence and measures of success as
dependent variables. Such meta-regression analysis is a common meta-analytic tool
(see Ganzeboom et al., 1989; Robbins et al., 2004). The analyses that follow differ
from the preceding moderator analyses in an important respect: in order to use all
the available information, I gave up the requirement of independent data and included
all the available correlations. If mental ability or socioeconomic success was
measured repeatedly for the same sample, then all the correlations were included
making it possible for one sample to contribute more than one 10 correlation to the
analysis. Naturally, this strategy results in some samples providing much more
correlations than others. In order to control for the effects of overrepresented
samples, I constructed dummy variables for all the data sets that contributed more
than 2 correlations from the same sample to a given moderator analysis. The dummy
variables were inserted into regression models as independent variables. In some raw
data sets that were large enough, the sample was broken down into smaller samples.
For example, the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women was divided into three
subsamples according to the age at - - -- the start of the survey the 14 17, 18 20,
and 21 - 24 year olds and these subsamples were then used as separate samples in the
regression analyses. This was done to obtain samples that are more homogenous

intelligence and career. All this information would be lost, however, if only one

to better capture the 11 effects of moderator variables. The results of the
meta-regression analyses are presented in Table 3. There are three dependent
variables in the table: the uncorrected correlations of 12 intelligence with
education, occupation, and income. The independent variables are the three moderator
variables (age at testing, age at success, and year of study) and data set dummies.
In order to provide a rough control for possible international differences, I also
included a dummy variable that equals 1 if the study was conducted in the United
States. Furthermore, in order to control for possible methodological differences that
might arise from using raw data (see Section 5.3), I constructed a dummy variable
that equals 1 if the correlation was calculated from raw data. Following the
suggestions made by Steel and Kammeyer-Mueller (2002), weighted least squares
regression analysis was used: each correlation was weighted by the inverse of its
sampling error variance as described in Steel and Kammeyer-Mueller (2002: - 100
101).<component x="286.24" y="171.17" width="221.21" height="260.09" page="14"

that breaking the original sample into smaller samples might limit the variance of
the variables. But this is unlikely to be the case because all these newly created
subsamples were large enough (sample size ranged from 126 to 4385 with a median of
503) to prevent any serious restriction of variance. 12 It would make very little
difference if corrected correlations (rather than uncorrected ones) were used in
these analyses because almost all correlations would be corrected with the same
reliability coefficients (see Section 5.3) and would, thus, be equally affected by
the correction.<component x="286.24" y="52.03" width="221.23" height="98.6" page="14"

meta-regression analysis in Table 3 are not radically different from the results of
the previous moderator analysis in Table 2. The moderating effect of age at testing
is positive and significant in all the three regression models. Age at success has a
positive effect on the correlations with occupation and income and a weak negative
effect of the correlation with education. Year of success provides some surprises by
having a weak positive effect of the correlation with education and a strong negative
effect on the correlation with occupation. It is of interest that the U.S.A. dummy is
not significant in any of the regression models indicating that the effect of IQ in
the United States is similar to its effect in other western societies. The raw data
dummy has a highly significant negative effect on the correlation with education and
a barely significant positive effect on the correlation with occupation. Therefore,
it seems that the inclusion of raw data is more likely to introduce a downward
(rather than upward) bias into the meta-analysis thus making the results
conservative.<component x="36.85" y="410.24" width="221.18" height="260.15" page="15"

of socioeconomic success Intelligence plays an influential and yet controversial role
in people's career (Gottfredson, 1997). In order to investigate this role, the
relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success was analyzed using
meta-analytic techniques. The first aim of the paper was to estimate the strength of
this relationship. The overall correlations were .56 (between intelligence and
education), .43 (between intelligence and occupation), and .20 (between intelligence
and income). Exclusion of the samples that were too old (over 18) at the time of
testing or too young (below 30) at the measurement of success resulted in somewhat
larger correlations: .56, .45, and .23, respectively. These results demonstrate that
intelligence, when it is measured before most individuals have finished their
schooling, is a powerful predictor of career success 12 or more years later when most
individuals have already entered stable careers. Two - - of the correlations with
education and occupation are of substantial magnitude according to the usual
standards of social science (Cohen, 1988); the correlation with education even
surpasses the wellestablished correlation of .51 between intelligence and job
performance (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998). The correlation with income is considerably
lower, perhaps even disappointingly low, being about the average of the previous
meta-analytic estimates (.15 by Bowles et al., 2001; and .27 by Ng et al., 2005). But
it should be noted that other predictors, studied in this paper, are not doing any
better in predicting income, which demonstrates that financial success is difficult
to predict by any variable. This claim is further corroborated by the meta-analysis
of Ng et al. (2005) where the best predictor of salary was educational level with a
correlation of only .29. It should also be noted that the correlation of .23 is about
the size of the average meta-analytic result in psychology (Hemphill, 2003) and
cannot, therefore, be treated as insignificant. The second aim of the meta-analysis
was to compare the predictive power of intelligence to the predictive power of other
prominent predictors of success, parental SES and academic performance. Such
comparisons are informative because different predictors represent different paths to
a successful career: intelligence represents one's general ability, parental SES
represents the social advantages or disadvantages experienced by a person, and
academic performance represents school-related learning and motivation. Meta-analysis
demonstrated that parental SES and academic performance are indeed positively related
to career success but the predictive power of these variables is not stronger than
that of intelligence (see Table 1). In fact, intelligence exhibited several
correlations with the measures of success that were larger than the respective
correlations for other predictors suggesting that intelligence is, after all, a
better predictor of success. Still, the differences in favor of intelligence were not
as overwhelming as one would have expected based on the results of Herrnstein and
Murray (1994). The index of parental SES, arguably the most representative measure of
social background, did not differ significantly from intelligence in its predictive
power (see Table 1). The same is true about the predictive power of academic
performance in relation to education and occupation. It has been observed before that
meta-analyses typically do not provide support for extreme scientific positions
(Lytton &amp; Romney, 1991). This is also true in the present case because the
extreme positions favoring intelligence (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) or parental
SES (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976) were not supported by the results. The reasonable
conclusion is rather modest: while intelligence is one of the central determinants of
one's socioeconomic success, parental SES and academic performance also play an
important role in the process of status attainment. Despite the modest conclusion,
these results are important because they falsify a claim often made by the critics of
the " " testing movement : that the positive relationship between intelligence and
success is just the effect of parental SES or academic performance influencing them
both (see Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; Fischer et al., 1996; McClelland, 1973). If the
correlation between intelligence and success was a mere byproduct of the causal
effect of parental SES or academic performance, then parental SES and academic
performance should have outcompeted intelligence as predictors of success; but this
was clearly not so. These results confirm that intelligence is an independent causal
force among the determinants of success; in other words, the fact that intelligent
people are successful is not completely explainable by the fact that intelligent
people have wealthy parents and are doing better at school. A number of moderator
analyses of the intelli- gence success correlation were also performed with the aim
of further clarifying the relationship between intelligence and success. The effects
of three moder- ator variables age at testing, age at success, and year - of success
were analyzed. With regard to age at testing, the results in Tables 2 and 3 clearly
demonstrate that the test scores of older individuals are better predictors of
success than the scores of younger individuals. As discussed in Section 4.3.1, there
are two conflicting explanations for this result. On the one hand, if we assume that
the test scores of " " older individuals are more contaminated by experiences, then
this result suggests that experiences make a contribution to the correlation between
intelligence and success. But on the other hand, if we assume that " the test scores
of older individuals are more contam" inated by genetic influences, then it would
mean that genes make a contribution to this correlation. Yet another explanation
would be that IQ scores of children are simply less reliable and the predictive
validity of childhood IQ was, therefore, underestimated. But contrary to this
explanation, preliminary examination of some evidence on the stability of
intelligence among children (e.g., Burchinal, Campbell, Bryant, Wasik, &amp; Ramey,
1997; Jensen, 1980: - 279) suggested that the test retest coefficients among children
below 10 are, on the whole, rather similar to - the test retest coefficients among
older individuals. It appears that the age-related changes in the predictive validity
of test scores cannot be explained by differential reliability of the scores.
Analyses of age at success in Tables 2 and 3 demonstrate that correlations with
occupation and income grow stronger as individuals grow older. This result confirms
the ideas of the gravitational hypothesis about intellectual differences cumulating
throughout life course leading people increasingly towards the social positions that
correspond to their ability (Gottfredson, 2003). The fact that declining validity
hypothesis (Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001) received no support for occupational and income
attainment indicates that being successful in these areas is a complex activity that
never ceases to be cognitively demanding. But as for educational attainment, the
negative impact of age at success on the IQeducation correlation in Table 3 provides
some support for the declining validity hypothesis and suggests that, in educational
career, intellectual differences might indeed become somewhat less important as
people get older. The difference between education and other measures of success can
be explained by the fact that climbing the educational ladder is, in a sense, easier
than climbing the occupational or financial ladder (because once you have acquired a
certain level of education, you can never loose it again, which is clearly not the
case with occupation or income). Year of the measurement of success had no obvious
effect on the corrected correlations ( p) between intelligence and success in Table
2. The meta-regression analysis in Table 3 showed that there is a slight tendency for
correlation between intelligence and education to increase over the years. This is
the only bit of evidence there is to support the claims of Herrnstein and Murray
(1994) about the growing importance of mental ability and increasing cognitive
stratification. This evidence is rather weak in comparison with the much stronger
declining trend exhibited by the correlation with occupation in Table 3. It would be
difficult to come up with explanations why intelligence might have become more
important with respect to one criterion and less important with respect to another.
Therefore, the safest conclusion from Tables 2 and 3 seems to be that the correlation
between intelligence and success has not changed in any consistent direction over the
past decades. It should be noted that the present paper analyzed changes in the
absolute importance of intelligence (measured by zero-order correlations); the
results so far discussed do not exclude the possibility of growing relative
importance of intelligence (i.e., importance relative to other predictors). However,
the analyses of Bowles et al. (2001) and Hauser and Huang (1997) found no evidence of
any trend in the relative importance. 7.2. Possible limitations and implications for
future research Like all research, the present meta-analysis contains several
limitations that can be amended in future research. One limitation concerns the
metaanalytic database. Although the present meta-analysis is, to my knowledge, the
most comprehensive review of the longitudinal research on intelligence and
socioeconomic success, it does not cover all the existing data. I am aware of several
additional longitudinal data sets that contain information on intelligence and
success but from which I have been unable to obtain necessary data (see J&#xE6;ger
&amp; Holm, 2003; Meghir &amp; Palme, 2005; Nyborg &amp; Jensen, 2001; Scarr &amp;
Weinberg, 1994). There are probably others. Efforts to collect information about the
existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from
outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the
present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany
or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an
Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other
scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been studied in continental Europe
(see e.g., Flynn, 1987; Sternberg, 2004; Weinert &amp; Schneider, 1999) but I have
not been able to find suitable data for the present study. The present study can also
be criticized for underestimating the importance of the predictors of success;
arguments can be offered for any of the three predictors (intelligence, parental SES,
or academic performance) as to why their importance was underestimated. First, the
present study used only three measures of social background (parental education,
occupation, and income) and therefore, could have underestimated its importance.
Although these three have always been the central indicators of social advantages,
several additional measures of social background could have an independent effect on
career success (Fischer et al., 1996). Future metaanalyses could, therefore, benefit
from considering other variables, such as neighborhood quality (Leventhal &amp;
Brooks-Gunn, 2000), number of siblings (Blake, 1989), or parental divorce (Amato
&amp; Keith, 1991), to get a more comprehensive picture of the effects of social
background. Second, the use of grade point average and class rank as the only
measures of academic performance can be criticized for ignoring between-school
differences; i.e., the same average grade or rank can have different meanings in
different schools depending on the quality of the schools (Bassiri &amp; Schulz,
2003). A more comprehensive study of the importance of academic performance should,
therefore, also take account of the quality of the school the individual is
attending. Third, as already discussed in Section 7.1, the predictive power of
intelligence in younger samples could have been underestimated by using a single -
test retest reliability coefficient for all studies that did not provide reliability
coefficients of their own. Although it was concluded above that the underestimation
was minimal, it would still be desirable to pay more attention to this problem in the
future research. As a possible limitation and implication for future research, it
should also be noted that one of the big questions that looms behind every paper that
deals with intelligence and success, the question of genetic versus environmental
influences on IQ and social status, was not directly addressed in this paper. The
fact that IQ scores predict socioeconomic success does not, in itself, tell us
whether the effect of intelligence can be attributed to genes or environment. On the
one hand, there is clear evidence that children's IQ scores are correlated with
parental SES (White, 1982), this result together with the fact that parental SES
predicts socioeconomic success (see Table 1) can be interpreted as showing that
envi"" ronment is the final cause of one's success or failure. This conclusion has
been criticized for ignoring the genetic influences on parental SES (Jensen, 1998).
On the other hand, the evidence on the heritability of intelligence (Devlin, Daniels,
&amp; Roeder, 1997) and socioeconomic success (Rowe, Vesterdal, &amp; Rodgers, 1999)
together with the evidence on the relationship between intelligence and success (see
Table 1) can be taken as proof that parents' and children's social status are both
determined by the genes for intelligence that run in the family. This conclusion has
been challenged by Bowles and Gintis (2002) who argued that, although socioeconomic
success might be heritable, the genetic inheritance of IQ, in particular, plays only
a very minor part in this process. The results of the present meta-analysis, although
not directly addressing these issues, can be useful in these discussions if combined
with the results from other studies.<component x="36.85" y="350.49" width="221.16"
