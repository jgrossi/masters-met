instance, has been selected throughout evolution due to its adaptive value. Following
Darwin's steps, other researchers found evidence that led them to propose that facial
expressions are automatic representations derived from the individual's emotional
experience. Hence, the informative value of such expressions is not their essential
function, but a secondary effect of an internal and individual emotional experience
(Izard &amp; Malatesta, 1987; Ekman, 1997). In contrast, Blair (2003) suggests that
facial expressions of emotion mainly serve a communicational purpose, where the
individual can transmit information on the emotional valence of objects and
situations to observers of the same species. Therefore, the conditions for an event,
but also a potential observer. Consistent with this, empirical evidence suggests that
emotional expressions are not the automatic result of an internal emotional
condition, but depend on the social context or even on the deliberate action of the
person displaying the emotion. Such a complex ability to decode important facial
information in the environment, emotional or identityrelated, will rely on the
harmonic functioning of strategies learned throughout development and the neural
systems underlying the processing of facial information. Identity and emotion
suggests that the processing of facial identity and facial affect relies on diverse
and interconnected, systems. The model proposed by Bruce and Young (1986) suggests
that facial affect is unimportant for face recognition. Instead, they propose that
recognition relies on 'Facial Recognition Units' (FRU) that contain the basic
structural codes for recognition. According to this model, whenever the observer
encounters an emotional face, this face undergoes a normalization process during
which the dynamic features are left aside. The normalized face is then submitted to
an appreciation based on the FRUs functional independence between the processing of
identity and emotion. and identity remains unanswered. In a study to investigate the
effects of expression on recognition, Endo, Endo, Kirita and Maruyama (1992) designed
a task using familiar and unfamiliar faces representing three emotions: happiness,
sadness and neutral affect. The results showed that the time for face recognition was
strongly affected by emotional affect, neutral faces being recognized faster than
emotional faces. Pathology and facial information processing Despite the above
proposition that the human ability to decode faces is innate and results from
successful adaptation, that ability likely improves after birth, throughout the
developmental process. Additionally facial decoding may be subject to the same risks
of failure observed in other cognitive and neuropsychological functions. Part of the
healthy development of facial information processing involves the capacity to
modulate and respond properly observed that facial disappointment expressed by a
young child who receives a poorer than expected gift is much more easily perceived
than the same feeling expressed by an older child. Accordingly, one may infer that
certain conditions enhancement of this perceptive modality. Thus leaving open the
possibility of erroneous interpretation of the social context or even to the
inability of accomplishing any functional appraisal at all. Probably the most well
documented example of such dysfunctions (Damasio et al., 1982; De Renzi et al., 1990;
Farah, 1991, in Posamentier &amp; Abdi, 2003) is prosopagnosia (from the Greek
prosopon, 'face' + agnosia, 'ignorance'). In that condition the individual is unable
to identify familiar faces, resorting to other clues (voice, gestures, etc.) in order
to recognize people. Despite such impairment, however, the capacity to interpret
facial emotions may remain perfectly healthy in these individuals. Besides
prosopagnosia, of impaired facial emotion recognition in psychiatric conditions such
as depression, social phobia, panic disorder, and schizophrenia. Such impairment, in
contrast with have varied presentations and is object of disagreement among
researchers. Faces and schizophrenia The study of facial emotion processing in
schizophrenia has faced a series of obstacles, such as the divided in subtypes,
according to the group of prominent symptoms. The current research on facial
processing patient group that is studied since the impairment in face perception
seems to be subject to the disease's different presentations. The objective of this
review is to make a survey of the studies on processing of facial identity and
emotion in schizophrenic patients published in the last 5 years, analyzing their
methodological aspects and results, which Method Paper search and selection The
search was conducted on the Medline database using the keywords "schizophrenia",
"affect", "identity", "face" and "facial", identifying a total of 97 papers, from
which 32 were selected. Inclusion criteria were empirical studies was determined in
function of the publication of similar and 2002 (Edwards et al.). Population which
were divided into three groups for this analysis: schizophrenia patients (SP),
patients with other diagnoses (POD) and healthy controls (HC). The two groups of
patients account for about half of the total, the remaining half being composed by
HC. Among the 2503 participants whose gender was noted (one of the studies did not
specify the gender distribution of a group of 138 healthy controls), 59% distribution
of gender by group was more uneven among SP, where there were almost two times more
men than groups, the differences were not as dramatic: 206 male and 180 female in the
first; 387 male and 358 female in the second. autistic patients (1 study) and 30
brain-lesioned patients (1 study). First-degree relatives of schizophrenic patients
included in this group since they were regarded as 'cases' in the studies they took
part in. Given the small number gender and age are unimportant. Tasks A series of
differences among the experimental designs adopted by each study was observed. Most
authors adopted the existence of consolidated tasks to evaluate facial information
processing [e.g. Benton Facial Recognition Test (BFRT - Benton, Hamsher, Varney &amp;
Spreen, 1983), Kinney's Affect Matching Task (KAMT - Kinney, 1995)]. The different
tasks used may be divided into four general categories or subjective judgment. 2)
Emotion discrimination: response based on emotional face presented previously or
simultaneously to a target stimulus. 3) Emotional intensity determination: response
based on differences of emotional intensity represented in the stimulus. Stimuli The
same diversity in the tasks chosen was observed in the stimuli that were used. The
most used stimuli (9 studies) were, as expected, the series "Pictures of Facial
Affect" by Ekman and Friesen (1976), followed by original Ekman (3 studies), series
by Mazurski and Bond (2 studies), schematic faces (1 study), and series by Izard (1).
Results Identity processing in schizophrenia focuses mainly on emotion recognition,
with the processing of identity coming in second place. All the 32 studies
investigated facial affect recognition, but only 50% also investigated non-emotional
aspects, included in the category "identity." Among the 16 studies that investigated
identity processing, seven and healthy controls in this function. Schizophrenic
patients with and without hearing impairment and healthy controls did not differ in
BFRT performance (Kubota et schizophrenics have a contextual appraisal of the face,
rather than a compartmented one. Despite these negative results, a discretely higher
proportion of studies investigating identity processing Kucharska-Pietura, David,
Masiak and Phillips (2005) state that schizophrenics are more impaired than controls
in face recognition, and that such impairment correlates were investigated by
Bozikas, Kosmidis, Anezoulaki, who reported impairment in verbal memory,
abstractionSome studies suggest that facial recognition may be impaired due to
restricted visual scanpath patterns (Loughland, Williams, &amp; Gordon, 2002;
Loughland, on peripheral and less important zones than on the facial features that
transmit information about identity. Curiously, an attenuated form of these abnormal
patterns was also The results of two other studies lie within an intermediate zone,
indicating that schizophrenic patients have problems in the performance of affect
matching tasks in different facial identities (Baudouin, Martin, Tiberghien, Verlut,
&amp; Franck, 2002; Martin, Baudouin, Tiberghien, &amp; Franck, 2005). The proposed
explanation is that these individuals' inability to disregard irrelevant information
for the execution of the task is correlated with negative symptoms. Emotion All 32
studies investigated facial emotion processing differences between patients and
healthy controls: Holt et al. (2006) found no differences in emotional intensity
judgments using a six-point Likert scale. Comparing patients and Poustka (2003),
found similar performance in all three groups. Gur et al. (2002) reported no
differences between patients and controls in an age estimation task involving
emotional faces. Schwartz et al. (2002) investigated the and concluded that changes
in face position or combination Baudouin at al. (2002) propose that variations in
emotional expressions do not affect the recognition of facial identity. In spite of
these negative results, most of the studies emotion in schizophrenics. With the
development of the Schizophrenia, cognition and social functioning A study involving
samples of schizophrenic patients with single and multiple episodes found that the
recognition of facial emotion correlates with social and cognitive functioning in
schizophrenia (Addington, Saeedi, &amp; Addington, 2006). Additionally, other studies
showed that men and women are differentially impaired in social contact, with males
being the most affected (Hooker &amp; Park, 2002; Scholten et al., 2005). This
difference between genders, also observed in healthy people, remains unchanged in
schizophrenia. Results show that the impairment in emotion recognition may be related
to cognitive deficits in different domains such as verbal memory, language
exclusively, in the recognition of neutral and happy faces. An attenuated version of
such a pattern is also be observed Affect processing and symptomatology As proposed
in the introduction, the research on facial information processing in schizophrenia
has evolved, of the schizophrenia. Evidence shows that patients with chronic
schizophrenia have greater impairment in affect recognition than those in the
beginning of the illness, which in turn are more impaired compared to healthy people
(Kucharska-Pietura et al., 2005). Hearing impaired patients with normal hearing
(Kubota et al., 2003) while disorganized and paranoid patients proved more impaired
than residual patients (Weniger, Lange, Ruther, &amp; Irle, speed-accuracy
decomposition (faster responses - probably task - resulting in more judgment
mistakes) in one study (Gur et al., 2006), but decreased response speed in another
(Suslow, Roestel, &amp; Arolt, 2003). emotions. For example, patients with higher
psychopathy scores are more impaired in the recognition of sadness (Fullam &amp;
Dolan, 2006), schizophrenics in remission but not other emotions (Bediou et al.,
2005), patients with blunted affect and anhedonia show increased sensitivity for
negative emotions (Suslow, Droste, Roestel, &amp; Arolt, 2005), and paranoid patients
present abnormal amplitudes during the visualization of neutral faces in ERP studies
(Herrmann, Reif, Jabs, Jacob, &amp; Fallgatter, 2006). Intervention One of the
studies (Wolwer et al., 2005) submitted two groups of patients to distinct training
programs (one aimed recognition: TAR - Training of Affect Recognition). After
verifying that schizophrenics were impaired in the recognition of facial emotions,
The TAR group displayed approaching the performance of the control group. Discussion
According to our analyses, we found that research on facial information processing
has been evolving, schizophrenic disorder. The study on facial information perception
is divided in two wide domains: 1) processing of identity and 2) processing of
emotion. The analyses indicate that there is substantially greater interest in the
research related to emotional information, possibly motivated by the search for
deeper comprehension of the mechanisms which lead to the precarious social adaptation
of the schizophrenic patient. in different domains are observed in schizophrenia,
such as attention, memory and language processing. The observation of these
impairments has led researchers to cognitive impairment. The results of the studies
we analyzed since they offer evidence pointing in diverse directions. In spite of
this, there seems to be a solid correlation between memory impairment and identity
processing, and between impaired attention and language and emotion processing.
Further research dedicated to comprehensive cognitive assessment in conjunction with
face processing tasks, might help establish the basis of this interaction. whether
identity and emotion processing is differentially impaired in schizophrenia. Almost a
third of the studies which investigated both these domains found no differences
between schizophrenics and healthy controls regarding identity processing, but found
patients impaired in emotion recognition. The remaining two thirds found impairment
in both domains. This numerical difference, however, is face perception, since there
are important differences in the study designs. The major troublesome factor for a
global analysis of the results from the different studies is the plethora of tasks
and stimuli used. The use of standardized tasks would facilitate the comparison of
results, but is hindered by the virtual impossibility of developing a small number of
instruments the same problem. Since no doubts seem to be left regarding the
correlation between schizophrenia and facial processing investigation of differences
among the different patient subgroups. The most robust evidence in this direction
indicates that patients with negative symptoms are more impaired than those without
these symptoms. This more pronounced impairment is be true both for the processing of
identity and emotion as well and, even emotions. Besides that, paranoid
schizophrenics seem to show increased sensitivity for negative facial stimuli and
neutral faces, tending to overestimate the intensity of negative emotions and
attribute emotional content where there is none. It is possible that these factors
take part in the genesis of hallucinations and delusions in this group of patients.
Lastly, some results indicate that all in unimportant regions of the face and the
inability to disregard unrelated contextual information (such as the extraction of
the emotional meaning of a face regardless of its identity, for example) provide
strong evidence in this direction.<component x="354.36" y="80.43" width="236.39"

instance, has been selected throughout evolution due to its adaptive value. Following
Darwin's steps, other researchers found evidence that led them to propose that facial
expressions are automatic representations derived from the individual's emotional
experience. Hence, the informative value of such expressions is not their essential
function, but a secondary effect of an internal and individual emotional experience
(Izard &amp; Malatesta, 1987; Ekman, 1997). In contrast, Blair (2003) suggests that
facial expressions of emotion mainly serve a communicational purpose, where the
individual can transmit information on the emotional valence of objects and
situations to observers of the same species. Therefore, the conditions for an event,
but also a potential observer. Consistent with this, empirical evidence suggests that
emotional expressions are not the automatic result of an internal emotional
condition, but depend on the social context or even on the deliberate action of the
person displaying the emotion. Such a complex ability to decode important facial
information in the environment, emotional or identityrelated, will rely on the
harmonic functioning of strategies learned throughout development and the neural
systems underlying the processing of facial information. Identity and emotion
suggests that the processing of facial identity and facial affect relies on diverse
and interconnected, systems. The model proposed by Bruce and Young (1986) suggests
that facial affect is unimportant for face recognition. Instead, they propose that
recognition relies on 'Facial Recognition Units' (FRU) that contain the basic
structural codes for recognition. According to this model, whenever the observer
encounters an emotional face, this face undergoes a normalization process during
which the dynamic features are left aside. The normalized face is then submitted to
an appreciation based on the FRUs functional independence between the processing of
identity and emotion. and identity remains unanswered. In a study to investigate the
effects of expression on recognition, Endo, Endo, Kirita and Maruyama (1992) designed
a task using familiar and unfamiliar faces representing three emotions: happiness,
sadness and neutral affect. The results showed that the time for face recognition was
strongly affected by emotional affect, neutral faces being recognized faster than
emotional faces. Pathology and facial information processing Despite the above
proposition that the human ability to decode faces is innate and results from
successful adaptation, that ability likely improves after birth, throughout the
developmental process. Additionally facial decoding may be subject to the same risks
of failure observed in other cognitive and neuropsychological functions. Part of the
healthy development of facial information processing involves the capacity to
modulate and respond properly observed that facial disappointment expressed by a
young child who receives a poorer than expected gift is much more easily perceived
than the same feeling expressed by an older child. Accordingly, one may infer that
certain conditions enhancement of this perceptive modality. Thus leaving open the
possibility of erroneous interpretation of the social context or even to the
inability of accomplishing any functional appraisal at all. Probably the most well
documented example of such dysfunctions (Damasio et al., 1982; De Renzi et al., 1990;
Farah, 1991, in Posamentier &amp; Abdi, 2003) is prosopagnosia (from the Greek
prosopon, 'face' + agnosia, 'ignorance'). In that condition the individual is unable
to identify familiar faces, resorting to other clues (voice, gestures, etc.) in order
to recognize people. Despite such impairment, however, the capacity to interpret
facial emotions may remain perfectly healthy in these individuals. Besides
prosopagnosia, of impaired facial emotion recognition in psychiatric conditions such
as depression, social phobia, panic disorder, and schizophrenia. Such impairment, in
contrast with have varied presentations and is object of disagreement among
researchers. Faces and schizophrenia The study of facial emotion processing in
schizophrenia has faced a series of obstacles, such as the divided in subtypes,
according to the group of prominent symptoms. The current research on facial
processing patient group that is studied since the impairment in face perception
seems to be subject to the disease's different presentations. The objective of this
review is to make a survey of the studies on processing of facial identity and
emotion in schizophrenic patients published in the last 5 years, analyzing their
methodological aspects and results, which Method Paper search and selection The
search was conducted on the Medline database using the keywords "schizophrenia",
"affect", "identity", "face" and "facial", identifying a total of 97 papers, from
which 32 were selected. Inclusion criteria were empirical studies was determined in
function of the publication of similar and 2002 (Edwards et al.). Population which
were divided into three groups for this analysis: schizophrenia patients (SP),
patients with other diagnoses (POD) and healthy controls (HC). The two groups of
patients account for about half of the total, the remaining half being composed by
HC. Among the 2503 participants whose gender was noted (one of the studies did not
specify the gender distribution of a group of 138 healthy controls), 59% distribution
of gender by group was more uneven among SP, where there were almost two times more
men than groups, the differences were not as dramatic: 206 male and 180 female in the
first; 387 male and 358 female in the second. autistic patients (1 study) and 30
brain-lesioned patients (1 study). First-degree relatives of schizophrenic patients
included in this group since they were regarded as 'cases' in the studies they took
part in. Given the small number gender and age are unimportant. Tasks A series of
differences among the experimental designs adopted by each study was observed. Most
authors adopted the existence of consolidated tasks to evaluate facial information
processing [e.g. Benton Facial Recognition Test (BFRT - Benton, Hamsher, Varney &amp;
Spreen, 1983), Kinney's Affect Matching Task (KAMT - Kinney, 1995)]. The different
tasks used may be divided into four general categories or subjective judgment. 2)
Emotion discrimination: response based on emotional face presented previously or
simultaneously to a target stimulus. 3) Emotional intensity determination: response
based on differences of emotional intensity represented in the stimulus. Stimuli The
same diversity in the tasks chosen was observed in the stimuli that were used. The
most used stimuli (9 studies) were, as expected, the series "Pictures of Facial
Affect" by Ekman and Friesen (1976), followed by original Ekman (3 studies), series
by Mazurski and Bond (2 studies), schematic faces (1 study), and series by Izard (1).
Results Identity processing in schizophrenia focuses mainly on emotion recognition,
with the processing of identity coming in second place. All the 32 studies
investigated facial affect recognition, but only 50% also investigated non-emotional
aspects, included in the category "identity." Among the 16 studies that investigated
identity processing, seven and healthy controls in this function. Schizophrenic
patients with and without hearing impairment and healthy controls did not differ in
BFRT performance (Kubota et schizophrenics have a contextual appraisal of the face,
rather than a compartmented one. Despite these negative results, a discretely higher
proportion of studies investigating identity processing Kucharska-Pietura, David,
Masiak and Phillips (2005) state that schizophrenics are more impaired than controls
in face recognition, and that such impairment correlates were investigated by
Bozikas, Kosmidis, Anezoulaki, who reported impairment in verbal memory,
abstractionSome studies suggest that facial recognition may be impaired due to
restricted visual scanpath patterns (Loughland, Williams, &amp; Gordon, 2002;
Loughland, on peripheral and less important zones than on the facial features that
transmit information about identity. Curiously, an attenuated form of these abnormal
patterns was also The results of two other studies lie within an intermediate zone,
indicating that schizophrenic patients have problems in the performance of affect
matching tasks in different facial identities (Baudouin, Martin, Tiberghien, Verlut,
&amp; Franck, 2002; Martin, Baudouin, Tiberghien, &amp; Franck, 2005). The proposed
explanation is that these individuals' inability to disregard irrelevant information
for the execution of the task is correlated with negative symptoms. Emotion All 32
studies investigated facial emotion processing differences between patients and
healthy controls: Holt et al. (2006) found no differences in emotional intensity
judgments using a six-point Likert scale. Comparing patients and Poustka (2003),
found similar performance in all three groups. Gur et al. (2002) reported no
differences between patients and controls in an age estimation task involving
emotional faces. Schwartz et al. (2002) investigated the and concluded that changes
in face position or combination Baudouin at al. (2002) propose that variations in
emotional expressions do not affect the recognition of facial identity. In spite of
these negative results, most of the studies emotion in schizophrenics. With the
development of the Schizophrenia, cognition and social functioning A study involving
samples of schizophrenic patients with single and multiple episodes found that the
recognition of facial emotion correlates with social and cognitive functioning in
schizophrenia (Addington, Saeedi, &amp; Addington, 2006). Additionally, other studies
showed that men and women are differentially impaired in social contact, with males
being the most affected (Hooker &amp; Park, 2002; Scholten et al., 2005). This
difference between genders, also observed in healthy people, remains unchanged in
schizophrenia. Results show that the impairment in emotion recognition may be related
to cognitive deficits in different domains such as verbal memory, language
exclusively, in the recognition of neutral and happy faces. An attenuated version of
such a pattern is also be observed Affect processing and symptomatology As proposed
in the introduction, the research on facial information processing in schizophrenia
has evolved, of the schizophrenia. Evidence shows that patients with chronic
schizophrenia have greater impairment in affect recognition than those in the
beginning of the illness, which in turn are more impaired compared to healthy people
(Kucharska-Pietura et al., 2005). Hearing impaired patients with normal hearing
(Kubota et al., 2003) while disorganized and paranoid patients proved more impaired
than residual patients (Weniger, Lange, Ruther, &amp; Irle, speed-accuracy
decomposition (faster responses - probably task - resulting in more judgment
mistakes) in one study (Gur et al., 2006), but decreased response speed in another
(Suslow, Roestel, &amp; Arolt, 2003). emotions. For example, patients with higher
psychopathy scores are more impaired in the recognition of sadness (Fullam &amp;
Dolan, 2006), schizophrenics in remission but not other emotions (Bediou et al.,
2005), patients with blunted affect and anhedonia show increased sensitivity for
negative emotions (Suslow, Droste, Roestel, &amp; Arolt, 2005), and paranoid patients
present abnormal amplitudes during the visualization of neutral faces in ERP studies
(Herrmann, Reif, Jabs, Jacob, &amp; Fallgatter, 2006). Intervention One of the
studies (Wolwer et al., 2005) submitted two groups of patients to distinct training
programs (one aimed recognition: TAR - Training of Affect Recognition). After
verifying that schizophrenics were impaired in the recognition of facial emotions,
The TAR group displayed approaching the performance of the control group. Discussion
According to our analyses, we found that research on facial information processing
has been evolving, schizophrenic disorder. The study on facial information perception
is divided in two wide domains: 1) processing of identity and 2) processing of
emotion. The analyses indicate that there is substantially greater interest in the
research related to emotional information, possibly motivated by the search for
deeper comprehension of the mechanisms which lead to the precarious social adaptation
of the schizophrenic patient. in different domains are observed in schizophrenia,
such as attention, memory and language processing. The observation of these
impairments has led researchers to cognitive impairment. The results of the studies
we analyzed since they offer evidence pointing in diverse directions. In spite of
this, there seems to be a solid correlation between memory impairment and identity
processing, and between impaired attention and language and emotion processing.
Further research dedicated to comprehensive cognitive assessment in conjunction with
face processing tasks, might help establish the basis of this interaction. whether
identity and emotion processing is differentially impaired in schizophrenia. Almost a
third of the studies which investigated both these domains found no differences
between schizophrenics and healthy controls regarding identity processing, but found
patients impaired in emotion recognition. The remaining two thirds found impairment
in both domains. This numerical difference, however, is face perception, since there
are important differences in the study designs. The major troublesome factor for a
global analysis of the results from the different studies is the plethora of tasks
and stimuli used. The use of standardized tasks would facilitate the comparison of
results, but is hindered by the virtual impossibility of developing a small number of
instruments the same problem. Since no doubts seem to be left regarding the
correlation between schizophrenia and facial processing investigation of differences
among the different patient subgroups. The most robust evidence in this direction
indicates that patients with negative symptoms are more impaired than those without
these symptoms. This more pronounced impairment is be true both for the processing of
identity and emotion as well and, even emotions. Besides that, paranoid
schizophrenics seem to show increased sensitivity for negative facial stimuli and
neutral faces, tending to overestimate the intensity of negative emotions and
attribute emotional content where there is none. It is possible that these factors
take part in the genesis of hallucinations and delusions in this group of patients.
Lastly, some results indicate that all in unimportant regions of the face and the
inability to disregard unrelated contextual information (such as the extraction of
the emotional meaning of a face regardless of its identity, for example) provide
strong evidence in this direction.<component x="354.36" y="80.43" width="236.39"
