such as gender, culture, race, age and class play a major role in constructing
masculinity, this paper looks at how these intersect with the body and what
discourses of masculinity and sexualities are in evidence in this respect in the
overtly masculinist context of the military. Drawing on data from a larger study
exploring 14 military men's narratives on their masculinity, sexuality, sexual
relationships and HIV/AIDS, the findings illustrate how successful masculinity in the
military context is played out through particular bodily performances, including
being physically strong, proving one's strength through high risk military
activities, and through hypersexuality. There is evidence that the body and other
bodily representations and accessories related to being in the military (uniform,
weapons, etc.) is a key area in which masculine identity is performed by men in this
institution. The suggestion is that male sexual practices cannot be tackled without
examining the intersection of the body and masculine identity and in the military
this means a particular focus on the way in which the body is centred in performances
and representations of being both a military person and a man. Key words: military,
South Africa, HIV/AIDS, hegemonic masculinity, (hetero)sexuality, bodies
INTRODUCTION. Underpinned by a social constructionist and critical men's studies
approach this paper explores how men in the military construct their masculinity/ies
in relation to their bodies. These approaches argue that the gender identities and
performances of men are socially constructed, changeable and often contradictory,
hence the term "masculinities" rather than a single "masculinity" (Morrell, 1998,
2002; Moynihan, 1998; Connell, 2000). National and international critical men's
studies emphasise the importance of looking at both local and global contexts when
exploring masculinities. This study, though not discarding the importance of global
contexts, privileges the local institutional context. Interpretation is focused on
the manner in which soldiers in the South African National Defence Force (SANDF)
construct their masculinity and sexuality and the role that the body and bodily
representation play in the construction of their masculinity and sexuality, which in
turn are located within the military context and are located within the performance
of various military activities. While the approaches and theories underpinning this
study firmly reject biological determinist positions, they nonetheless acknowledge
and theorise the centrality of the body and the physical in understanding dominant
performances of masculinity. This is especially salient in understanding the way in
which strength and virility have been widely shown to be integral components in the
construction of hegemonic forms of masculinity that are arguably amplified by men in
the military (Connell, 1994, 2000; Hearn, 1996; Cock, 2001). In this context, men's
bodies which are expected to be tough, muscular and macho in many cultural contexts
are particularly central, valued and associated with social and sexual success in
military contexts (Kimmel, 2000; Cock, 2001). This article attempts to look at how a
group of military men's constructions of masculinity intersects with discourses about
the body specifically in the overtly masculinist context of the military which is
itself centred about physicality. The article begins by contextualizing the focus in
the article through a brief history of the South African military and its
post-apartheid transformation before turning to a theoretical overview of the role of
the body in the social construction of masculinity. The article then goes on to
outline the study and unpack the key discourses that reflect the ways in which
dominant discourses of masculinity intersect with discourses on the body and
physicality for this group of military men. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN
MILITARY. The South African Defence Force (SADF) had extensive operational deployment
experience inside the country. In the 1970s compulsory military service for young,
fit and white South African men was introduced. During the 1980s, the SADF took on
increasing responsibility for internal security matters, providing the South African
Police (SAP) with considerable support in their attempt to crush anti-apartheid
resistance (Stott, 2002). Many SADF conscripts emphasised that the core of military
training was to inculcate aggressiveness and to equate it with masculinity (Cock,
2001). On the eve of the first democratic general election in 1994, the South African
National Defence Force (SANDF) replaced the SADF. This new structure emerged from the
decision to integrate the non-statutory forces of Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) and the
Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA) with the SADF and the Transkei,
Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei (TBVC) forces (Seegers, 1996; Le Roux, 2003). The
transition from the SADF to the SANDF has been tremendously complicated and marred by
tension and dissatisfaction (Stott, 2002; Le Roux, 2003; Ngculu, 2003). The short-
and long-term process of replacing the SADF with a truly national defence force
comprising statutory and non-statutory forces that had been at war for 37 years, was
complex. While literature analyzing current constructions of gender in the military
is scarce there is some work that highlights the centrality of the body. Barrett
(1996) has argued that while the military emphasizes aggression and physical fitness,
the qualities of a "gentleman" hinging around discourses of cleanliness, a neat
appearance and showing attention to detail are also values that the military seeks to
impart. It is also notable that even though the SANDF largely maintains a
masculinised body, in contrast to the SADF, a fairly large proportion of the members
of the new South African military are women. Given the above historical context, the
South African military is not unified or a homogenous structure. It is stratified
across race, gender and class, though its primary identifier remains a masculinist
tradition. Understanding the way in which the body may have been foregrounded in
military institutions requires engaging with theoretical arguments about the way in
which the body and bodily performance has been centred in social constructions of
hegemonic masculinity, highlighting arguments about the particular forms this may
take in the hypermasculine, physicalist context of the military. MASCULINITY AND THE
BODY. Connell (1994) criticises the neglect of the body in theorising gender in terms
of the sex-gender conceptual divide, which emerges from the philosophical mind-body
tradition, and intersects with other classic binary opposites like male-female and
rational-irrational. Connell's concern about the neglect of the body is shared by
other researchers (Vance, 1989; Crossley, 1996; Dowsett, 1996) who appeal for
acknowledgement of the body as an active agent in shaping sexualities, genders and
social processes. These researchers argue not only for the body's agency in social
practice, but also for the material diversity of bodies: "This point is nowhere more
important than in relation to gender. Gender is fundamentally a way in which social
practice is ordered. In gender processes, the everyday conduct of life is ordered in
relation to a reproductive arena&#x2026;This arena includes sexual arousal and
intercourse, childbirth and infant care, bodily sex difference and similarity. It is
thus constituted by the materiality of bodies" (Connell, 2000:58-59). This does not
mean these researchers favour deterministic discourses over sociocultural accounts of
gender. Rather, the notion of "embodiment" is central to a number of contemporary
theoretical perspectives and feminist writings that contribute to understanding human
subjectivity (Jung, 1996; Potts, 2001; Somerville, 2004). If men's bodies are
inextricably relevant to masculinity, then to understand how their bodies intersect
with their masculinities, "we must not abandon the conventional dichotomy between
changing culture and unchanging bodies" (Connell, 2000:57). Echoing Foucault's (1984)
account of the way in which bodies are regulated and disciplined within
socio-cultural and historical processes, Connell argues that social institutions and
discourses have given particular social meaning to gendered bodies. A range of bodily
practices located in particular social contexts - ranging across dress, sport and
sexuality - address or modify bodies. Broadly, the terms of masculinity require men
to have a high level of muscular strength. This suggests that men should be
physically fit and well built (Klein, 1999; GETNET, 2001). Therefore, the body is key
in the construction of successful masculinity (Connell, 2000; Dowsett, 2003;
Lindegger &amp; Maxwell, 2007). Bodies in this view have moved beyond biology, and
play a crucial role in how people construct their masculinity and how they behave/act
in their social surroundings. Within this framework the centrality of bodies and
physicality, particularly the desired strong physique and the symbolic role of the
uniform in the military are clearly of relevance in understanding the discursive
function of body in constructions of military and masculine identity. Masculine body
and the military. Much literature has foregrounded the way in which bodily strength
and physicality is performed in the military. For some men, the physical training
that produces the physical fitness required by the military seems to be a way of
reasserting their 26 manhood, or proving their masculinity (Cohn, 2000). For some,
military service is an inherent part of maturation, a ceremonial transition to
successful male adulthood (Klein, 1999). The military embodies codes of honour that
stress a number of supposedly male virtues. Traditional male virtues or attributes,
such as risk-taking, honour, courage, adventurousness, heroism and sexual virility
are central to constructions of hegemonic masculinity (Enloe, 1988; Nagel, 1998;
Cheng, 1999; Martino, 1999; Heinecken, 2000). These virtues are supposedly tempered
with restraint and dignity, so as to reflect masculine ideals such as liberty,
equality and fraternity (Nagel, 1998). The demands of soldiering require these manly
virtues and the concepts of bravery, fearlessness and persistence to be brought
together (UNAIDS, 1998; Heinecken, 2000). Attaining this masculine ideal appears to
hinge around soldiers' material bodies. Furthermore, attainment of masculine identity
in the military depends on a soldier's emotional "maturity". The military-masculine
ideology discourages military personnel from admitting they are emotionally
vulnerable as this is potentially threatening to military morale, hence the
ascendance of phrases such as "behave like a soldier" or "take it like a man". Given
that the central function of the military is the preparation for and implementation
of military combat, it could be argued that the institutional context of the military
legitimises and idealises violence, serving to "groom" male bodies for violence
(Cock, 2001; Agostino, 2003). Emotional and physical vulnerability is therefore not
tolerated in the military. It is not only physical strength that is key in the bodily
representation of the military but also the use of weapons viewed as an extension of
the body for military men. Writing about the South African military, Cock (2001)
argues that guns are a key feature of hegemonic masculinity in this context. A strong
association between the military context and high-risk sexual practices have also
been widely argued, with a number of authors arguing that the hypermasculine context
of the military and other aspects of the lived experience of being in the military
facilitates a particular vulnerability to unsafe sexual practices. Okee-Obereng,
(2001) confirms that there is an association between work in the military and
high-risk sexual activity. UNAIDS (1998:3) reported that "the military professional
ethos tends to excuse or even encourage risk-taking". Aggression is valued and is
associated with "conquest". Willingness to accept and take risks is the key feature
in a soldier's preparation for combat, but off the battlefield it might vicariously
motivate soldiers' willingness to engage in needlessly risky behaviour, such as
unprotected sex. Nkosi's (1999:167) quotation from a Malawian soldier demonstrates
the centrality of the male sexual body and performance in the identity of the
military man poignantly: "Soldiers like to conquer. The more women you take to bed
the more you feel like a real man." The above literature highlights the centrality of
physical strength, risk-taking, sexual virility, all part of the embodiment of
masculinity and how hegemonic masculinity and particular forms of idealised male
bodies are central to and exaggerated in military settings. The opposite side of the
coin with respect to the centrality of the body in masculine achievement is the way
in which female soldiers are problematised in the military, which further highlights
the way in which it is a specifically male body that is key to constructions of
success in the military, adding further impetus to the argument of the centrality of
the body in constructions of military masculinity. The feminine body and the
military. Women have almost universally been excluded from warfare. In the first
instance, their biological role (bearing children) and gender roles (raising and
caring for children) were viewed as the inhibiting forces within a patriarchal notion
of the military. The traditional belief in both military and civilian spheres is that
men are protectors and defenders of the country, women and children. The key
underlying argument is that if women die in war, there will be no one to fulfil their
traditional reproductive roles. "New lives can be created, but it takes one woman to
bear each child each year, while one man can father a larger number of children a
year. Numerous women are essential to the replenishment of a population, but only a
few men are required" (Steihm, 1980:56). This seems to be a good argument for
polygamy and the prospect of a patriarchal dividend for the successful surviving
warrior. This is in line with sex role theory whereby men's bodies are seen as the
only ones that should be placed in risky situations, and emerges from old forms of
sexist discourse based on notions that women are the weaker sex while men are
considered strong and brave (Weitzman, 1979; Agostino, 2003). Another common concern
raised is that if women take part in combat, men will concentrate more on defending
them from their common opponents instead of fighting their counterparts (Agostino,
2003), again highlighting the patriarchal discourse of men as women's protectors.
Similarly, sexist notions of women as physically lacking in relation to men abound in
military discourse. Women are described as not having the ability to perform military
tasks that require a high level of muscular strength, such as, for example, the
carrying of heavy equipment and fighting in war, hence many countries have suggested
that women should participate in combat (Presidential Commission, 1992). South Africa
is no different; it has also restricted women from combat. However, Article 9 of the
Constitution of South Africa (1996) instructed that women should be afforded equal
opportunities in, and to, all roles. It is evident that while women are admitted into
the military and lip-service is paid to their achieving equal opportunities, the
dominant discourse remains one in which both male and female bodies are constructed
as fixed essences. The exclusion of women from most aspects of the military is
rationalised in terms of women's physical deficits and assumed masculine power which
is constructed as naturally invested only in male bodies. This construction leaves no
or little space for women to be fully integrated and accepted in the military, as
male bodies are viewed within dominant cultural discourses as superior to female
bodies with respect to required performances for the military role (Agostino, 2003).
While the literature flags the body as a key terrain for the performance of
masculinity in and outside of military contexts, there is little work that
specifically explores discourses of the male body among military men. This article
emerges out of a larger study that attempted to understand social constructions of
masculinity and sexuality among a group of military men in the South African
military. METHODOLOGY. A qualitative, feminist study looking at how men in the
military construct their masculinity and how their constructions reportedly link with
sexual practices was conducted with a group of male soldiers in a South African
military institution. The method used is an analysis and interpretation of 14
transcribed individual in-depth interviews with male soldiers enrolled in a tertiary
institution pursuing a career in the military. As the participants were students,
they were all junior officers with ranks ranging from lieutenant to captain. All
participants had been in the military for more than four years. The participants were
between the ages of 24 to 33 years, a group regarded as sexually active and at high
risk of HIV infection (Heinecken, 2001). Twelve participants were single, two were
married. They all identified themselves as heterosexuals. While acknowledging that
there are multiple forms of sexual identity and sexual practice, heterosexuality
became the point of departure in this article as the military setting is dominated by
heteronormative practices of masculine (Holland, Ramazanoglu, Scott, Sharpe &amp;
Thomson, 1996). This is in line with local research indicating that the social
construction of dominant masculinity is powerfully based on the successful
performance of heterosexual prowess (for example, Hunt, 1989; Campbell, 2001;
Dunbar-Moodie, 2001). 1 There were seven African participants, four whites and three
coloureds . Representivity during sampling is not regarded as crucial when doing
qualitative research. However, the decision was taken to consider a sample that
represents some of South African diversity with respect to categories set up by
apartheid and still of salience in the construction of identity today. This decision
was based on the assumption that a diverse sample might facilitate the possibility of
diverse stories and narratives being heard which could contribute significantly to
the nature and content of future HIV/AIDS interventions. It is worth highlighting by
way of illustrating the diversity of the narratives across historical apartheid
categories that white participants joined the military for different reasons than
African participants. For example, all white participants in this study expressed the
belief that soldiering is "a calling". This reference to the "calling" of soldiers is
often central in the stories about how they came to their current occupations. In
contrast, all the African reported that they joined the military for socio-economic
reasons. This highlights the racialised class inequalities that existed during the
apartheid era and their impact thereafter. It is worth pointing out, though, that all
of the African participants appreciate the military for the same reasons
(representing the country and positive male identity) as their white colleagues. This
points to the argument that the processes of racialisation and its intersection with
masculine identity are fluid, and variations reflect changes in politics and social
discourse. The interviews were approximately an hour to an hour-and-a-half long, and
explored the multiple ways in which these participants speak about their construction
and performance of masculinity. One of the emerging themes related to the way in
which they construct their bodies in relation their construction of their
masculinity. The author anticipated that the interview format and use of vignettes
would elicit rich and detailed data from the participants and not force the
interviews in a preconceived direction.<component x="65.22" y="304.32" width="468.22"

concerned that being a female might lead participants to perceive of me as a feminist
who might be judgmental of them as men. Although there is an assumption that people
of the same gender are able to connect better in an interview situation, Scully
(1990) found the opposite to be true in her study when, compared to her male
colleague, she appeared to connect better with the male participants and obtained
greater levels of disclosure. Similarly, I found that I was able to communicate well
with the male participants. This might be due to my experience of being a
psychologist in the military, and having to deal mostly with men in my day-today work
in the institution. To counteract any barriers based on gender, an experienced male
interviewer was coopted to conduct three interviews. This served to ascertain whether
gender and other aspects of social identity (for example, age, race and language)
impacted in any way on the interview process or created discomfort for the male
participants (Phoenix, 1994; Shefer et al, 2005). Further, this helped ensure a
different data set, outside of my influence. The male interviewer was selected based
on his excellent interpersonal skills, open-mindedness, and expertise on the subject
of gender and sexuality. His training as a clinical psychologist and his research
experience in emotional and sexual matters proved valuable and effective. The content
of his interviews did not appear to be compromised by the fact that he was a male
interviewer interviewing male subjects; nor did it differ significantly from the
content of the interviews that I had conducted. Interviews were analysed using Edley
and Wetherell's (1997) interpretative discourse analysis. Discourses of bodies or
physiques in constructions of masculinity among this group of South African soldiers,
and how these intersect with their sexuality in relation to the dominant discourses
of masculinity were identified. In the following section, direct transcriptions from
the interviews are presented to illustrate the discursive themes that emerged.
Pseudonyms are used to identify participants. MASCULINITY AND THE BODY. The
centrality of the body to masculinity emerged strongly in participants' discussions
in the interviews (Connell, 2000). As Connell argues, institutions and discourses
have attached social meanings to bodies. In the military, particular emphasis is
placed on physical fitness and strength in achieving masculinity and successful
military status (Klein, 1999). Some illustrative examples below highlight the
importance of physicality in the home environment that articulate with patriarchal
discourses related to protecting women: John: "Be physically well built I would say.
Um, in terms of relationships for me to be able to make my girlfriend or my lady
quite happy. That in a relationship there must be protection &#x2026; so in the end I
must give her everything that she can have. Then I feel like a real a man in my
relationship". Sam: "I want to be the father figure in the house&#x2026; I must be
able to give my family anything. I must be physically strong and work so as to
protect my family". John's excerpt below further shows how even if the body does not
fit the ideal, being in the military can alter one's construct of self as "not male
enough". His excerpt further underlines the centrality of a particular ideal body
image in constructions of masculinity. 30 Despite the information that he "looks like
a teddy bear", and therefore does not achieve the ideal masculine image at the bodily
level to start with, joining the military acts to reconstruct this and prove his
masculinity. Thus the identity of a military man interestingly serves to undermine
the social construction of him as "not man enough" with respect to his body: John:
"If you've got your own occupation you'll be able to do whatever is required of you
[&#x2026;] I don't really, personally, again, I don't really care about what people
think about me. My soft voice or physique about my stomach and my backside, but ja, I
don't really care about what people think about me. You know because I've been
characterised as a &#x2026; they used to call me a teddy bear that was when there was
nothing (pointing to the beard) at that stage, that was when I joined the army. And I
never felt like threatened". The excerpt above demonstrates that inspite of the
social pressures to conform to an ideal body for men, which is also perpetuated in
the military, being in the military can also destabilise such pressures to conform to
the general ideal image as legitimacy of masculinity is assured by the status of the
military man. Rubin (1993) suggests that the biological body should be acknowledged
as experienced through cultural meaning and goes beyond the mere physicality of the
body to the way in which it is represented. Similarly, participants in this study,
raise the significance of the adornment of the body, with emphasis on dressing and
the role of the media in reinforcing bodily concerns for men: Simon: "You don't read
Cosmo [Cosmopolitan] (laughing). I enjoy, I shave, put moisturiser on, I look after
my body, ok. I put some weight down, I enjoy &#x2026; I don't want to be this, you
know you get a guy who thinks he is a man because he's got a lot of chesty hair, he
has a moustache, he is healthy. I want to look good. I want to be a man but I want to
dress well. I wanna look good. I want to make an impression, so I want to cut my
nails, I want to clean my nails &#x2026;". Interestingly, the excerpt from Simon
speaks of men's bodily concerns shifting towards those traditionally constructed as
more feminine - that of wearing nice clothes and using moisturisers etc. This points
not only to increased advertising of such products for men, but also to the way male
discourses are changing under consumer pressure. The excerpt is about the new forms
of masculinity and the body which is impacted on by consumerism. It throws up
concerns about appropriately "doing" masculinity but also highlights the emphasis on
male neatness and bodily presentability in achieving military status. On the other
hand, the following excerpt is about the important link between the body and
attracting women, another key component of hegemonic masculinity: Gerhard: "If you
really are a true man, then every true man has got blood in him and that blood is
causing him to look at the other, the other gender also so obviously you want to
sometimes impress some of the ladies, and um you won't do that by dressing like a
clown or a idiot or whatever. [] I think um just to dress neatly, clean, try and read
Men's Health more often and see what the the dressing tips, how to make a tie, how to
wear which shoes with which clothes and or which pants and belt and all that type of
things. Putting a bit of aftershave on maybe now and then when you go out, and put 31
The excerpt from Gerhard emphasises cleanliness and "looking after himself" primarily
in relation to attracting women. Here masculinity and the centrality of the body as
representative of successful masculinity are constructed in relation to women's
sexuality and their responses to men. This ties in with McFadden's (1992) argument
that in all societies and cultures, dressing and physical appearance are key to the
constructions of sexuality. In this view physical appearance is culturally
constructed and being sexual is related to the clothes that individuals wear and how
they appear to others. Furthermore, the excerpts show that some participants join the
military for the status afforded the soldier which is symbolised by physical
representation, primarily the clothing (uniform) which also powerfully impacts on the
constructions of body image (Craik, 2005). The emphasis in the following excerpts is
the way in which the uniform becomes an extension of the body:<component x="65.22"

uniform and I walk in there between the girls, then I'm feeling two feet taller.
Really, I think it's the, it's the feeling of pride [&#x2026;] It's a nice feeling to
be in uniform, I think even nicer if you're walking between civilians on the street
and people are looking at you". It is interesting to note that Gerhard feels good
when walking amongst the girls. This suggests that a body in a "nice" uniform exerts
a comforting effect and creates confidence when among women. The uniform further
confers a sense of masculinity, and facilitates a sense of masculinity that is viewed
as superior to that of civilian men. Gerhard further mentioned that his friend also
feels like "showing off" when he is in Stellenbosch: Gerhard: "He would walk up
straight like this (demonstrating with shoulders up)". The importance of the uniform
in conferring status in the military and in achieving masculinity suggests that the
social structure of the military creates gender patterns which not only give male
soldiers a sense of masculinity through the danger associated with their profession,
but also a sense of strength through observable symbols, primarily that of the
uniform. Similarly Craik (2005) argues that military uniforms convey power relations,
status, authority and roles, and serve to shape the way individuals construct
identities. As Connell (2000) also puts it, bodily practices ranging across dress,
sport and sexuality locate and modify bodies and subjectivities in society.
Therefore, the desired strong physique and the symbolic implications of the uniform
bring into focus the centrality of bodies in the military in forming a particular
type of masculine identity. Returning to the participant Simon who perceives
cleanliness as a symbol of manliness (Barrett, 1996), it is important to mention that
he also spoke of dirtiness as key to male performance in certain military
environments. Therefore dirtiness in a different context can also signify manhood: 32
Simon: "It depends [on] a situation. Once we go to Lehotla (South African Army Combat
Training Unit), I don't want to be clean. I will be dirty because we are at Lehotla".
A body in dirty clothes is said to be one of the key principles of military training,
demonstrating the hard work that is expected from "real men" (Service Sound and
Vision Corporation, 1995, cited in Woodward, 2000). The body intersecting with ethnic
rites of passage. Factors relevant to constructions of masculinity within different
cultural groups can play a significant role in the interpretation of masculinity. For
example, an initiation ritual performed on the body is also about proving bodily
strength and the body is also physically impacted on as a sign of this transition, as
in the case of circumcision and/or other physical challenges associated with certain
traditional rites of passage. In studying the construction of masculinity among
isiXhosa-speaking men, a selfconscious masculinity which gives circumcised men a
voice of authority and decisionmaking rights has been reported (Gqola &amp; Goniwe,
2005; Gqola, 2007). Similarly in the current study, Mtobeli, who is circumcised,
confirms that the initiation ritual symbolises manhood or masculinity, but maintains
that he does not feel more of a man in the military because of initiation and that
traditional practices may not translate seamlessly into similar hierarchal practices
in the military: Mtobeli: "Because I'm in the military I will compromise. It's like
now here we have boys who call us by name and you don't &#x2026; you don't have a
choice because at home the boys &#x2026; boys don't call me by name [ ] but in the
military they call you by name. Then I will accept it because I'm in the military".
On the other hand, a coloured participant, Jeff did raise the issue, highlighting how
such discourses are prevalent in the military. Jeff was wary of the implication that
circumcision conferred manhood, while not being circumcised held men in perpetual
limbo. He questions the initiation as necessarily illustrative of being a man. Jeff:
"Somebody does not automatically become a man just because he spent three or four
months in the bush in a little camp". Jeff further argues that circumcising immature
boys puts a lot of pressure on them to prove their masculinity. He argues that this
becomes problematic for them, for other ethnic groups, and for military culture. For
him, men who are circumcised create animosity in the military as they undermine the
rank structure. He quoted the example that if a group from a certain department is
given a task which requires one person to lead the group, a person who is circumcised
would be selected, or there might be conflict: Jeff: "[A circumcised man] would try
to force, even though he wasn't appointed by a senior official as being the leader.
He wanted to enforce his authority because he was, he was a man. And there was many
times that I've heard where a black guy would tell a white guy and a coloured guy,
'I'm a man, you're still a boy. You haven't proven Clearly the notion of
subordination is as important to masculinity as the notion of hegemony. Statements by
these participants show that a complex understanding of masculinity should take
account of systems of race, ethnicity and class. As other theorists have noted,
cultural processes, political needs and consolidation of power (both in the military
culture and other cultures) enable, deny, impose and constrain expressions of
masculinity and create power imbalances that necessitate dichotomies of who is good
or bad, weak or violent (Connell, 1995; Dowsett, 2003; Morrell, 1998). To add
complexity, it is evident that there may also be a clash between military discourse
and the discourse of circumcision, as both discourses compete in defining hegemonic
masculinity. What is central in both definitions is the body. A caution though is
that other than the isiXhosa-speaking men, there are other African groups and Jews
who practice male circumcision and participants did not make reference to them.
Therefore, before more can be said, further research needs to be done in order to
bring these discourses to the surface and unpack the extent to which they impact on
male identities. Militarisation of the body: Weapons as extensions of self. The
weapons used in the military are similarly viewed as extensions of the military body
or like the uniform, as an accessory that adds bodily value. For some participants
having a weapon on their body represent both a real and symbolic idealisation of
aggression and as such functions as an extension of the militarised body. Military
weapons and their implicit threat of aggression arguably constitute the ideals of
hegemonic masculinity (Cock, 2001). A study conducted by Heinecken and Khanyile
(1996) found that weaponry was indeed a motivating factor for joining the military.
Similarly, most participants in the present study expressed satisfaction and even
pleasure in carrying a rifle, concurring that it provides a sense of manhood. A few
excerpts demonstrate this: John: "At first, when we started with our training, it
felt good, okay. Yoh! I used to go home after my first weapons training and so, and I
used to brag with this weapon, so yes, to a certain degree it make you feel better or
special then you see [&#x2026;] It definitely give a boost to manhood". Military
training in the sense of reinforcing masculinity has clearly worked for this
participant. Similarly, carrying a rifle brings a sense of masculine achievement and
is experienced as a powerful visceral experience for most participants: Tshepo: "You
just want to drill, drill, you feel like ja [yes] ja [yes] I am in the army. [ ] You
think that this thing is gonna explode [&#x2026;] On the other hand there is that
excitement". Gerhard: "The first time you do it, you feel like yoh! This is the big
world. Once again every now and then when you handle a weapon again after a long
time, once again you get that shaky feeling. You get that adrenalin rush". Gerhard
elaborates: "It's just like in a relationship also, at first, everything is new to
you, you can't wait just to hold the girl's hand and to kiss her at night and
whatever, but then 34 Interestingly, Gerhard likens the experience of carrying a
rifle with intimate relationships. In a quintessentially patriarchal metaphor, women
are conflated with military weapons, both bringing a similar frisson of excitement
and "otherness" (especially when the relationship with the weapon/woman is new). It
should be noted that Gerhard is a participant who is not sexually active because of
his religious beliefs. Carrying a rifle and sexual intimacy are for him clearly
related and are associated with pleasure and power. This again points to the
intersection between masculinity, sexuality and sexual practices, and highlights the
insidious way in which the military is sexualised (and imbued with the same forms of
gender power relations) as well as sexuality militarised (with woman constructed as
objects, like rifles, to be owned with pride, and which also bring a sense of power)
(Shefer &amp; Mankayi, 2007). Tulani sees the issue of weapons as very much part of
his authority and status, clearly illustrating his power to others even if not
displayed too obviously: Tulani: "I had my own rifle but now when I'm in the car,
then I will put it there, and the troops will see (as if he wanted to cough). When we
are patrolling then I will have my weapon but most of the time my weapon slings, I
like to sling it". In a way similar to Swart's (1998) description, participants in
this study benchmarked their deployment preparedness with guns, and this relates to
the conceptions of a macho body and the willingness to lead in risky situations. The
findings also highlight how particular categories of the military which depend on
more physical strength are viewed as conferring greater military status as well as
greater masculinity. Thus, certain occupations in the military which involve greater
physicality and endurance are more facilitative of masculinity as in this quote in
which being a "parachute man" is seen as reflecting greater physical strength and
therefore higher status both as man and soldier: Simon: "Like I wanted to be a
parachute man, now you get to the Army and you think Hey! I can run force operations.
Hey! I'm stronger than the rest. You go to the parachute training. You look around
and you think, hey! I am better than you. It does definitely work on you". Simon
adds: "I am full of injuries. I have been doing it rough now for 14 years. My ankles
were broken, this ankle had operations, this one was shot, my wrists are sore, all my
fingers have been broken, my knees are going, neck is going to break or busy
cracking. [&#x2026;] So because of work my body is old. I feel I'm 60 years old but
that does not stop me from challenging myself even sexually". Despite all his
injuries which prove the risks involved in his work, Simon challenges himself
sexually. This attests to the perception that a strong well-formed body not only
boosts the sense of masculinity, but is also linked to sexual prowess - having
achieved physically viewed as representing sexual ability. Also evident in this quote
is the way in which material scars of physical achievement, such as the injuries on
his body, are a Male soldiers and civilian male relationships. There was a strong
perception from some participants that civilian men are ignorant and somehow less
knowledgeable about what is happening around the world, implying that civilian men
cannot fully understand the world's issues. The soldiers' direct involvement with
security issues makes them feel as if they have access to direct modes of male power
and privilege that limit civilian men's bodily and intellectual ability to prove
their masculinity, for instance by going to war. A number of reasons for the poor
relationship between soldiers and civilians are evident in the following excerpts,
which also set up the male soldier body in a privileged binary position to the male
civilian body: Tulani: "There are lot of differences, for example ... a soldier is
actually trained not to fear, I'm &#x2026; I may say now some of the soldiers they
fear nothing &#x2026; It is actually their motto that &#x2026; they are actually
different than civilians". John: "I've got this one friend now that is in the police
force so he's actually become competition (laughs) [Interviewer: What is the
competition all about?] He must just know that I'm his boss, stronger than him.
[&#x2026;] Currently he actually is in a more, in a more challenging environment than
me because he's working with criminals, he must go out to, so he's actually doing
more challenging work". The discourse of competition between civilian men and
soldiers is articulated as a major facet of the construction of masculinity among
soldiers and played out through comparisons of physical strength and prowess.
Soldiers' working conditions are risky (Heinecken, 2000), hence there is a
construction that only tough bodies can survive those risky conditions. The emergence
of this idea of masculinity hinges on physical training (Craik, 2005). As soldiers
are risk-takers by profession, they see themselves as more masculine. This results in
soldiers undermining male civilians to the point that mixing with them is negatively
viewed and a sense of confidence and power is attained from comparison with them:
Simon: "When I'm out there, I'm a soldier but I talk civilian shit. [ ] You know we
did a lot of things in the early 1990s that we were just not supposed to talk about.
What you saw, you don't talk about it because its not &#x2026; (couldn't finish) [ ].
You literally became a zombie to see so many dead bodies, so much blood. Once I got
to civics I don't I don't want to talk Army. [ ] I want to escape Army for a while. I
just want to talk about rugby, and &#x2026; and chase the ladies, get away from that.
Recharge". Participants dwell on the notion that being a man is tough and taxing, and
being in the military is particularly demanding for men. On the other hand,
civilians' lack of insight is annoying to soldiers as their knowledge, skills and
capabilities are not recognised by civilians: Tulani: "Civilian guys are actually
&#x2026; are ignorant about the social behaviours of the soldiers. They tend to
generalise the behaviours of the soldiers. Some of them don't understand that there
are rank structures and how those structures work. If they see a Simon: "These days
unfortunately the army has a stigma that, if you're in the army it means you're too
shitty to get a job from outside". Tshepo: "Especially when you have a firearm, they
just take you like&#x2026; Hayi, hayi [no., no], this guy can shoot you, which is not
the case". The lack of recognition from civilians appears to result in soldiers
experiencing a paradoxical sort of powerlessness, a demasculisation which may fuel
their "othering" and undermining of civilian men and their bodies and masculinity.
Interestingly, most participants reported having good relationships with civilian
women. Does that mean women are more knowledgeable and respectful of military
masculinity? It appears that women seem to assist soldiers in proving their
masculinity through their sexual relationships. There is a perceived sexual rivalry
between civilian men and male soldiers. The perceived sexual rivalry seems to be an
overwhelming preoccupation among military men, emerging through a discourse of
competition over the possession of women. Some participants feel that civilian women
admire soldiers above civilian men. According to Sam: Sam: "In the military we've got
a, got a unique lifestyle, see. We do things unique. And some civilians don't like
the way we do things. [Interviewer: Such as?] We pop out say hundred bucks we go to
the bar we say so we sitting over there, here's the money for the night, you just
supply us [&#x2026;] Now, the ladies in the vicinity, usually likes the way we as
soldiers are. Because in the discos we like to er make jokes. Just releasing (taking
break from) the military. Then there usually becomes quarrelling because now the
civilian guys, we break their hearts [Interviewer: Do you quarrel about women?] Yeah.
Definitely. Some women are very funny, you see. Or most of them. Okay, I saw them,
that they like the way that we as soldiers are doing things in a club. We'll get
there, like, properly dressed and some civilian guys, how do I, does not come
properly dress, so there's the first point. Number two is um, especially on pay day,
soldiers, soldiers got little, how can I put it now, they don't care about money,
see, especially on pay days. [&#x2026;] And the women &#x2026; see it is nice in that
group and so they will make some plans to get in the group, you see. And a civilian
guy will see maybe this girl &#x2026;". Again the bodily signifiers of being well
dressed (in well built bodies because of physical training) and possessing and
flaunting money are raised as a sign of masculinity. The competition is also evident
in the following excerpt: Gerhard: "In the military we always look at the civvies
with suspicion. You know the civvies they are slapgat [ ], they are not so lekker
&#x2026; The civilians again think, ja no the military guys think they are so clever
and they are so masculine &#x2026; and they come with their uniform to take our girls
away. Things like that". Gerhard's statement supports Buchbinder (1994) who argues
that discontinuities in male-male relationships are due to suspiciousness of each
other, which may link to the theoretical understanding of how hegemonic masculinity
takes on its identity in relation to other less valued masculinities and femininity.
There were narratives across the 37 sample that showed it is easier for soldiers to
impress and receive favours from younger women. Only one participant disagreed that
women seem to particularly like soldiers. In this respect, it appears that the
military male body is also a more desirable sexual body which links to the pressures
on men to conform to hypersexual masculinity. The sexual body. The imperative to be a
successful sexual body for these military men was very evident in the study. While
men were constructed as sexual actors, acting from bodily desire, women on the
contrary were clearly constructed as sexual objects. In line with Flood's (2000)
findings that women's bodies are constructed as objects for men's pleasure, such a
discourse also emerged in the study. Tulani for example argues that a woman's body
may reach a stage where it does not serve any value to men. In Tulani's construction,
once a woman's body does not provide him with optimal sensation all the time, she
becomes useless: Tulani: "When after a first round then we carry on to [a] second
round and then I find now &#x2026; everything is too relaxed in such a way that I
can't feel that I'm in or out, is where I'll decide [to leave the girl] &#x2026; the
beautifulness of that girl diminishes &#x2026; I feel like having another girlfriend
that is appetising". In this discourse women's bodies are related to as an object of
possession purely for the sake of men's satisfaction or pleasure. Also, the object or
body is disposable after use. When its pleasure-giving value at a physical level is
exhausted, it loses its "value". In this way, women (as body objects) are
interchangeable for men's sexual pleasure and are in some way devalued if they do not
gratify men's sexual desires. Also evident in participants' constructions of their
sexuality was the notion that they operate as men from a basis of physical desire.
Linked with the construction of men's sexuality as very "other" to women, a discourse
positioning men as different to women with respect to the body and its relationship
with emotions also emerges. The assumption is that for men, emotions (for example,
feelings of love) are disconnected from their bodies while for women emotions and
bodily response are enmeshed. An essentialist notion of sex as bodily, linked to
physicality alone, and unemotional for men was evident: Daniel: "Sex for a man is
very unemotional &#x2026; because you're thinking of physical things. You're thinking
of how big her breasts are. You're thinking about [her] bums".<component x="65.22"

have a great pair of breasts, but she's got it and you've noticed it &#x2026;
compliment her. She's got it, why not, [&#x2026;] if it attracts your eye it's like a
good painting, it's there, I mean, and if that feeling of yours become way stronger
than, ja, it does". The training and everyday business of the military focuses
strongly on physical strength and bodily appearance (Barrett, 1996; Presidential
Commission, 1992). Bearing in mind the above excerpts, the way soldiers regard sex
and women's bodies appears to be In a related vein, the participant, Bongi,
articulates the oft-repeated idea that men are encouraged to separate sexual
intercourse from emotion, and then fixate on the intercourse and its pleasures
grounded in and through the bodies of women. That is where "the real action" is for
men. That is where it begins and ends for them: Bongi: "Men are not taking sex as
something that [has] to be emotional. They're just taking [sex] as a physical thing,
and that's it. There you have it. Period. End of debate". Because men are encouraged
to construct male and female bodies and male and female sexualities as classic binary
opposites, this separation between "emotion" (as in meaningful, sincere human
connection) and sexual intercourse makes it easier for men to perpetrate sexual
misuses or abuses. The discourse of separating love from sex is also found in other
studies (Holland, Ramazanoglu, Scott, Sharpe &amp; Thomson, 1991; Shefer, 1999). In
this discourse on male and female, masculine and feminine sexualities and their
expressions, women tend to offer men a "relationship" when what men really want is
physical or bodily pleasure. And when this happens men "dive for cover": Bongi: "Many
men tend to withdraw. Because, [they] see [they're] not getting what [they] want.
What they want is a physical thing, a woman's body". These findings highlight the
imperative for men, apparently more exaggerated in the military setting, to separate
emotional connection from their sexual relationships. As has been shown in studies
with civilian populations, being strong, being hypermasculine links to sexual
prowess. Participants construct men's bodies as sexually active and as always
desiring women, as in the widely cited "male sexual drive discourse" (Hollway, 1989),
yet only at a bodily physical level. The ways in which such a construction of male
sexuality facilitates unsafe sexual practices is more than evident. CONCLUSION. This
article has examined how a group of male soldiers construct and construe their bodies
in relation to masculinity and their identity as men in the military. Their responses
illuminate the diversity of discourses the participants draw on to explain what it is
to be masculine and how this is achieved in and through their bodies. There is a
complex relationship between the male body and masculinity, particularly as this
relationship is played out within the military. In particular, male soldiers define
their masculinities powerfully in opposition to others, specifically male civilians
and women, and this is played out through bodily narratives. In sum, being in the
military clearly emphasises the centrality of the body or physical representation
evident also in normative performances of masculinity outside the military, yet
apparently exaggerated in the military context. The study further highlights how body
deficits and nonconformity to the masculine physical ideal also can be overcome by
being a soldier. The military uniform and apparatus (in particular fire-arms) serve
as evidence of being hypermasculine (and therefore hypersexual, which further
confirms hegemonic masculinity). Military scars in or on the body are a further
representation of successful masculinity and superiority to other men at a physical
(and therefore, sexual) level. Another important finding in respect of the body and
the military is that the more risky, 39 The powerful and multiple roles of the body
in the construction of masculinity in the military highlights the importance of this
knowledge in attempts to challenge unsafe sexual practices among military. While many
of these findings mirror those emerging with civilian men, there are clearly some
contextual components of the military that exaggerate a preoccupation and centring of
the body and extensions of the military body (uniform and weapons) in the
construction of dominant forms of masculinity in the military. Clearly many of these
constructions facilitate practices of multiple and risky sexuality in many ways. In
order to challenge risky sexual practices emerging out of hypermasculinity and
hypersexuality, researchers need to further explore constructions of masculinity
among military men and their complex enmeshment with the physical representation and
performance of the body in order to inform interventions that speak to the particular
context of this group of men. Acknowledgements. Thanks are due to Professors Tamara

such as gender, culture, race, age and class play a major role in constructing
masculinity, this paper looks at how these intersect with the body and what
discourses of masculinity and sexualities are in evidence in this respect in the
overtly masculinist context of the military. Drawing on data from a larger study
exploring 14 military men's narratives on their masculinity, sexuality, sexual
relationships and HIV/AIDS, the findings illustrate how successful masculinity in the
military context is played out through particular bodily performances, including
being physically strong, proving one's strength through high risk military
activities, and through hypersexuality. There is evidence that the body and other
bodily representations and accessories related to being in the military (uniform,
weapons, etc.) is a key area in which masculine identity is performed by men in this
institution. The suggestion is that male sexual practices cannot be tackled without
examining the intersection of the body and masculine identity and in the military
this means a particular focus on the way in which the body is centred in performances
and representations of being both a military person and a man. Key words: military,
South Africa, HIV/AIDS, hegemonic masculinity, (hetero)sexuality, bodies
INTRODUCTION. Underpinned by a social constructionist and critical men's studies
approach this paper explores how men in the military construct their masculinity/ies
in relation to their bodies. These approaches argue that the gender identities and
performances of men are socially constructed, changeable and often contradictory,
hence the term "masculinities" rather than a single "masculinity" (Morrell, 1998,
2002; Moynihan, 1998; Connell, 2000). National and international critical men's
studies emphasise the importance of looking at both local and global contexts when
exploring masculinities. This study, though not discarding the importance of global
contexts, privileges the local institutional context. Interpretation is focused on
the manner in which soldiers in the South African National Defence Force (SANDF)
construct their masculinity and sexuality and the role that the body and bodily
representation play in the construction of their masculinity and sexuality, which in
turn are located within the military context and are located within the performance
of various military activities. While the approaches and theories underpinning this
study firmly reject biological determinist positions, they nonetheless acknowledge
and theorise the centrality of the body and the physical in understanding dominant
performances of masculinity. This is especially salient in understanding the way in
which strength and virility have been widely shown to be integral components in the
construction of hegemonic forms of masculinity that are arguably amplified by men in
the military (Connell, 1994, 2000; Hearn, 1996; Cock, 2001). In this context, men's
bodies which are expected to be tough, muscular and macho in many cultural contexts
are particularly central, valued and associated with social and sexual success in
military contexts (Kimmel, 2000; Cock, 2001). This article attempts to look at how a
group of military men's constructions of masculinity intersects with discourses about
the body specifically in the overtly masculinist context of the military which is
itself centred about physicality. The article begins by contextualizing the focus in
the article through a brief history of the South African military and its
post-apartheid transformation before turning to a theoretical overview of the role of
the body in the social construction of masculinity. The article then goes on to
outline the study and unpack the key discourses that reflect the ways in which
dominant discourses of masculinity intersect with discourses on the body and
physicality for this group of military men. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN
MILITARY. The South African Defence Force (SADF) had extensive operational deployment
experience inside the country. In the 1970s compulsory military service for young,
fit and white South African men was introduced. During the 1980s, the SADF took on
increasing responsibility for internal security matters, providing the South African
Police (SAP) with considerable support in their attempt to crush anti-apartheid
resistance (Stott, 2002). Many SADF conscripts emphasised that the core of military
training was to inculcate aggressiveness and to equate it with masculinity (Cock,
2001). On the eve of the first democratic general election in 1994, the South African
National Defence Force (SANDF) replaced the SADF. This new structure emerged from the
decision to integrate the non-statutory forces of Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) and the
Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA) with the SADF and the Transkei,
Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei (TBVC) forces (Seegers, 1996; Le Roux, 2003). The
transition from the SADF to the SANDF has been tremendously complicated and marred by
tension and dissatisfaction (Stott, 2002; Le Roux, 2003; Ngculu, 2003). The short-
and long-term process of replacing the SADF with a truly national defence force
comprising statutory and non-statutory forces that had been at war for 37 years, was
complex. While literature analyzing current constructions of gender in the military
is scarce there is some work that highlights the centrality of the body. Barrett
(1996) has argued that while the military emphasizes aggression and physical fitness,
the qualities of a "gentleman" hinging around discourses of cleanliness, a neat
appearance and showing attention to detail are also values that the military seeks to
impart. It is also notable that even though the SANDF largely maintains a
masculinised body, in contrast to the SADF, a fairly large proportion of the members
of the new South African military are women. Given the above historical context, the
South African military is not unified or a homogenous structure. It is stratified
across race, gender and class, though its primary identifier remains a masculinist
tradition. Understanding the way in which the body may have been foregrounded in
military institutions requires engaging with theoretical arguments about the way in
which the body and bodily performance has been centred in social constructions of
hegemonic masculinity, highlighting arguments about the particular forms this may
take in the hypermasculine, physicalist context of the military. MASCULINITY AND THE
BODY. Connell (1994) criticises the neglect of the body in theorising gender in terms
of the sex-gender conceptual divide, which emerges from the philosophical mind-body
tradition, and intersects with other classic binary opposites like male-female and
rational-irrational. Connell's concern about the neglect of the body is shared by
other researchers (Vance, 1989; Crossley, 1996; Dowsett, 1996) who appeal for
acknowledgement of the body as an active agent in shaping sexualities, genders and
social processes. These researchers argue not only for the body's agency in social
practice, but also for the material diversity of bodies: "This point is nowhere more
important than in relation to gender. Gender is fundamentally a way in which social
practice is ordered. In gender processes, the everyday conduct of life is ordered in
relation to a reproductive arena&#x2026;This arena includes sexual arousal and
intercourse, childbirth and infant care, bodily sex difference and similarity. It is
thus constituted by the materiality of bodies" (Connell, 2000:58-59). This does not
mean these researchers favour deterministic discourses over sociocultural accounts of
gender. Rather, the notion of "embodiment" is central to a number of contemporary
theoretical perspectives and feminist writings that contribute to understanding human
subjectivity (Jung, 1996; Potts, 2001; Somerville, 2004). If men's bodies are
inextricably relevant to masculinity, then to understand how their bodies intersect
with their masculinities, "we must not abandon the conventional dichotomy between
changing culture and unchanging bodies" (Connell, 2000:57). Echoing Foucault's (1984)
account of the way in which bodies are regulated and disciplined within
socio-cultural and historical processes, Connell argues that social institutions and
discourses have given particular social meaning to gendered bodies. A range of bodily
practices located in particular social contexts - ranging across dress, sport and
sexuality - address or modify bodies. Broadly, the terms of masculinity require men
to have a high level of muscular strength. This suggests that men should be
physically fit and well built (Klein, 1999; GETNET, 2001). Therefore, the body is key
in the construction of successful masculinity (Connell, 2000; Dowsett, 2003;
Lindegger &amp; Maxwell, 2007). Bodies in this view have moved beyond biology, and
play a crucial role in how people construct their masculinity and how they behave/act
in their social surroundings. Within this framework the centrality of bodies and
physicality, particularly the desired strong physique and the symbolic role of the
uniform in the military are clearly of relevance in understanding the discursive
function of body in constructions of military and masculine identity. Masculine body
and the military. Much literature has foregrounded the way in which bodily strength
and physicality is performed in the military. For some men, the physical training
that produces the physical fitness required by the military seems to be a way of
reasserting their 26 manhood, or proving their masculinity (Cohn, 2000). For some,
military service is an inherent part of maturation, a ceremonial transition to
successful male adulthood (Klein, 1999). The military embodies codes of honour that
stress a number of supposedly male virtues. Traditional male virtues or attributes,
such as risk-taking, honour, courage, adventurousness, heroism and sexual virility
are central to constructions of hegemonic masculinity (Enloe, 1988; Nagel, 1998;
Cheng, 1999; Martino, 1999; Heinecken, 2000). These virtues are supposedly tempered
with restraint and dignity, so as to reflect masculine ideals such as liberty,
equality and fraternity (Nagel, 1998). The demands of soldiering require these manly
virtues and the concepts of bravery, fearlessness and persistence to be brought
together (UNAIDS, 1998; Heinecken, 2000). Attaining this masculine ideal appears to
hinge around soldiers' material bodies. Furthermore, attainment of masculine identity
in the military depends on a soldier's emotional "maturity". The military-masculine
ideology discourages military personnel from admitting they are emotionally
vulnerable as this is potentially threatening to military morale, hence the
ascendance of phrases such as "behave like a soldier" or "take it like a man". Given
that the central function of the military is the preparation for and implementation
of military combat, it could be argued that the institutional context of the military
legitimises and idealises violence, serving to "groom" male bodies for violence
(Cock, 2001; Agostino, 2003). Emotional and physical vulnerability is therefore not
tolerated in the military. It is not only physical strength that is key in the bodily
representation of the military but also the use of weapons viewed as an extension of
the body for military men. Writing about the South African military, Cock (2001)
argues that guns are a key feature of hegemonic masculinity in this context. A strong
association between the military context and high-risk sexual practices have also
been widely argued, with a number of authors arguing that the hypermasculine context
of the military and other aspects of the lived experience of being in the military
facilitates a particular vulnerability to unsafe sexual practices. Okee-Obereng,
(2001) confirms that there is an association between work in the military and
high-risk sexual activity. UNAIDS (1998:3) reported that "the military professional
ethos tends to excuse or even encourage risk-taking". Aggression is valued and is
associated with "conquest". Willingness to accept and take risks is the key feature
in a soldier's preparation for combat, but off the battlefield it might vicariously
motivate soldiers' willingness to engage in needlessly risky behaviour, such as
unprotected sex. Nkosi's (1999:167) quotation from a Malawian soldier demonstrates
the centrality of the male sexual body and performance in the identity of the
military man poignantly: "Soldiers like to conquer. The more women you take to bed
the more you feel like a real man." The above literature highlights the centrality of
physical strength, risk-taking, sexual virility, all part of the embodiment of
masculinity and how hegemonic masculinity and particular forms of idealised male
bodies are central to and exaggerated in military settings. The opposite side of the
coin with respect to the centrality of the body in masculine achievement is the way
in which female soldiers are problematised in the military, which further highlights
the way in which it is a specifically male body that is key to constructions of
success in the military, adding further impetus to the argument of the centrality of
the body in constructions of military masculinity. The feminine body and the
military. Women have almost universally been excluded from warfare. In the first
instance, their biological role (bearing children) and gender roles (raising and
caring for children) were viewed as the inhibiting forces within a patriarchal notion
of the military. The traditional belief in both military and civilian spheres is that
men are protectors and defenders of the country, women and children. The key
underlying argument is that if women die in war, there will be no one to fulfil their
traditional reproductive roles. "New lives can be created, but it takes one woman to
bear each child each year, while one man can father a larger number of children a
year. Numerous women are essential to the replenishment of a population, but only a
few men are required" (Steihm, 1980:56). This seems to be a good argument for
polygamy and the prospect of a patriarchal dividend for the successful surviving
warrior. This is in line with sex role theory whereby men's bodies are seen as the
only ones that should be placed in risky situations, and emerges from old forms of
sexist discourse based on notions that women are the weaker sex while men are
considered strong and brave (Weitzman, 1979; Agostino, 2003). Another common concern
raised is that if women take part in combat, men will concentrate more on defending
them from their common opponents instead of fighting their counterparts (Agostino,
2003), again highlighting the patriarchal discourse of men as women's protectors.
Similarly, sexist notions of women as physically lacking in relation to men abound in
military discourse. Women are described as not having the ability to perform military
tasks that require a high level of muscular strength, such as, for example, the
carrying of heavy equipment and fighting in war, hence many countries have suggested
that women should participate in combat (Presidential Commission, 1992). South Africa
is no different; it has also restricted women from combat. However, Article 9 of the
Constitution of South Africa (1996) instructed that women should be afforded equal
opportunities in, and to, all roles. It is evident that while women are admitted into
the military and lip-service is paid to their achieving equal opportunities, the
dominant discourse remains one in which both male and female bodies are constructed
as fixed essences. The exclusion of women from most aspects of the military is
rationalised in terms of women's physical deficits and assumed masculine power which
is constructed as naturally invested only in male bodies. This construction leaves no
or little space for women to be fully integrated and accepted in the military, as
male bodies are viewed within dominant cultural discourses as superior to female
bodies with respect to required performances for the military role (Agostino, 2003).
While the literature flags the body as a key terrain for the performance of
masculinity in and outside of military contexts, there is little work that
specifically explores discourses of the male body among military men. This article
emerges out of a larger study that attempted to understand social constructions of
masculinity and sexuality among a group of military men in the South African
military. METHODOLOGY. A qualitative, feminist study looking at how men in the
military construct their masculinity and how their constructions reportedly link with
sexual practices was conducted with a group of male soldiers in a South African
military institution. The method used is an analysis and interpretation of 14
transcribed individual in-depth interviews with male soldiers enrolled in a tertiary
institution pursuing a career in the military. As the participants were students,
they were all junior officers with ranks ranging from lieutenant to captain. All
participants had been in the military for more than four years. The participants were
between the ages of 24 to 33 years, a group regarded as sexually active and at high
risk of HIV infection (Heinecken, 2001). Twelve participants were single, two were
married. They all identified themselves as heterosexuals. While acknowledging that
there are multiple forms of sexual identity and sexual practice, heterosexuality
became the point of departure in this article as the military setting is dominated by
heteronormative practices of masculine (Holland, Ramazanoglu, Scott, Sharpe &amp;
Thomson, 1996). This is in line with local research indicating that the social
construction of dominant masculinity is powerfully based on the successful
performance of heterosexual prowess (for example, Hunt, 1989; Campbell, 2001;
Dunbar-Moodie, 2001). 1 There were seven African participants, four whites and three
coloureds . Representivity during sampling is not regarded as crucial when doing
qualitative research. However, the decision was taken to consider a sample that
represents some of South African diversity with respect to categories set up by
apartheid and still of salience in the construction of identity today. This decision
was based on the assumption that a diverse sample might facilitate the possibility of
diverse stories and narratives being heard which could contribute significantly to
the nature and content of future HIV/AIDS interventions. It is worth highlighting by
way of illustrating the diversity of the narratives across historical apartheid
categories that white participants joined the military for different reasons than
African participants. For example, all white participants in this study expressed the
belief that soldiering is "a calling". This reference to the "calling" of soldiers is
often central in the stories about how they came to their current occupations. In
contrast, all the African reported that they joined the military for socio-economic
reasons. This highlights the racialised class inequalities that existed during the
apartheid era and their impact thereafter. It is worth pointing out, though, that all
of the African participants appreciate the military for the same reasons
(representing the country and positive male identity) as their white colleagues. This
points to the argument that the processes of racialisation and its intersection with
masculine identity are fluid, and variations reflect changes in politics and social
discourse. The interviews were approximately an hour to an hour-and-a-half long, and
explored the multiple ways in which these participants speak about their construction
and performance of masculinity. One of the emerging themes related to the way in
which they construct their bodies in relation their construction of their
masculinity. The author anticipated that the interview format and use of vignettes
would elicit rich and detailed data from the participants and not force the
interviews in a preconceived direction.<component x="65.22" y="304.32" width="468.22"

concerned that being a female might lead participants to perceive of me as a feminist
who might be judgmental of them as men. Although there is an assumption that people
of the same gender are able to connect better in an interview situation, Scully
(1990) found the opposite to be true in her study when, compared to her male
colleague, she appeared to connect better with the male participants and obtained
greater levels of disclosure. Similarly, I found that I was able to communicate well
with the male participants. This might be due to my experience of being a
psychologist in the military, and having to deal mostly with men in my day-today work
in the institution. To counteract any barriers based on gender, an experienced male
interviewer was coopted to conduct three interviews. This served to ascertain whether
gender and other aspects of social identity (for example, age, race and language)
impacted in any way on the interview process or created discomfort for the male
participants (Phoenix, 1994; Shefer et al, 2005). Further, this helped ensure a
different data set, outside of my influence. The male interviewer was selected based
on his excellent interpersonal skills, open-mindedness, and expertise on the subject
of gender and sexuality. His training as a clinical psychologist and his research
experience in emotional and sexual matters proved valuable and effective. The content
of his interviews did not appear to be compromised by the fact that he was a male
interviewer interviewing male subjects; nor did it differ significantly from the
content of the interviews that I had conducted. Interviews were analysed using Edley
and Wetherell's (1997) interpretative discourse analysis. Discourses of bodies or
physiques in constructions of masculinity among this group of South African soldiers,
and how these intersect with their sexuality in relation to the dominant discourses
of masculinity were identified. In the following section, direct transcriptions from
the interviews are presented to illustrate the discursive themes that emerged.
Pseudonyms are used to identify participants. MASCULINITY AND THE BODY. The
centrality of the body to masculinity emerged strongly in participants' discussions
in the interviews (Connell, 2000). As Connell argues, institutions and discourses
have attached social meanings to bodies. In the military, particular emphasis is
placed on physical fitness and strength in achieving masculinity and successful
military status (Klein, 1999). Some illustrative examples below highlight the
importance of physicality in the home environment that articulate with patriarchal
discourses related to protecting women: John: "Be physically well built I would say.
Um, in terms of relationships for me to be able to make my girlfriend or my lady
quite happy. That in a relationship there must be protection &#x2026; so in the end I
must give her everything that she can have. Then I feel like a real a man in my
relationship". Sam: "I want to be the father figure in the house&#x2026; I must be
able to give my family anything. I must be physically strong and work so as to
protect my family". John's excerpt below further shows how even if the body does not
fit the ideal, being in the military can alter one's construct of self as "not male
enough". His excerpt further underlines the centrality of a particular ideal body
image in constructions of masculinity. 30 Despite the information that he "looks like
a teddy bear", and therefore does not achieve the ideal masculine image at the bodily
level to start with, joining the military acts to reconstruct this and prove his
masculinity. Thus the identity of a military man interestingly serves to undermine
the social construction of him as "not man enough" with respect to his body: John:
"If you've got your own occupation you'll be able to do whatever is required of you
[&#x2026;] I don't really, personally, again, I don't really care about what people
think about me. My soft voice or physique about my stomach and my backside, but ja, I
don't really care about what people think about me. You know because I've been
characterised as a &#x2026; they used to call me a teddy bear that was when there was
nothing (pointing to the beard) at that stage, that was when I joined the army. And I
never felt like threatened". The excerpt above demonstrates that inspite of the
social pressures to conform to an ideal body for men, which is also perpetuated in
the military, being in the military can also destabilise such pressures to conform to
the general ideal image as legitimacy of masculinity is assured by the status of the
military man. Rubin (1993) suggests that the biological body should be acknowledged
as experienced through cultural meaning and goes beyond the mere physicality of the
body to the way in which it is represented. Similarly, participants in this study,
raise the significance of the adornment of the body, with emphasis on dressing and
the role of the media in reinforcing bodily concerns for men: Simon: "You don't read
Cosmo [Cosmopolitan] (laughing). I enjoy, I shave, put moisturiser on, I look after
my body, ok. I put some weight down, I enjoy &#x2026; I don't want to be this, you
know you get a guy who thinks he is a man because he's got a lot of chesty hair, he
has a moustache, he is healthy. I want to look good. I want to be a man but I want to
dress well. I wanna look good. I want to make an impression, so I want to cut my
nails, I want to clean my nails &#x2026;". Interestingly, the excerpt from Simon
speaks of men's bodily concerns shifting towards those traditionally constructed as
more feminine - that of wearing nice clothes and using moisturisers etc. This points
not only to increased advertising of such products for men, but also to the way male
discourses are changing under consumer pressure. The excerpt is about the new forms
of masculinity and the body which is impacted on by consumerism. It throws up
concerns about appropriately "doing" masculinity but also highlights the emphasis on
male neatness and bodily presentability in achieving military status. On the other
hand, the following excerpt is about the important link between the body and
attracting women, another key component of hegemonic masculinity: Gerhard: "If you
really are a true man, then every true man has got blood in him and that blood is
causing him to look at the other, the other gender also so obviously you want to
sometimes impress some of the ladies, and um you won't do that by dressing like a
clown or a idiot or whatever. [] I think um just to dress neatly, clean, try and read
Men's Health more often and see what the the dressing tips, how to make a tie, how to
wear which shoes with which clothes and or which pants and belt and all that type of
things. Putting a bit of aftershave on maybe now and then when you go out, and put 31
The excerpt from Gerhard emphasises cleanliness and "looking after himself" primarily
in relation to attracting women. Here masculinity and the centrality of the body as
representative of successful masculinity are constructed in relation to women's
sexuality and their responses to men. This ties in with McFadden's (1992) argument
that in all societies and cultures, dressing and physical appearance are key to the
constructions of sexuality. In this view physical appearance is culturally
constructed and being sexual is related to the clothes that individuals wear and how
they appear to others. Furthermore, the excerpts show that some participants join the
military for the status afforded the soldier which is symbolised by physical
representation, primarily the clothing (uniform) which also powerfully impacts on the
constructions of body image (Craik, 2005). The emphasis in the following excerpts is
the way in which the uniform becomes an extension of the body:<component x="65.22"

uniform and I walk in there between the girls, then I'm feeling two feet taller.
Really, I think it's the, it's the feeling of pride [&#x2026;] It's a nice feeling to
be in uniform, I think even nicer if you're walking between civilians on the street
and people are looking at you". It is interesting to note that Gerhard feels good
when walking amongst the girls. This suggests that a body in a "nice" uniform exerts
a comforting effect and creates confidence when among women. The uniform further
confers a sense of masculinity, and facilitates a sense of masculinity that is viewed
as superior to that of civilian men. Gerhard further mentioned that his friend also
feels like "showing off" when he is in Stellenbosch: Gerhard: "He would walk up
straight like this (demonstrating with shoulders up)". The importance of the uniform
in conferring status in the military and in achieving masculinity suggests that the
social structure of the military creates gender patterns which not only give male
soldiers a sense of masculinity through the danger associated with their profession,
but also a sense of strength through observable symbols, primarily that of the
uniform. Similarly Craik (2005) argues that military uniforms convey power relations,
status, authority and roles, and serve to shape the way individuals construct
identities. As Connell (2000) also puts it, bodily practices ranging across dress,
sport and sexuality locate and modify bodies and subjectivities in society.
Therefore, the desired strong physique and the symbolic implications of the uniform
bring into focus the centrality of bodies in the military in forming a particular
type of masculine identity. Returning to the participant Simon who perceives
cleanliness as a symbol of manliness (Barrett, 1996), it is important to mention that
he also spoke of dirtiness as key to male performance in certain military
environments. Therefore dirtiness in a different context can also signify manhood: 32
Simon: "It depends [on] a situation. Once we go to Lehotla (South African Army Combat
Training Unit), I don't want to be clean. I will be dirty because we are at Lehotla".
A body in dirty clothes is said to be one of the key principles of military training,
demonstrating the hard work that is expected from "real men" (Service Sound and
Vision Corporation, 1995, cited in Woodward, 2000). The body intersecting with ethnic
rites of passage. Factors relevant to constructions of masculinity within different
cultural groups can play a significant role in the interpretation of masculinity. For
example, an initiation ritual performed on the body is also about proving bodily
strength and the body is also physically impacted on as a sign of this transition, as
in the case of circumcision and/or other physical challenges associated with certain
traditional rites of passage. In studying the construction of masculinity among
isiXhosa-speaking men, a selfconscious masculinity which gives circumcised men a
voice of authority and decisionmaking rights has been reported (Gqola &amp; Goniwe,
2005; Gqola, 2007). Similarly in the current study, Mtobeli, who is circumcised,
confirms that the initiation ritual symbolises manhood or masculinity, but maintains
that he does not feel more of a man in the military because of initiation and that
traditional practices may not translate seamlessly into similar hierarchal practices
in the military: Mtobeli: "Because I'm in the military I will compromise. It's like
now here we have boys who call us by name and you don't &#x2026; you don't have a
choice because at home the boys &#x2026; boys don't call me by name [ ] but in the
military they call you by name. Then I will accept it because I'm in the military".
On the other hand, a coloured participant, Jeff did raise the issue, highlighting how
such discourses are prevalent in the military. Jeff was wary of the implication that
circumcision conferred manhood, while not being circumcised held men in perpetual
limbo. He questions the initiation as necessarily illustrative of being a man. Jeff:
"Somebody does not automatically become a man just because he spent three or four
months in the bush in a little camp". Jeff further argues that circumcising immature
boys puts a lot of pressure on them to prove their masculinity. He argues that this
becomes problematic for them, for other ethnic groups, and for military culture. For
him, men who are circumcised create animosity in the military as they undermine the
rank structure. He quoted the example that if a group from a certain department is
given a task which requires one person to lead the group, a person who is circumcised
would be selected, or there might be conflict: Jeff: "[A circumcised man] would try
to force, even though he wasn't appointed by a senior official as being the leader.
He wanted to enforce his authority because he was, he was a man. And there was many
times that I've heard where a black guy would tell a white guy and a coloured guy,
'I'm a man, you're still a boy. You haven't proven Clearly the notion of
subordination is as important to masculinity as the notion of hegemony. Statements by
these participants show that a complex understanding of masculinity should take
account of systems of race, ethnicity and class. As other theorists have noted,
cultural processes, political needs and consolidation of power (both in the military
culture and other cultures) enable, deny, impose and constrain expressions of
masculinity and create power imbalances that necessitate dichotomies of who is good
or bad, weak or violent (Connell, 1995; Dowsett, 2003; Morrell, 1998). To add
complexity, it is evident that there may also be a clash between military discourse
and the discourse of circumcision, as both discourses compete in defining hegemonic
masculinity. What is central in both definitions is the body. A caution though is
that other than the isiXhosa-speaking men, there are other African groups and Jews
who practice male circumcision and participants did not make reference to them.
Therefore, before more can be said, further research needs to be done in order to
bring these discourses to the surface and unpack the extent to which they impact on
male identities. Militarisation of the body: Weapons as extensions of self. The
weapons used in the military are similarly viewed as extensions of the military body
or like the uniform, as an accessory that adds bodily value. For some participants
having a weapon on their body represent both a real and symbolic idealisation of
aggression and as such functions as an extension of the militarised body. Military
weapons and their implicit threat of aggression arguably constitute the ideals of
hegemonic masculinity (Cock, 2001). A study conducted by Heinecken and Khanyile
(1996) found that weaponry was indeed a motivating factor for joining the military.
Similarly, most participants in the present study expressed satisfaction and even
pleasure in carrying a rifle, concurring that it provides a sense of manhood. A few
excerpts demonstrate this: John: "At first, when we started with our training, it
felt good, okay. Yoh! I used to go home after my first weapons training and so, and I
used to brag with this weapon, so yes, to a certain degree it make you feel better or
special then you see [&#x2026;] It definitely give a boost to manhood". Military
training in the sense of reinforcing masculinity has clearly worked for this
participant. Similarly, carrying a rifle brings a sense of masculine achievement and
is experienced as a powerful visceral experience for most participants: Tshepo: "You
just want to drill, drill, you feel like ja [yes] ja [yes] I am in the army. [ ] You
think that this thing is gonna explode [&#x2026;] On the other hand there is that
excitement". Gerhard: "The first time you do it, you feel like yoh! This is the big
world. Once again every now and then when you handle a weapon again after a long
time, once again you get that shaky feeling. You get that adrenalin rush". Gerhard
elaborates: "It's just like in a relationship also, at first, everything is new to
you, you can't wait just to hold the girl's hand and to kiss her at night and
whatever, but then 34 Interestingly, Gerhard likens the experience of carrying a
rifle with intimate relationships. In a quintessentially patriarchal metaphor, women
are conflated with military weapons, both bringing a similar frisson of excitement
and "otherness" (especially when the relationship with the weapon/woman is new). It
should be noted that Gerhard is a participant who is not sexually active because of
his religious beliefs. Carrying a rifle and sexual intimacy are for him clearly
related and are associated with pleasure and power. This again points to the
intersection between masculinity, sexuality and sexual practices, and highlights the
insidious way in which the military is sexualised (and imbued with the same forms of
gender power relations) as well as sexuality militarised (with woman constructed as
objects, like rifles, to be owned with pride, and which also bring a sense of power)
(Shefer &amp; Mankayi, 2007). Tulani sees the issue of weapons as very much part of
his authority and status, clearly illustrating his power to others even if not
displayed too obviously: Tulani: "I had my own rifle but now when I'm in the car,
then I will put it there, and the troops will see (as if he wanted to cough). When we
are patrolling then I will have my weapon but most of the time my weapon slings, I
like to sling it". In a way similar to Swart's (1998) description, participants in
this study benchmarked their deployment preparedness with guns, and this relates to
the conceptions of a macho body and the willingness to lead in risky situations. The
findings also highlight how particular categories of the military which depend on
more physical strength are viewed as conferring greater military status as well as
greater masculinity. Thus, certain occupations in the military which involve greater
physicality and endurance are more facilitative of masculinity as in this quote in
which being a "parachute man" is seen as reflecting greater physical strength and
therefore higher status both as man and soldier: Simon: "Like I wanted to be a
parachute man, now you get to the Army and you think Hey! I can run force operations.
Hey! I'm stronger than the rest. You go to the parachute training. You look around
and you think, hey! I am better than you. It does definitely work on you". Simon
adds: "I am full of injuries. I have been doing it rough now for 14 years. My ankles
were broken, this ankle had operations, this one was shot, my wrists are sore, all my
fingers have been broken, my knees are going, neck is going to break or busy
cracking. [&#x2026;] So because of work my body is old. I feel I'm 60 years old but
that does not stop me from challenging myself even sexually". Despite all his
injuries which prove the risks involved in his work, Simon challenges himself
sexually. This attests to the perception that a strong well-formed body not only
boosts the sense of masculinity, but is also linked to sexual prowess - having
achieved physically viewed as representing sexual ability. Also evident in this quote
is the way in which material scars of physical achievement, such as the injuries on
his body, are a Male soldiers and civilian male relationships. There was a strong
perception from some participants that civilian men are ignorant and somehow less
knowledgeable about what is happening around the world, implying that civilian men
cannot fully understand the world's issues. The soldiers' direct involvement with
security issues makes them feel as if they have access to direct modes of male power
and privilege that limit civilian men's bodily and intellectual ability to prove
their masculinity, for instance by going to war. A number of reasons for the poor
relationship between soldiers and civilians are evident in the following excerpts,
which also set up the male soldier body in a privileged binary position to the male
civilian body: Tulani: "There are lot of differences, for example ... a soldier is
actually trained not to fear, I'm &#x2026; I may say now some of the soldiers they
fear nothing &#x2026; It is actually their motto that &#x2026; they are actually
different than civilians". John: "I've got this one friend now that is in the police
force so he's actually become competition (laughs) [Interviewer: What is the
competition all about?] He must just know that I'm his boss, stronger than him.
[&#x2026;] Currently he actually is in a more, in a more challenging environment than
me because he's working with criminals, he must go out to, so he's actually doing
more challenging work". The discourse of competition between civilian men and
soldiers is articulated as a major facet of the construction of masculinity among
soldiers and played out through comparisons of physical strength and prowess.
Soldiers' working conditions are risky (Heinecken, 2000), hence there is a
construction that only tough bodies can survive those risky conditions. The emergence
of this idea of masculinity hinges on physical training (Craik, 2005). As soldiers
are risk-takers by profession, they see themselves as more masculine. This results in
soldiers undermining male civilians to the point that mixing with them is negatively
viewed and a sense of confidence and power is attained from comparison with them:
Simon: "When I'm out there, I'm a soldier but I talk civilian shit. [ ] You know we
did a lot of things in the early 1990s that we were just not supposed to talk about.
What you saw, you don't talk about it because its not &#x2026; (couldn't finish) [ ].
You literally became a zombie to see so many dead bodies, so much blood. Once I got
to civics I don't I don't want to talk Army. [ ] I want to escape Army for a while. I
just want to talk about rugby, and &#x2026; and chase the ladies, get away from that.
Recharge". Participants dwell on the notion that being a man is tough and taxing, and
being in the military is particularly demanding for men. On the other hand,
civilians' lack of insight is annoying to soldiers as their knowledge, skills and
capabilities are not recognised by civilians: Tulani: "Civilian guys are actually
&#x2026; are ignorant about the social behaviours of the soldiers. They tend to
generalise the behaviours of the soldiers. Some of them don't understand that there
are rank structures and how those structures work. If they see a Simon: "These days
unfortunately the army has a stigma that, if you're in the army it means you're too
shitty to get a job from outside". Tshepo: "Especially when you have a firearm, they
just take you like&#x2026; Hayi, hayi [no., no], this guy can shoot you, which is not
the case". The lack of recognition from civilians appears to result in soldiers
experiencing a paradoxical sort of powerlessness, a demasculisation which may fuel
their "othering" and undermining of civilian men and their bodies and masculinity.
Interestingly, most participants reported having good relationships with civilian
women. Does that mean women are more knowledgeable and respectful of military
masculinity? It appears that women seem to assist soldiers in proving their
masculinity through their sexual relationships. There is a perceived sexual rivalry
between civilian men and male soldiers. The perceived sexual rivalry seems to be an
overwhelming preoccupation among military men, emerging through a discourse of
competition over the possession of women. Some participants feel that civilian women
admire soldiers above civilian men. According to Sam: Sam: "In the military we've got
a, got a unique lifestyle, see. We do things unique. And some civilians don't like
the way we do things. [Interviewer: Such as?] We pop out say hundred bucks we go to
the bar we say so we sitting over there, here's the money for the night, you just
supply us [&#x2026;] Now, the ladies in the vicinity, usually likes the way we as
soldiers are. Because in the discos we like to er make jokes. Just releasing (taking
break from) the military. Then there usually becomes quarrelling because now the
civilian guys, we break their hearts [Interviewer: Do you quarrel about women?] Yeah.
Definitely. Some women are very funny, you see. Or most of them. Okay, I saw them,
that they like the way that we as soldiers are doing things in a club. We'll get
there, like, properly dressed and some civilian guys, how do I, does not come
properly dress, so there's the first point. Number two is um, especially on pay day,
soldiers, soldiers got little, how can I put it now, they don't care about money,
see, especially on pay days. [&#x2026;] And the women &#x2026; see it is nice in that
group and so they will make some plans to get in the group, you see. And a civilian
guy will see maybe this girl &#x2026;". Again the bodily signifiers of being well
dressed (in well built bodies because of physical training) and possessing and
flaunting money are raised as a sign of masculinity. The competition is also evident
in the following excerpt: Gerhard: "In the military we always look at the civvies
with suspicion. You know the civvies they are slapgat [ ], they are not so lekker
&#x2026; The civilians again think, ja no the military guys think they are so clever
and they are so masculine &#x2026; and they come with their uniform to take our girls
away. Things like that". Gerhard's statement supports Buchbinder (1994) who argues
that discontinuities in male-male relationships are due to suspiciousness of each
other, which may link to the theoretical understanding of how hegemonic masculinity
takes on its identity in relation to other less valued masculinities and femininity.
There were narratives across the 37 sample that showed it is easier for soldiers to
impress and receive favours from younger women. Only one participant disagreed that
women seem to particularly like soldiers. In this respect, it appears that the
military male body is also a more desirable sexual body which links to the pressures
on men to conform to hypersexual masculinity. The sexual body. The imperative to be a
successful sexual body for these military men was very evident in the study. While
men were constructed as sexual actors, acting from bodily desire, women on the
contrary were clearly constructed as sexual objects. In line with Flood's (2000)
findings that women's bodies are constructed as objects for men's pleasure, such a
discourse also emerged in the study. Tulani for example argues that a woman's body
may reach a stage where it does not serve any value to men. In Tulani's construction,
once a woman's body does not provide him with optimal sensation all the time, she
becomes useless: Tulani: "When after a first round then we carry on to [a] second
round and then I find now &#x2026; everything is too relaxed in such a way that I
can't feel that I'm in or out, is where I'll decide [to leave the girl] &#x2026; the
beautifulness of that girl diminishes &#x2026; I feel like having another girlfriend
that is appetising". In this discourse women's bodies are related to as an object of
possession purely for the sake of men's satisfaction or pleasure. Also, the object or
body is disposable after use. When its pleasure-giving value at a physical level is
exhausted, it loses its "value". In this way, women (as body objects) are
interchangeable for men's sexual pleasure and are in some way devalued if they do not
gratify men's sexual desires. Also evident in participants' constructions of their
sexuality was the notion that they operate as men from a basis of physical desire.
Linked with the construction of men's sexuality as very "other" to women, a discourse
positioning men as different to women with respect to the body and its relationship
with emotions also emerges. The assumption is that for men, emotions (for example,
feelings of love) are disconnected from their bodies while for women emotions and
bodily response are enmeshed. An essentialist notion of sex as bodily, linked to
physicality alone, and unemotional for men was evident: Daniel: "Sex for a man is
very unemotional &#x2026; because you're thinking of physical things. You're thinking
of how big her breasts are. You're thinking about [her] bums".<component x="65.22"

have a great pair of breasts, but she's got it and you've noticed it &#x2026;
compliment her. She's got it, why not, [&#x2026;] if it attracts your eye it's like a
good painting, it's there, I mean, and if that feeling of yours become way stronger
than, ja, it does". The training and everyday business of the military focuses
strongly on physical strength and bodily appearance (Barrett, 1996; Presidential
Commission, 1992). Bearing in mind the above excerpts, the way soldiers regard sex
and women's bodies appears to be In a related vein, the participant, Bongi,
articulates the oft-repeated idea that men are encouraged to separate sexual
intercourse from emotion, and then fixate on the intercourse and its pleasures
grounded in and through the bodies of women. That is where "the real action" is for
men. That is where it begins and ends for them: Bongi: "Men are not taking sex as
something that [has] to be emotional. They're just taking [sex] as a physical thing,
and that's it. There you have it. Period. End of debate". Because men are encouraged
to construct male and female bodies and male and female sexualities as classic binary
opposites, this separation between "emotion" (as in meaningful, sincere human
connection) and sexual intercourse makes it easier for men to perpetrate sexual
misuses or abuses. The discourse of separating love from sex is also found in other
studies (Holland, Ramazanoglu, Scott, Sharpe &amp; Thomson, 1991; Shefer, 1999). In
this discourse on male and female, masculine and feminine sexualities and their
expressions, women tend to offer men a "relationship" when what men really want is
physical or bodily pleasure. And when this happens men "dive for cover": Bongi: "Many
men tend to withdraw. Because, [they] see [they're] not getting what [they] want.
What they want is a physical thing, a woman's body". These findings highlight the
imperative for men, apparently more exaggerated in the military setting, to separate
emotional connection from their sexual relationships. As has been shown in studies
with civilian populations, being strong, being hypermasculine links to sexual
prowess. Participants construct men's bodies as sexually active and as always
desiring women, as in the widely cited "male sexual drive discourse" (Hollway, 1989),
yet only at a bodily physical level. The ways in which such a construction of male
sexuality facilitates unsafe sexual practices is more than evident. CONCLUSION. This
article has examined how a group of male soldiers construct and construe their bodies
in relation to masculinity and their identity as men in the military. Their responses
illuminate the diversity of discourses the participants draw on to explain what it is
to be masculine and how this is achieved in and through their bodies. There is a
complex relationship between the male body and masculinity, particularly as this
relationship is played out within the military. In particular, male soldiers define
their masculinities powerfully in opposition to others, specifically male civilians
and women, and this is played out through bodily narratives. In sum, being in the
military clearly emphasises the centrality of the body or physical representation
evident also in normative performances of masculinity outside the military, yet
apparently exaggerated in the military context. The study further highlights how body
deficits and nonconformity to the masculine physical ideal also can be overcome by
being a soldier. The military uniform and apparatus (in particular fire-arms) serve
as evidence of being hypermasculine (and therefore hypersexual, which further
confirms hegemonic masculinity). Military scars in or on the body are a further
representation of successful masculinity and superiority to other men at a physical
(and therefore, sexual) level. Another important finding in respect of the body and
the military is that the more risky, 39 The powerful and multiple roles of the body
in the construction of masculinity in the military highlights the importance of this
knowledge in attempts to challenge unsafe sexual practices among military. While many
of these findings mirror those emerging with civilian men, there are clearly some
contextual components of the military that exaggerate a preoccupation and centring of
the body and extensions of the military body (uniform and weapons) in the
construction of dominant forms of masculinity in the military. Clearly many of these
constructions facilitate practices of multiple and risky sexuality in many ways. In
order to challenge risky sexual practices emerging out of hypermasculinity and
hypersexuality, researchers need to further explore constructions of masculinity
among military men and their complex enmeshment with the physical representation and
performance of the body in order to inform interventions that speak to the particular
context of this group of men. Acknowledgements. Thanks are due to Professors Tamara
