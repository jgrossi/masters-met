considered a public health problem and one of the most common disorders among the
people of different countries, currently occupying the fourth place among the
diseases with the greatest lack of capacity and (1) approximately 200 million people
suffer from the same . The World Health Organization estimates that by 2020
depression will be one of the most common disorders and will occupy the second place
among the causes of (2) disease affect and is characterized by subjective feelings of
grief, sorrow, discouragement, loneliness and isolation with changes in thought,
behavior and somatic and affective side which may hinder the normal functioning of
the (3) human being . In Mexico it is estimated a prevalence of depression of 12% to
20% among population of 18-65 years old, (4) 5.8% of them are women and 2.5% are men
. In the state of Veracruz there is currently a rate of depression of (5) 60.6% among
the young population . Adolescence itself face, where it runs the risk of suffering
from depression, and the manifestations vary according to gender, values, emotional
adjustment and educational level, as well as the (2) environment where young people
develop themselves . Sometimes it presents itself as a transient and common problem,
where symptoms can be masked and manifest themselves, in many cases, with substance
abuse, including alcohol and other drugs, as well as aggressive behavior, learning
disorders, propensity to automobile accidents, excessive sexual conduct, compulsion
to games or food, diseases or reckless acts that endanger the lives of (2) young
people . With regard to alcohol consumption half of the world's population consumes
it, even though there are large differences among and within the countries, this
activity is part of the social and cultural practices in many (6) regions of the
world . Alcohol is a psychoactive substance that affects the brain and most body
organs of the consumer, also (6) impacting the people around them, relates to family
. Moreover, the lack of ability to work. It is estimated that in 2004 2.5 million
people around the world died from causes related to alcohol consumption, including
320,000 young people (7) of 15 to 19 years old . In Mexico, the National Survey of
Addictions (N) 2008, indicates that nearly 27 million of Mexicans between 12 and 65
drink large amounts of alcohol, and higher levels of consumption are presented from
18 to 29 among teenagers. For Mexican adolescents beer is the (8) lower proportion,
prepared drinks and wine . Particularly in the state of Veracruz the ENA 2008 reports
that the daily consumption of alcohol for men (0.9%) is below the national average
and women do not present prevalence of daily consumption. The abuse/ (1.5%), numbers
within the national average, but that represent a problem in the state of delicate
health by the (8) absence of regulation on the sale to minors . In young people the
combination of curiosity, the behavior associated with the tendency to take risks and
social pressures are important predisposing factors due constitute an important
factor associated with alcohol (9) consumption in adolescents . Repetitive and
regular consumption of alcohol in leisure moments may generate other problems such as
anxiety and depression, and then some adolescents use alcohol regularly to compensate
the anxiety, depression (10) and lack of positive social qualities . As noted
currently the consumption of alcohol by adolescents is a threat to public health, not
only a negative impact on biological and physical, but also psychological in those
who consume it, which can cause many (11) experience a depressive episode than men .
According to what has been explained above this study aimed to examine if there is a
relationship between the level of depression and the pattern of alcohol consumption
by students of a public school of the city of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico.
Methodology The design of this study was descriptive and transversal. The population
was formed by students from a school located in the suburban area of the city of
Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico. 175 students of both sexes participated in the
sample, registered in the period of 2010 and who was studying in the second and
fourth semester, selected by simple random probability sampling. To collect the data
were used a document with Self-Rating Depression Scale, consisting of 20 Likert type
questions with four response options: 1 (nothing or a few times) 2 (sometimes), 3
(often) and 4 (always); divided into four categories: affective, physiological,
psychomotor and psychological. To determine the level of depression equal to 28
points means no depression, 29 to 41 is mild depression, 42-53 is moderate depression
and 54 points or more is severe depression. Although the high scores do not imply a
diagnosis, allow to analyze the depressive (12,13) syndrome in its different
symptomatic aspects . In this study the reliability reported by this scale was 80. of
Alcohol Use Disorders AUDIT, an instrument with crosscultural validity used to
identify excessive consumption of alcohol; it is composed of 10 reactive, examines
the use of alcohol during the past 12 months and was approved in the Mexican
population. It has a maximum value of 40 points and a minimum value of zero, the
higher score means (14) higher alcohol consumption, dependence and harm . The
internal consistency of the instrument reported in this study was 0.86. In the
ethical aspect the research was based on the provisions of the general law of health
in research for (15) health issued by the Health Secretary in 1987 . For the
realization of the project it was expected the approval of the ethics committee of
the nursing college of Minatitlan campus of Veracruzana University as well as
approval of the authorities of the institution of education. To where through a list
were selected the students who participate in this study and were informed about the
informed consent to ensure the reliability of information study. After formalized
with the signing of the consent, it was proceeded the implementation of the
instruments in a time of approximately 25 minutes. At the end of data collection, its
storage and analysis was proceeded through Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences [SPSS] statistical program, Spanish version 17.0. Results Participate in
this study 80 men (45.7%) and 95 women (54.3%) between 15 and 19 years old with a
mean age of both parents and 6.9% with other family members. that 96.6% of the
participant showed some level of depression according to the measuring scale of Zung.

According to the risky consumption, 13.8% of men manifest this pattern fewer than
reported by women, since 14.7% of those who reported drinking alcoholic beverages do
this in a risky way, data that highlight that these young teens are consuming more
than men, which could trigger an increase in consumption levels if they continue with
that habitual consumption, without discarding a possible future dependency. About the
harmful and damaging consumption they are presented only in men with 6.3% and 2.5%
respectively, data that show the age so low of these young people, it looks like they
have already problems with their way of consuming alcohol. When performing the
analysis of the relationship between alcohol consumption and depression, Table 4
shows that 98.3% of young people reported consuming alcohol and had some level of
depression, but it is important to mention that the majority of students who said not
drinking alcohol also reported some level of depression, as only 1.7% of abstainers
did not show any level of depression. It is worth noting the presence of severe

national average. However it is important to note that be within the national average
does not mean normality and these young people are suffering physical and/or
emotional problems due to their drinking. In relation to gender was observed that men
are showing higher consumption than women. However, this way, fact checking with the
national ENA reported in 2008 (8) alcohol by female adolescents. Regarding the
consumption of alcohol and the level of depression this study found that levels of
moderate and severe depression were presented more frequently in young people who
reported consuming alcohol in the normal, dependent and harmful ways than those who
reported not consuming. A possible relationship between alcohol consumption and the
depression, similar to the (15) , supported the research which found a high
relationship between depression and alcohol consumption. Conclusion The results
showed that most young people have levels of depression and alcohol consumption.
Depression predominated in women and students consumers. This highlights that the
mental health of these young people are being affected by the levels of depression
that they present, situation which, if continues without being resolved, could
increase the risky behaviors, including alcohol consumption, that is only one

national average. However it is important to note that be within the national average
does not mean normality and these young people are suffering physical and/or
emotional problems due to their drinking. In relation to gender was observed that men
are showing higher consumption than women. However, this way, fact checking with the

moderate and severe depression were presented more frequently in young people who
reported consuming alcohol in the normal, dependent and harmful ways than those who
reported not consuming. A possible relationship between alcohol consumption and the

relationship between depression and alcohol consumption. Conclusion The results
showed that most young people have levels of depression and alcohol consumption.
Depression predominated in women and students consumers. This highlights that the
mental health of these young people are being affected by the levels of depression
