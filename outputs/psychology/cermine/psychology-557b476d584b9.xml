        <p>The relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success has been the source of numerous controversies. The present paper conducted a meta-analysis of the longitudinal studies that have investigated intelligence as a predictor of success (as measured by education, occupation, and income). In order to better evaluate the predictive power of intelligence, the paper also includes metaanalyses of parental socioeconomic status (SES) and academic performance (school grades) as predictors of success. The results demonstrate that intelligence is a powerful predictor of success but, on the whole, not an overwhelmingly better predictor than parental SES or grades. Moderator analyses showed that the relationship between intelligence and success is dependent on the age of the sample but there is little evidence of any historical trend in the relationship. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Decades of research on human mental abilities have
demonstrated that the scores of intelligence tests are
positively correlated with several desirable outcomes
and negatively correlated with several undesirable
outcomes. One of the central and personally most
relevant desirable outcomes is socioeconomic success (or
career success), which is usually measured by the
educational level, occupational prestige, and income of an
individual in adulthood. Although it is sometimes
claimed in popular press and textbooks that intelligence has
no relationship to important real-life outcomes (see
Barrett &amp; Depinet, 1991, for a review of such claims), the
scientific research on the topic leaves little doubt that
people with higher scores on IQ tests are better educated,
hold more prestigious occupations, and earn higher
incomes than people with lower scores (Gottfredson,
1997, 2003; Jensen, 1980, 1998; Schmidt &amp; Hunter,
2004).</p>
      <p>Thus, the existence of an overall positive
correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success
is beyond doubt. But quite surprisingly, the mere
existence of this correlation seems to be the only fact
that is established beyond doubt after many decades of
research. Several major questions are still without
definite answers and continue to arouse heated debates
(the debate about The Bell Curve being a prominent
example in recent decades; see Herrnstein &amp; Murray,
1994; Fischer et al., 1996). First, what is the
approximate size of the correlation between
intelligence and success? Is it large enough to be of any
practical importance? While some researchers have
said that this correlation is “larger than most found in
psychological research” (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004:
162), others are convinced that “IQ is just not an
important enough determinant of economic success”
(Bowles &amp; Gintis, 2002: 12). Second, how does the
predictive power of intelligence compare to the
predictive power of other variables, such as parental
socioeconomic status (SES) or school grades? On the
one hand there are studies showing that “individual
ability is by far the strongest influence on
occupational achievement” (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999: 217).
And yet other studies conclude that “the effect of
socioeconomic background on each of the three adult
status variables – schooling, income, and
occupational status – is greater than the effect of childhood
IQ” (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974: 44). Third, are there
any age-related or historical changes in the
relationship between intelligence and success? The question
of historical changes in the importance of IQ has been
particularly controversial with some authors warning
against increasing cognitive stratification (Herrnstein
&amp; Murray, 1994) and others trying to disprove these
claims (Hauser &amp; Huang, 1997).</p>
      <p>The present paper will address these questions by
conducting a meta-analysis of the longitudinal research
on the relationship between intelligence and
socioeconomic success. I will concentrate on longitudinal studies
(where intelligence is measured before the actual
success) because only longitudinal research design allows
us to make conclusions about the possible causal impact
of intelligence on success.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>2. A brief history</title>
      <p>Longitudinal studies on the relationship between
intelligence and career success have been conducted since
the first decades of the 20th century (Ball, 1938;
Thorndike et al., 1934). And these studies have invariably
uncovered a positive relationship. The early studies,
however, did not consider other possible determinants of
success, most importantly parental SES. Therefore, they
were open to the criticism that the positive relationship
between intelligence and success might actually be the
result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp;
Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s,
with the inception of the status attainment research
paradigm, investigators started to construct more
sophisticated models of career advancement that
considered several determinants of success at the same time
(Duncan, 1968; Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp;
Ohlendorf, 1970).</p>
      <p>But it was with the publication of The Bell Curve in
1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the question of
intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to
public attention. Analyzing a representative longitudinal
data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray
found that intelligence is a better predictor of several
desirable outcomes (e.g., not living in poverty, not being
arrested) than is parental SES. They also found evidence
that the role of intelligence in status attainment has been
growing throughout the 20th century and concluded that
the social structure of American society is increasingly
based on mental ability. The ideas of The Bell Curve
have been severely criticized for a number of reasons.
Fischer et al. (1996) argued that Herrnstein and Murray
used an inappropriate measure of parental SES and,
therefore, underestimated its importance. Hauser and
Huang (1997) argued that the claim about the growing
importance of intelligence is simply a misinterpretation
of previous research. Other researchers have, however,
supported the ideas of The Bell Curve (Gottfredson,
2003; Jensen, 1998) saying that its central claims have
been convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459).</p>
      <p>At the same time in Great Britain, a similar
discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who,
analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from
Great Britain, found that intelligence is a better
predictor of occupational attainment than is parental
SES and concluded that England is, to a large extent,
a meritocratic society (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999;
Saunders, 1997, 2002). These conclusions were
challenged by Breen and Goldthorpe (1999, 2001)
who argued that Saunders greatly overestimated the
importance of intelligence by using inappropriate
analytic techniques.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="3">
      <title>3. Previous reviews</title>
      <p>There have been surprisingly few attempts to
systematically review the literature on intelligence and
socioeconomic success. Reviewers typically cite only a
couple of studies (see e.g., Brody, 1997; Farkas, 2003;
Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Some of the most
comprehensive reviews have been conducted by Jencks (see
Jencks et al., 1972, 1979). Two meta-analyses have so
far addressed the relationship between intelligence and
socioeconomic success. Both of them used income as a
measure of success. The more comprehensive one of
the two was conducted by Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne
(2001). They assembled 65 estimates from 24 studies
to estimate the relationship between intelligence and
income. The mean standardized regression coefficient
of intelligence on income is .15 according to their study
(p. 1154). In addition to that, Bowles et al. (2001)
reported that there is no time trend in the size of the
coefficients between the years 1960 and 1995 and that
the age of the sample at the time of ability testing has
no effect on the results.</p>
      <p>The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. is a valuable
contribution but it suffers from several shortcomings.
First, it considered only one measure of success,
income, thereby ignoring education and occupation.
Second, the meta-analytic estimate of .15 was not derived
from zero-order correlations as is usually required by
the textbooks of meta-analysis (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt,
2004: 475) but from regression equations that included
several predictors in addition to intelligence. Peterson
and Brown (2005) have recently suggested that the use
of partial effect sizes, instead of zero-order ones, does
not affect the meta-analytic results very much but it is
nevertheless obvious that the use of disparate studies
makes the results difficult to interpret. Third, the
metaanalysis of Bowles et al. was not based on independent
samples. The authors stated that they used 65 estimates
from 24 studies (p. 1154) but neither of these figures
represents the number of independent samples.
Inspection of the appendix (not published but available from
the authors) leaves no doubt that some samples
contributed more than one coefficient to the final
meta-analytic estimate thereby ignoring the
requirement of independent data (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt,
2004, chapter 10). Fourth, their meta-analysis mixed
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The distinction
between cross-sectional and longitudinal study design
is vital in the present context because only the latter can
answer questions about the causal impact of
intelligence on career success.</p>
      <p>Another, more recent, meta-analysis was conducted
by Ng, Eby, Sorensen, and Feldman (2005) who
collected 8 studies and found an average correlation of
.27 between intelligence and salary. The meta-analysis
of Ng et al. (2005) was, unlike the one by Bowles et al.,
based on zero-order correlations and avoided the use of
non-independent samples but it failed to separate
crosssectional and longitudinal studies.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="4">
      <title>4. Topics addressed in the present paper</title>
      <p>4.1. The size of the correlation between intelligence and
success</p>
      <p>Meta-analyses are often conducted with the aim to
determine if a statistical relationship between two
variables is significantly different from zero. This cannot be
the only aim of the present meta-analysis because very
few social scientists would doubt that there is a positive
correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic
success. Having acknowledged that, the next logical
question is: what is the approximate size of the
correlation? Answers to this question are far from uniform.
Take the correlation between intelligence and income:
Jensen has suggested that it is somewhere around .40
(Jensen, 1998: 568) while Bowles et al. (2001) have
found that it is only about .15. That is why the first aim
of the present meta-analysis is to estimate the
approximate sizes of the correlations between
intelligence and measures of success. The importance of the
correlations can be evaluated using Cohen's
classification scheme which classifies correlations as small if
they are below .30, medium-sized if they are between
.30 and .50, and large if they are over .50 (Cohen,
1988). Knowing the size of the correlation between
intelligence and career success would allow us to
compare it to other, well-established, correlations in the
social scientific literature; e.g., the correlation of .51
between intelligence and job performance (Schmidt &amp;
Hunter, 1998).
4.2. Intelligence and other predictors of success</p>
      <p>It is difficult to evaluate the importance of a predictor
in isolation; it would be informative to compare the
predictive power of intelligence to the predictive power
of other relevant predictors of socioeconomic success.
This paper will, therefore, analyze two additional
predictors – parental SES (e.g., father's occupation)
and academic performance (e.g., school grades) – with
the aim to determine if intelligence is a better predictor
of success than the other two variables. Parental SES
and academic performance have often been treated as
the main “competitors” of intelligence in predicting
career success because, as explained shortly, they
represent different views about a typical path to success.
Including them in this paper will, consequently, allow us
to better evaluate the role of intelligence in people's
career.</p>
      <sec id="4-1">
        <title>4.2.1. Intelligence versus parental SES</title>
        <p>The question about the relative importance of
intelligence and parental SES in predicting success is one of
the central questions of status attainment research. This
is a question about the nature of the society we live in:
whether a typical western society rewards people for
their own abilities or their social background (Saunders,
1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a
definite answer to this question. Some authors have
found that intelligence outcompetes parental SES as a
predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998;
Saunders, 1997). Others have replied that parental SES,
if properly measured, is actually a better predictor
(Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The
seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in
some studies results from the failure to correct for
measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles
&amp; Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important
aspects of parental status (most importantly, parental
income) among the predictors (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974;
Fischer et al., 1996).</p>
        <p>Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation
between intelligence and success with the correlation
between parental SES and success. To accomplish that,
the present paper will include a meta-analysis of the
relationship between the different aspects of parental
SES (parental education, occupation, and income) and
socioeconomic success. Research on this relationship is,
of course, voluminous and several narrative and
quantitative reviews of it are available (see Ganzeboom,
Luijkx, &amp; Treiman, 1989; Haveman &amp; Wolf, 1995;
Mulligan, 1999). Ganzeboom et al. (1989), for instance,
gathered 149 studies from 35 countries to analyze the
association between father's occupation and son's
occupation, and concluded that the association is stronger in
non-industrialized societies and has been weakening
during the 20th century. But none of these reviews has
presented the results in a manner that would make them
directly usable in this paper, hence the need for a
separate meta-analysis.1</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="4-2">
        <title>4.2.2. Intelligence versus academic performance</title>
        <p>The question about the relative importance of mental
ability and academic performance in predicting success
has also been recognized as important (see Jencks &amp;
Phillips, 1999). It is a question of what really matters for
career success: is it one's general ability (as measured
by IQ tests) or the things one has learned at school and
motivation to learn (as measured by school grades)? Not
many studies have explicitly compared the predictive
power of IQ scores and school grades (e.g., Taubman &amp;
Wales, 1974, chapter 3). But the more general question
about the usefulness of grades as predictors of success
has been the object of considerable debate (see Roth,
BeVier, Switzer, &amp; Schippmann, 1996; Roth &amp; Clark,
1998). The meta-analysis by Roth and Clark (1998), for
instance, found an average correlation of .28 between
grades and salary. Thus, contrary to some earlier claims
(e.g., McClelland, 1973), grades have turned out to be
good predictors of success. This literature is somewhat
limited by being almost exclusively restricted to college
grades. If the purpose is to compare grades and IQ test
scores as predictors of career success, then high school
grades would be a better choice because college
students constitute a rather selected group that does
not represent the full range of career attainments in
society. High school grades have been meta-analytically
related to job performance (Dye &amp; Reck, 1988) and
college grades (Robbins et al., 2004) but there is
currently no meta-analysis about the relationship
between high school grades and general socioeconomic
success (as measured by education, occupation, and
income). The present paper will, thus, conduct such a
meta-analysis.</p>

          <title>4.3. Moderators of the correlation between intelligence and success In order to further clarify the role of intelligence in people's career, the effects of three moderator variables</title>

            <title>1 Ganzeboom et al. (1989) analyzed social mobility tables, Mulligan</title>

this paper, however, bivariate standardized regression coefficients
(i.e., correlations) are needed.
(age at testing, age at success, and year of success) on
intelligence–success correlation will be studied. These
moderator variables have been analyzed in several
studies but with rather conflicting results.</p>

      <sec id="4-3">
        <title>4.3.1. Age at the time of testing</title>
        <p>The first moderator analysis concerns age at testing
(age of individuals at the time the IQ test was taken)
and how it affects the correlation between intelligence
and success. Analysis of the effect of age at testing
reveals something about the mechanism behind the
intelligence–success correlation. If intelligence predicts
success irrespective of the age at which it is measured,
then there is reason to believe that the differences in
people's career success are the result of the stable
individual differences measured by IQ tests (Jencks &amp;
Phillips, 1999). If however, the predictive power of IQ
tests changes with age, then different interpretations
are possible depending on how we believe the test
score to be affected by genes and environment.
According to the standard sociological interpretation,
the test scores of older individuals should be more
affected by life experiences than the scores of children
(because older individuals simply have had more
experiences) and consequently, if intelligence tested
at an older age should turn out to be a better predictor
career success, then it would mean that the test scores
probably reflect some career-relevant experiences
which the older individuals have had more time to
accumulate (Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1999). The other
interpretation is based on behavior genetic research
which has found that genetic influences on IQ scores
increase with age and environmental influences
decrease (McCartney, Harris, &amp; Bernieri, 1990); from
these results one can conclude that if the test scores of
older individuals are better predictors of success, then
it can be attributed to the growing effect of some
career-relevant genes.2</p>
        <p>Empirical evidence concerning age at testing is rather
contradictory. A study by McCall (1977) found a clear
upward trend in the correlations between intelligence
and success; that is, correlations grew stronger as age at
testing increased. Some of the studies reviewed by
Jencks and Phillips (1999) have found a similar trend.
The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. (2001), however,
found that age at testing has no effect on the association
between intelligence and income. Jencks et al. (1979)
reached a similar conclusion in their review.</p>

      <sec id="4-4">
        <title>4.3.2. Age at the measurement of success</title>
        <p>A related issue concerns the age of the individuals at
the time their career success is measured. According to
the so-called gravitational hypothesis, the correlation
between intelligence and success should grow stronger
as individuals grow older because (as a result of
selfselection and competition) individuals “gravitate”
towards the positions that correspond to their ability
levels as they progress in their careers. This reasoning
has been used to support the idea that intellectual
differences cumulate over life course and become
progressively more important (see Gottfredson, 2003;
Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996). Other researchers have
suggested that exactly the opposite is true: the
predictive validity of IQ scores should decline as time
goes by because less able people have time to
accumulate skills to compensate for their initial lack
of ability (Ackerman, 1987; Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001).
These opposing views can be reconciled by saying that
the idea of declining importance of IQ applies to the
performance of specific tasks that become automatic
after some practice and the idea of growing importance
applies complex long term activities, such as attaining
and maintaining social status, that never cease to be
cognitively demanding. But so far as socioeconomic
success can depend on the performance of specific work
tasks, the possibility of declining validity of IQ is not
completely ruled out.</p>
        <p>Several studies have correlated intelligence with
success at different points in people's life course. Some
of them have found that the correlations indeed increase
with age as predicted by the gravitational hypothesis
(Brown &amp; Reynolds, 1975; Deary et al., 2005; Wilk &amp;
Sackett, 1996), others have found no clear trend
(Hauser, Warren, Huang, &amp; Carter, 1996; Warren, Sheridan,
&amp; Hauser, 2002). The reviews by Hulin, Henry, and
Noon (1990) and Keil and Cortina (2001) found support
for the declining validity thesis but it should be noted
that many of the studies reviewed in these papers used
specific laboratory tasks as dependent variables and are,
therefore, not directly comparable to the studies
reviewed in the present paper.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="4-5">
        <title>4.3.3. Year of the measurement of success</title>
        <p>A particularly controversial issue concerns the
historical changes in the relationship between intelligence and
success. It was one of the central claims of The Bell
Curve that the association between mental ability and
career success in western societies has been growing
throughout the 20th century (Herrnstein &amp; Murray,
1994). The logic behind this idea is similar to the
gravitational hypothesis, discussed in the previous section –
in both cases individuals are increasingly drawn towards
the positions that correspond to their ability as time goes
by – but in this case the gravitation does not take place
during a life course of a single individual but over several
generations.</p>
        <p>Several studies have investigated changes in the
association between intelligence and success during past
decades. Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded
that “the main point seems beyond dispute” (1994: 52)
and some studies have found support for this point
(Murnane, Willett, &amp; Levy, 1995), there are still serious
reasons to doubt that the importance of intelligence is or
has been growing. Neither the meta-analysis by Bowles
et al. (2001) nor the review by Jencks et al. (1979) found
any clear trend in the correlations between intelligence
and success. The same conclusion was reached by Flynn
(2004) and Hauser and Huang (1997). Breen and
Goldthorpe (2001) found that the association between
intelligence and occupational status in England is, if
anything, declining.</p>

        <title>5.1. Definition of variables</title>
        <p>The present meta-analysis investigated the
relationship between three measures of socioeconomic success
(educational level, occupational level, and income) and
three predictors (intelligence, parental SES, and
academic performance). The operationalization of these
variables is described next.</p>
        <sec id="5-1-1">
          <title>5.1.1. Socioeconomic success</title>
          <p>Educational level was measured by the number of years
spent in full time education or the highest level of education
completed. Occupational level was typically measured by
such occupational scales as Duncan Socioeconomic Index,
International Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status,
NORC prestige scale, etc. These scales provide detailed
numerical measures of occupational status (see
Ganzeboom &amp; Treiman, 1996a, for a general discussion). In some
studies, less detailed occupational classifications were
used. Irrespective of the level of detail, all the occupational
variables in this paper had a common property of ordering
occupations on a single hierarchical dimension with higher
values designating more desirable and prestigious
occupations. Income was measured by salary or total monetary
income, which had to refer to the personal income of an
individual, not to family or household income. If possible, I
preferred income measured on a logarithmic scale because
logarithmic transformation removes the skew typically
found in income distribution.</p>

        <sec id="5-1-2">
          <title>5.1.2. Intelligence</title>
          <p>Intelligence, or general mental ability, of an
individual was measured by a score on a test of intelligence. It
is not always easy, however, to decide if a given test is a
test of intelligence. The definitions of intelligence state
that it is an abstract ability that is not tied to any specific
domain of knowledge. Therefore, only the tests that are
designed to measure such ability should be used in the
meta-analysis. If we take the traditional threefold
distinction between ability, aptitude, and achievement
tests (Jensen, 1981), then the present study should use
only ability and aptitude test scores. Although some
researchers have contended that achievement tests can
also be treated as measures of general ability (Boudreau,
Boswell, Judge, &amp; Bretz, 2001), and even everyday life
can be interpreted as an IQ test (Gordon, 1997), the
present study took a more conservative approach and
included only those tests that are generally regarded as
tests of intelligence (see e.g., Anastasi &amp; Urbina, 1997;
Jensen, 1980, chapter 7, for a discussion and
classification of different tests).</p>
          <p>There are numerous “classical” tests (e.g., Henmon–
Nelson, Lorge–Thorndike, Otis–Lennon, Raven
Progressive Matrices, Stanford–Binet, Wechsler tests) for
which there seems to be a general consensus that
these are indeed tests of general mental ability. Such
multiple aptitude test batteries as Armed Services
Vocational Aptitude Battery or General Aptitude Test
Battery are also often treated as measures of general
ability. The most problematic ones are the tests that
are specifically constructed for use in a single data
set. Such unique tests have been used in several large
and influential data sets (e.g., National Child
Development Study, National Longitudinal Survey of
High School Class 1972, Panel Study of Income
Dynamics, Project Talent). In these cases I consulted
the manuals of the data sets and studies that are based on
the data. If the test was derived from other IQ tests or if it
was described as a test of intelligence, then I included it
in my study. Studies using well-known achievement
tests, such as Iowa Test of Basic Skills (Smokowski,
Mann, Reynolds, &amp; Fraser, 2004), were excluded. The
names of all the IQ tests used in this paper are listed in the
Appendix.</p>

          <title>5.1.3. Parental SES</title>
          <p>Five measures of parental socioeconomic status
(SES) were used in this paper; the first four were
father's education, mother's education, father's
occupation, and parental income. The measurement of these
variables was similar to the measurement of
respondent's own education, occupation, and income (see
above). Parental income refers to father's income or
total income of parents. Because too few studies
reported data on mother's occupation, this variable
was not included. In addition to these four, I also used
a general index of SES, which combines several
parental characteristics into one variable. A number of
studies have used a composite index on the
assumption that it is a better indicator of social advantages
than any of the single variables that make up the index
and, therefore, also a better predictor of success (see
White, 1982, for supporting evidence). A correlation
with SES index was included in the present
metaanalysis if the index was composed of the following
components — parental education (education of one
or both parents), parental occupation (occupation of
one or both parents), and material well-being of the
parental home. The latter was measured by parental
income or by a “possession index” which indicates
how many of the valued items (e.g., a car, TV set,
computer) were present at home. If a study did not use
an index of SES but presented intercorrelations among
the necessary variables, then I used the formulas
reported by Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 433) to
calculate a composite score correlation between SES
index and success.</p>

school or the years preceding high school. In some
studies, rank in class (i.e., how well the student

interchangeably with GPA (see Kuncel, Crede, &amp;

        <title>5.2. Collection of data</title>
        <p>Studies were identified for inclusion in the
metaanalysis by searching computerized databases (such as
JSTOR, PsycINFO) using terms like “status
attainment”, “educational attainment” “occupational
attainment”, “socioeconomic achievement” as keywords.
Reference sections of review papers were also searched.</p>
        <p>To be included in the meta-analysis, the following
general criteria had to be met. First, the measurement of
the variables had to correspond to the descriptions
presented in Section 5.1. Second, the data had to be
longitudinal; that is, the predictors (intelligence, parental
SES, and academic performance) had to be measured at
an earlier time and career success (education, occupation,
and income) at a later time.3 Third, the interval between
the measurement of predictors and dependent variables
had to be at least 3 years because studies with shorter
intervals would have very little advantage over
crosssectional studies. Fourth, the study had to report a
zeroorder correlation between the variables and another
measure of association transformable into a zero-order
correlation.</p>
        <p>Fifth, majority of individuals in the sample had to be at
least 20 years old at the time the career success was
measured because it makes little sense to talk about the
career success of individuals younger than 20. Sixth,
majority of individuals had to be less than 25 years old at
the time the IQ test was taken because, to properly
investigate the effect of intelligence on career, intelligence
should be tested before the individuals start a career.
Obviously, even individuals tested in their early twenties
might already have started a career, but since these
individuals can be used for comparison with younger
individuals, they were included. Information on parental
SES and academic performance had to refer to the time the
respondents were approximately 12–18 years old (the
time these variables presumably have their greatest impact
on subsequent career). Seventh, the study had to be
conducted in a “western” society; that is, in the United
States, Canada, Europe, Australia, or New Zealand.
Additional criteria are described in Section 5.4.</p>
        <p>It is rather common for published studies not to
report the information necessary for meta-analysis (the
lack of zero-order correlations is a typical problem). But
fortunately, the raw data of several well-known data sets
(e.g., General Social Survey, National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth) are available for public use. Because it
would be a serious waste of information to leave these
sources unused, I decided to use the available raw data
to calculate the correlations if none of the published
sources reported the necessary information or if the
information in the published source was deficient in
some way (e.g., if the correlations were reported
separately for men and women but not for the complete</p>

          <title>3 That does not mean that all the studies had to actually include at</title>
          <p>least two waves of measurement because one of the predictors,
parental SES, can be measured retrospectively (by asking adult
respondents questions like “what was your father's occupation at the
time you were 16?”). It is important, however, that the information
about father's occupation or parental income obtained from adult
respondents refers to parents' past (not current) occupation or
income. The latter requirement was not applied to parental education
because parents' education is unlikely to change while children grow
up. In some studies (e.g. Duncan &amp; Hodge, 1963), father's occupation
was rather vaguely referred to as father's “usual occupation” or
“longest occupation”. These studies were also included.
sample). Most of the raw data sets had been prepared for
public use and contained all the necessary variables in a
ready-to-use form. In some cases, minor statistical
procedures were implemented before calculating the
correlations (e.g., summing the standardized scores of subtests
to obtain the score of general intelligence; transforming
the original occupational variable into a more appropriate
prestige scale using the methodological tools provided by
Ganzeboom and Treiman (1996b). The raw data sets used
in this paper are listed in the Appendix.</p>
          <p>Several longitudinal data sets contain data from more
than one follow up. Career success has been measured
repeatedly for the same individuals in these data sets
(up to 20 times in some cases). In some data sets,
the predictors (intelligence, parental SES, or academic
performance) have also been measured repeatedly. In
order to ascertain that every sample contributed only
one correlation to one analysis, I averaged all the
correlations that were derived from the same sample. If
the sample sizes of the averaged correlations were
different, mean sample size was used. The procedures
for moderator analyses are described in Sections 6.3

reliability coefficients obtained from the same sample as
the correlation that needs to be corrected (Hunter &amp;
Schmidt, 2004, chapter 3). However, such reliability
coefficients were available for only a small minority of
studies included in the present meta-analysis. The
correlations from these studies were corrected with these
reliability coefficients. But for the majority of studies,
mean reliabilities (estimated from various sources, as
described below) were used. Each study was then
corrected individually with the appropriate reliability
coefficient. The nature and sources of reliability information
are described next.</p>

          <title>5.3.1. Socioeconomic success</title>
          <p>Information on education, occupation, and income
can be obtained from three sources. The first source is
institutional record (e.g., tax records of income).
Following the common practice, data from such objective
sources were assumed to have a reliability of 1. The
second and by far the most common source is self-report.
Self-reports are not perfectly reliable, however. The
amount of error is usually measured by asking the
same individuals to report their socioeconomic
characteristics again after a few months and then correlating the
first and second reports (producing a test–retest
correlation). Several estimates of these correlations,
derived from nationally representative samples, are
available. Using the data presented by Bowles (1972)
and Jencks et al. (1979), I calculated the average test–
retest correlations for educational level (.89), occupational
status (.88), and income (.83). These values were used to
correct the correlations with self-reported socioeconomic
success. The third possibility is to obtain the information
from the spouse, parent, sibling, or child of the focal
individual. Because these sources would introduce
unnecessary complications and an unknown degree of
error, the studies using these sources were excluded
unless they contained correlations between intelligence
and success (these correlations are too valuable to be
discarded).4</p>

          <title>5.3.2. Intelligence</title>
          <p>When correcting for unreliability in the test scores,
test–retest alternate-form reliability (the correlation
between parallel forms of the same test administered
on two separate occasions) is generally considered to be
the most appropriate form of reliability (Schmidt &amp;
Hunter, 1999). But since these coefficients are rarely
available, simple test–retest reliability is often taken as
the second best option in meta-analytic studies of the
predictive power of IQ scores (Judge, Colbert, &amp; Ilies,
2004; Salgado, Anderson, Moscoso, Bertua, &amp; Fruyt,
2003). Because test–retest reliability coefficients were
reported in only a few studies, an average test–retest
coefficient, obtained from the meta-analysis of Salgado
et al. (2003), was used for most of the studies. Salgado
et al. averaged 31 test–retest correlations of different
general mental ability tests (the mean interval between
test and retest being 6 months) and obtained an average
coefficient of .83. This value is similar to average test–
retest correlations obtained in other reviews: e.g., .82 in
Parker, Hanson, and Hunsley (1988) or .85 in Kuncel,
Hezlett, and Ones (2004). Thus, the reliability of .83
seems to be a representative estimate and was used in the

reported education, occupation, and income. Second, it
can be reported by the children. Children's reports on
parental characteristics are known to suffer from
considerable error. Probably the best estimate of this
error is the correlation between child's report and
parent's own report on a given characteristic. Looker
(1989) has presented a comprehensive review of these
correlations for father's education, mother's education,
and father's occupation. Using the information in Table
3 in Looker's paper, I calculated the average
correlations between child's report and parent's report. The
average correlations are .80 for father's education, .79
for mother's education, and .78 for father's occupation.
These values were used to correct the correlations that
involved children's reports on parental SES.5
Information on the reliability of children's reports on parental
income is harder to find. I could locate two studies
(Bell, Senese, &amp; Elliott, 1984; Massagli &amp; Hauser,
1983) that provided reliability estimates from three
samples. The estimates ranged from .45 to .59. with an
average of .51 that was used in the present paper. The
third source of information on parental SES is
objective data (e.g., tax records of income) that was
assumed to have a reliability of 1. Internal consistency
method (Cronbach alpha) was used to correct for
unreliability in the SES index. This method was
recommended by Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 438)
for composite variables. For all but two studies, the
alpha value of the SES index was obtained from the
same sample as the correlation itself. For the remaining
two, the average alpha of all the other studies (.71) was

        <p>No mathematical correction for range restriction
was performed in the present meta-analysis. Instead of
that, the correction was done indirectly by excluding
studies with considerable range restriction. This
strategy was preferred because most of the studies
that satisfied the inclusion criteria (see Section 5.2)
were based on samples that were fairly representative
of the general population and did not require the
correction for range restriction. It is, therefore,
appropriate to limit the current meta-analysis to
representative studies and exclude the studies that
exhibit signs of considerable range restriction.6 More
specifically, I excluded the studies that sampled only
(a) college students or individuals with a college degree
(e.g., Eckland, 1965), (b) employees of a single
organization (e.g., Dreher &amp; Bretz, 1991), or
(c) representatives of one specific occupational group
(such as engineers or managers; see e.g., Sackett, Gruys,
&amp; Ellingson, 1998).7 These criteria exclude much of the
personnel selection research, which is the kind of
research where the problem of range restriction is
particularly serious (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004). I
also excluded the correlation if the range of one (or both)
of the correlated variables was deliberately restricted by
the research design. For example, in the study of gifted
children by Terman and Oden (1947), the range of
intelligence was severely restricted by sampling only
individuals with IQs over 135; in the Polish study by
Firkowska-Mankiewicz (2002), the range of intelligence
was restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs
below 86 or over 130. The correlations obtained from
Fergusson, Horwood, and Ridder (2005) and Kuh and

only if every sample, included in a particular analysis, is

moderator analysis if the range of the moderator variable in
question exceeded 10 years. It should be noted, however,
that the majority of the samples that provided data on
intelligence were rather homogenous in terms of all the
moderator variables because longitudinal surveys
typically concentrate on a specific cohort. The moderator
analyses were conducted in two steps: first a more
conventional subgroup analysis and then a
meta-regression analysis. The details of these analyses are

        <title>5.6. Meta-analytic calculations</title>
        <p>In order to estimate the strength of the relationship
between predictors and success, three averages were
calculated: a simple average correlation, a sample size
weighted average correlation, and a sample size
weighted average correlation corrected for unreliability
and dichotomization in the correlated variables. The
latter constitutes the central meta-analytic result of the
present paper. Other averages can be used for
comparison to see how much the results are affected by
weighting and correcting the original correlations.
Because the sample sizes were highly variable (from
60 to 339,951 with a median of 518), weighting the
correlations by sample size would allow the few very
large studies to overly dominate the results. To prevent
that, all the samples with the size over 7000 individuals
(about 5% of the samples in this study) were set equal to
7000 for the weighting procedure.</p>
        <p>In order to estimate the variability of the correlations,
the standard deviation of original correlations and
corrected standard deviation of corrected correlations
(Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 126) were calculated. The 95%
credibility intervals of sample size weighted corrected
correlations were calculated to assess the presence of
moderators. Moderators are present if the credibility
intervals are large (over 0.11 according to Koslowsky &amp;
Sagie, 1993) or include zero (see Whitener, 1990).
Finally, 95% confidence intervals of the sample size
weighted corrected correlations were calculated using
the formula for heterogeneous studies (Whitener, 1990:
317). Confidence intervals can be used to assess the
significance of the correlations (correlation is
significantly different from zero if the confidence intervals do
not include zero) as well as to compare correlations
(according to a simple and conservative rule of thumb,
two correlations are significantly different from one
another if their confidence intervals do not intersect).</p>

The phrase “all studies” in parentheses indicates that all
the studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria are

positively correlated with education, occupation, and
income; the sample size weighted and corrected
correlations ( p) are .56, .43, and .20, respectively. The fact that
the 95% credibility intervals exceed 0.11 suggests the
presence of moderators according to Koslowsky and
Sagie (1993). Comparing the three averages (r, rw, and

weighting the correlations by sample size tends to
reduce the average. This means that larger studies

overestimate the correlation between intelligence and
success.</p>
          <p>The results, just described, can be criticized for
including several samples that are somewhat inappropriate for
studying the causal influence of intelligence on success. In
some studies, most of the individuals were already in their
early twenties at the time the IQ test was taken. It is possible
that many individuals in these samples had already started a
career by that time, which makes the direction of influence
between intelligence and career success rather ambiguous.
Furthermore, in several studies the individuals were still in
their twenties at the time their career success was measured.
It seems reasonable to assume, however, that individuals
under 30 cannot yet be reliably classified as more
successful or less successful. Taking these observations into
account, the second row in every section of Table 1,
containing the phrase “best studies” in parentheses, includes
only samples with the average age of less than 19 at testing
and over 29 at the measurement of success. If raw data were
used, then the individuals of inappropriate age were simply
excluded.</p>
          <p>Looking at the “best studies”, we can observe the
corrected sample size weighted correlations of .56, .45,
and .23 between intelligence and education, occupation,
and income, respectively. These correlations can be treated
as the most appropriate estimates of the relationship
between intelligence and socioeconomic success. The
averages of the “best studies” are somewhat higher than
the averages of “all studies” indicating that the inclusion of
the less appropriate samples among the latter lowers the
meta-analytic results. It is surprising how much the
number of samples (k) included among the “best studies”
differs from the number of “all studies” — almost two
thirds of the correlations with education had to be
excluded for the analysis of the “best studies”. It shows
that much of the research on intelligence and success is
being conducted with samples that are either too old at the
time of testing or too young at the measurement of success.</p>
          <p>Having characterized the predictive power of
intelligence in general, the next step is to compare it to the
predictive power of parental SES and academic
performance. Table 1 presents the meta-analytic results for the
five indicators of parental SES (father's education,
mother's education, father's occupation, parental income,
and the SES index). Not surprisingly, all the correlations are
positive but, judging by the confidence intervals, several of
the correlations (e.g., the one between father's education
and education, p = .50, or father's occupation and
occupation, p = .35) are significantly smaller than the respective
correlations for intelligence. On the other hand, none of the
parental variables is a significantly stronger predictor than
intelligence. The SES index is the most successful predictor

provide information on both predictors and then make comparisons
within each sample. The advantage of such within-sample
comparisons would be the elimination of between-study methodological
differences. I used this strategy to compare the correlations with
intelligence and SES index (arguably the best measure of social
background). The significance of the difference between the
correlations was tested with the formula for comparing dependent
correlations (Meng, Rosenthal, &amp; Rubin, 1992: 173). With education
as the measure of success, there were 15 samples that provided
correlations with both IQ and SES index; in 11 of these samples, the
correlations were significantly different (p b .05, 2-tailed); 8 of the
significant differences were in favor of IQ. With occupation as the
measure of success, 14 comparisons were made; 7 of the differences
were significant, all in favor of IQ. With income as the measure of
success, 12 comparisons were made; 5 were significant, 2 of them in
favor of IQ. These results suggest that there seems to be an overall
tendency for IQ to be a better predictor but this tendency is not
consistently found in every occasion.</p>
          <p>The results for academic performance are presented
in the last rows of the three sections of Table 1. The
correlations of academic performance with education
( p = .53) and occupation ( p = .37) demonstrate that
academic performance is an important predictor of
educational and occupational success. The predictive
power in relation to income, however, is weak
( p = .09).</p>

        <title>6.3. Moderator analysis using subgroups</title>
        <p>As a first step in analyzing the influence of
moderator variables, the analysis of subgroups was
performed. The moderator variables were divided into
the following categories: age at testing into 1–10, 11–
15, 16–18, 19–25; age at success into 20–24, 25–29,
30–34, 35–39, 40–44, 45–49, and over 49; and the
year of success into pre-1960, 1960–1969, 1970–
1979, 1980–1989, post-1989. The raw data sets were
exploited to the full extent by dividing the samples into
appropriate subgroups by age or year. Every sample</p>

contributed only one correlation to a moderator
category. If a sample could contribute more than one
correlation, then the most appropriate of the available
correlations (the one that best fitted into the moderator
category) was used. Equally appropriate correlations
were averaged.</p>
        <p>Table 2 presents the results of the moderator
analysis. The table is divided into three sections with
every section presenting the results for one moderator
variable. In the first section of Table 2, age at testing
(i.e., mean age of the sample at the time of ability
testing) is used as a moderator variable. The
youngest sample in this analysis was, on average,
3 years old at the time of testing, the oldest one was
23 years old. The results of the analysis are quite
clear-cut with regard to education and occupation as
measures of success: the correlations increase as age
at testing increases. The correlation between
intelligence and income does not exhibit any obvious trend
but even here the largest correlation comes from the
oldest group.</p>
        <p>In the next section of Table 2, the moderator
variable is age at success (i.e., the mean age of the
sample at the time of the measurement of
socioeconomic success). Age at success ranges from 20 to 78
in the present study. The results are rather different
for different measures of success. The correlation
between intelligence and education remains more or
less stable. The correlation between intelligence and
occupation takes a noticeable upward leap during the
twenties – from .35 in the 20–24 group to the .44 in
the 25–29 group – and then levels off. The
correlation between intelligence and income
undergoes the most dramatic changes: the correlation is
barely above zero in the 20–24 group but jumps to
the value of .20 in the 25–29 group, and then takes
another jump to the value of .27 in the 30–34 group;
after the age of 40, the correlation appears to decline
again but not as low as the values it had before the
age of 30.</p>
        <p>The influence of the third moderator variable, year of
success (i.e., year of the measurement of success), is
analyzed in the third section of Table 2. Year of success
ranges from 1929 to 2003 in the present meta-analysis.</p>
        <p>Judging by the sample size weighted corrected
correlations ( p), there appears to be no historical trend for any
one of the moderator variables: correlations with
education and occupation remain more or less stable
throughout the period under study; correlations with
income fluctuate more but without any obvious
direction. Quite surprisingly, if unweighted and
uncorrected correlations ( r) are observed instead, then the
correlations with education and occupation exhibit a
declining trend.
6.4. Moderator analysis using multiple regression</p>
        <p>Moderator analyses in the previous section can be
criticized for ignoring the fact that the moderator
variables might not be completely independent of each
other, which makes it possible to claim that some of
the results can be explained by the intercorrelations
among the moderator variables (Steel &amp;
KammeyerMueller, 2002). In order to take account of this
possibility, I conducted multiple linear regression
analyses using the moderator variables as independent
variables and the correlations between intelligence and
measures of success as dependent variables. Such
meta-regression analysis is a common meta-analytic
tool (see Ganzeboom et al., 1989; Robbins et al.,
2004).</p>
        <p>The analyses that follow differ from the preceding
moderator analyses in an important respect: in order to
use all the available information, I gave up the
requirement of independent data and included all the
available correlations. If mental ability or
socioeconomic success was measured repeatedly for the same
sample, then all the correlations were included making
it possible for one sample to contribute more than one
correlation to the analysis.10 Naturally, this strategy
results in some samples providing much more
correlations than others. In order to control for the effects of
overrepresented samples, I constructed dummy
variables for all the data sets that contributed more than 2
correlations from the same sample to a given moderator
analysis. The dummy variables were inserted into
regression models as independent variables. In some
raw data sets that were large enough, the sample was
broken down into smaller samples. For example, the
National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women was
divided into three subsamples according to the age at
the start of the survey – the 14–17, 18–20, and 21–
24 year olds – and these subsamples were then used as
separate samples in the regression analyses. This was
done to obtain samples that are more homogenous in
10 In order to understand the necessity of this methodological
decision, consider the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. This
data set contains annual or biennial information on the career success
of its respondents for a period of more than 20 years, thus providing
an ideal opportunity to study age-related and historical changes in the
relationship between intelligence and career. All this information
would be lost, however, if only one correlation was allowed to
represent one sample.

terms of age and year and, thus, to better capture the
effects of moderator variables.11</p>
        <p>The results of the meta-regression analyses are
presented in Table 3. There are three dependent
variables in the table: the uncorrected correlations of
intelligence with education, occupation, and income.12
The independent variables are the three moderator
variables (age at testing, age at success, and year of
study) and data set dummies. In order to provide a
rough control for possible international differences, I
also included a dummy variable that equals 1 if the
study was conducted in the United States.
Furthermore, in order to control for possible methodological
differences that might arise from using raw data (see
Section 5.3), I constructed a dummy variable that
equals 1 if the correlation was calculated from raw
data. Following the suggestions made by Steel and
Kammeyer-Mueller (2002), weighted least squares
regression analysis was used: each correlation was
weighted by the inverse of its sampling error variance
as described in Steel and Kammeyer-Mueller (2002:
100–101).
11 There is, of course, a threat that breaking the original sample into
smaller samples might limit the variance of the variables. But this is
unlikely to be the case because all these newly created subsamples
were large enough (sample size ranged from 126 to 4385 with a
median of 503) to prevent any serious restriction of variance.
12 It would make very little difference if corrected correlations
(rather than uncorrected ones) were used in these analyses because
almost all correlations would be corrected with the same reliability
coefficients (see Section 5.3) and would, thus, be equally affected by
the correction.</p>
        <p>The results of the meta-regression analysis in
Table 3 are not radically different from the results of
the previous moderator analysis in Table 2. The
moderating effect of age at testing is positive and
significant in all the three regression models. Age at
success has a positive effect on the correlations with
occupation and income and a weak negative effect of
the correlation with education. Year of success
provides some surprises by having a weak positive
effect of the correlation with education and a strong
negative effect on the correlation with occupation. It
is of interest that the U.S.A. dummy is not significant
in any of the regression models indicating that the
effect of IQ in the United States is similar to its effect
in other western societies. The raw data dummy has a
highly significant negative effect on the correlation
with education and a barely significant positive effect
on the correlation with occupation. Therefore, it
seems that the inclusion of raw data is more likely
to introduce a downward (rather than upward) bias
into the meta-analysis thus making the results
conservative.</p>

      <title>7. Discussion</title>
      <p>7.1. Intelligence as a predictor of socioeconomic
success</p>
      <p>Intelligence plays an influential and yet
controversial role in people's career (Gottfredson, 1997). In
order to investigate this role, the relationship between
intelligence and socioeconomic success was analyzed
using meta-analytic techniques. The first aim of the
paper was to estimate the strength of this relationship.
The overall correlations were .56 (between
intelligence and education), .43 (between intelligence and
occupation), and .20 (between intelligence and
income). Exclusion of the samples that were too old
(over 18) at the time of testing or too young (below
30) at the measurement of success resulted in
somewhat larger correlations: .56, .45, and .23,
respectively. These results demonstrate that
intelligence, when it is measured before most individuals
have finished their schooling, is a powerful predictor
of career success 12 or more years later when most
individuals have already entered stable careers. Two
of the correlations – with education and occupation –
are of substantial magnitude according to the usual
standards of social science (Cohen, 1988); the
correlation with education even surpasses the
wellestablished correlation of .51 between intelligence and
job performance (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998). The
correlation with income is considerably lower,
perhaps even disappointingly low, being about the
average of the previous meta-analytic estimates (.15
by Bowles et al., 2001; and .27 by Ng et al., 2005).
But it should be noted that other predictors, studied in
this paper, are not doing any better in predicting
income, which demonstrates that financial success is
difficult to predict by any variable. This claim is
further corroborated by the meta-analysis of Ng et al.
(2005) where the best predictor of salary was
educational level with a correlation of only .29. It
should also be noted that the correlation of .23 is
about the size of the average meta-analytic result in
psychology (Hemphill, 2003) and cannot, therefore,
be treated as insignificant.</p>
      <p>The second aim of the meta-analysis was to
compare the predictive power of intelligence to the
predictive power of other prominent predictors of
success, parental SES and academic performance.
Such comparisons are informative because different
predictors represent different paths to a successful
career: intelligence represents one's general ability,
parental SES represents the social advantages or
disadvantages experienced by a person, and academic
performance represents school-related learning and
motivation. Meta-analysis demonstrated that parental
SES and academic performance are indeed positively
related to career success but the predictive power of
these variables is not stronger than that of
intelligence (see Table 1). In fact, intelligence
exhibited several correlations with the measures of
success that were larger than the respective
correlations for other predictors suggesting that intelligence
is, after all, a better predictor of success. Still, the
differences in favor of intelligence were not as
overwhelming as one would have expected based on
the results of Herrnstein and Murray (1994). The
index of parental SES, arguably the most
representative measure of social background, did not differ
significantly from intelligence in its predictive power
(see Table 1). The same is true about the predictive
power of academic performance in relation to
education and occupation.</p>
      <p>It has been observed before that meta-analyses
typically do not provide support for extreme scientific
positions (Lytton &amp; Romney, 1991). This is also true
in the present case because the extreme positions
favoring intelligence (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) or
parental SES (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976) were not
supported by the results. The reasonable conclusion is
rather modest: while intelligence is one of the central
determinants of one's socioeconomic success, parental
SES and academic performance also play an important
role in the process of status attainment. Despite the
modest conclusion, these results are important because
they falsify a claim often made by the critics of the
“testing movement”: that the positive relationship
between intelligence and success is just the effect of
parental SES or academic performance influencing
them both (see Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; Fischer et al.,
1996; McClelland, 1973). If the correlation between
intelligence and success was a mere byproduct of the
causal effect of parental SES or academic
performance, then parental SES and academic performance
should have outcompeted intelligence as predictors of
success; but this was clearly not so. These results
confirm that intelligence is an independent causal
force among the determinants of success; in other
words, the fact that intelligent people are successful is
not completely explainable by the fact that intelligent
people have wealthy parents and are doing better at
school.</p>
      <p>A number of moderator analyses of the
intelligence–success correlation were also performed with
the aim of further clarifying the relationship between
intelligence and success. The effects of three
moderator variables – age at testing, age at success, and year
of success – were analyzed. With regard to age at
testing, the results in Tables 2 and 3 clearly
demonstrate that the test scores of older individuals
are better predictors of success than the scores of
younger individuals. As discussed in Section 4.3.1,
there are two conflicting explanations for this result.
On the one hand, if we assume that the test scores of
older individuals are more “contaminated” by
experiences, then this result suggests that experiences make
a contribution to the correlation between intelligence
and success. But on the other hand, if we assume that
the test scores of older individuals are more
“contaminated” by genetic influences, then it would mean that
genes make a contribution to this correlation. Yet
another explanation would be that IQ scores of
children are simply less reliable and the predictive
validity of childhood IQ was, therefore,
underestimated. But contrary to this explanation, preliminary
examination of some evidence on the stability of
intelligence among children (e.g., Burchinal,
Campbell, Bryant, Wasik, &amp; Ramey, 1997; Jensen, 1980:
279) suggested that the test–retest coefficients among
children below 10 are, on the whole, rather similar to
the test–retest coefficients among older individuals. It
appears that the age-related changes in the predictive
validity of test scores cannot be explained by
differential reliability of the scores.</p>
      <p>Analyses of age at success in Tables 2 and 3
demonstrate that correlations with occupation and
income grow stronger as individuals grow older. This
result confirms the ideas of the gravitational
hypothesis about intellectual differences cumulating
throughout life course leading people increasingly
towards the social positions that correspond to their
ability (Gottfredson, 2003). The fact that declining
validity hypothesis (Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001) received
no support for occupational and income attainment
indicates that being successful in these areas is a
complex activity that never ceases to be cognitively
demanding. But as for educational attainment, the
negative impact of age at success on the
IQeducation correlation in Table 3 provides some
support for the declining validity hypothesis and
suggests that, in educational career, intellectual
differences might indeed become somewhat less
important as people get older. The difference
between education and other measures of success
can be explained by the fact that climbing the
educational ladder is, in a sense, easier than climbing
the occupational or financial ladder (because once
you have acquired a certain level of education, you
can never loose it again, which is clearly not the
case with occupation or income).</p>
      <p>Year of the measurement of success had no
obvious effect on the corrected correlations ( p)
between intelligence and success in Table 2. The
meta-regression analysis in Table 3 showed that there
is a slight tendency for correlation between
intelligence and education to increase over the years. This
is the only bit of evidence there is to support the
claims of Herrnstein and Murray (1994) about the
growing importance of mental ability and increasing
cognitive stratification. This evidence is rather weak
in comparison with the much stronger declining trend
exhibited by the correlation with occupation in
Table 3. It would be difficult to come up with
explanations why intelligence might have become
more important with respect to one criterion and less
important with respect to another. Therefore, the
safest conclusion from Tables 2 and 3 seems to be
that the correlation between intelligence and success
has not changed in any consistent direction over the
past decades. It should be noted that the present
paper analyzed changes in the absolute importance
of intelligence (measured by zero-order correlations);
the results so far discussed do not exclude the
possibility of growing relative importance of
intelligence (i.e., importance relative to other predictors).</p>
      <p>However, the analyses of Bowles et al. (2001) and
Hauser and Huang (1997) found no evidence of any
trend in the relative importance.
7.2. Possible limitations and implications for future
research</p>
      <p>Like all research, the present meta-analysis
contains several limitations that can be amended in
future research. One limitation concerns the
metaanalytic database. Although the present meta-analysis
is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive review
of the longitudinal research on intelligence and
socioeconomic success, it does not cover all the
existing data. I am aware of several additional
longitudinal data sets that contain information on
intelligence and success but from which I have been
unable to obtain necessary data (see Jaeger &amp; Holm,
2003; Meghir &amp; Palme, 2005; Nyborg &amp; Jensen,
2001; Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1994). There are probably
others. Efforts to collect information about the
existing data sets should be continued. This applies
especially to the data from outside the United States
because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in
the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data
from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France)
demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct
is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has
not been very enthusiastically accepted in other
scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been
studied in continental Europe (see e.g., Flynn, 1987;
Sternberg, 2004; Weinert &amp; Schneider, 1999) but I
have not been able to find suitable data for the
present study.</p>
      <p>The present study can also be criticized for
underestimating the importance of the predictors of
success; arguments can be offered for any of the three
predictors (intelligence, parental SES, or academic
performance) as to why their importance was
underestimated. First, the present study used only three
measures of social background (parental education,
occupation, and income) and therefore, could have
underestimated its importance. Although these three
have always been the central indicators of social
advantages, several additional measures of social
background could have an independent effect on
career success (Fischer et al., 1996). Future
metaanalyses could, therefore, benefit from considering
other variables, such as neighborhood quality
(Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000), number of
siblings (Blake, 1989), or parental divorce (Amato
&amp; Keith, 1991), to get a more comprehensive picture
of the effects of social background. Second, the use
of grade point average and class rank as the only
measures of academic performance can be criticized
for ignoring between-school differences; i.e., the same
average grade or rank can have different meanings in
different schools depending on the quality of the
schools (Bassiri &amp; Schulz, 2003). A more
comprehensive study of the importance of academic
performance should, therefore, also take account of
the quality of the school the individual is attending.
Third, as already discussed in Section 7.1, the
predictive power of intelligence in younger samples
could have been underestimated by using a single
test–retest reliability coefficient for all studies that
did not provide reliability coefficients of their own.
Although it was concluded above that the
underestimation was minimal, it would still be desirable to
pay more attention to this problem in the future
research.</p>
      <p>As a possible limitation and implication for future
research, it should also be noted that one of the big
questions that looms behind every paper that deals
with intelligence and success, the question of genetic
versus environmental influences on IQ and social
status, was not directly addressed in this paper. The
fact that IQ scores predict socioeconomic success
does not, in itself, tell us whether the effect of
intelligence can be attributed to genes or
environment. On the one hand, there is clear evidence that
children's IQ scores are correlated with parental SES
(White, 1982), this result together with the fact that
parental SES predicts socioeconomic success (see
Table 1) can be interpreted as showing that
environment is the “final cause” of one's success or
failure. This conclusion has been criticized for
ignoring the genetic influences on parental SES
(Jensen, 1998). On the other hand, the evidence on
the heritability of intelligence (Devlin, Daniels, &amp;
Roeder, 1997) and socioeconomic success (Rowe,
Vesterdal, &amp; Rodgers, 1999) together with the
evidence on the relationship between intelligence
and success (see Table 1) can be taken as proof that
parents' and children's social status are both
determined by the genes for intelligence that run in
the family. This conclusion has been challenged by
Bowles and Gintis (2002) who argued that,
although socioeconomic success might be heritable,
the genetic inheritance of IQ, in particular, plays
only a very minor part in this process. The results
of the present meta-analysis, although not directly
addressing these issues, can be useful in these
discussions if combined with the results from other
studies.
