      <abstract>
        <p>The processing of facial identity and emotion in schizophrenia and its relation with these patients' cognitive and social functioning has been extensively studied over the last 25 years. In this paper, the results of 32 studies indexed in the PubMed database and published between 2001 and 2005 are analyzed and synthesized. Following the description of the problem and presentation of current hypotheses, methodological aspects and findings concerning the processing of facial emotion and identity are discussed. The analysis shows that, despite the growing attention dedicated to the theme and the provision of more specific results, the question of dependence/ independence between the two processes - emotion and identity recognition - and between these and the pervasive cognitive deficits found in schizophrenia remains unanswered. Keywords: schizophrenia, face, emotion, affect, identity.</p>

      <p>No other part of the human body is able to convey,
from an immediate visual appraisal, so much essential
information for survival and social functioning as the face.
The facial features, which generate this information, may
be divided in two groups: structural (the face’s physical
features) and dynamic (derived from the automatic or
deliberate movement of the facial features).</p>
      <p>These two groups may be better understood according
to the type of information each transmits. Thus, structural
features are those essentially responsible for the composition
of an individual’s facial identity. Besides identity, the
structural features of the face still transmit information
on the individual’s gender and age, participating in the
regulation of a broader social contact. The dynamic features
of the face refer to the multiple possibilities of organization
of the face’s internal elements (eyes, mouth, eyebrows,
etc.) as to create different facial expressions, indicators of
the emotional context elicited by the environment.</p>
      <p>The importance of the face in human interaction has
drawn the attention of researchers for over a century. Darwin
(1872) carried out a deep study on affect manifestations
in humans and animals, suggesting that facial expressions
represent innate and automatic behavioral patterns.
According to this idea, it is reasonable to suppose that the
human capacity to quickly and precisely decode facial
expressions such as fear, for instance, has been selected
throughout evolution due to its adaptive value.</p>
      <p>Following Darwin’s steps, other researchers found
evidence that led them to propose that facial expressions
are automatic representations derived from the individual’s
emotional experience. Hence, the informative value of such
expressions is not their essential function, but a secondary
effect of an internal and individual emotional experience
(Izard &amp; Malatesta, 1987; Ekman, 1997).</p>
      <p>In contrast, Blair (2003) suggests that facial expressions
of emotion mainly serve a communicational purpose,
where the individual can transmit information on the
emotional valence of objects and situations to observers
of the same species. Therefore, the conditions for an
emotional representation require not only an emotional
event, but also a potential observer. Consistent with this,
empirical evidence suggests that emotional expressions are
not the automatic result of an internal emotional condition,
but depend on the social context or even on the deliberate
action of the person displaying the emotion.</p>
      <p>Such a complex ability to decode important facial
information in the environment, emotional or
identityrelated, will rely on the harmonic functioning of strategies
learned throughout development and the neural systems
underlying the processing of facial information.
Identity and emotion</p>
      <p>Though apparently indistinct at first sight, evidence
suggests that the processing of facial identity and facial
affect relies on diverse and interconnected, systems. The
model proposed by Bruce and Young (1986) suggests
that facial affect is unimportant for face recognition.
Instead, they propose that recognition relies on ‘Facial
Recognition Units’ (FRU) that contain the basic structural
codes for recognition. According to this model, whenever
the observer encounters an emotional face, this face
undergoes a normalization process during which the
dynamic features are left aside. The normalized face is
then submitted to an appreciation based on the FRUs
to then be identified. In short, the model proposes the
functional independence between the processing of
identity and emotion.</p>
      <p>Despite the coherence of that model, the question of
dependence/independence between the processing of emotion
and identity remains unanswered. In a study to investigate
the effects of expression on recognition, Endo, Endo, Kirita
and Maruyama (1992) designed a task using familiar and
unfamiliar faces representing three emotions: happiness,
sadness and neutral affect. The results showed that the time
for face recognition was strongly affected by emotional affect,
neutral faces being recognized faster than emotional faces.
Pathology and facial information processing</p>
      <p>Despite the above proposition that the human ability to
decode faces is innate and results from successful adaptation,
that ability likely improves after birth, throughout the
developmental process. Additionally facial decoding may
be subject to the same risks of failure observed in other
cognitive and neuropsychological functions. Part of the
healthy development of facial information processing
involves the capacity to modulate and respond properly
to the environment’s social requirements. Saarni (1984)
observed that facial disappointment expressed by a young
child who receives a poorer than expected gift is much more
easily perceived than the same feeling expressed by an older
child. Accordingly, one may infer that certain conditions
may have a negative influence on the development and
enhancement of this perceptive modality. Thus leaving
open the possibility of erroneous interpretation of the
social context or even to the inability of accomplishing any
functional appraisal at all.</p>
      <p>Probably the most well documented example of such
dysfunctions (Damasio et al., 1982; De Renzi et al., 1990;
Farah, 1991, in Posamentier &amp; Abdi, 2003) is prosopagnosia
(from the Greek prosopon, ‘face’ + agnosia, ‘ignorance’). In
that condition the individual is unable to identify familiar
faces, resorting to other clues (voice, gestures, etc.) in order
to recognize people. Despite such impairment, however, the
capacity to interpret facial emotions may remain perfectly
healthy in these individuals. Besides prosopagnosia,
which refers more specifically to the dysfunction in face
identification, several studies have also supplied evidence
of impaired facial emotion recognition in psychiatric
conditions such as depression, social phobia, panic disorder,
and schizophrenia. Such impairment, in contrast with
prosopagnosia whose circumscription is quite precise, may
have varied presentations and is object of disagreement
among researchers.</p>
      <p>Faces and schizophrenia</p>
      <p>The study of facial emotion processing in
schizophrenia has faced a series of obstacles, such as the
lack of standardized stimuli in the beginning, and the
challenge of knowing exactly which cognitive processes
were enrolled in each task’s demands. These issues did not
hinder research from expanding and providing important
findings since the middle 1980s, when better focused
and systematic studies started to appear. However, some
crucial questions remain. Facial information decoding
depends not only on the integrity of the perceptual
system itself, but also on some cognitive functions
such as memory and attention. Generally speaking, the
schizophrenic patient presents important neurocognitive
impairments, rendering the distinction between the
effects of these and possible specific impairment in facial
processing a difficult undertaking. Besides the question of
‘global deficit vs. specific deficit’, schizophrenia may be
divided in subtypes, according to the group of prominent
symptoms. The current research on facial processing
in schizophrenia has been obliged to clearly define the
patient group that is studied since the impairment in face
perception seems to be subject to the disease’s different
presentations.</p>
      <p>The objective of this review is to make a survey of
the studies on processing of facial identity and emotion
in schizophrenic patients published in the last 5 years,
analyzing their methodological aspects and results, which
point to answers for the questions posed above.
Paper search and selection</p>
      <p>The search was conducted on the Medline database using
the keywords “schizophrenia”, “affect”, “identity”, “face”
and “facial”, identifying a total of 97 papers, from which
32 were selected. Inclusion criteria were empirical studies
published in the last five years in English, Portuguese or
Spanish, involving the processing of facial identity and/or
emotion in schizophrenia. The time range, set at five years,
was determined in function of the publication of similar
studies in 1994 (Phillips &amp; David), 1997 (Mueser et al.)
and 2002 (Edwards et al.).</p>
      <p>Population</p>
      <p>The 32 studies involved a total of 2641 participants,
which were divided into three groups for this analysis:
schizophrenia patients (SP), patients with other diagnoses
(POD) and healthy controls (HC). The two groups of
patients account for about half of the total, the remaining
half being composed by HC.</p>
      <p>Among the 2503 participants whose gender was
noted (one of the studies did not specify the gender
distribution of a group of 138 healthy controls), 59%
(1,496) were male, and 41% (1,007) female. The
distribution of gender by group was more uneven among
SP, where there were almost two times more men than
women (903 and 469, respectively). In the POD and HC
groups, the differences were not as dramatic: 206 male
and 180 female in the first; 387 male and 358 female in
the second.</p>
      <p>Regarding age, some studies provided means, while
others informed the range, making it impossible to determine
either a general mean or a global range. In the SP group,
means varied between 17.6 (SD = 3.1) and 47.7 (SD = 7.1),
and the range was 18-60. In the HC group, means varied
between 21.7 (SD = 6.05) and 48.2 (SD = 9.6), while the age
range was 18-45. Four studies had no control groups.</p>
      <p>The POD group included 44 patients with affective
disorders (1 study), 41 with depression (2 studies), 35
autistic patients (1 study) and 30 brain-lesioned patients
(1 study). First-degree relatives of schizophrenic patients
(134; 3 studies) and autistic patients (102; 1 study) were also
included in this group since they were regarded as ‘cases’
in the studies they took part in. Given the small number
of participants in each condition, specific information on
gender and age are unimportant.</p>
      <p>Tasks</p>
      <p>A series of differences among the experimental designs
adopted by each study was observed. Most authors adopted
tasks specifically developed for their studies, despite
the existence of consolidated tasks to evaluate facial
information processing [e.g. Benton Facial Recognition
Test (BFRT – Benton, Hamsher, Varney &amp; Spreen, 1983),
Kinney’s Affect Matching Task (KAMT – Kinney, 1995)].</p>
      <p>The different tasks used may be divided into four general
categories, according to their requirements: 1) Emotion
recognition: labeling of facial emotions using predefined
categories or subjective judgment. 2) Emotion discrimination:
response based on emotional face presented previously or
simultaneously to a target stimulus. 3) Emotional intensity
determination: response based on differences of emotional
intensity represented in the stimulus.</p>
      <p>Stimuli</p>
      <p>The same diversity in the tasks chosen was observed
in the stimuli that were used. The most used stimuli (9
studies) were, as expected, the series “Pictures of Facial
Affect” by Ekman and Friesen (1976), followed by original
or unidentified series (11 studies) of pre-existent tests like
the BFRT or KAMT (4 studies), series by Matsumoto and
Ekman (3 studies), series by Mazurski and Bond (2 studies),
schematic faces (1 study), and series by Izard (1).
Identity</p>
      <p>The first main point is that research on facial information
processing in schizophrenia focuses mainly on emotion
recognition, with the processing of identity coming in
second place. All the 32 studies investigated facial affect
recognition, but only 50% also investigated non-emotional
aspects, included in the category “identity.” Among the
16 studies that investigated identity processing, seven
(43.75%) found no differences between schizophrenics
and healthy controls in this function. Schizophrenic
patients with and without hearing impairment and healthy
controls did not differ in BFRT performance (Kubota et
al., 2003). The same procedure and results were found in
a study by Scholten, Aleman, Montagne and Kahn (2005),
comparing facial recognition abilities in male and female
schizophrenics. Gur et al. (2002), using an age estimation
paradigm, also failed to find differences between a group
of patients and healthy controls.</p>
      <p>Additionally, no differences were observed by
Combs and Gouvier (2004) when comparing measures
of attention and facial identity processing. Still among
the studies that found no differences between patients
and controls in identity processing, Schwartz, Marvel,
Drapalski, Rosse and Deutsch (2002) observed that
patients are as influenced as healthy controls by changes
in facial configuration This finding supports the idea that
schizophrenics have a contextual appraisal of the face,
rather than a compartmented one.</p>
      <p>Despite these negative results, a discretely higher
proportion of studies investigating identity processing
(56.25%) did find differences between patients and controls.
Kucharska-Pietura, David, Masiak and Phillips (2005)
state that schizophrenics are more impaired than controls
in face recognition, and that such impairment correlates
with illness’ duration. Identity-related cognitive deficits
were investigated by Bozikas, Kosmidis, Anezoulaki,
Giannakou and Karavatos (2004), who verified memory
and verbal fluency impairment in patients, and by Sachs,
Steger-Wuchse, Kryspin-Exner, Gur and Katschnig (2004),
who reported impairment in verbal memory,
abstractionflexibility and language processing.</p>
      <p>Some studies suggest that facial recognition may
be impaired due to restricted visual scanpath patterns
(Loughland, Williams, &amp; Gordon, 2002; Loughland,
Williams, &amp; Harris, 2004). In practice, schizophrenics
do not ‘see’ the face as healthy people do, fixating more
on peripheral and less important zones than on the facial
features that transmit information about identity. Curiously,
an attenuated form of these abnormal patterns was also
observed in first-degree relatives of schizophrenic patients.
The results of two other studies lie within an intermediate
zone, indicating that schizophrenic patients have problems
in the performance of affect matching tasks in different facial
identities (Baudouin, Martin, Tiberghien, Verlut, &amp; Franck,
2002; Martin, Baudouin, Tiberghien, &amp; Franck, 2005). The
proposed explanation is that these individuals’ inability to
disregard irrelevant information for the execution of the
task is correlated with negative symptoms.</p>
      <p>Emotion</p>
      <p>All 32 studies investigated facial emotion processing
in schizophrenia. Among those, five (15.6%) failed to find
differences between patients and healthy controls: Holt
et al. (2006) found no differences in emotional intensity
judgments using a six-point Likert scale. Comparing patients
with their first-degree relatives and healthy controls, Bölte
and Poustka (2003), found similar performance in all three
groups. Gur et al. (2002) reported no differences between
patients and controls in an age estimation task involving
emotional faces. Schwartz et al. (2002) investigated the
effect of configurational changes in emotion recognition
and concluded that changes in face position or combination
of different faces do not influence the process. Lastly,
Baudouin at al. (2002) propose that variations in emotional
expressions do not affect the recognition of facial identity.</p>
      <p>In spite of these negative results, most of the studies
(84.4%) found differences in the processing of facial
emotion in schizophrenics. With the development of the
research in the field, the results of these studies may be
analyzed separately, according to their specificity.
Schizophrenia, cognition and social functioning</p>
      <p>A study involving samples of schizophrenic patients
with single and multiple episodes found that the
recognition of facial emotion correlates with social and
cognitive functioning in schizophrenia (Addington,
Saeedi, &amp; Addington, 2006). Additionally, other studies
showed that men and women are differentially impaired in
social contact, with males being the most affected (Hooker
&amp; Park, 2002; Scholten et al., 2005). This difference
between genders, also observed in healthy people, remains
unchanged in schizophrenia.</p>
      <p>Results show that the impairment in emotion
recognition may be related to cognitive deficits in
different domains such as verbal memory, language
processing and attention (Combs &amp; Gouvier, 2004;
Bozikas et al., 2004; Sachs et al., 2004). Martin et
al. (2005), although not indicating specific cognitive
deficits, suggest that schizophrenics again have
difficulties disregarding irrelevant facial information for
the execution of certain tasks. In this study, patients had
problems matching photographs of the same emotion
represented by distinct facial identities.</p>
      <p>Social functioning problems resulting from
dysfunctional emotional perception in schizophrenia may
still be linked to the visual scanpath patterns observed in
these patients. According to two studies by Loughland
et al. (2002, 2004), schizophrenics show restricted
visual scanpaths which lead to deficits mainly, but not
exclusively, in the recognition of neutral and happy faces.
An attenuated version of such a pattern is also be observed
in these patients’ first-degree relatives.</p>
      <p>Affect processing and symptomatology</p>
      <p>As proposed in the introduction, the research on facial
information processing in schizophrenia has evolved,
supplying more specific results related to different aspects
of the schizophrenia. Evidence shows that patients with
chronic schizophrenia have greater impairment in affect
recognition than those in the beginning of the illness,
which in turn are more impaired compared to healthy
people (Kucharska-Pietura et al., 2005). Hearing impaired
schizophrenics showed greater deficits compared to
patients with normal hearing (Kubota et al., 2003) while
disorganized and paranoid patients proved more impaired
than residual patients (Weniger, Lange, Ruther, &amp; Irle,
2004). Lastly, patients with blunted affect showed greater
speed-accuracy decomposition (faster responses – probably
linked to difficulty in sustaining concentration in the
task – resulting in more judgment mistakes) in one study
(Gur et al., 2006), but decreased response speed in another
(Suslow, Roestel, &amp; Arolt, 2003).</p>
      <p>Some studies also pointed to deficits for specific
emotions. For example, patients with higher psychopathy
scores are more impaired in the recognition of sadness
(Fullam &amp; Dolan, 2006), schizophrenics in remission
have greater difficulties recognizing sadness and anger,
but not other emotions (Bediou et al., 2005), patients with
blunted affect and anhedonia show increased sensitivity
for negative emotions (Suslow, Droste, Roestel, &amp; Arolt,
2005), and paranoid patients present abnormal amplitudes
during the visualization of neutral faces in ERP studies
(Herrmann, Reif, Jabs, Jacob, &amp; Fallgatter, 2006).
Intervention</p>
      <p>One of the studies (Wolwer et al., 2005) submitted two
groups of patients to distinct training programs (one aimed
at the remediation of cognitive deficits: CRT – Cognitive
Remediation Training, and another specifically at emotion
recognition: TAR – Training of Affect Recognition).
After verifying that schizophrenics were impaired in the
recognition of facial emotions, The TAR group displayed
significant improvement in the recognition of facial emotions,
approaching the performance of the control group.</p>
      <p>According to our analyses, we found that research
on facial information processing has been evolving,
providing specific results related to different aspects of the
schizophrenic disorder. The study on facial information
perception is divided in two wide domains: 1) processing
of identity and 2) processing of emotion. The analyses
indicate that there is substantially greater interest in
the research related to emotional information, possibly
motivated by the search for deeper comprehension of the
mechanisms which lead to the precarious social adaptation
of the schizophrenic patient.</p>
      <p>Besides impaired social functioning, cognitive deficits
in different domains are observed in schizophrenia, such
as attention, memory and language processing. The
observation of these impairments has led researchers to
question whether the deficits in the processing of emotion
and identity are specific phenomenon or the result of global
cognitive impairment. The results of the studies we analyzed
do not allow for the elaboration of a definitive answer,
since they offer evidence pointing in diverse directions. In
spite of this, there seems to be a solid correlation between
memory impairment and identity processing, and between
impaired attention and language and emotion processing.
Further research dedicated to comprehensive cognitive
assessment in conjunction with face processing tasks,
might help establish the basis of this interaction.</p>
      <p>Another question, derived from the one above, is
whether identity and emotion processing is differentially
impaired in schizophrenia. Almost a third of the studies
which investigated both these domains found no differences
between schizophrenics and healthy controls regarding
identity processing, but found patients impaired in emotion
recognition. The remaining two thirds found impairment
in both domains. This numerical difference, however, is
not enough to confirm the hypothesis of a global deficit in
face perception, since there are important differences in the
study designs.</p>
      <p>The major troublesome factor for a global analysis of the
results from the different studies is the plethora of tasks and
stimuli used. The use of standardized tasks would facilitate
the comparison of results, but is hindered by the virtual
impossibility of developing a small number of instruments
adequate for the investigation of quite different aspects of
the same problem.</p>
      <p>Since no doubts seem to be left regarding the
correlation between schizophrenia and facial processing
deficits, the current area of most interest is the
investigation of differences among the different patient
subgroups. The most robust evidence in this direction
indicates that patients with negative symptoms are
more impaired than those without these symptoms. This
more pronounced impairment is be true both for the
processing of identity and emotion as well and, even
more specifically, for the perception of negative valence
emotions. Besides that, paranoid schizophrenics seem
to show increased sensitivity for negative facial stimuli
and neutral faces, tending to overestimate the intensity
of negative emotions and attribute emotional content
where there is none. It is possible that these factors take
part in the genesis of hallucinations and delusions in this
group of patients. Lastly, some results indicate that all
these deficits outlined above, both identity and
emotionrelated, general or specific, could stem from abnormal
patterns of visual face exploration. The visual fixation
in unimportant regions of the face and the inability to
disregard unrelated contextual information (such as the
extraction of the emotional meaning of a face regardless
of its identity, for example) provide strong evidence in
this direction.
