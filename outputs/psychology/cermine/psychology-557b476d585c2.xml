        <p>This cross-cultural study investigated and compared the influence of hardiness in burnout among Portuguese and Brazilian nurses, as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory- Human Service Survey (MBI-HSS) and the Personal Views Survey (PVS). The sample consisted of 630 nurses working in hospitals (394 Portuguese, 236 Brazilians). The statistical analysis using multiple linear regression showed that hardiness is a personality trait that explains burnout, presenting different predictive models for each sample. Results suggested that overall work characteristics and work settings of Portuguese and Brazilian nurses explained the differences found between the samples. Findings suggested that future applied interventions aiming to reduce burnout among Portuguese and Brazilian nurses, should contemplate different hardiness dimensions.

      <title>con Enfermeros Portugueses y Brasileños</title>
      <p>Se trata de un estudio transcultural que busca explorar la influencia del hardiness en las dimensiones
del síndrome de burnout en enfermeras brasileñas y portuguesas, evaluados con el Maslach Burnout
Inventory-Human Services (MBI-HSS) e do Personal Views Survey (PVS). La muestra fue
constituida por 630 enfermeras (394 portugueses, 236 brasileños) que trabajavan en el contexto hospitalario.
Los resultados obtenidos mediante análisis de regresión lineal múltiple indican que el hardiness,
como un rasgo de la personalidad, explica significativamente el síndrome de burnout en enfermeras,
mostrando diferencias significativas en los modelos de predicción de acuerdo con la nacionalidad. La
evidencia destaca la importancia de las características del trabajo y el contexto de para explicar las
diferencias encontradas en ambas muestras. Los resultados sugieren que las intervenciones para reducir
el burnout en enfermeros portugueses y brasileños deben tener en cuenta las diferentes dimensiones
de hardiness.</p>
      <p>Palabras clave: Síndrome de Burnout, personalidad hardiness enfermeras, estudio transcultural.</p>
      <p>The Syndrome of Burnout (SB) has
received increased attention over the last years across
nations. This fact is associated with a global
change in socio economic factors, particularly
moving from an economy based on industry to
an economy based on services. Consequently,
this change caused increased demands for
professionals, experiencing more and more
psychological pressure over time (Schaufeli, Leiter, &amp;
Maslach, 2009).</p>
      <p>Maslach and Jackson (1981) defined burnout
symptoms as: (a) emotional exhaustion, in which
professionals feel that they are no longer able to
cope at a psychological level; (b)
depersonalization (or cynicism), characterized as negative and
cynical attitudes and feelings towards clients.</p>
      <p>The last dimension represents the interpersonal
context dimension of burnout (c) reduced
efficacy or personal accomplishment, understood as
the professionals’ tendency to evaluate oneself
negatively, particularly their work with clients.</p>
      <p>It is related with feelings of incompetence and a
lack of achievement at work.</p>
      <p>Nursing has been considered the most
stressful profession among health care
workers (Pisanti, Van der Doef, Maes, Lazzari, &amp;
Bertini, 2011). This is likely to be related with
the different demands nurses face in the work
context. Several work stressors experienced by
nurses have been described in the literature. As
an example, Gray-Toft and Anderson (1981)
have identified stressors related with: physical
environment (eg. workload); social environment
stressors (eg. conflict with staff) and
psychological environmental stressors (eg. death and
dying, lack of staff support, uncertainty associated
with treatment, and lack of preparation to deal
with the emotional needs of patients and their
families). Furthermore, as suggested by a report
developed by Pricewaterhouse Coopers (2002)
nurses enter the health care field with the
believe that they will have the time, the resources,
and continued support to meet the needs of their
patients and give them a high level of quality
care. However, as suggested by the same report.</p>
      <p>Hence, due to all these factors, nurses are likely
to be more prone to burnout, which may
negatively affect the quality of nursing care, increase
turnover, absenteeism and reduced productivity
(Raiger, 2005).</p>
      <p>Added to this fact, individual characteristics
have shown to also influence nurses’ experience
of stress in the work context
(Saksvik-Lehouilliera et al., 2012). Additionally, culture appears
to be an important concept influencing burnout
levels among nurses (Turnipseed &amp; Turnipseed,
1997). However, little is known about the
influence of personality factors predicting burnout
among nurses across different cultures,
especially between Portugal and Brazil. Since as
suggested by Triandis and Suh (2002) there are both
universal and culture-specific aspects of
variation in personality. It would be interesting to
further understand the differences in personality
factors predicting burnout among nurses across
cultures. Furthermore, as nursing is a profession
that involves cultural care diversity (Leininger,
1978) it seems critical to further understand how
personality factors across cultures predict
nurses’ burnout in order to design cultural sensitive
interventions.</p>
      <p>The model of Burnout proposed by
Maslach, Schaufeli, and Leiter (2001) emphasizes
the importance of work characteristics and
context as predictors of burnout. However, it is
lkely that personality traits also play an important
role in the development of burnout. Although
some evidence has emerged supporting this
view, little is known about this particular
relationship (Azeem, 2010; Ghorpade, Lackritz,
&amp; Singh, 2007). In a meta-analysis conducted
by Alarcon, Eschleman and Bowling (2009)
examining the relationship between
personality and burnout, it was found that self-esteem,
self-efficacy, locus of control, emotional
stability, extraversion, conscientiousness,
agreeableness, positive affectivity, negative affectivity,
optimism, proactive personality, and hardiness
were associated with the three dimensions of
the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Particularly,
hardiness showed the stronger relationship with
all the three dimensions of burnout compared
with the other personality factors under study.</p>
      <p>As recommended by the authors, these findings
highlight the need to further examine the
relationship between hardiness and burnout.</p>
      <p>Hardiness has been defined as a
personality construct that reflects the extent to which
a person is able to face stressors without
experiencing ill effects, such as psychological or
physical strains (Kobasa, 1979). Kobasa
suggested that the concept is a resilience resource
that can be applied in stressful situations and
which is assumed to protect the person from
stress. Hence, the construct has emerged as an
important buffer in the relationship between
stressors and illness (Maddi, 1999). Hardiness
comprises a high sense of life and work
commitment, perceptions of control, and high openness
to change and challenge, as well as a more
positive appraisal of stress. Thus, the dimensions of
commitment, control and challenge define the
construct of hardiness (Kobasa, Maddi, &amp;
Puccetti, 1982). Commitment reflects a dedication to
oneself and to one’s work. Control is the extent
to which an individual influences life events to
ensure a particular outcome. Challenge refers to
the extent to which individuals perceive
challenges as opportunities. Risquez, Fernández and
Sánchez-Meca (2011) suggested that hardiness
influences the person’s health through the type
and intensity of the stressors experienced, and
by restricting or assisting the use of specific
coping strategies. This idea is also supported
by research conducted by Beehr and Bowling
(2005) examining hardiness as a moderator of
stressor-strain relationships. More specifically,
hardiness is expected to yield a negative
relationship with burnout via effects on both the
perceived and objective nature of the work
environment (Alarcon et al., 2009).</p>
      <p>In what concerns to the relationship
between personality and burnout among nurses,
some evidence has been found in the
literature (e.g., Boyle Grap, Younger, &amp; Thornby,
1991; Ghorpade, Lackritz, &amp; Gangaram, 2011;
Phillips, 2011; Risquez et al., 2011;
SaksvikLehouilliera et al., 2012; Simoni &amp; Paterson,
1997). In particular, hardiness has shown to
be a protector in the process of burnout among
nurses (Garrosa, Rainho, Moreno-Jiménez, &amp;
Monteiro, 2010).</p>
      <p>Additionally, how individual differences
influence the stress-strain outcomes seems to
be an important topic of research in today’s
increasingly culturally mixed work environments
(Györkös, Becker, Massoudi, Bruin, &amp;
Rossier, 2012). In agreement with this idea, Smith,
Fisher, and Sale (2001) suggested that recently
the need for cross-cultural studies in
Occupational Psychology (OP) research has become
more and more evident. Despite this necessity,
cross-cultural studies in OP are not very
common, mostly due to methodological difficulties
of cross-cultural research (Smith et al., 2001).</p>
      <p>Thus, the current study aimed to compare
whether there was a different predictive model
of hardiness in burnout for Portuguese and
Brazilian nurses. Since this study is exploratory in
nature, therefore no detailed hypothesis can be
presented. However, contemplating nursing job
characteristics variations across both countries,
it is hypothesized that different dimensions of
hardiness would predict burnout for Brazilian
and Portuguese nurses. Findings from this
original research study, will develop the
theoretical knowledge in the area of cross-cultural
research in OP, and will highly contribute to the
applied field of nursing.</p>
      <p>This study was cross-sectional in nature
(Grimes &amp; Shulz, 2002) and was conducted in
Portuguese and Brazilian’ hospitals. Data was
collected across four large public general
hospitals (1500 to 5000 employees) located in a
major metropolitan city of both countries
(PortoPortugal and Porto Alegre-Brazil). Participants
included 630 nurses (394 Portuguese, 236
Brazilians). Portuguese sample’ mean age was 34.3
(SD = 8.3) years old. Most were women (77.2%),
married (56.0%), had children (61.0%), and were
in permanent positions (68.4%). Participants
worked in that hospital an average length of 10.2
years (SD = 7.9). Brazilian sample´ mean age
was 34 (SD = 8.2) years old. Participants were
women (81.4%), married (61.9%), had
children (66.9%), and worked with the remainder in
temporary positions of varying contract length
(58.2%). Participants had worked in a hospital
an average length of 2.5 years (SD = 3.9).</p>
      <p>Sociodemographic and Occupational
Questionnaire. The questionnaire pack gathered data
regarding gender, age, marital status, children,
sort of contract (temporary/long term),
exclusivity (worked in other institution), time working
in that institution.</p>
      <p>Maslach Burnout Inventory – Human
Services Survey (MBI-HSS; Maslach &amp; Jackson,
1981). The instrument was validated to
Portuguese language by Carlotto and Câmara (2007).</p>
      <p>The MBI is a 22-item scale designed to
measure three dimensions of BS: Emotional
exhaustion (9 items), Depersonalization (5 items), and
Personal accomplishment (8 items). Each item
is answered on a five-point response scale
ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (everyday). A separate
score was calculated for each of the three
subscales.</p>
      <p>Personal Views Survey (PVS). Developed
by Kobasa (1982), was used to assess hardiness,
with a version adapted and translated to
Portuguese language by Mallar and Capitão (2004).</p>
      <p>This instrument consists of 50 items measuring
hardiness trait, composed by three dimensions:
Commitment (16 items), Control (17 items) and
Challenge (17 items). The frequency with which
the subject experiences feelings relating to each
scale is rated on a four point Likert scale ranging
from 0 (not at all true) to 3 (completely true).</p>
      <p>A separate score was calculated for each of the
three subscales.</p>
      <p>Hospitals management teams were
contacted, to explain and present the aims of the study.</p>
      <p>Following research ethics approval from
university and hospitals, permission was given to
contact nurse’s team leaders and schedule data
collection procedures using anonymous
questionnaires. The instruments used were part of
a larger study on occupational health
psychology in the workplaces. In the Brazilian sample,
questionnaire pack was fulfilled in the
presence of a researcher. In the Portuguese sample,
questionnaires were handed in to participants
and returned by post to the researcher.
Fulfillment of the questionnaire took approximately
20 minutes to complete. Data collection for both
countries was collected over the year of 2010.</p>
      <p>All participants were informed that their answers
would be treated anonymously and
confidentially. Written informed consent was obtained from
participants. No financial or material incentives
were offered to participants.</p>
      <p>The statistical program PASW version 18
(SPSS/PASW, Chicago, IL) was used to
conduct data analysis. After screening for outliers
and normality, Cronbach alphas were obtained
for all study variables. Descriptive statistics
were used to calculate frequencies, mean scores,
and standard deviations. The strength and
direction of relationships among variables were
determined using the parametric Pearson’s
correlation coefficient measure. Prior to performing the
regression analysis, the data were checked for
multicollinearity, normality, linearity,
homoscedasticity, independence of residuals and outliers.</p>
      <p>No major violations of the assumptions of the
regression analysis were found. Multiple linear
regression analyses (Stepwise Method) were
performed to investigate the relationship
between burnout and hardiness for the Portuguese
and Brazilian samples. The three PVS subscales
were used as the independent variables and the
three MBI subscales were used as the dependent
variables. Hence, sex, age and time of service
were controlled and three separate hierarchical
regression analyses were performed. The
selection of the predictor variables was performed
with the level of significance p &lt; .05. In order
to provide a more objective measure of the size
of the observed differences between the two
samples (Portugal and Brazil), effect sizes for
the regression analyses were also calculated
using Effect size R2 where values of &lt; .01 indicate
small, &lt; .059 medium and &gt; .138 large effect
sizes (Field, 2009).</p>
      <p>In regression analysis, to compare the power
of the obtained significant effects, standardized
regression coefficients – which can be
considered as effect sizes in terms of standard
deviation units – were calculated for each final model.</p>
      <p>The results of internal consistencies
(Cronbach’s α) and correlations between the variables
of the MBI and PVS are showed among
Portuguese (Table 1) and Brazilian nurses (Table 2).</p>
      <p>The correlation matrix showed that there were
significant correlations between the independent
and the dependent variables for both cultures.</p>
      <p>The personality variables had a positive,
significant correlation with personal accomplishment
and a negative, significant correlation with
emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.</p>

        <p>Results of the hierarchical regression
analyses are showed in Table 3 for
Portuguese nurses and in Table 4 for Brazilian nurses.
For the Portuguese nurses, results obtained for
the dimension of Emotional Exhaustion
suggested that the predictor model is characterized by
the dimensions of Commitment and Challenge.
This regression model explained 27% of the
variance of Emotional Exhaustion, revealing the
highest explanatory power compared with other
dimensions of burnout. In what concerns to
Depersonalization for the Portuguese nurses, the
final model was explained by the dimensions
of Commitment, Challenge and Control by
almost 22.3% of the variance. Commitment and
Control together accounted for almost 13.8%
of the variance in Personal Accomplishment.
In what relates to the results for the
Portuguese nurses, it was found that Commitment (β =
-.372 ) and Challenge (β = -.193) had a negative
relation with Emotional Exhaustion, suggesting
that high levels of Commitment and Challenge
predicted lower levels of Emotional Exhaustion
at work. Depersonalization seemed to
decrease, as Commitment (β = -.189), Challenge (β =
-.127), and Control (β = -.156) increased.
Personal Accomplishment was positively related with
Commitment (β = .219) and Control (β = .146).
Among Portuguese nurses, Commitment
seemed to be the dimension of hardiness that best
predicted variability in burnout.</p>
        <p>When analyzing the Brazilian nurses,
Emotional Exhaustion was predicted by
Commitment and Control with almost 25% of variance.
Control accounted for 24.3% of the variance in
Depersonalization. Personal Accomplishment
was predicted by Commitment and Control with
almost 25.6% of variance. The results revealed
a negative relation between Emotional
Exhaustion, Commitment (β = -.250) and Control (β =
-.206), suggesting that high levels of
Commitment and Control tend to decrease Emotional
Exhaustion at work. Depersonalization was
negatively predicted by Control (β = -.256).
Personal Accomplishment was predicted by
Commitment and Control. These results revealed a
positive relation between the burnout dimension
Personal Accomplishment, and the hardiness
dimensions Commitment (β = .298), and Control
(β = .223). It seems that for the Brazilian nurses,
Control was the dimension of hardiness that best
predicted variability in burnout. Overall, results
found are between the medium (R2 = .120) and
large effect sizes (R2 = .256) recommended by
Field (2009).

        <p>The main aim of this paper was to explore
whether there was a different predictive model
of hardiness in burnout for Portuguese and
Brazilian nurses. Results partially support our
hypothesis that the predictive model of hardiness
in burnout among nurses in these two countries
is mainly different, except for personal
accomplishment. Additionally, although the values
were relatively low, our findings showed that all
the dimensions of hardiness were related with
burnout for both the Portuguese and Brazilian
nurses. Hence, in agreement with previous
research (e.g., Azeem, 2010; Ebling &amp; Carlotto,
2012; Garrosa et al., 2010), our results suggest
that hardiness, as personality trait, is likely to
explain only part of the experience of burnout for
Portuguese and Brazilian nurses.</p>
        <p>Results suggest that there are differences
between nurses in Brazil and Portugal in what
concerns to variables explaining Emotional
Exhaustion and Depersonalization. Particularly,
for Portuguese nurses, it seems that
Commitment was the personality trait that best
explained variability in burnout. On the other hand,
for Brazilian nurses, Control seemed to be the
most important variable explaining burnout.
We believe that these findings can be partially
explained by the differences in the type and
context of work nurses face in each one of the
countries. Furthermore, these results are likely
to be related with the overall work culture of
each country. In Portugal, nurses job, involves
spending most of their time involved in direct
patient care, independently of their health status.
Thus, the relationship developed between the
nurse and the patient has almost a therapeutic
effect. Until recently, nurses in Portugal were
expected to establish a strong nurse-patient
relationship, besides the technical skills required in
caring. Nurses were also required to show
empathy and kindness for the patient health status
and support patient empowerment (Amendoeira,
2006). When analyzing the Portuguese nurses
in our study, the best predictors of Emotional
Exhaustion for these participants were
Commitment and Challenge. It is believed that these
findings may be explained by the professional
emphasis of nurses’ job in Portugal, since it is
more based on nurse-patient assistance and care
(Antunes, 2007). Additionally, these findings
also support previous theory in the area of
assistance care jobs (Edelwich &amp; Brodsky, 1980),
suggesting that people who work in health care
professions are strongly motivated by the will
to help others. Furthermore, when analysing the
Brazilian and Portuguese nurse’s demographic
characteristics, it is clear that Portuguese nurses
spend more time working in the same
institution, compared with Brazilian nurses. Thus, they
suffer less changes in their work environment.
This fact is extremely important in assistant care
jobs, since professionals have an opportunity to
develop their experience of learning and
personal growth in that institution (Leipold, Schacke,
&amp; Zank, 2008). On the other hand, Brazilian
nurses job implies different tasks on a daily
basis, compared with the Portuguese ones. These
include providing care and support to patients,
and conduct administrative work. In this way, in
order to perform these tasks Brazilian nurses are
required not only to have stronger technical
knowledge in the area, but also strong management
skills (e.g., decision making, leadership, good
communication skills), and administrative skills
(e.g., organize paperwork related with
equipment and reports to supervisors; Peres &amp;
Ciampone, 2006). Additionally, nurses in Brazil face
innumerous changes in their work environment.
Some of these include organization shifting their
mission from service to enterprise due to serious
financial problems. In agreement with this point,
Guevara and Mendias (2002) suggested that
Latin American countries have experienced
increased acuity in hospitalized patients and increased
service demand due to coverage expansion
(because of universal coverage in Latin American
countries), along with greater emphasis on cost
control. Additionally, the authors added that
payment systems for patients and providers have
changed, with emphasis on reimbursement,
stricter reimbursement requirements, and strategies
such as managed care. Finally, administrative
changes for Brazilian nurses include the use of
organizational matrices in which nurses appear
to report to more than one supervisor, they have
responsibilities for more than one area, there is
a redistribution of nursing resources, and a focus
on interdisciplinary teams. Thus, it is clear that
the profession of nurse in Brazil is related with
different tasks, and more challenges compared
with the profession of nurse in Portugal. Hence,
our findings tend to somehow highlight these
differences, since that Brazilian nurses seem to use
more Control, possibly for facing the different
tasks and changes at work. This result may be
explained by Brazilian nurses possibly believing
that their actions will influence work events,
anticipating future threats, and decreasing in this
way Emotional Exhaustion. Additionally, the
second strongest predictor of burnout among
Brazilian nurses was Commitment, suggesting that
although this individual characteristic is present
in the sample, it is likely to come after the
management and administrative tasks.</p>
        <p>Finally, for the Portuguese nurses the three
dimensions of hardiness are likely to be
protective factors against Depersonalization, whereas
for the Brazilian nurses only two dimensions of
hardiness (commitment and control) predicted
burnout. It is believed that these findings suggest
that Portuguese nurses may be better prepared
to face the process of distancing from patients,
when compared with Brazilian nurses.</p>
        <p>It is important to highlight that findings
were similar for the burnout dimension Personal
Accomplishment across both samples. In other
words, Commitment and Control predicted
Personal Accomplishment among Portuguese and
Brazilian nurses. This result can be explained by
a historical and universal meaning, related with
nursing job. In support of this idea, White (2002)
suggested that nursing vocation is to be
dedicated and committed to assisting another one who
is disadvantaged, seeking public recognition of
their work. The variance explained by this
model was larger among Brazilian nurses (25.6%)
compared with Portuguese nurses (13%).</p>
        <p>Functional, cultural, economic and
contextual factors of organizations do also play an
important role in influencing professional’s
behavior (Hofstede, 1991; Raiger, 2005; Silva &amp;
Gomes, 2009; Vanheule, Rosseel, &amp; Vlerick,
2007). Hence, it is believed that these factors
may also contribute to the explanation of
similarities and differences found in the predictive
models of burnout among Portuguese and
Brazilian nurses in the current study. In agreement
with this idea, Vanheule et al. (2007) suggested
that burnout differences across samples can be
influenced by differences in job content, work
circumstances, and professional goals in the
respective sectors.</p>
        <p>Our results, support the idea that
personality traits are important predictors of burnout
(Azeem, 2010; Ghorpade et al., 2011; Schaufeli
&amp; Enzmann, 1998; Sheard &amp; Golby, 2007).
Additionally, the percentage of explanation of the
variation found in burnout in our study (between
12% and 27%) was superior to that found
previously in a study by Ghorpade et al. (2011) in the
occupational setting. Particularly, the authors
found that personality provides an additional
6.9% of explanation of the variation of
emotional exhaustion; an additional 11.7% explanation
of the variation in depersonalization; and an
additional 13.8% of the variation in personal
accomplishments. As suggested by Azeem (2010),
the minimum variance of 10% was considered
significant and meaningful. These findings
support previous literature in the area, suggesting
that burnout is an interaction between variables
in the work context and personality factors
(Cano-García, Padilla-Muñoz, &amp; Carrasco-Ortiz,
2005). In sum, some individual characteristics
such as hardiness, may work as protectors against
occupational stress and burnout among
Portuguese and Brazilian nurses. A major strength of
this study was the use of a strong theoretical
basis, as well as reliable and accurate instruments
for data collection purposes. Additionally, the
effect size found, fit the values recommended by
Cohen (1988).</p>
        <p>The encouraging results of this study should
be considered in light of several limitations.
Firstly, as a cross-sectional study, it precludes
evaluation of temporality and causality of the
observed relationships. Further research is required
using longitudinal or experimental designs.
Secondly, although sample size of the samples
support the statistical analyses, results cannot be
generalized, due to samples being collected in
public hospitals in a specific geographic region
of Brazil and Portugal.</p>
        <p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to
compare the relationship between hardiness and
burnout among Brazilian and Portuguese nurses.
When aiming to achieve a competent system of
care, research should conduct cross-culturally
studies, aiming to understand similarities and
differences between the cultures, and valuing
diversity (Cross Bazron, Dennis, &amp; Isaacs, 1989).</p>
        <p>Careful should be drawn when designing
immediate definitive practical interventions
based on the results of this study. However, it
is important to highlight that applied
practitioners in the area, should aim to increase
hardiness training among Brazilian and Portuguese
nurses when aiming to prevent burnout. As
suggested by Maddi (2008) this personality
construct is actively developed through a dynamic
process. In other words, although life is
stressful because it is always changing, people can
turn stressful life events into opportunities for
growth. Despite limitations, our results are
consistent with previous trends in studies conducted
in different clinical, cultural and social contexts
around the world, adding considerable
credibility to the findings. It is believed that this sort of
cross-cultural research among nurses develops
the theoretical knowledge in the area of cultural
diversity among this profession, and provides an
important basis for the design of applied
interventions.
