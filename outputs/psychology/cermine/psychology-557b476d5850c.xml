        <p>SUMMARY-Amid ongoing public speculation about the reasons for sex differences in careers in science and mathematics, we present a consensus statement that is based on the best available scientific evidence. Sex differences in science and math achievement and ability are smaller for the mid-range of the abilities distribution than they are for those with the highest levels of achievement and ability. Males are more variable on most measures of quantitative and visuospatial ability, which necessarily results in more males at both high- and low-ability extremes; the reasons why males are often more variable remain elusive. Successful careers in math and science require many types of cognitive abilities. Females tend to excel in verbal abilities, with large differences between females and males found when assessments include writing samples. High-level achievement in science and math requires the ability to communicate effectively and comprehend abstract ideas, so the female advantage in writing should be helpful in all academic domains. Males outperform females on most measures of visuospatial abilities, which have been implicated as contributing to sex differences on standardized exams in mathematics and science. An evolutionary account of sex differences in mathematics and science supports the conclusion that, although sex differences in math and science performance have not directly evolved, they could be indirectly related to differences in interests and specific brain and cognitive systems. We review the brain basis for sex differences in science and mathematics, describe consistent effects, and identify numerous possible correlates. Experience alters brain structures and functioning, so causal statements about brain differences and success in math and science are circular. A wide range of sociocultural forces contribute to sex differences in mathematics and science achievement and ability-including the effects of family, neighborhood, peer, and school influences; training and experience; and cultural practices. We conclude that early experience, biological factors, educational policy, and cultural context affect the number of women and men who pursue advanced study in science and math and that these effects add and interact in complex ways. There are no single or simple answers to the complex questions about sex differences in science and mathematics.</p>

      <p>The National Science Board (2003) sounded an alarm about
critical workforce shortages in jobs that require high-level
mathematical and science skills. Their fears about a dwindling
pool of mathematicians and scientists has fueled concern that
the United States will not be able to maintain its leadership in
science and technology, which translates directly to an inability
to fill positions that are essential to homeland security. A similar
call to arms had been made by leading economists, who warned
that the shortage of workers with science and math skills is
dampening our economic growth and posing a major threat to our
economic well-being. In the 2000 Biennial Report to the United
States Congress (Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science
and Engineering, 2000, section 5), experts predicted that the
overall rise in employment opportunities in the coming decade
would be around 14%, with employment opportunities in
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (commonly
abbreviated STEM) expected to increase by over 50%. Despite
the serious need for a workforce with high-level skills in science
and mathematics, data from the National Science Foundation
show that ‘‘Women made up almost one-fourth (24 percent) of the
[science and engineering] workforce but close to one-half
(46 percent) of the U.S. workforce, in 1999’’ (National Science
Foundation, 2002b). Making fuller use of the female talent pool
could go a long way toward addressing workforce shortages.
Women are also underrepresented in academic positions at
research universities, especially in science and mathematics. A
recent review found that women in science, engineering, and
technology are less likely to obtain tenure (29% of women
compared to 58% of men in full-time, ranked academic
positions at 4-year colleges) and are less likely to achieve the
rank of full professor (23% of women compared to 50% of men;
Ginther &amp; Kahn, 2006). Why are women underrepresented in
high-level careers in math and science?</p>
      <p>Questions about sex differences in the cognitive abilities
needed for success in science and mathematics have a long
history in scientific psychology. Helen Bradford Thompson’s
(later Woolley) 1903 doctoral dissertation, The Mental Traits
of the Sexes, began with this sentence: ‘‘The object of the present
monograph is to furnish some accurate information on the
muchdiscussed question of the psychology of the sexes’’ (p. 1).
Thompson’s carefully controlled comparisons of males and
females on various ‘‘intellectual faculties’’ is a perfect
introduction to many of the underlying assumptions in explanations
that were offered over the ensuing century for the unequal
outcomes for men and women in academic careers in mathematics
and science. It shows both how much and how little the science
of sex differences has advanced in the last 100 years. Thompson
had almost no empirical work to build upon, whereas
contemporary psychologists have an extensive base of empirical studies
to inform our conclusions; yet, in many ways, we are still asking
the same basic questions. In this report, we present a summary of
what is known about sex differences in mathematics and science
achievement and abilities based on a review and evaluation of
the best available scientific evidence.</p>
      <p>The topic of unequal outcomes for men and women in science
and math areas in academia was brought to the consciousness of
the general public a few years ago, when Lawrence Summers
(2005), then president of Harvard University, remarked publicly
on these discrepancies. He offered three possible explanations
for the low percentage of women in academic positions in
science in mathematics. He raised the possibility that women
are unwilling to reduce their time with family to work the long
hours required to achieve the status of high-level academic
scientists, which requires a near total commitment to one’s work.
He rhetorically asked, ‘‘Who wants to do high-powered intense
work?’’ Summers also discussed the possibility that sex-related
differences in socialization or discrimination during hiring or
promotion could be barriers to female success in science,
mathematics, and engineering, but he said he did not believe
that these mechanisms contributed much to keeping women
as minorities in these fields. His main hypothesis focused on
the finding that there are many fewer females than males at the
upper end of advanced mathematical achievement and ability
tests, which led him to infer that fewer females than males have
the ‘‘innate ability’’ to succeed in academic disciplines that
require advanced mathematical abilities. Summers reasoned
that it was the scarcity of females with exceptional mathematical
talent that explains the disparate ratios of females and males in
mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences.</p>
      <p>This issue of Psychological Science in the Public Interest was
organized in direct response to the heated controversies
generated by Summers’ remarks. There is a large research literature
on the topic of whether and when (in the life span) there are
differences between females and males in cognitive abilities
needed for successful careers in STEM. The research literature
directly addresses questions about the extent to which sex
differences can be attributed to ‘‘innate’’ explanations,
socialization, or the way these two types of influences reciprocally
affect each other. Questions about the ways in which males and
females differ are controversial because conclusions may have
implications for public policies and for the way people think
about education, career choices, and ‘‘natural’’ roles for males
and females in society. We recognize that all social-science
research is conducted in a cultural context that influences the
nature of the questions that may be asked and the evidence
that is accepted as valid. Science can never be free of all biases,
but it is the best method available for finding answers to
politically charged questions. In addressing questions about sex
differences in mathematics and science, we rely on findings that
have been replicated and on the relative transparency of the
scientific method. We also recognize that science is a cumulative
process, so that the conclusions that are drawn today may
change as additional data are collected over time, as society and
people change, and as our understanding of the phenomena
being studied evolves.
The terms we use in this report to describe constructs and the
way we discuss and explain results are important in conveying
our understanding of controversial phenomena. We do not
want to become enmeshed in cultural struggles over ‘‘correct’’
terminology. Thus, we first clarify our usage of terms.
Sex and Gender
One area of contention concerns the use of the terms sex and
gender. Some authors prefer sex to refer to biological distinctions
between people, such as genitals and chromosomes, and gender
to refer to those male and female differences that are thought to
arise from social or environmental influences. On one side of this
issue, there are psychologists who believe that using the term
‘‘gender differences’’ in research that compares females and
males is preferable because it does not imply the origin of the
differences or it conveys a more pro-nurture origin (Caplan &amp;
Caplan, 2005); other authors, writing in outlets such as the
National Women’s Studies Association Journal, have suggested
that the distinction between sex and gender may have outlived
its usefulness, because biology cannot be separated from its
cultural influences and the continued use of two separate terms
perpetuates the westernized view of mind–body dualism
(Severin &amp; Wyer, 2000). Those who oppose the restrictive use of
sex for biological distinctions and gender for social or
environmental ones further note that the dichotomy is often artificial.</p>
      <p>When studying cognitive abilities, it is extremely difficult to
separate biological influences from environmental ones because
the two influences are reciprocal. Halpern (2000, 2004) and
others have advocated a biopsychosocial model (sometimes
called a psychobiosocial model) that emphasizes the complex
influences of biological and social/environmental variables on
cognitive abilities. Consider, for example, brain development.
As we describe in a later section, there are differences between
female and male brains that are influenced initially by prenatal
hormones and later by other hormones over the course of life, but
human brain development is also altered by life experiences,
including the prenatal environment. Similarly, high-performing
students report that the subjects they like the most in school
correspond to the academic disciplines in which they achieve
high scores on standardized tests of knowledge and ability. Not
surprisingly, they engage in more activities that relate to areas
that they like (e.g., reading, math clubs, science competitions),
thus further increasing their knowledge and abilities in these
areas (reviewed in Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2007). It is difficult
to know whether high ability leads to increased interest and
additional activities in an academic domain or whether high
interest in an academic domain and engaging in activities
that develop expertise in that domain lead to high ability. The
distinction between sex and gender is entangled in the debate
about what is biologically determined and what is
environmentally determined. For these reasons, we have chosen—
perhaps arbitrarily but for the sake of clarity—to use the term
sex throughout our report.</p>
      <p>Biological and Innate
Terms like biological and innate are often misunderstood. Humans
are both biological and social beings shaped by the complex
interaction of biology and environment. When psychologists use
the term innate, they are referring to a potential that is ‘‘ready’’
for development in a supportive environment. Innate does not
mean immutable or unchangeable. Hormones, for example, are
chemicals, secreted by endocrine glands, that affect a wide variety
of behaviors and brain development, yet hormonal secretions
change in response to environmental events such as social
victories or defeats (Schultheiss et al., 2005). Learning is both a
biological and an environmental process, and the brain remains
plastic into very old age, changing in response to learning and
environmental events.</p>
      <p>Abilities and Achievement
Abilities and achievement are terms used in assessment, and
although they are theoretically different, in practice they are
often difficult to separate. An achievement test is a test of what
an individual knows at a particular time. A high score on an
achievement test in calculus, for example, is interpreted to mean
that the test taker learned calculus and was willing and able to
demonstrate that learning by solving the problems on the test.
Achievement tests are usually written to reflect a curriculum.
Two people could have the same low score on a mathematics
achievement test and differ widely in their mathematical ability.
One of these individuals could have had several years of
mathematics instruction and learned very little and the other
could have had no mathematics instruction.</p>
      <p>Ability is a more abstract construct; ability tests assess an
individual’s likelihood to benefit from instruction or,
alternatively, how much instruction might be needed to reach a level
of competence. Although the term ability connotes a ‘‘raw’’ or
undeveloped talent, ability assessments usually test content
information that was taught in school (except for projects that
identify precocious talent). Unfortunately, one cannot measure
ability without also measuring achievement to some extent,
so the distinction between these two constructs is somewhat
blurred. We use the term ability as it was defined by Fleishman
(1972): a general trait of an individual that is the product of
learning and development. (Some psychologists have suggested
that the term abilities be replaced with more neutral terms like
skills or performance; Sherman, 1977.)</p>
      <p>Humans are born with innate abilities, such as the ability to
learn a language, but the language they learn, if any, depends
largely on their experience. Similarly, they are born with the
innate ability to count and discern quantities, but how they
develop those abilities depends on their environment and
learning experiences. Abilities are developed in supportive
environments. In this report, we shall refer to abilities in this
broad and environmentally dependent way.</p>
      <p>Intelligence and IQ
Intelligence is another abstract construct in assessment. It is
usually summarized with a single score known as IQ, which stands
for ‘‘intelligence quotient.’’ It was originally derived from a
quotient that included an individual’s test score divided by the score
that would be obtained by an average person of the same age (then
multiplied by 100 so average scores at any age are 100). The most
commonly used intelligence tests have been designed so that
there are no overall sex differences in IQ scores (Brody, 1992).
When items are selected for inclusion in standardized
intelligence tests, items that show an advantage for either males or
females are either discarded during test construction or balanced
with items that show an equal advantage for the other sex. Hence,
overall, there are no sex differences in IQ scores for the most
commonly used tests. Thus, we cannot turn to standardized
intelligence tests to determine if there is a ‘‘smarter sex.’’
The Grade–Test Disparity
In general, females receive higher grades in school in every
subject, including mathematics and science, so the question
is not whether females can learn advanced concepts in
mathematics and science; class grades show that they can and do
(Dwyer &amp; Johnson, 1997; Kimball, 1989). Women constitute a
substantial majority of college enrollments in the United States
and many other countries. American women have received more
college degrees than men every year since 1982, with the female
advantage widening every year. Among women between 25 and
34 years old, 33% have completed college, compared to 29% of
men (Bae, Choy, Geddes, Sable, &amp; Snyder, 2000). Despite these
successes, females score significantly lower on many (though
not all) ‘‘high stakes’’ standardized tests used for admissions
to college and graduate school, including both the Verbal
and Mathematics sections of the SAT (previously called the
Scholastic Aptitude Test) and the Graduate Record Examination
(GRE). Females also score lower than males, on average, in
science and mathematics when the tests are not closely related
to material that has been taught in school (despite getting
higher grades in school-based exams), and males and females
participate in different subfields of mathematics and science at
different rates (Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997).</p>
      <p>Thus, there is a grade–test disparity in successful
achievement in mathematics and science for males and females, with
females achieving better grades in school and males achieving
higher scores on tests designed for admissions to colleges,
universities, and graduate programs. A corollary of this
discrepancy is the finding that standardized tests slightly
underpredict college and graduate school performance for
women and overpredict performance for men (Willingham &amp;
Cole, 1997).</p>
      <p>There are many laws of cognitive psychology that are as
certain as the law of gravity. Here is one: All cognitive abilities
will improve with learning and practice. This is the reason we
have schools: to provide instruction in math, science, and the
other STEM areas and abilities covered in this review. Even
when we conclude that there are meaningful differences
between males and females, this conclusion leaves open the
possibility that the performance gap could be narrowed or closed
with appropriate instruction, just as it could be widened. Ceci
and Papierno (2005) make the point that interventions often
widen achievement gaps between groups because higher-ability
groups can usually achieve greater gains than lower-ability
groups can.</p>
      <p>The questions addressed in this report are about two groups of
females and males, those with average abilities and those at the
highest ability levels, and the possible origins of the differences
within and between these two groups. We are not addressing the
question of whether males and females are similar or different in
their mathematics and science abilities and achievement levels,
because the answer is that males and females are both similar
and different. The similarities between males and females are so
numerous and obvious that we tend to overlook them and
take them for granted. We need to heed the caveats that the
overemphasis on studies of differences can distort the countless
findings of ‘‘no significant differences’’ that routinely are ignored
or unreported. Hyde (2005) has reviewed numerous areas of
research on sex differences among females and males of average
ability and concluded that ‘‘males and females are similar on
most, but not all, psychological variables’’ (p. 581). There are
many critical research-design issues to consider when
evaluating research on sex differences in math and science abilities, but
most critical is the inability to ever ‘‘prove’’ the null hypothesis
that there is no difference between any groups using standard
research methods. So when differences are not found, we are
careful to avoid conclusions that would affirm the null
hypothesis, although we can rely on aggregate analyses across multiple
studies to decide if an effect size or average group difference is
large enough to be meaningful in real-world contexts.
The Size of an Effect
When researchers say ‘‘males are better at X’’ or ‘‘females are
better at Y,’’ it is important to know the magnitude of the
difference claimed. If a nationally normed vocabulary test showed that
females scored statistically significantly higher than males, this
result might sound impressive, but what if it turned out to mean
that, on average, females know 1.5 more vocabulary words than
males? Such a small difference might be statistically but not
practically meaningful. How many words, on average, would the
difference need to be before it became meaningful? There are
statistical formulas for computing effect sizes, but deciding when
a difference is large enough to be important in everyday life is a
matter of judgment, and reasonable people often disagree.</p>
      <p>There are several statistical ways to present the size of the
difference between two (or more) groups. Because we are often
comparing results among several studies in which the dependent
variables (what is measured) could be test scores like the SATs,
reaction time to respond to a target, or accuracy in responding,
a common metric is needed. The most widely used measure
is d (Cohen, 1977):
where Xf is the mean for the female group and Xm is the mean for
the male group, and SDf and SDm are the respective standard
deviations for females and males. Either group mean could be
subtracted from the other, but when females are subtracted
from males, positive values indicate a ‘‘male advantage,’’ and
negative values indicate a ‘‘female advantage.’’ Thus, d provides
a measure of how far apart the means of the two distributions
are in standard deviation units. The value of d can range from
0—meaning no difference was found between the means for the
groups being compared—to values as large as 2 or 3 (or –2 to
–3, which signify the same distance between the means as the
positive values). Large values mean that there is very little
overlap in scores between the two groups. There is no theoretical
limit to the size of d, but practically .8 is generally considered
a large difference. Any value of d can be mathematically
converted into a correlation or another indicator of percentage of
‘‘explained variance’’ (Rosenthal, Rosnow, &amp; Rubin, 2000). It is
important to understand effect sizes, because they are often used
to label a difference between males and females as large or
small. Rosenthal et al. (2000) weighed in on this critical matter:
‘‘Mechanically labeling . . . ds automatically as small, medium,
and large can lead to later difficulties. The reason is that
even small effects can turn out to be practically important’’
(pp. 15–16).</p>
      <p>According to Rosenthal and Rubin (1982), an effect that
accounts for only 4% of the variance (variability among scores)
is associated with a difference of 60% versus 40% of a group’s
performance above average; for example, on a test designed such
that an individual must attain at least an average score to qualify
for admission to a graduate program, then, with this effect size,
60% of one group and 40% of the other group would qualify.
Thus, although effect sizes may sometimes seem ‘‘small,’’ they
can have substantial real-world consequences. In Valian’s
(1998) analysis of females’ slow advancement in academia and
other professions, she showed how smaller disparities were
compounded over time to create larger ones, so the seemingly
small 4% of variance accounted for can be meaningful,
depending on the context and variable being assessed.</p>
      <p>Meta-analyses are used to assess effect sizes across multiple
studies. As the term suggests, a meta-analysis is an analysis of
previous analyses, or an analysis of many individual research
results. The need for meta-analysis is obvious in a research area
in which the size of the literature can be measured in linear
yards or pounds of paper generated. Meaningful integrations of
research findings are the best way to interpret the voluminous
literature. Meta-analysis allows us to take a broad overview in
summarizing research results (Hyde &amp; Linn, 1988).</p>
      <p>THE WHAT, WHEN, AND WHERE OF SEX</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>DIFFERENCES IN MATH AND SCIENCE ACHIEVEMENT</title>
      <p>The question of sex differences in mathematical and science
achievements is really a set of embedded questions, because the
answer depends on (a) which mathematical and science
achievements are studied, (b) how those achievements are
assessed, (c) when in the life span they are assessed, (d) which
portion of the achievement/ability distribution is investigated,
and (e) the context in which achievement is assessed. The
majority of the literature on sex differences in mathematics and
science has investigated differences in three different, broadly
defined, but core cognitive abilities: verbal, visuospatial, and
quantitative abilities (e.g., Carroll, 1992; Snow &amp; Lohman,
1989). These types of abilities are linked in various ways,
because they are used together and, sometimes, compensate for
each other. All are necessary in learning and doing science and
mathematics.</p>
      <p>Terms like verbal, visuospatial, and quantitative are category
headings used to organize and study cognition. They are not
unitary constructs. Verbal abilities for example, apply to all the
components of language usage, including skills like word fluency,
grammar, spelling, reading, vocabulary, verbal analogies, and
language comprehension. Verbal abilities also apply to tasks used
by cognitive psychologists in laboratory settings, such as tasks
measuring speed of lexical access, a reaction-time measure
usually reported in fractions of a second, or those measuring
working-memory span, such as the number of items an individual
can maintain in memory while also engaged in a verbal processing
task (e.g., a task of verbal reasoning). Examples of items used to
assess verbal abilities include tasks such as (a) choosing which in
a group of words are most nearly the same in meaning, (b) solving
verbal analogies, (c) answering questions about complex passages
just read (reading comprehension), (d) answering simple grammar
questions, and (e) writing in response to prompts or other
instructions. These tasks do not tap the same skills even though they
all involve language, and males and females do not differ in the
same way on all of these measures. Thus, different combinations
of these measures give different answers to the question about sex
differences in verbal abilities.</p>
      <p>Visuospatial abilities are also not unitary. In a recent review
of the literature, Halpern and Collaer (2005) described the
multiple components of visuospatial information processing,
including the many different combinations of retrieval from
long-term memory; the generation, maintenance,
transformation, and scanning of images; and the interplay among verbal,
spatial, and pictorial mental representations. Visuospatial
abilities are central to the work of architects, chemists, dentists,
designers, artists, engineers, decorators, mechanics, taxi drivers,
and many other professions. All of these fields rely heavily on the
ability to maintain a visual image while simultaneously deciding
what it would look like if it were viewed from another perspective,
moved to another location, moved through space at various
speeds, or physically altered in some way. Quantitative abilities
are also heterogeneous. Consider the differences among tasks
like simple rote multiplication, word problems, and other more
advanced mathematical tasks (some of which are visuospatial in
nature) like calculus, topology, and geometry.</p>
      <p>Although the initial impetus for this review was the comment
by Lawrence Summers, former president of Harvard, about the
innate abilities of females to be scientists or professors of
science, there are no ‘‘science abilities’’ per se. The
cognitiveabilities literature lists different hierarchically organized
abilities, which usually include verbal abilities; quantitative
abilities; visuospatial abilities; and some combination of
perceptual speed, mechanical reasoning (which often shares
variance with visuospatial abilities), general reasoning, working
memory, and other abilities (e.g., Carroll, 1993). The abilities
needed for success in advanced and academic science are
diverse and include verbal and social abilities such as
communicating clearly, comprehending complex texts, working with</p>

    </sec>
    <sec id="3">
      <title>ABILITIES</title>
      <p>There are many different types of scientists and mathematicians—
not just the ones seen in the media accepting the highest prizes
in their disciplines. Society needs people with a broad range of
skills to advance and support the fields of science and math. On
average, do males and females differ in the skills and abilities
needed to pursue careers in these complex disciplines?
We begin to answer that question by first looking at average
differences early in development, then examining mean
differences during later stages of development and in the development
of excellence in math and science.</p>
      <p>Cognitive Sex Differences in Infancy
Psychologists often look for sex differences very early in life as
clues to the relative contribution of biological and
environmental factors. The reasoning is that newborns have had fewer
social interactions, so the earlier that sex differences are reliably
found, the more likely they may be assumed to be biological in
origin. It does not necessarily follow, however, that differences
found later in life are caused by social or environmental factors,
because there are developmental timelines for biological
processes, including the timing of puberty, the development of
the forebrain, and the aging processes, all of which are also
influenced by the environment. And the assumption about
early sex differences reflecting biological differences may be
questionable itself. Across species it is common for there to be
few sex differences early in life, even when substantial
differences emerge with reproductive maturation (Darwin, 1871). It
may seem impossible to assess cognitive abilities in newborns,
but psychologists who study cognitive development in infants
have developed a variety of techniques to infer when, in early
life, babies comprehend language, maintain a persisting mental
representation of objects (memory), show interest in people and
objects, make inferences about the paths of motion and rates
of speed of moving objects, have basic ‘‘number sense,’’ and
understand that an adult who looks at an object is likely to reach
for it (Kotovsky &amp; Baillargeon, 1998; Phillips, Wellman, &amp;
Spelke, 2002; Xu, Spelke, &amp; Goodard, 2005). The usual finding,
from many studies conducted by many researchers in different
Mean Verbal Abilities
Verbal abilities are essential for success in mathematics and
science, given the densely written technical articles to
comprehend, the need for clear communication skills, and the
general language demands found in any advanced field of
learning, even if they differ somewhat in qualitative ways from
those that might be required in the humanities. Verbal abilities
comprise different components, and the size of the sex
differences between males and females is not the same across all
of them. Based on a review of 24 large data sets (including
several large representative samples of U.S. students, working
adults, and military personnel), Willingham and Cole (1997)
concluded that differences are small in the elementary school
grades, with only writing, language use, and reading having
d &gt; .2, favoring females at fourth grade. In the United States,
by the end of high school, the largest differences, again favoring
females, are found for writing (d between .5 and .6) and language
usage (d between .4 and .5).</p>
      <p>In a report published by the U.S. Department of Education
(Bae et al., 2000), titled ‘‘Trends in Educational Equity of Girls
and Women,’’ the data on reading and writing achievement are
described this way: ‘‘Females have consistently outperformed
males in writing achievement at the 4th, 8th, and 11th grade
levels between 1988 and 1996. Differences in male and female
writing achievement were relatively large. The writing scores of
female 8th graders were comparable with those of 11th grade
males’’ (p. 18). In a meta-analytic review of the research
literature, Hedges and Nowell (1995) reported that ‘‘the large
sex differences in writing . . . are alarming. The data imply that
males are, on average, at a rather profound disadvantage in the
performance of this basic skill’’ (p. 45). Thus, the advantage for
females on tests of writing is large and robust by the middle to
end of secondary school.</p>
      <p>If an assessment of verbal abilities is heavily weighted with
writing, and language-usage items cover topics that females are
familiar with, sex differences favoring females will be much
larger than they will be in an assessment of verbal abilities
lacking these components. This is the case in the review of sex
differences in a recently published review conducted in the</p>
      <p>United Kingdom (Strand, Deary, &amp; Smith, 2006). The SAT-Verbal
(SAT-V) test has (up through 2004) contained many
verbalanalogy questions—a question type that is conceptually closer to
mapping relationships than it is to other types of verbal usage, and
one that often shows an advantage to males. Therefore, it is not
surprising that the SAT-V test, despite being labeled a ‘‘verbal’’
test, does not tap the same verbal abilities as do tests of writing or
other language areas in which females excel; nor is it surprising
that males score higher than females on the SAT-V test.</p>
      <p>The female advantage in several specific verbal abilities, such
as reading, is international. The data in Figure 1 were taken from
the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study of 2001
(Mullis, Martin, Gonzalez, &amp; Kennedy, 2003; Ogle et al., 2003).</p>
      <p>Fourth-grade females scored higher than fourth-grade males in
every participating country. The advantage for females in
reading literacy is replicated and is comparable in size for
15-year-olds in each of the 25 countries that participated in the
Program for International Student Assessment (National Center
for Education Statistics, 2002; data not shown).</p>
      <p>Similar to sex differences in verbal abilities, sex differences
in memory depend on the type of memory system examined.</p>
      <p>Most psychologists divide memory into qualitatively different
subsystems, with two broad major classifications: working (or
short-term) memory and long-term memory. Long-term memory
is further divided into multiple types, one of which is episodic
memory, or memory for events that are personally experienced
and recalled with information about time and place. Given the
female advantage on some verbal abilities, it might be expected
that they also are better able than males to describe personal
memories. In a recent review of the literature, Herlitz and
Rehnman (2007) summarized multiple studies showing that
females are better at episodic-memory tasks than males are. For
example, they describe a large population-based study of adults
(35–80 years old) in which sex differences were found on
Fig. 1. Difference in average scores between boys and girls for the combined reading literacy scale of
fourth graders, by country. (Note that girls scored significantly higher than boys in all 33 countries in
which the assessment was conducted.) Findings from the Progress in International Reading Literacy
Study of 2001 (Mullis, Martin, Gonzalez, &amp; Kennedy, 2003; Ogle et al., 2003).
episodic-memory tasks that required participants to remember
previously presented words, objects, or activities (Herlitz,
Nilsson, &amp; Ba¨ ckman, 1997). Across multiple studies,
differences between men and women on such tasks are typically small
to medium sized (e.g., Herlitz, Airaksinen, &amp; Nordstro¨ m, 1999).</p>
      <p>There is also an advantage for females in the ability to recognize
faces, and this difference is found across the age span with both
children and adults (e.g., Lewin &amp; Herlitz, 2002; Lewin,
Wolgers, &amp; Herlitz, 2001). Perhaps the most surprising finding is
that girls and women are most accurate when recognizing female
faces—their own sex bias. This ability of girls and women to
recognize female faces better than male faces and to perform better
than males on all measures of face recognition has been replicated
cross-culturally. Herlitz and Rehman attribute these results to
differential attention paid by females to female faces. These
findings provide ancillary support for the hypothesis that females
are more ‘‘people oriented’’ than males are and thus choose careers
and courses of study, such as teaching and social work, that
involve greater social interaction, instead of careers that are more
‘‘thing oriented,’’ such as physics and engineering (Lippa, 1998).</p>
      <p>Variability in Verbal Abilities
In Strand et al.’s (2006) sample of over 320,000 students aged 11
to 12 years, there was a greater percentage of females in the 5th,
6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th stanines than males on the verbal-abilities
test that they used. (Stanines are standard scores indicating
which 1/9 of a sample from a normal or bell-shaped population
contains certain scores. A score in the 1st stanine is among the
lowest 4% of all scores and a score in the 9th stanine is among
the highest 4% of all scores; the 5th stanine corresponds to
the middle portion of scores and comprises 20% of all scores.)
The female mean was higher than the male mean, which explains
the finding that there were more females in the upper tail. Thus,
differences in mean scores between females and males and/or
differences in variability will result in disproportionately more
females or males in the upper tail of a distribution, with the
advantage going to the group with the higher mean, greater
variability, or both. The 2006 SAT data for college-bound
seniors on the writing test show a similar pattern. The female
mean was higher than the male mean (502 vs. 491) for the writing
test, with 58.7% of the top 1% of all test takers being female.</p>
      <p>The 2006 SAT data for college-bound seniors in the (new) test of
Critical Reading show a different pattern. The male mean is
slightly higher than the female mean (505 vs. 502), but 53.04%
of test takers in the top 1% are female, which runs counter to the
usual conclusion that males are more variable in all
cognitiveability domains. The males in Strand et al.’s sample were more
variable on the quantitative and nonverbal reasoning ability
tests, and the SAT data for college-bound seniors for the math
test showed that males are more variable in math, suggesting
that the male-variability hypothesis—or a higher proportion
of males in the upper tail—extends across multiple measures of
quantitative abilities but not to all cognitive-ability tests.
Visuospatial Abilities
A large body of research conducted over the last 25 years
has revealed substantial sex differences for some, but not all,
of the measures that reflect visuospatial information
processing. These differences begin to emerge around the time
children enter kindergarten or begin first grade, which may be
as early as children can reliably perform tasks that assess
visuospatial abilities. The preschool literature on sex
differences in spatial skills was reviewed by Levine, Huttenlocher,
Taylor, and Langrock (1999). They found that, on average,
preschool boys are more accurate than girls at spatial tasks
that measure accuracy of spatial transformations (d 5 .31)
and score higher on the Mazes subtest of the Wechsler Preschool
and Primary Scale of Intelligence (d 5 .30). They concluded that
sex differences in favor of boys are present on spatial tasks by
age 4 1.</p>
      <p>2</p>
      <p>There is a large research literature on visuospatial tasks
with young adults (i.e., college students). Effect sizes vary
considerably with the type of task, ranging from small and fragile
(i.e., not worth talking about, although still favoring males when
an effect size is found; e.g., Voyer, Voyer, &amp; Bryden, 1995) for a
commonly used task that involves imagining what a folded paper
would look like if it had a hole punched in it and then was
unfolded—a fairly simple task—to larger and more robust
effects. Results using tasks that require generating an image and
maintaining it in memory while ‘‘working’’ on it (i.e., mentally
folding and unfolding it) vary depending on the complexity of the
image to be generated and the specific nature of the task, with
observed differences that range between d 5 .63 and d 5 .77
(Loring-Meier &amp; Halpern, 1999). Mental rotation tasks that
require maintaining a three-dimensional figure in working
memory while simultaneously transforming it show very
large sex differences, somewhere between .9 to 1.0 standard
deviations (Masters &amp; Sanders, 1993; Nordvik &amp; Amponsah,
1998), although some researchers have reported smaller effect
sizes (Voyer et al., 1995).</p>
      <p>The largest differences are probably found with spatiotemporal
tasks (judgments about moving objects), but there are not
enough studies with spatiotemporal tasks to allow a reliable
estimate of the effect size (Law, Pelligrino, &amp; Hunt, 1993).</p>
      <p>For example, studies that used ‘‘time to collision’’ estimates that
also involve spatiotemporal abilities found that males made
more accurate estimates (McLeod, &amp; Ross, 1983). Similar
results were found with a Chinese sample that made
time-tocollision estimates under varying conditions. The authors
concluded that males were better than females in judgment
accuracy with this task (Liu, &amp; Huang, 1999). Thus, although
the number of studies that examined spatiotemporal abilities
is small, results consistently point to a male advantage. An
example of a mental rotation task is shown in Figure 2. The task
for the participant is to determine if the two figures labeled A and
the two figures labeled B could be made identical by rotating
them in space.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2. An example of a mental rotation task. The task is to determine if the two figures labeled A and the two
figures labeled B could be made identical by rotating them in space. These are called mental rotation tasks
because the rotation must be done in working memory.</p>

    <sec id="4">
      <title>Visuospatial Skills and Computer Games</title>
      <p>With the meteoric rise of online games, there has been a great
deal of interest in navigating through virtual space. The
popularity of online learning has led to the creation of a large
number of online simulations of real-world events in which
learners can ‘‘practice’’ a wide variety of tasks, such as surgery
or navigating through unknown territory in preparation for
military excursions (Macedonia, 2002; Wrobel, 2005). The 3-D
virtual environment literature consistently shows that males
outperform females (e.g., Cutmore, Hine, Maberly, Langford,
&amp; Grant, 2000), although some accommodations, such as
very large displays, can reduce or eliminate this effect (Tan,
Czerwinsk, &amp; Robertson, 2006).</p>
      <p>The results with virtual environments parallel those that are
often found in real-world way-finding tasks. An important
variable in such tasks involves the use of maps. In one study,
participants were given a map that they were to use to give
directions to a stranger (L.N. Brown, Lahar, &amp; Mosley, 1998).</p>
      <p>Males were generally more accurate than females in the
directions that they gave, and males were also more likely to use
compass headings (North, South, East, West) when giving
directions; females used landmarks more often when giving
directions. This study, like many others, suggests that when
women learn a route, either from a map or from direct
experience, they tend to rely on landmarks to find their way, whereas
men are more likely to attend to and keep track of the compass
direction in which they are traveling (Lawton, 1994). Similarly,
when adults learned a route from a map, the men made fewer
errors in getting to a destination, but the women had better recall
for landmarks along the way (Galea &amp; Kimura, 1993).</p>
      <p>Visuospatial Abilities and Mathematics
It has been suggested that certain visuospatial sex differences
contribute to observed sex differences in some aspects
of mathematical performance. For example, Casey, Nuttall,
Pezaris, and Benbow (1995) found that the sex difference on
the Mathematics portion of the SAT (SAT-M) was eliminated in
several samples when the effects of mental rotation ability were
statistically removed. This suggests that rotational skill may
mediate the sex differences in certain high-level mathematical
abilities or, at the least, that these two abilities tend to covary.
Linkage of mathematical and visuospatial skill has important
consequences, because high levels of both of these skills are
required for careers in fields such as physics and engineering
in which women are typically underrepresented. However, the
precise relation between these variables is complex, varying
with the specific visuospatial and mathematical measures
considered (Tartre, 1990). In addition, these two variables
appear to be more strongly linked in females than males,
suggesting that females may be particularly hampered in
mathematical domains if they have reduced visuospatial skill.</p>
      <p>Quantitative Abilities
Of all of the sex differences in cognitive abilities, differences in
quantitative abilities have received the most media attention
because of the large sex differences at the highest end of the
distribution among those who take the SAT-M test and other
high-stakes mathematics tests. Differences depend on the
portion of the distribution that is examined, and because males
are more variable in quantitative and visuospatial abilities there
are more males at both high- and low-ability ends (a
phenomenon we explore more fully in a later section). The reasons why
males show more variability are not known, but given the higher
variability, even small mean differences between females and
males will result in a disproportionately large number of males
in both the high- and low-ability ends of the distribution. There
is no large-scale examination that assesses writing in a
comparable way to the SAT-M. If there were, we expect it would
show the female advantage in verbal abilities in secondary
school and throughout adulthood because females have higher
mean scores on tests of writing.</p>
      <p>Researchers have identified mathematically precocious
preschoolers (scoring one to two standard deviations above the
norm) and have concluded that males are overrepresented in this
precocious group even at this young age (Robinson, Abbott,
Berninger, &amp; Busse, 1996). Sex differences in quantitative
abilities do not follow a predictable developmental schedule, in
that they vary by the type of quantitative task examined. In fact,
on average, females get higher grades in school in math classes
at all grade levels (Kimball, 1989; Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997)
and do slightly better on international assessments in algebra
(National Center for Education Statistics, 2005), possibly
because of algebra’s language-like structure, but tend to score
lower on quantitative tests when the content is not directly
related to what is taught in their own curriculum (reviewed in
Geary, 1996; Halpern, 2000). The differences between boys and
girls in mathematical abilities in elementary school tend to be
small and to favor girls. Abilities are assessed in elementary
school mostly with school grades, which reflect other factors,
including behavior and turning in assignments on time. Girls
are slightly better at computational tasks in 4th grade and
remain at the same advantage relative to males through 12th
grade (d between .1 and .2; Willingham &amp; Cole, 1997; but see
Royer, Tronsky, Can, Jackson, &amp; Marchant, 1999). Thus, we see
advantages for females in the early primary-school years, when
mathematics consists of computational knowledge and speed;
little or no sex difference through the rest of the primary-school
years; and then a male advantage when the mathematical
concepts require more reasoning and are more spatial in nature,
in the context of solving problems in geometry and calculus,
subjects typically taught in the higher secondary-school grades
(Geary, 1996; Hyde, Fennema, &amp; Lamon, 1990).</p>
      <p>The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is
regularly given to a representative sample of U.S. students and
differs from the international assessments and the SAT-M test
in that it is more closely aligned with curriculum. There is
essentially no difference between males and females on the
mathematics test of the NAEP (Coley, 2001). In fact, when the
international assessments from the Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS; standardized across
33 countries) are compared for the final year of secondary school
for math, science, and reading literacy, the female advantage in
reading and the male advantage in science are considerably
larger and more reliable than the male advantage found in
mathematics. In order to achieve in science, learners need
good mathematical abilities, but they also need verbal and
visuospatial abilities, so science achievement cannot be
explained by math scores alone. This conclusion is in accord
with Hedges and Nowell’s (1995) meta-analytic review, in which
they concluded that ‘‘average sex differences in most measured
abilities are small, with the possible exception of science,
writing, and stereotypical vocational aptitudes’’ (p. 45). It seems
that for the large-scale quantitative assessments they reviewed,
sex differences were smaller in mathematical abilities than they
were in these other areas, although the authors did not compare
specific types of mathematical skills in their review.</p>
      <p>Trends Over Time in Average Abilities
The question of whether sex differences have been decreasing over
time depends on which data are examined. In a meta-analysis,
Hyde, Fennema, and Lamon (1990) concluded that sex
differences in some mathematical skills were decreasing. But
different sorts of data give different answers, probably because
mathematics is not a unitary domain and neither are the
competencies assessed across studies. Hedges and Nowell
(1995), in their meta-analysis, conclude that ‘‘differences do not
appear to be decreasing ... across the 32 year period’’ (p. 45).</p>
      <p>Despite all of the interest focused on the superior-ability tail
of the SAT-M test as it relates to scientists, it is instructive to
consider average male–female performance on this test over
time, as shown in Figure 3. The average difference between
males and females on the SAT-M test has remained unchanged
for over 35 years, despite the large increase in the number of
females entering fields that require mathematics. Logically, as
more girls take advanced coursework in mathematics, their
mean score on the SAT-M would be expected to increase, but this
has not happened. Another possibility is that the large increase
in the number of females taking the SAT-M test has been
lowering the average scores (i.e., because an overall less select
group of females is taking the test).</p>
      <p>Racial and Ethnic Differences in Average Abilities
In thinking about sex differences in math and science abilities,
one important question is the extent to which various races,
ethnic groups, and peoples around the world show the same
patterns of results. To answer this question, racial and ethnic
groups were compared in terms of education and work in the
United States (Coley, 2001). Large racial and ethnic group
differences appear overall, and the size of the differences
between females and males within each racial and ethnic group
differs somewhat. Sex-typed cognitive patterns do not vary much
among racial and ethnic groups, with a few exceptions. For
example, Blacks are the only group in which females score
higher than males on the verbal section of the Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT-V), but the few-point difference on this test
is too small to be meaningful (Coley, 2001). Prior to 2005, the
SAT-V contained a large proportion of verbal analogies, and it
did not have a writing component; therefore, despite being
labeled a ‘‘verbal’’ test, it did not contain the components of
verbal language in which females excel. Results from the NAEP
showed that females scored higher, on average, in all racial or
ethnic groups and across all ages, in reading, writing, and civics.</p>
      <p>The graduate admissions tests (the GRE and the Graduate
Management Admission Test, GMAT, which is used for
admissions to business schools) show that males score higher
across all racial/ethnic groups, with the largest differences in
quantitative areas. But White, Black, and Hispanic females
are more likely than their male counterparts to graduate from
college, an advantage that does not translate into higher
earnings. The relationship between education and career
success (when assessed with earnings) is moderated by sex and
race in many job categories. The moderating variables may
explain a portion of the sex differences in career success in math
and science fields as well.

      <p>Sex differences in cognitive abilities and career achievement
are complicated, but the fact that there are some tests and some
areas of mathematics and science in which females, across all
racial and ethnic groups, tend to excel, and some in which
males, across all racial and ethnic groups, tend to excel, makes
it difficult for any single theory such as motivation, learning,
biology, or test-related anxiety to explain the difference.</p>
      <p>The consistency of the sex-related cognitive pattern of results
is consistent with predictions based on an evolutionary
perspective (Geary, 1998), but as we note later, there are many
researchers who raise objections to evolutionary explanations
for science and math data.</p>
      <p>A Cognitive-Process Taxonomy of Average Abilities
Halpern (2000, 2004) offered a solution to the mismatch in
outcomes for males and females of school grades—outcomes
that are based, at least in part, on tests that reflect school
curricula, as well as on scores on standardized tests that are
comprised of questions that are novel or unrelated to the school
curriculum. By considering the underlying cognitive processes
used in solving different sorts of math problems, Halpern
proposed a taxonomy in which math problems that were spatial
in nature would be advantageous to males and those that did
not require visuospatial abilities would show either no sex
differences or an advantage to females. In a series of studies,
Gallagher and her colleagues (Gallagher &amp; DeLisi, 1994;
Gallagher, Levin, &amp; Cahalan, 2002) examined cognitive
patterns of sex differences on GRE math problems. They found
the usual sex differences favoring males when there was an
advantage to solving problems with a spatially based solution
strategy, but not when solution strategies were more verbal
in nature or were similar to the ones presented in popular
mathematics textbooks. They also found that there were no sex
differences for GRE math problems when solutions required
multiple algorithmic steps (i.e., differences were not due to the
ability to hold information in working memory), but the usual
male advantage was found with math problems that had multiple
possible solution paths. Thus, some portion of the performance
differences between males and females on GRE math problems
lies in the recognition and/or selection of a solution strategy
that may be novel. Gallagher et al. found that the usual male
advantage on standardized mathematics tests can be minimized,
equated for women and men, or maximized by altering the way
problems are presented and emphasizing the particular types of
cognitive processes that lead to the optimal solution. What is
unknown is how these manipulations of test items affect the
validity of the GRE in predicting grades in graduate school or
success after graduation.</p>
      <p>Gallagher’s research on verbal and visuospatial
representation of quantitative problems on the GRE is an exciting advance
because it allows researchers to identify the locus of the sex
difference and also shows that identical mathematical content
can be presented in ways that are advantageous to males or
females. In reviewing each problem on the quantitative portion
of the GRE, she found that some problems had an optimal
solution strategy; for other problems, different strategies were
equally fast in yielding the correct answer. Research has shown
that visuospatial training leads to improvement in a variety of
tasks (Newcombe, 2002), so we can expect that training with
multiple problem representations may have the same effects
(Johnson, 1984). Recent meta-analyses have shown that
children and adults can improve their visuospatial skills with
training (Maruli, Liu, Warren, Uttal, &amp; Newcombe, 2007). The
overall mean effect size (mean of 13 effect sizes) is d 5 .52. The
researchers explained that the effect size for visuospatial-skills
training was moderated because control groups that did not
receive the training also showed improvement. Recall that
research by Casey et al. (1995) found that sex differences on the
SAT-M could be eliminated when the effect of mental-rotation
ability was removed. One possible educational intervention for
females and males would be to teach them multiple ways to solve
problems using both verbal and visuospatial solution strategies,
thereby allowing for more flexibility in overall problem solving.</p>
      <p>In the most comprehensive test of the hypothesis that women can
learn to enhance their visuospatial skills and thereby enjoy
greater success in STEM fields, Sorby and Baartmans (2000)
created a special course designed to enhance three-dimensional
spatial skills. The skills that were targeted for instruction were
those that are needed by students in engineering, architecture,
and other fields in which success frequently depends on the use
of visuospatial abilities. All students with low scores on a test
of visuospatial ability were encouraged to enroll in a course to
improve these skills. This course has been offered for many
years for both women and men at Michigan Technological
University. As Sorby and Baartmans explain, there are many
theories to explicate the finding that men tend to have more
highly developed spatial skills than women. One promising
theory suggests that sketching three-dimensional objects is a
significant factor (but not the only factor) in the development of
these skills. Sorby and Baartmans designed and implemented a
course to improve the spatial visualization skills of first-year
engineering students. They measured improvement in spatial
skills with standardized testing instruments in each of the
7 years of the project so far. The gains made by students on these
spatial-skills tests as a result of participation in their course
were statistically and materially significant. Both men and
women who initially scored low on visuospatial tests benefitted
from the instruction. This improvement in spatial skills resulted
in improved performance in subsequent graphics courses, as
measured by final grades in the courses, and better retention in
engineering programs, which suggests that the effects lasted
over time and were of practical significance.</p>
      <p>SEX DIFFERENCES IN MATH AND SCIENCE ABILITIES</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="5">
      <title>IN THE TAILS OF THE DISTRIBUTION</title>
      <p>Studying sex differences in mathematical and scientific abilities
by examining differences at the population mean is useful but
can lead to misleading conclusions if the distribution of test
scores is not similar for males and females (Feingold, 1995).
This is particularly the case when the focus is on populations
characterized by high abilities and the potential to become
future mathematics or science professionals (Wise, Steel,
&amp; MacDonald, 1979). Differences in population variance,
as well as potential skew in these distributions, could lead to
overrepresentation of one sex over the other at the extremes.</p>
      <p>Sex Differences in Distributions and Variances
Feingold (1992) and Hedges and Friedman (1993) examined the
results from available test-norming studies to assess the possible
effects of sex differences in both mean test scores and variances.</p>
      <p>There were differences in variances (males were more variable),
and, when combined with mean differences, these two effects
produced more males at the high end of the distribution.</p>
      <p>Drawing from data on abilities that were measured in six
national surveys over a 32-year interval, Hedges and Nowell
(1995) found that, in addition to the (small) mean differences in
mathematical and science abilities favoring males (science:
d 5 .32; math: d 5 .16), the test scores of males were more
variable than were those of females, with variance ratios
differing between 3% and 20% (Hedges &amp; Nowell, 1995), with
little change over the 32-year interval sampled. Similarly,
Strand et al. (2006) found many more males than females in the
top stanines in mathematics and nonverbal reasoning (also see
Deary, Thorpe, Wilson, Starr, &amp; Whalley, 2003, fig. 1, p. 537). In
the 9th stanine (top 4% of all scores) of the quantitative test,
60% were males; in the 9th stanine of the nonverbal reasoning
test, 54% were males. Similar results were reported by Stanley,
Benbow, Brody, Dauber, and Lupkowski (1992) in their study of
86 nationally standardized achievement and aptitude tests
(obtained from 1982 to 1987) and by Feingold (1995) with the
Differential Aptitude Test. Thus, differences in mathematical
and science abilities that are large enough to be of practical
importance are found at the high end of the ability distribution
(Humphreys, 1988; Hyde et al., 1990).</p>
      <p>Data from the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth
(SMPY) exemplifies this phenomenon. In their first article on the
topic, Benbow and Stanley (1980) observed sex differences in
mathematical reasoning ability among 9,927 intellectually
talented 12- to 14-year-olds who had taken the SAT several years
before the typical age. The sex difference on the SAT-M, which
is a test of mathematical reasoning ability especially when
administered to the precocious in the seventh and eighth grades,
favored the males and averaged d 5 .40. There were essentially
no differences on the SAT-V. Table 1, which is from another
SMPY sample of precocious youth, illustrates these sex
differences with four different samples.</p>
      <p>In a follow-up to the first study, Benbow and Stanley (1983)
reported SAT data on another 40,000 young, intellectually
talented adolescents, and the findings in the first studies were
reaffirmed. No differences of any significance were found on the
SAT-V, but the SAT-M revealed sex differences favoring males.</p>

      <p>Sex Differences in Mathematical Reasoning in
have persisted and are also observed on the ACT-Math (Benbow
Mills, Ablard, and Strumpf (1993) documented sex differences
&amp; Stanley, 1996; Stanley, 1994). For reasons that are not well
among intellectually gifted students in mathematical reasoning
understood, current ratios of males to females at the high end are
as early as second grade (average d 5 .43). Robinson et al.
(1996) reported sex differences in mathematical precocity
before kindergarten (average d 5 .37). More significantly, these
latter sex differences were maintained following exposure to
mathematical enrichment opportunities aimed at both males and
females. Males gained more than females did on quantitative
and visuospatial measures after an average of 28 biweekly
intervention sessions (Robinson, Abbott, Berninger, Busse, &amp;
Mukhopadhyah, 1997).</p>
      <p>The implications of these differences, and especially of
the disparate ratios at the top for the math-science education
pipeline, are clear: Given an early advantage in these
fundamental quantitative skills, a greater number of males
than females will qualify for advanced training in disciplines
that place a premium on mathematical reasoning. As Hedges
and Nowell (1995) stated, ‘‘Sex differences in variance
and mean lead to substantially fewer females than males
who score in the upper tails of the mathematics and science
distributions and hence are poised to succeed in the sciences.</p>
      <p>The achievement of fair representation of women in science
will be much more difficult if there are only one-half to
oneseventh as many women as men who excel in the relevant
abilities’’ (p. 45).</p>
      <p>Other cognitive and noncognitive sex differences expand our
understanding of the factors that influence the way precocious
youth develop in math. Table 1 contains data on abilities and
values of gifted students in the Midwest who were identified by
SMPY from 1988 to 1991 and who attended a special summer
program (Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 1992). Again, sex differences in
mathematical reasoning ability were consistently observed
(average d 5 .84), but sex differences in the SAT-V were not
observed. Table 1 includes other cognitive measures of general
intelligence and specific abilities. No meaningful differences
were observed among scores on the Advanced Raven
Progressive Matrices (Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 1992), which is a
nonverbal measure of general intelligence. There were, however,
substantial differences in spatial and mechanical reasoning
abilities (average d 5 .92). In addition to these differences in
specific abilities, there were also sex differences in vocational
interests and values. Table 1 presents the differences in values.</p>
      <p>As can be seen, males are higher on theoretical values, and
females are higher on social values, among other trends.</p>
      <p>Strongly held theoretical values are characteristic of physical
scientists, while social values are negatively correlated with
interests in the physical sciences (Achter, Lubinski, Benbow,
&amp; Eftekhari-Sanjani, 1999). Similar preference distinctions
between males and females have been found using the Strong
Interest Inventory (Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2006), with the SMPY
males having stronger investigative and realistic interests
and the SMPY females having stronger social interests
(Achter, Lubinski, &amp; Benbow, 1996, Appendix B, p. 76). Thus, it
appears that early differences in mathematical skills may occur
along with other factors relevant to the development of scientific
expertise.
Sex Differences in Higher Education
Male–female differences are increasingly apparent as one
moves up the educational-vocational continuum (Lane, 1999;
Lawler, 1999, 2002; Mervis, 1999a, 1999b, 2000; Sax, 2001;
Seymour &amp; Hewitt, 1997; Wickware, 1997), with the disparity
actually increasing dramatically at the highest levels (National
Research Council, 2001). For example, in the late 1990s there
was a 1.5:1.0 male:female ratio among undergraduates in science
at MIT, but a more than 11.4:1.0 male:female ratio among faculty
(Committee on Women Faculty, 1999). More current data,
displayed in Table 2, yield the same pattern of increasing
discrepancy at higher levels of achievement (Gottfredson, 1997).</p>
      <p>As previously discussed, women now surpass men in the rate
at which bachelor’s and master’s degrees in all areas are earned.</p>
      <p>The advances of women in terms of degrees earned, however,
have not been even across disciplines. We still find fewer women
than men in the physical sciences. Yet it is difficult to conclude
that this is due to an aversion toward science among women. In
1996, women earned one third or more of the bachelor’s degrees
in astronomy, earth sciences, and oceanography, over 40% of the
bachelor’s degrees in chemistry, mathematics, and statistics,
over 50% of those in biology, and 73% of those in psychology
(Browne, 2002). By 2004, women earned over 42% of the
mathematics undergraduate degrees, up from 37% in 1994
(American Mathematical Society, 2004; National Science
Foundation, 2006, p. 1), and over 40% of the degrees in the
physical sciences (up from 14% in 1966) and in the earth,
atmospheric, and oceanic sciences (up from 9% in 1966;
National Science Foundation, 2002a). Nonetheless, as Table 3
illustrates, women are earning more college degrees and master’s
degrees than men are, and they are earning close to half of
all doctorate and professional degrees. However, as shown in
Table 4, percentages vary by discipline, with more doctorates
in education and the social sciences going to women; women
are about par with men in the life sciences, but they are
underrepresented in the physical sciences and engineering
(National Science Foundation, 2002a; Nelson &amp; Rogers, 2004;
Valian, 1998, 2005).</p>
      <p>Data from 1995 (reported in Browne, 2002), however, give
a more nuanced look at this trend and reveal that there are
substantial differences among subdisciplines in addition to the
differences among disciplines. In engineering, for example,
women are scarce in mining/mineral and mechanical
engineering (0% and 6%, respectively) but not in environmental
health and bioengineering (25%). Among physics doctorates,
17% of acoustics but only 4% of particle physics degrees are
earned by women. In biology, 22% of the entomology degrees
went to women, in comparison to 68% of those in the nutritional
sciences. And, in psychology, where 64% of the doctoral degrees
went to women in 1995, physiological psychology attracted
38% women, in contrast to developmental psychology, which
attracted 80% women. Finally, in the social sciences as a whole,
fewer women chose statistics and economics (23% and 24%,
respectively) than chose anthropology and sociology (58% and
53%; Browne, 2002).</p>
      <p>It is tempting to ask whether these differences in higher
education emanate from sex differences in abilities, but the
combination of native ability, socioeconomic context, personal
interests, and cultural influence is remarkably complex. For
example, while women do not complete their doctorates in
natural sciences and engineering at the same rates as men, the
difference disappears when mathematical ability is adjusted for
(J.C. Baker, 1998). Moreover, while sex differences in
mathematical ability are associated with sex differences in occupational
status and income (Paglin &amp; Rufolo, 1990), sex differences in
interests—such as a preference for working with people—are
also important in explaining educational and career choice.</p>
      <p>Sex Differences in Career Development Choices
Xie and Shauman (2003) noted that the best understanding of
the engagement of males and females in science is likely to
emerge from studies that take a life-course perspective. The
SMPY has collected longitudinal information on a large number
of high-ability males and females to investigate their career
Year Education Social sci. Life sci. Physical sci. Engineering
development (Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2006). (The very oldest
individuals in the study were born in 1959 and the youngest in
the early 1980s.) Over 4,000 intellectually talented individuals,
identified according to their performance on the SAT during
seventh or eighth grade, have been tracked for over three
decades in four separate cohorts (along with a comparison group
of 714 nonprecocious individuals). There is no comparable
study of its kind. Students were invited to take the SAT in the
seventh or eighth grade if they had scored in the top percentiles
on a standardized achievement test administered by their
school. The first cohort comprised seventh and eighth graders
from the Greater Baltimore Area who were identified in the early
1970s as representing the top 1% in mathematical ability. The
second cohort included seventh graders from the Mid-Atlantic
region who scored in the top .5% in mathematical ability, verbal
ability, or both. The third cohort included seventh and eighth
graders from across the nation who were identified in the early
1980s as being in the top .01% in mathematical ability, verbal
ability, or both. The fourth cohort, drawn from the Midwest in the
late 1980s and early to mid 1990s, comprised two groups: One
represented the top .5% in mathematic ability, verbal ability, or
both, and the other represented individuals who scored at least
at the 97th percentile on any subtest of an achievement test
administered by their schools.</p>
      <p>Participants completed comprehensive surveys and inventories
providing a detailed view of their development and educational/
career trajectories. The last survey of this group occurred when
participants were in their mid 30s, with earlier data collection
points occurring at ages 13, 18, and 23. Because it is likely
that not all future talent for mathematics and science can be
identified using the SAT at age 13, the SMPY decided to form a
fifth cohort to determine the generalizability of its findings.</p>
      <p>Cohort five comprised 714 individuals, educated in the United
States, who were enrolled in the top 15 U.S. graduate programs
in mathematics and science. Because an equal sample of men
and women was needed in departments where the male:female
ratios often exceeded 3:1, the women were oversampled
(i.e., more women were included in the sample than their
proportional enrollment in graduate programs). This cohort was
studied retrospectively, concurrently, and prospectively (age 33
and beyond; Lubinski, Benbow, Shea, Eftekhari-Sanjani, &amp;
Halvorson 2001; Lubinski, Benbow, Webb, &amp; Bleske-Rechek,
2006).</p>
      <p>As in other studies, no statistically significant sex differences
in overall general intelligence were found for the SMPY
samples, but differences were found in certain specific abilities.</p>
      <p>Individuals who were assessed by age 13 as being in the top 1%
in mathematical reasoning ability (cohorts 1 and 2) became
highly educated: Over 90% earned a bachelor’s degree, and over
25% earned a doctorate, with essentially no sex differences in
degrees earned (Benbow, Lubinski, Shea, &amp; Eftekhari-Sanjani,
2000). About 50% earned at least one postsecondary degree
in math and science areas, with 64% of the top .5% in

Eftekhari-Sanjani (2000).
mathematical ability securing at least one postsecondary math
or science degree (Benbow et al., 2000). The men were at least
twice as likely to earn degrees in the inorganic sciences and
engineering as the women, with the men earning almost five
times as many doctorates in these areas as the women. As shown
in Figure 4, more women than men earned doctoral degrees
in the life sciences and medicine (Benbow et al., 2000).</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, the subsequent career choices of these
mathematically talented individuals mirror the pattern seen for
degree specialization.</p>
      <p>In a subsequent study to Benbow et al. (2000), mathematically
talented individuals in cohorts 1 and 2 who had planned on
majoring in mathematical or scientific areas when they entered
college were studied in more depth at approximately age 33,
to better understand the factors that differentiated those who
remained in mathematics or science and earned such degrees
from those who opted to pursue undergraduate degrees in other
areas (Webb et al., 2002). More males had declared an intention
to pursue a mathematics or science degree than females, as
shown in Tables 5 and 6, and there was greater attrition from the
mathematical or scientific disciplines by females than there was
by males (26% vs. 17%). High-school educational experiences,
abilities, and interests predicted whether an undergraduate
degree was attained in mathematics or science or the individual
left to pursue other areas of study. The ones persisting with
mathematics or science degrees had higher SAT-M scores and
more high-school course work in mathematics and science, and
they more often reported a mathematics or science course as
their favorite course. They also had congruent occupational
interests as measured by the Study of Values and Holland
Occupational codes. Once these variables had been entered into
the discriminant function analysis (a statistical procedure for
determining which variables are important in differentiating two
or more groups), sex added essentially no explanatory power. (By
itself, sex yielded a squared multiple correlation—a measure of
the amount of variance that can be explained by or attributed to a
variable—of only .01, independent of the other variables.) These
results underscore the complex set of explanatory variables
needed to predict career success in mathematics and science. In
other words, among highly gifted individuals, those who pursued
careers in science and mathematics also took more related
coursework in high school, rated math and science courses as
their favorites, and were interested in math and science. More of
the highly gifted males than the females had these patterns of
experiences and attitudes that were predictive of career choices
in science and mathematics.</p>
      <p>To pursue further the role of mathematical reasoning ability in
math and science achievement, individuals in cohort 1 who
by age 13 had scored in the top quartile of the top 1% were
compared with those in the bottom quartile of the top 1%
(Benbow, 1992; Wai, Lubinski, &amp; Benbow, 2005). On 37
math/science achievement variables assessed at age 23 (these
variables went well beyond grades), statistically and
substantively significant effect sizes were observed favoring the top
versus the bottom quartile on 34 of the variables (Benbow,
1992). (Effect sizes averaged d 5 .97 for continuous variables
and d 5 .57 for categorical variables from the high-school years,
d 5 .47 for the continuous variables and d 5 .39 for the
categorical variables from the college years, and d 5 .41 from
the early stages of graduate school.) Although sex differences
were found in these analyses, they were smaller than the
differences between the top and bottom quartiles, and they were
not observed in the relation between mathematical ability and
academic achievement.</p>
      <p>At age 33, the same pattern emerged for the highly gifted
individuals in Cohort 1 when the following variables were
studied: secured doctorates, math/science PhDs, income,
patents, and tenure-track positions at top U.S. universities (Wai
et al., 2005). These results provide evidence against the
‘‘threshold’’ hypothesis, which maintains that there is some
(high) level of ability needed for career success in cognitively
demanding occupations and that scoring beyond that level will
not increase the probability of success in those fields. What is
missing from predictions based on the threshold hypothesis is
an understanding that there is a great deal of variability in the
extreme tails of ability distributions, such that the top quarter of
the top 1% could be very far from the bottom quarter of the top
1% (with actual distances depending on the specific
distribuNote. From Webb, Lubinski, and Benbow (2005).
tion). This idea can be visualized by imagining a bell-shaped
curve with the tails never quite touching the horizontal axis. The
results of this study contrast with a conclusion drawn by the
authors of a letter published in Science (Muller et al., 2005),
who claimed: ‘‘[T]here is little evidence that those scoring at the
top of the range in standardized tests are likely to have more
successful careers in the sciences. Too many other factors are
involved’’ (p. 1043). Yet ability is not everything. A congruent
preference pattern is also a good predictor of the discipline in
which one is likely to earn a four-year degree (Achter et al.,
1999) and one’s occupational setting at age 33 (Wai et al., 2005).</p>
      <p>Preference patterns add incremental (additional) validity
beyond abilities, and the effect holds for both males and females.</p>
      <p>Visuospatial Ability and Mathematics and Science Careers
All of the above studies speak to the power of mathematical
reasoning ability in predicting subsequent math/science
achievement. Yet prediction can be improved if one considers
visuospatial ability and the relative strength of mathematical
ability compared to verbal ability within a given individual, both
of which display sex differences. Individual differences in
the relative strength of verbal, mathematical, and quantitative
abilities that are identified at an early age can predict
differences in developmental trajectories and occupational pursuits
(Achter et al., 1999; Lubinski, Webb, Morelock, &amp; Benbow,
2001). We discuss both sets of findings next.</p>
      <p>Proficiency in visuospatial ability has long been associated
with success in cognitively demanding educational tracks and
occupations such as engineering, architecture, physics,
chemistry, and surgery (Smith, 1964; Snow &amp; Yalow, 1982; Sorby, &amp;
Baartmans, 2000) and is a salient characteristic of physical
scientists (Gohm, Humphreys, &amp; Yao, 1998; Humphreys,
Lubinski, &amp; Yao, 1993). Yet, visuospatial ability is not routinely
taught or assessed by schools and thus is not often developed
and assessed in ways that influence students’ educational and
career plans.
Note. From Webb, Lubinski, &amp; Benbow (2005).</p>
      <p>Using a sample of 393 precocious males and 170 precocious
females, Shea, Lubinski, and Benbow (2001) employed
multivariate statistical methods (i.e., methods that use multiple
dependent measures), using age-13 SAT-M, SAT-V, and
visuospatial-ability scores for top-.5%-ability individuals, to
predict a series of developmentally sequenced educational/
vocational outcomes: (a) favorite and least favorite high-school
course, (b) field of undergraduate degree, (c) field of graduate
degree, and (d) occupation at age 33. Visuospatial ability added
incremental validity to SAT-M and SAT-V assessments in
predicting educational/vocational outcomes over 20 years, an
effect shown in Figure 5. Perusal of Figure 5 will show, for
example, that students who reported that their favorite
highschool subjects were in the humanities or social sciences tended
to be above the mean on the SAT-V (above the horizontal axis),
below the mean on the SAT-M (to the left of the vertical axis), and
below the mean on spatial ability (indicated with an arrow facing
left). The other three graphs in Figure 5, which show the profile
for their least-favorite high-school courses, college majors, and
occupations, can be read in the same way. It is not surprising,
given these findings, that Humphreys et al.’s (1993) 13-year
longitudinal study of 400,000 high-school students, assessed on
Fig. 5. Favorite and least-favorite high-school courses at age 18 (panels A and B), college majors at age 23 (panel C), and occupations at age 33

sample of precocious males and females. These 4 figures depict the simultaneous effects of math, verbal, and spatial scores, using 3-dimensional
space. Panel A, for example, shows that students who reported that their favorite high-school subjects were in the humanities or social sciences
tended to be above the mean on the SAT-V (above the horizontal axis), below the mean on the SAT-M (to the left of the vertical axis), and below the
mean on spatial ability (indicated with an arrow facing left). The other three panels can be read in the same way. Reprinted from ‘‘Importance

mathematical, visuospatial, and verbal abilities, concluded that
mathematics and science disciplines appear to be losing many
talented individuals because selection for these educational
tracks is limited to mathematical and verbal abilities.</p>
      <p>Intellectually talented adolescents with stronger visuospatial
ability relative to verbal ability (determined intraindividually)
were more likely to be found in engineering, computer science,
and mathematical fields, whereas those with the inverse ability
pattern tended to gravitate toward humanities, social science,
organic science, medical arts such as nursing, and legal fields
(Shea et al., 2001). A similar pattern also emerged for relative
intraindividual strengths in quantitative versus verbal abilities,
with visuospatial ability exhibiting somewhat greater overall
discriminative power. That is, students who are relatively more
verbally than quantitatively or spatially talented gravitate
toward the humanities and social sciences, whereas those with
the opposite ability pattern lean more toward engineering and
the physical sciences. Webb, Lubinski, and Benbow (in press)
obtained similar results with an independent sample of 1,060
high-ability adolescents tracked for 5 years. These findings held
for both males and females.</p>
      <p>In a more definitive study, Lubinski, Webb, et al. (2001) found
that among profoundly gifted individuals (top 1 in 10,000 in
ability and who are disproportionately male), those whose ability
strength was mathematical compared to verbal but nonetheless
had very high verbal ability reported mathematics and science
courses as their favorites in high school and college, and
disproportionately pursued educational credentials in
mathematics and science, reporting three times as many awards and
special accomplishments in science and technology as
compared to the humanities and arts. Those with the inverse ability
pattern (i.e., V &gt; M) reported the humanities to be their favorite
courses in high school and in college, disproportionately
pursued educational credentials in the humanities and law, and
reported twice as many awards and special accomplishments in
the humanities and arts compared to sciences and technology.</p>
      <p>Those with relatively flat profiles fell somewhere in between.</p>
      <p>It must be acknowledged that the attribute of having a ‘‘tilt’’
favoring mathematical and visuospatial abilities compared to
verbal (i.e., M &gt; V), regardless of level of ability, is more
frequently exhibited by males than by females across the four
cohorts in the SMPY study. Females tend to be more balanced in
their ability profile (i.e., M ’ V) and this leads them to choose
mathematics, engineering, or physical-science careers less
frequently than their male counterparts do. In other words, these
data show that having better math abilities relative to one’s
own verbal abilities is associated with selecting careers in
mathematics and science and that this tilt is more frequently
found in high-ability males than it is in high-ability females.</p>
      <p>When making career choices, highly gifted individuals consider
their own pattern of abilities and not whether they have
the absolute level of ability needed to pursue a career in a
demanding field of study. They seem to be implicitly asking,
‘‘What am I better at?’’ and not asking ‘‘Am I smart enough to
succeed in a particular career?’’</p>
      <p>The above studies illustrate how sex differences in mathematical
and visuospatial abilities detected by age 13 have consequences
that can be seen 20 years later. These sex differences in
abilities and preferences predict differences in participation and
achievement in mathematics and science for individuals in their
mid 30s. Sharper predictive power is obtained if abilities are
combined with preferences, which also display sex differences
by age 13 (Achter et al., 1996, p. 76; Lubinski &amp; Benbow, 2006).</p>
      <p>Males more frequently than females display preference patterns
that are conducive to pursuing science and mathematics careers
and that, when coupled with abilities, form aptitude complexes
(Corno et al., 2002; Cronbach &amp; Snow, 1977), vocational taxons
(Dawis &amp; Lofquist, 1984), or trait clusters (Ackerman, 1996;
Ackerman &amp; Heggestad, 1997) that contribute to the
development of scientific skills. The finding that highly gifted
individuals prefer academic areas in which they are most able further
exacerbates discrepancies at the high levels of achievement, as
do any differences in self-competency beliefs, with their effect
on task values and, thus, engagement in science (Jacobs, Lanza,
Osgood, Eccles, &amp; Wigfield, 2002). High-ability males were
found in one study to have unrealistically high self-competency
beliefs; no such effect was found for females, whose beliefs
also were high but were more accurate predictors of future
performance (e.g., r 5 .38 for males vs. r 5 .61 for females;
Gibbons, Benbow, &amp; Gerrard, 1994).</p>
      <p>Additional Factors Influencing Sex Differences in Career
Choices of High-Ability Individuals
Occupational choices are not made in isolation or independently
of other life decisions such as marrying, having children, or
living close to relatives (Benbow et al., 2000; Eccles, 1994).</p>
      <p>There are trade-offs, and for many successful women there
exists considerable conflict between the traditionally feminine
values and goals in life (e.g., child-care responsibilities) and
the expectations from traditionally male highly competitive
achievement activities (Browne, 2002; Eccles, 1994). Indeed,
intellectually talented men in their mid 30s are on average more
career focused (ds of .21 – .76), work longer hours, and are
willing to work longer hours than women of the same age whose
reports indicate that they tend to prefer a more balanced life
approach with regard to career, family, and friends (Benbow
et al., 2000; Lubinski, 2004, Webb et al., 2002). If these sex
differences continue over a sustained time frame, women’s
additional family responsibilities may help explain some of the
underrepresentation of women in science careers (Eccles, 1994)
and at the highest levels of various professional careers. That
is, if men remain more career focused and spend more hours
working, for whatever the reasons, then, in all likelihood, men
will accomplish more than their female counterparts and will
likely be seen as more successful in the world of work. Already,
men in the SMPY sample reported higher incomes, a difference
that disappeared when hours worked was controlled (Benbow
et al., 2000). This does not mean, however, that men are more
successful in life or more personally satisfied: On all indicators
examined, these talented men and women in their mid 30s
reported feeling equally good about themselves and about their
achieved success.</p>
      <p>Xie and Shauman (2003), when studying women in science,
found that most of the observed sex differences in research
productivity could be attributed to personal characteristics
and the structural features of the employment setting. Having
children was one factor associated with less engagement in
mathematical and science careers for women but not for men.</p>
      <p>Sex differences in mathematical and science careers are indeed
extremely complex and are surely influenced by the social
structures in which individuals are situated, the neighborhood
resources, and the networks of interaction in which they
participate (Eccles, 1994; Entwistle, Alexander, &amp; Olsson,
1994; Farmer, Wardrop, Anderson, &amp; Risinger, 1995; Xie &amp;
Shuman, 2003). The fact that social and environmental variables
are important determinants of career success, however, does not
mean that we cannot draw conclusions about the role of abilities,
preferences, and other factors that may be responsible for
producing sex disparities in participation, engagement, and
achievement in the quantitative disciplines at the very highest
levels. The SMPY studies clearly demonstrate that sex
differences in mathematical and visuospatial abilities, the male tilt
compared to female balance in ability profiles, and differing
preferences and educational experiences all contribute to the
sex differences in outcomes among the highly gifted.</p>
      <p>AN EVOLUTIONARY ACCOUNT OF SEX DIFFERENCES</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="7">
      <title>IN MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE</title>
      <p>There are multiple perspectives for examining the origins and
meaning of sex differences in science and mathematical
achievement. In psychology, evolutionary theory emphasizes the
adaptive value of behaviors and mental processes that have
developed throughout the entire history of a species. Answering
questions about sex differences in academic and cognitive
domains from an evolutionary perspective is complicated because
the knowledge bases, technical skills, and insights that are
needed to achieve in math and science are rooted in the poorly
understood interaction of cognitive and motivational factors
and culture-specific educational goals and opportunities to
master these academic domains. Most of the competencies that
compose modern math and science are not the direct result
of evolution (Geary, 1996). Studying advanced topics in
mathematics and science, for example, are recent activities for
humans, so they may be better thought of as being built upon
earlier adaptive solutions for functioning in a specific cultural
context rather than as direct reflections of the history of
our species (Gazzaniga &amp; Heatherton, 2006; Geary, 2007).
Nonetheless, an evolutionary perspective can contribute to our
understanding of sex differences in math and science by
providing a way to understand proximate biological correlates
(e.g., sex hormones) of these differences, and a perspective for
simultaneously considering developmental and social
correlates. A detailed consideration of potential indirect evolutionary
influences on sex differences in math and science is beyond the
scope of this monograph and, in fact, may not be possible given
our current state of knowledge in these areas. Our goals are to
provide examples of how an evolutionary perspective can be
used to frame our understanding of current empirical findings
and to generate hypotheses for future study.
Sexual Selection
Darwin (1871) proposed that many sex differences have evolved by
means of sexual selection. The mechanisms involve competition
with members of the same sex over mates and discriminative choice
of mating partners. The most frequently studied dynamics are
male–male competition over access to mates and female choice of
mating partners. It is clear that female competition and male choice
occur in many species. Whatever the pattern, the most common
result is the evolutionary elaboration of physical, behavioral, or
cognitive traits that facilitate competition and choice. In recent
decades, the study of sexually selected sex differences has
emerged as a vibrant area in the biological sciences and has
yielded insights into the evolution and proximate expression of
these differences across hundreds of species (Andersson, 1994;
Andersson &amp; Simmons, 2006). Although the results of these
studies strongly confirm the importance of sexual selection,
some sex differences may have evolved that are unrelated to
sexual selection (Isaac, 2005). Even for traits related to sexual
selection, many issues remain to be resolved regarding the
nuances of competition and choice and the interaction of these
dynamics (Andersson &amp; Simmons, 2006).</p>
      <p>Sex Hormones
The proximate expression of many of the traits that have evolved
by means of sexual selection are influenced by prenatal and
postnatal exposure to sex hormones, particularly androgens
in mammals (e.g., Adkins-Regan, 2005; Morris, Jordan, &amp;
Breedlove, 2004). Androgens and other hormones can influence
sex differences in cognition and behavior through early prenatal
organization of associated brain areas, activation of these areas
by postnatal exposure to androgens, or some combination.
The influences of sex hormones are, however, complex and
sometimes very subtle, and often interact reciprocally with
genetic sex, physical health, and social and ecological context
(Arnold et al., 2004; McEwen et al., 1997). As an example, these
reciprocal relations are important for understanding how
androgens interact with male health and social context in the
expression (or not) of evolved sex differences.</p>
      <p>Within-Sex Variation
The processes that are at work in sexual selection can also
exaggerate within-sex variation (Houle, 1992; Pomiankowski
&amp; M ller, 1995). Pomiankowski’s and M ller’s cross-species
review and analysis suggest that within-sex variation can occur
when competition or choice favors traits toward the phenotypic
extreme (observable traits such as the peacock’s tail). Although
much remains to be learned, it appears that selection that favors
extreme traits can result in the evolution of genetic mechanisms
that result in exaggerated within-sex variation as well as the
evolution of condition-dependent traits.</p>
      <p>As a way of understanding condition-dependent traits, consider
for example, how the combination of the physical demands of
maintaining a larger body size—a common result of male–male
studies support the notion that females perform better on tasks
such as language processing that require bilateral activation,
while males excel in tasks requiring focal activation of the visual
association cortex. Studies by O’Boyle, Gill, Benbow, and
Alexander (1994) found that the right hemisphere may play a
role in linguistic processing for mathematically precocious
youth, a population that, as we discussed earlier, displays sex
differences in mathematical and visuospatial abilities.
Single-Sex Schools
None of the data regarding brain structure or function suggest
that girls and boys learn differently or that either sex would
benefit from single-sex schools, yet that is exactly the claim that
is driving a rapid increase in such schools. According to Sax
(cited in MSNBC, 2006), who is the director of the National
Association for Single-Sex Schools, at least 223 public schools
across the country already offer some single-sex classrooms—
up from 4 in 1998. Those who support single-sex schools have
argued that new information about brain differences for girls and
boys should change how we think about single-sex education
and that each sex should be taught in a way that is compatible
with its brain. Others who favor single-sex education provide
social reasons for their support. Their argument is based on the
idea that girls and boys spend too much time impressing each
other when they are in the same classes and that, by separating
them, each sex will be more focused on school work.</p>
      <p>As already noted, girls get better grades in school in every
subject and are now attending college at substantially higher
rates than boys are. These data, which represent increased
academic and career success over the decades when the number
of single-sex schools declined, do not support the reasoning
behind such schooling. The relative success of girls in academic
settings has been labeled a ‘‘boy crisis’’ in the popular media
(e.g., Tyre, 2006). Thus, one reason for proposing single-sex
schools is to stem the loss of boys from higher education. But
boys score higher than girls on standardized tests in math and
science from the end of secondary school through graduate
school, so it is not true that boys are failing to learn in
coeducational schools—each sex is showing superior performance on
different types of measures of learning. The question of whether
grades in school or scores on standardized tests are better or
more valid measures is a matter of considerable dispute. Some
critics have argued that the grade–test disparity shows that
schools are biased against boys; while others have argued that
standardized tests are biased against girls. The data show different
patterns of achievement on different types of assessments, so it
could also be argued that, given an appropriate assessment, both
sexes show evidence of learning in math and science.</p>
      <p>Several different meta-analyses have examined the data in
support of the claim that single-sex education is advantageous
for either girls or boys. In a conceptual overview of single-sex
education, Salomone (2006) asks: ‘‘Is there any evidence that
separating students on the basis of sex might make a positive
difference in academic performance and achievement or social
adjustment, at least for some students?’’ (p. 791). She considers
a range of possible advantages, including those that are
motivational, social, and educational. Salomone concludes that ‘‘the
evidence is undeniably inadequate’’ (p. 791). The Campbell
Collaboration (2001) is a nonprofit organization that aims to help
people make well-informed decisions about the effects of
interventions in the social, behavioral, and educational arenas. They
commission reviews that ‘‘synthesize evidence on social and
behavioural interventions and public policy, including education,
criminal justice, and social welfare, among other areas. The
primary concern is with evidence on overall intervention or
policy effectiveness and how effectiveness is influenced by
variations in process and implementation, intervention
components and recipients, as well as other factors’’ (The Campbell
Collaboration, 2001). In two separate reviews of single-sex
education, the conclusions were the same. In the words of one of
the reviews: ‘‘The paradox of single-sex and co-education is that
the beliefs are so strong and the evidence is so weak’’ (Smithers
&amp; Robinson, 2006, p 31).</p>
      <p>THE BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL: AN INTEGRATION</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="8">
      <title>OF NATURE AND NURTURE</title>
      <p>In thinking about the brain and applying the findings about brain
structures and function to cognitive sex differences, it is
important to keep in mind the fact that the environment also
shapes the brain. Consider these two examples: A study
of London cab drivers found that they had enlarged portions of
their right posterior hippocampus relative to a control group of
adults whose employment required less use of spatial skills. The
cab drivers showed a positive correlation between the size of
the region of the hippocampus that is activated during recall of
complex routes and the number of years they worked in this
occupation (Maguire, Frackowiak, &amp; Frith, 1997; Maguire et al.,
2000). The finding that the size of the hippocampus varied as
a function of years spent driving taxis makes it likely that it was a
lifetime of complex way-finding that caused the brain structure
used in certain visuospatial tasks to increase in size, although
other explanations also are possible. In a second recent study, a
3-month period of juggling practice led to an increase in
greymatter density in the putative motion-processing region of the
temporal cortex (MT/V5; Draganski et al., 2004), showing a
direct relationship between behavior and brain morphology (the
brain area also changed back when the juggling practice
stopped). These findings are consistent with many studies of
nonhuman species and demonstrate that experience can alter the
biological underpinnings of behavior and cognition—including
the size of brain structures—making the nature–nurture
distinction difficult to resolve. These data are important because
they suggest that sex differences in structures or functions of the
brain might not be ‘‘hard wired,’’ but could also result from
differences in the experiences that men and women have in life.</p>
      <p>When most people think about the reasons why there are fewer
females than males in math and science careers (or fewer males
than females teaching kindergarten), they assume one of two
alternatives: nature or nurture. However, a strict nature–nurture
dichotomy is too simplistic; nature cannot exist without nurture.
Instead of thinking about influences lining up along a continuum
with nature and nurture at either end, the biopsychosocial
model—which is more like a continuous loop in which variables
exert reciprocal influences on each other—is a better metaphor.
A biopsychosocial model is shown in Figure 8.</p>
      <p>SOCIOCULTURAL FORCES, SEX, AND MATHEMATICS</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="9">
      <title>AND SCIENCE</title>
      <p>The evidence for social and cultural influences on sex differences
in math and science performance is plentiful and varied. First, we
consider five categories of evidence: (a) research on family,
neighborhood, peer, and school influences; (b) research on
stereotype threat; (c) training studies; (d) cross-cultural
analyses; and (e) trends over time. Then, we shift to the question
of occupational choice and examine sociocultural influences on
that process. Finally, we review the evidence on the impact of
sex discrimination and women’s roles.</p>
      <p>Family, Neighborhood, Peer, and School Influences
There are multiple influences of parents, peers, and the schools
on children’s development (e.g., Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris,
1998; Vandell, 2000). Here we focus on these influences
specifically in the domains of abilities, academic performance,
and self-efficacy beliefs. A limitation to some of these studies
is that they simply report a correlation, for example, between
parents’ estimates of their children’s mathematics ability and the
children’s scores on a standardized test. From this correlation,
we cannot infer the direction of causality. We cannot tell whether
the parents’ beliefs in their children influence the children’s
performance or whether the opposite process occurs—that
children’s test scores influence their parents’ estimates of their
abilities. Moreover, it may be that both processes occur in
reciprocal fashion. Some researchers have used more advanced
designs, such as longitudinal research or controlling for ability
at the time of the first measurement, to try to sort out these issues;
most recently, reciprocal-effects modeling has been applied
(Marsh, Trautwein, Lu¨ dtke, Ko¨ ller, &amp; Baumert, 2005). We note
the studies that use these more advanced methods. Similarly,
when researchers find evidence of correlations between
afterschool activities (e.g., participation in a computer club) and
math performance, it is difficult to know whether participation
improves math performance or whether youth with stronger math
skills choose to participate in such activities. The latter follows
from the expectation that, to some extent, children will create
Fig. 8. Biopsychosocial model showing how genes, hormones, and
experiences alter brain development and how individuals select experiences

thus also altering the size and connectivity of their brains. In this model,

(2000).
their own environments and seek niches consistent with their
interests and abilities (Scarr, 1996; Scarr &amp; McCartney, 1983).</p>
      <p>Numerous studies have confirmed the finding that parents’
expectations for their children’s academic abilities and success
are correlated with the children’s self-concept of their own
ability and their subsequent performance (e.g., Bleeker &amp;
Jacobs, 2004; Parsons, Adler, &amp; Kaczala, 1982). Parents’ level
of education correlates with their children’s mathematics
achievement, even when children’s math ability and attitudes
are controlled, an effect that holds across cultures (Schiller,
Khmelkov, &amp; Wang, 2002). Higher levels of parental
involvement with their children’s education is correlated with higher
levels of children’s performance in mathematics (Muller, 1998),
although Raymond and Benbow (1986) found that parents were
equally supportive of their mathematically talented sons and
daughters. Parental involvement also covaries with successful
placement of students in higher-ability mathematics groups
(Useem, 1992). More specific studies are needed to determine
whether parents show sex-differentiated treatment of their
children in important matters such as intervening to have them
placed in high-math-ability classes.</p>
      <p>Lytton and Romney (1991) conducted a meta-analysis of
studies of parents’ differential socialization of boys versus girls
in western cultures. Although overall they found evidence of
similarity in treatment of boys and girls (e.g., warmth d 5 .07,
discipline d 5 .07), the studies may not be relevant to the
questions addressed in this report. Parents treated males and
females similarly in encouraging achievement (d 5 .02), but this
measure did not differentiate areas, such as language arts
or mathematics, in which achievement was encouraged. The
notable exception to this pattern of similar treatment was
encouragement of sex-typed activities and sex-typed
perceptions of the child, which was sex-differentiated (d 5 0.34 for
mothers, d 5 0.49 for fathers). That is, parents, especially
fathers, encouraged sex-typed behavior—particularly, fathers
discouraged their sons from playing with dolls. The question,
then, is the extent to which these sex-typed experiences may
contribute to sex differences in math and science abilities.</p>
      <p>Sociologists and psychologists have also studied
neighborhood effects—that is, effects outside the home that have an
impact on children (e.g., Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2004). One
well-sampled study of children in kindergarten and first grade
found that boys’ gains in math reasoning were more sensitive to
neighborhood resources than were those of girls (Entwistle,
Alexander, &amp; Olson, 1994), which is consistent with the earlier
suggestion that male development is more sensitive to
environmental conditions. The effect was to create more variability
among males in their math performance. By middle school, when
children were tracked for math classes, males in the high track
were outscoring females in the high track, even though
sex differences were not significant in the full sample. The
researchers traced this greater variability for males to their early
sensitivity to neighborhood effects. In the Entwistle et al. study,
there were reports that boys in the summer after first grade were
more likely than girls to be monitored less closely by their
parents, go to recreation centers, and play organized sports,
whereas girls were more likely to play in the house and thus had
less freedom to move about the neighborhood. Similar patterns
continued in middle school. These differential experiences may
give boys more spatial experience and, in complex games, more
spatial and mathematical experience. Consistent with this idea,
Matthews (1986, 1987) found that, by age 11, boys show greater
spatial knowledge than girls do—as demonstrated, for example,
by making a map of a familiar area—and attributed this
difference to girls’ lesser experience of roaming over their
environment, which in turn may be related to parents’ greater
restrictions placed on girls as well as by child-initiated sex
differences in size of the play range, suggesting that girls may
opt for activities that include less roaming than those chosen by
boys.</p>
      <p>Children and adolescents are strongly influenced by peers
(Harris, 1995; Rubin, Bukowski, &amp; Parker, 1998). Here we
focus on peer influence on academic performance and
motivation. Children’s math grades are correlated with the average
verbal and math skills of the children in their peer group
(Kurdek &amp; Sinclair, 2000). Children tend to become part of peer
groups who are similar to them in regard to academic motivation
or academic performance, making cause-and-effect inferences
difficult (Altermatt &amp; Pomerantz, 2003; Kindermann, 1993;
Crosnoe, Cavanagh, &amp; Elder, 2003).</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, children appear to stereotype mathematics as
masculine. In one study, girls rated men as liking mathematics
more and being better at mathematics than women, although the
girls rated boys and girls as equal on these variables (J. Steele,
2003; see also Heyman &amp; Legare, 2004). In a Finnish study,
second-, fourth-, and sixth-grade children were asked to identify
the child who was best in their class in language arts and in
mathematics (Ra¨ ty, Kasanen, Kiiskinen, &amp; Nykky, 2004). In
language arts, boys and girls were nominated evenly. However,
in mathematics, the boys nominated only boys from the second
grade on, and the girls began nominating more boys than girls
beginning in fourth grade. By middle adolescence, girls
generally receive less peer support for science activities than boys
do (Stake &amp; Nickens, 2005). Science enrichment programs can
be helpful in counteracting these effects, by giving girls a
science-supportive peer network (Stake &amp; Nickens, 2005).</p>
      <p>Peer influence, of course, is not limited to childhood and
adolescence. Holland and Eisenhart (1990) conducted an
ethnographic study of females entering college—at either a
southern, predominantly White university or a southern,
historically Black college—who were planning to major in
mathematics or science. The title of their book, Educated in Romance,
reflects their finding that these young women lost their way on
the science path during college, being swept away by the search
for a romantic partner, which reduced their career ambitions.</p>
      <p>Holland and Eisenhart concluded that faculty and
administrators actually had little impact on the women’s choices of career
and major; the guiding forces came from peer relationships. It
remains to be seen whether female students would be swept
away at universities such as MIT or CalTech or whether female
students who enter these science-intensive environments differ
from women who enter other universities. In either case, the peer
environment, as well as women’s own preferences, during the
undergraduate years may result in a loss of women who are
prepared to enter graduate training in science and mathematics.</p>
      <p>Herzig’s (2004) analysis of women choosing or leaving
doctoral programs in mathematics also emphasized peer and other
contextual influences. To persist in their doctoral program,
students must feel integrated into their community of practice,
which means that they must not feel isolated, as women may if
they are small in number in a graduate program in mathematics,
physics, or engineering. Men, in contrast, may not need as much
peer support and social integration to persist in these programs.</p>
      <p>Schools may exert an influence in multiple ways, including via
teachers’ attitudes and behaviors, curricula, ability groupings,
and sex composition of classrooms (Roeser, Eccles, &amp; Sameroff,
2000). For example, ability grouping in mathematics tends to
benefit high-ability students (Colangelo, Assouline, &amp; Gross,
2004; Mulkey, Catsambis, Steelman, &amp; Crain, 2005). When
combined with implicit instruction (e.g., questioning of
students’ experimental results) or explicit instruction (e.g,. Klahr
&amp; Nigam, 2004; Kuhn &amp; Dean, 2005), hands-on laboratory
experiences are especially important for learning in the physical
sciences in middle school and high school. An important point
for this report is that, although laboratory experiences do not
improve the physical-science achievement of boys, they do
improve the achievement of girls, thereby helping to close the
gender gap in these areas (Burkam, Lee, &amp; Smerdon, 1997; Lee
&amp; Burkam, 1996).</p>
      <p>A complementary set of studies has investigated whether boys
and girls do, in fact, experience different learning environments
relevant to mathematics and science, both in school and out of
school. In science and mathematics classes, teachers are more
likely to encourage boys to ask questions and to explain
concepts (American Association of University Women, 1995; Jones
&amp; Wheatley, 1990; Kelly, 1988). In one study of high-school
geometry classrooms, teachers directed 61% of their praise
comments and 55% of their high-level open questions to boys
(Becker, 1981). Experiences such as these are thought to give
children a deeper conceptual knowledge of, and more interest
in, science, although this relation has not been fully established.</p>
      <p>Moreover, as Kelly (1988) noted, even an apparently small
difference between teachers spending 44% of their time with
girls and 56% with boys could translate—via extrapolation—to
1,800 more hours with males over a child’s school career of
15,000 hours.</p>
      <p>Science-education researchers refer to out-of-school learning
as informal learning. The quality of students’ informal learning
environments correlates with their performance on tests of
scientific reasoning ability (Gerber, Carvallo, &amp; Marek, 2001).</p>
      <p>For example, presence of a computer in the home for educational
purposes and use of a home computer predict performance on
standardized tests of mathematics (Downey &amp; Yuan, 2005).</p>
      <p>Compared with high-school girls, high-school boys are more
likely to have computers in their homes for educational purposes
and are more likely to use them (Downey &amp; Yuan, 2005). When
engaged in a science task—playing with magnets—mothers
talk about the science process (e.g., they use explanations
and generate hypotheses) more with boys than with girls
(Tenenbaum, Snow, Roach, &amp; Kurland, 2005). Moreover, the
amount of mothers’ science-process talk predicts children’s
comprehension of readings about science 2 years later. When
parents and children use interactive science exhibits at a
museum, parents are three times more likely to explain science
to boys than to girls (Crowley, Callanan, Tenenbaum, &amp; Allen,
2001). High-school boys are more likely to have participated in
a math or science fair and, as with the activities noted above, this
activity affects standardized mathematics test performance
(Downey &amp; Yuan, 2005). Thus, informal learning environments
relevant to mathematics and science appear to differ for boys
and girls. However, it is not clear to what extent these relations
are due to parental assumptions of the interests and abilities of
boys and girls, to differences in the responsiveness of boys and
girls to these activities, or to some combination.</p>
      <p>Of course, schools do not exert absolute power over students,
and students are not passive recipients of their experiences.</p>
      <p>Students exercise choice in school activities and in informal
learning. Crucial to this discussion is students’ choice in high
school to take advanced mathematics and science courses. The
gender gap in mathematics course enrollment has narrowed over
the last several decades, so that by 1998 girls were as likely as
boys to have taken advanced mathematics courses, including
Advanced Placement calculus (National Science Foundation,
2005). Girls were actually slightly more likely than males to take
advanced biology (40.8% of females vs. 33.8% of males),
Advanced Placement biology (5.8% vs. 5.0%), and chemistry
(59.2% vs. 53.3%). Boys, however, were more likely to take
Advanced Placement chemistry (3.3% of males vs. 2.6% of
females) and physics (31.0% vs. 26.6%) and were twice as
likely to take Advanced Placement physics (2.3% vs. 1.2%;
National Science Foundation, 2005). The science pipeline
heading toward physics, then, begins to leak early, as fewer girls
than boys take the necessary high-school courses to prepare
themselves for college-level physics.</p>
      <p>Stereotype Threat
Stereotype threat is an influence that has been demonstrated in
laboratory settings and may occur in real testing situations. It
was initially identified and theorized to explain differences in
test performance between talented Black and White college
students (C.M. Steele, 1997). C.M. Steele proposed that a
negative stereotype about one’s group leads to self-doubt and other
processes that can then undermine academic performance,
perhaps by impairing working memory. This concept was
quickly extended from stereotypes about Blacks’ intellectual
inferiority to stereotypes about females’ deficiencies in
mathematics (R.P. Brown &amp; Josephs, 1999; Quinn &amp; Spencer, 2001;
Spencer, Steele, &amp; Quinn, 1999; Walsh, Hickey, &amp; Duffy, 1999).</p>
      <p>In one experiment, male and female college students with
equivalent math backgrounds were tested (Spencer et al., 1999).</p>
      <p>Half were told that the math test had shown sex differences in the
past, and half were told that the test had been shown to be gender
fair. Among those who were led to believe that the test was
unbiased, there were no sex differences in performance, but
among those who believed it showed sex differences, women
performed worse than men.</p>
      <p>The stereotype-threat effect on males’ and females’
performance on math tests has been replicated numerous times (e.g.,
Ben-Zeev, Fein, &amp; Inzlicht, 2005; Cadinu, Maass, Rosabianca,
&amp; Kiesner, 2005; Ford, Ferguson, Brooks, &amp; Hagadone, 2004;
Inzlicht &amp; Ben-Zeev, 2000; Johns, Schmader, &amp; Martens, 2005;
Keller &amp; Dauenheimer, 2003, in a naturalistic setting; Marx,
Stapel, &amp; Muller, 2005; Quinn &amp; Spencer, 2001; Schmader,
Johns, &amp; Barquissau, 2004), although there are occasional
failures to replicate, including one in a more typical test-taking
setting that used test questions taken from standardized exams
(Cullen, Hardison, &amp; Sackett, 2004). Importantly, most of these
studies have been conducted with high-math-ability females—
precisely those who are most capable of succeeding at careers in
mathematics and science. We note here the heated exchange
between Sackett, Hardison, and Cullen (2004a, 2004b), who
were concerned about the mischaracterization of stereotype
threat by the media, and C.M. Steele and Aronson (2004), who
responded to their critique. Sackett et al. also raised concerns
about the use of covariates and other statistical procedures used
to demonstrate stereotype threat. Steele and Aronson responded
to the concerns raised by Sackett et al. by referring to the large
number of studies that found evidence for stereotype threat and
by pointing out that many of these studies do not rely on the use
of covariates to demonstrate the effect. This exchange, which
was published in one of psychology’s leading journals, shows
the disagreement over the concept of stereotype threat and its
importance in real-life settings. No one has yet conducted a
meta-analysis of these stereotype-threat studies, so the size of
the effect is unknown, but some studies show large effects
(d 5 .67, Quinn &amp; Spencer, 2001; d 5 1.35, Johns et al., 2005).</p>
      <p>It is also unknown how altering test scores by removing
stereotype threat from the testing setting affects the validity of
the scores in predicting grades or other indicators of success.</p>
      <p>Additional research has elaborated the processes involved in
stereotype threat. For example, when solving difficult math
problems, females’ ability to formulate problem-solving
strategies is reduced under high-stereotype-threat conditions
compared with low-stereotype-threat conditions (Quinn &amp; Spencer,
2001). Exposure to sex-stereotyped television commercials
reduces females’ math performance (Davies, Spencer, Quinn, &amp;
Gerhardstein, 2002), providing evidence of the media as one
of the pervasive sociocultural sources of stereotype threat. And
females who endorse stereotypes about mathematics as masculine
show larger stereotype-threat effects on their math performance
than do females who do not endorse these stereotypes (Schmader
et al., 2004). The presence of a math-competent female role model
eliminates the stereotype-threat effect on females’ math
performance (Marx &amp; Roman, 2002).</p>
      <p>The stereotype-threat research carries two important
implications: First, if a simple manipulation of instructions can produce
or eliminate sex differences in performance on a mathematics
exam, the notion of fixed sex differences in mathematics ability
is called into serious question. Stereotype threat remains a
somewhat contentious topic, and some would argue that this is a
straw argument because no one really believes that mathematical
ability is some fixed or permanent attribute of an individual, so the
first concern is not valid. Second, stereotype threat is a result of
cultural factors—specifically, stereotypes about female
inferiority at mathematics—and thus provides evidence of sociocultural
influence on sex differences in mathematics performance.</p>
      <p>Most of the research on stereotype threat has been conducted
in laboratory settings. Does the effect occur in real-world
settings with high-stakes tests? To answer this question, Stricker
and Ward (2004) collected information about sex and race either
before or after high-school students took an Advanced
Placement test in calculus. Students who score 3 or above in this exam
are often given college credit for calculus, so it is an important
test. Stricker and Ward set their criteria for deciding if
stereotype threat was operating in this real-world setting using a
standard alpha level of .05 (indicating that the obtained results
would occur by chance when the groups really did not differ in
fewer than 5 out of 100 replications) and by deciding that they
would only consider effect sizes larger than d 5 .20. They
concluded that they found no evidence of deleterious effects of
stereotype threat on female performance on quantitative tests. In
a reanalysis of their data, Danaher and Crandall (in press)
refuted the conclusion that stereotype threat was unimportant in
real high-stakes testing. They countered that effect sizes need to
be considered within a context and that d &lt; .20 is large and
meaningful in this context. They calculated that 5.9% additional
females and 4.7% fewer males would achieve a passing score of
3 or higher if sex and race were indicated after students take the
test instead of before. The result would be 2,789 more females
starting college with credit already achieved for calculus. Thus,
stereotype threat has been found to have significant
consequences, even though the effect size is small.</p>
      <p>Training Studies
Environmental input is essential to the development of spatial
and mathematical abilities (Baenninger &amp; Newcombe, 1995;
Newcombe, 2002). Babies are not born knowing how to work
calculus problems. Children acquire these skills through
schooling and other experiences (Geary, 1995, 2006). Here
we review the evidence from training and schooling studies. A
meta-analysis found that spatial ability can indeed be improved
with training, with effect sizes ranging between d 5 0.4 and
d 5 0.8, depending on the length and specificity of the training
(Baenninger &amp; Newcombe, 1989). A more recent meta-analysis
of the effects of training and experience on spatial skills
confirms the earlier findings (Marulis et al., 2007). The effects of
training were similar for males and females; that is, both groups
benefited about equally from the training, and there was little
evidence that the gap was closed or widened by training. Vasta,
Knott, and Gaze (1996), however, showed that the difference
could be eliminated by carefully conceptualized training.
Unfortunately, most school curricula contain little or no emphasis
on spatial learning. Girls, especially, could benefit greatly from
such a curriculum.</p>
      <p>The most recent development is multimedia software that
provides training in three-dimensional spatial-visualization skills
(Gerson, Sorby, Wysocki, &amp; Baartmans, 2001). As described
earlier, training in such skills has been used successfully with
first-year engineering students. Importantly, there were
improvements in the retention of female engineering students who
took the spatial-visualization course; without the course, the
retention rate for females was 47%, whereas with the course it was
77%. These results have held up across multiple years of training
with different cohorts.</p>
      <p>Studies of the effects of schooling are difficult in the United
States because schooling is nearly universal. One design,
though, has compared children’s growth during the school year
with their growth during summers. A study of kindergartners and
first graders, for example, found that growth in spatial skills was
much more rapid from October to April (when children are in
school most of the time) than it was from April to October (when
children are in school less of the time; Huttenlocher, Levine, &amp;
Vevea, 1998). Importantly, this effect did not occur for all
measures; for example, memory performance improved as much
over the April-to-October period as it did from October to April,
suggesting specificity of the effects of schooling on spatial skills.</p>
      <p>Similar results for schooling have been found for mathematics
(e.g., Downey, von Hippel, &amp; Broh, 2004).</p>
      <p>Cross-Cultural Analyses
The International Assessment of Educational Progress tested
the math and science performance of 9- and 13-year-olds in 20
nations around the world. The effect sizes for sex differences for
selected countries are shown in Table 7 (Beller &amp; Gafni, 1996).</p>
      <p>Focusing first on the results for mathematics, we see that the sex
differences are small in all cases. Most importantly, effect sizes
are positive (favoring males) in some countries, negative
(favoring females) in other countries, and several are essentially
zero. The 2003 TIMSS (National Center for Education Statistics,
2005) found similar results, with some positive and some
negative effect sizes, and most less than .10 (see also D.P. Baker
&amp; Jones, 1993). In the TIMSS data for eighth graders, the
magnitude of the sex differences was 0.09 in Chile (country
average score 379), 0.02 in the United States (country average
502), 0.01 in Japan (country average 569), and 0.05 in
Singapore (country average 611). That not only the magnitude
but also the direction of sex differences in math performance
varies from country to country highlights the importance of
sociocultural factors in influencing those differences, although it
also possible that different genetic pools are underlying some of
the differences. Perhaps most importantly, though, the sex
difference is very small in most nations.</p>
      <p>We note here that large differences in the TIMSS math tests
were found by the end of secondary school. As described in the
summary report: ‘‘The results by gender for the secondary
students differ from those at the earlier grades. In most of the
countries, males had significantly higher average achievement
than females in both mathematics literacy and in advanced
mathematics’’ (estimated average d 5 .38; Mullis, Martin,
Fierros, Goldberg, &amp; Stemler, 2000, p. 13).</p>
      <p>Focusing next on the results for science performance, as
shown in Table 7, we see that the effect sizes more consistently
favor males and are somewhat larger, although they are not large
for any nation. When the results are subdivided into scientific
subdisciplines, sex differences are smallest in life-sciences
knowledge (0.11 and 0.20 at ages 9 and 13, respectively,
averaged over all countries) and somewhat larger for physical
sciences (0.22 and 0.33; Beller &amp; Gafni, 1996). The TIMSS report
Note. From Beller &amp; Gafni, 1996, Table 2 and Appendix.
summarized the findings this way: ‘‘The gender differences were
more pronounced in science than in mathematics. Still, by the
final year of secondary school, males had significantly higher
average achievement than females in most countries in both
mathematics and science’’ (Mullis et al., 2000, p. 30).</p>
      <p>The data by content area for fourth, eighth, and final
secondary-school grades showed that differences in performance by
gender vary by content areas and age. For example, in
mathematics, males outperformed females in measurement at eighth
grade, but females exhibited a slight edge in algebra. In science,
males outperformed females in earth science, physics, and
chemistry, but not in life science or environmental issues at the
same grade level. Large differences favoring males were not
found until the final year of secondary school, and these also
varied in size as a function of content area.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that cross-cultural differences in
mathematics performance are very large compared with sex
differences in any one country. For example, in one
cross-national study of fifth graders, American males (M 5 13.1)
performed better than fifth-grade American females (M 5 12.4) on
word problems, but fifth-grade Taiwanese females (M 5 16.1)
and Japanese females (M 5 18.1) performed far better than
American males (Lummis &amp; Stevenson, 1990). Environmental
factors can be more important than sex in determining the level
of mathematics performance.</p>
      <p>In perhaps the most sophisticated analysis of cross-national
patterns of gender differences in mathematics performance, D.P.</p>
      <p>Baker and Jones (1993) found that, across nations, the
magnitude of the sex difference in mathematics performance for eighth
graders correlated significantly with a variety of measures of sex
stratification in the countries. For example, the magnitude of
the sex difference in math performance correlated .55, across
nations, with the percentage of females in the workforce in those
nations: The more that females participate in the labor force (an
index of equality), the smaller the sex difference in mathematics
achievement. These findings are consistent with Eagly and
Wood’s (1999) social-structural theory of psychological sex
differences.</p>
      <p>Sociocultural Influences on Occupational Choice
To understand sex differences in occupational preferences and
choices, one must understand the multiple pathways and
psychological processes to those choices. A well-tested model
of these choices has been proposed by Eccles, using an
expectancy-value theory (Eccles, 1983, 1994; Meece,
EcclesParsons, Kaczala, Goff, &amp; Futterman, 1982).</p>
      <p>According to Eccles’ model (Fig. 9), individuals choose a
particular occupation and, before that, take the necessary
academic courses in high school and college, as a function of two
factors: (a) expectations for success (i.e., individuals take on
challenges when they expect that they can succeed at them) and
(b) perceptions of task value (i.e., individuals take on a challenge
when they value the task, perhaps because they intrinsically
enjoy the task, perhaps because it has utility value such as a good
salary, or for other reasons). Costs are estimated as well (e.g.,
joining the after-school science club might require giving up
cheerleading). Expectations for success are shaped by the
individual’s task-specific beliefs (self-concept of ability in the
relevant domain, perceptions of the difficulty of the task), which
in turn are shaped by past events (e.g., grades in school in that
subject, standardized test scores), and also by the person’s
interpretation of those past events (e.g., high grades in
mathematics as a result of ability or of effort). Perceptions of task value
are shaped by the individual’s long-term goals (e.g., becoming a
mathematics professor) and short-term goals (e.g., taking the
right sequence of undergraduate mathematics courses to qualify
for a PhD program in mathematics). These perceptions of task
value are shaped in turn by the individual’s perceptions of the
attitudes and expectations of important socializers (parents,
teachers, peers) and the larger cultural milieu (such as the mass
media and gender segregation in the occupation). Dozens of
studies have provided evidence supporting the model’s proposed
links, although it has been criticized for not including a
measure of ability (e.g., Eccles, Vida, &amp; Barber, 2004; Fredricks
&amp; Eccles, 2002; Frome &amp; Eccles, 1998; Jodl, Michael,
Malanchuk, Eccles, &amp; Sameroff, 2001; Meece et al., 1982;
reviewed by Eccles, 1994).</p>
      <p>How does the model of achievement proposed by Eccles help
us understand sex differences in choice of academic courses in
high school, major in college, and occupation? At the simplest
level, if males and females differ in their expectations for
success at math- and science-related tasks, or if they attach
different values to success at these tasks, then sex differences in
choices will occur. Research has documented sex differences in
expected task value and expected success in the areas of science
and mathematics, as well as sociocultural forces that influence
those expectations. In general, children’s math-competence
beliefs decline from 1st to 12th grade (Jacobs et al., 2002).</p>
      <p>Although boys start out with greater math-competence beliefs
than girls, by 12th grade there is no sex difference in these
Fig. 9. Eccles (1994) model showing how cultural milieu, beliefs, aptitudes, and experiences work together to
create beliefs and expectations in developing children and ultimately influence those individuals’
achievement in math and science. Adapted from ‘‘Understanding Women’s Educational and Occupational Choices:
Applying the Eccles et al. Model of Achievement-Related Choices,’’ by J.S. Eccles, 1994, Psychology of
Women Quarterly, 18, p. 588. Copyright 1994, Blackwell Publishing. Adapted with permission.
beliefs, at least in recent studies (Fredricks &amp; Eccles, 2002;
Jacobs et al., 2002; see Wilkins, 2004, for international
comparisons; and see Hyde, Fennema, Ryan, Frost, &amp; Hopp, 1990,
for a meta-analysis of earlier studies). Reciprocal-effects
modeling with longitudinal data indicates that math-competence
beliefs predict later standardized-test performance much more
strongly than test scores predict competence beliefs (Marsh
et al., 2005). Children’s valuing of mathematics also declines
from 1st to 12th grade, but there are no sex differences in valuing
math. What we do not know from these studies is what the sex
differences look like in college-age samples, when serious
decisions about occupations are made, or how sex differences
in interests may interact with these beliefs in determining
long-term career choices.</p>
      <p>One relevant study examined ninth graders’ intentions to
enroll in math courses (Crombie et al., 2005). Although many
of the predictors of intentions were the same for boys and
girls, the direct path from math competence beliefs to
enrollment intentions was significant for girls but not for boys,
suggesting that girls may be more influenced by their math
self-concept.</p>
      <p>Research within this expectancy-value theory has also
documented the relation between parents’ sex-stereotyped
beliefs and children’s sense of competence and achievement in
mathematics and science. In one longitudinal study, mothers’
estimates of their sixth-grade children’s likelihood of success in
mathematics predicted the children’s actual math career choices
at ages 24 to 25 years (controlling for children’s ability);
importantly, mothers’ sixth-grade estimates of their children’s
math-career success were significantly higher for boys than for
girls, although there was no control for ability in this study and
the authors acknowledge that less subjective measures, such as
achievement tests, might have yielded different relations with
career choice (Bleeker &amp; Jacobs, 2004). In another study,
parents who held stereotypic beliefs about male superiority in
mathematics gave significantly higher math-ability estimates to
sons than they did to daughters, controlling for the children’s
actual grades (Jacobs, 1991; see also Jacobs &amp; Eccles, 1992).</p>
      <p>Parents’ perceptions of their children’s math ability may have a
stronger influence on children’s beliefs in their own ability than
their math grades do (Frome &amp; Eccles, 1998). This is a finding
that needs to be replicated and studied further.</p>
      <p>Similar results have been found for the influence of teachers.</p>
      <p>For example, teachers’ perceptions of students’ math talent early
in the school year predict the students’ later math
achievementtest scores, even when earlier measures of ability are controlled
(Jussim &amp; Eccles, 1992). In short, the Eccles research
demonstrates the potential importance of key socializers—especially
parents and teachers—in shaping children’s self-concepts of
their ability, their course choices, and their occupational
choices. When the socializers hold stereotypic beliefs about
male superiority in mathematics and science, these beliefs can
translate to daughters with lower self-concepts of their math and
science ability who choose not to pursue careers in science and
mathematics.</p>
      <p>Correll’s (2004) sociological model is similar to that of Eccles,
but Correll’s model emphasizes a broader principle: that cultural
beliefs about sex differences affect the emerging career
aspirations of males and females. In a laboratory experiment,
participants were told that they were being tested for a (fictitious)
ability, ‘‘contrast sensitivity,’’ which was said to be very important
for graduate school and employment success. In one condition,
participants were told that, on average, males perform better on
these tests (male-advantage, MA, condition), and in the other
condition, participants were told that there were no gender
differences (NGD condition). The task was in fact ambiguous,
and all participants were told that they were correct on 13 of 20
items. Afterward, males in the MA condition gave themselves
significantly higher contrast-sensitivity ratings than did females
in that condition; in the NGD condition, there were no sex
differences in ability ratings. Perhaps most importantly,
compared with females in the MA condition, males in the MA
condition rated themselves as significantly more likely to apply to
graduate programs and for jobs requiring high levels of
contrastsensitivity ability; this differences was not found in the NGD
condition.</p>
      <p>Another line of evidence comes from cross-cultural analyses
indicating that sex-stereotypic patterns of course choice and
occupational choice vary from one nation to another. For
example, female enrollment in 12th-grade math classes ranges
from 22% in Japan to 52% in Thailand (Hanson, Schaub,
&amp; Baker, 1996; see also Davenport et al., 1998). Female
enrollment in physics classes ranges from 13% in Japan to 52% in
Thailand, with the United States at 22% (Hanson et al., 1996). For
students planning to major in mathematics or science in college,
the range is from 13% female in Japan to 38% female in Canada,
with the United States at 28%. These variations closely parallel the
proportion of women employed as scientists in those countries.</p>
      <p>Sex Discrimination and Occupational Success
Psychological scientists have studied sex discrimination in a
number of ways. Social psychologists agree that the old-fashioned,
overt sexism that existed several decades ago in the United
States may have been replaced by unconscious, covert, modern
sexism or neosexism in some situations (Jackson, Esses,
&amp; Burris, 2001; Masser &amp; Abrams, 1999; Swim &amp; Cohen,
1997). Studies investigating sex bias generally use one of two
methodological approaches: (a) experimental studies, in which
a work product (e.g., an article) is submitted to raters for
evaluation of its quality and half of the raters see it with a
stereotypic male name as author and the other half see the same
work product but with a stereotypic female name as author; and
(b) naturalistic studies examining experiences of sexism or
evaluations or hiring of males and females in real work settings.</p>
      <p>The experimental studies have the advantage of experimental
control but may lack external validity; the naturalistic studies
supply the latter, and therefore these studies are perceived to be
complementary.</p>
      <p>A meta-analysis of studies using the experimental paradigm
found that, when job applications were evaluated, sex bias
occurred (d5 .13 to .25; Swim, Borgida, Maruyama, &amp;
Myers, 1989; the negative value indicates that the female
applicant was rated lower than the male). The effect size does not
represent a performance difference between males and females
but rather a difference in evaluating the work of a male stimulus
person compared with that of a female stimulus person. A
metaanalysis of experimental research conducted in simulated
employment contexts (e.g., when hiring or compensation
decisions were measured) found that sex bias in ratings depended on
whether the job in question was traditionally sex-typed as male
or female (Davison &amp; Burke, 2000). When the job was male
sex-typed, males received higher ratings (d 5 .33) even though
identical qualifications had been presented in the experiment.</p>
      <p>When the job was female sex-typed, females received higher
ratings (d5 .26). This pattern suggests that raters’ beliefs
about applicants’ future performance may have influenced their
ratings. A meta-analysis of field studies of sex bias in ratings of
job performance found, overall, little evidence of bias; however,
a substantial pro-male bias (d 5 .32) appeared when only males
served as raters (Bowen, Swim, &amp; Jacobs, 2000). The Davison
and Burke (2000) meta-analysis, however, did not find male
raters to be more biased than female raters (d 5 .24 and .34,
respectively). Therefore, it is an open question as to whether
males are more biased in their ratings than females are.</p>
      <p>One study investigated fourth-year medical students’
experiences of sex discrimination and sexual harassment (Stratton,
McLaughlin, Witte, Fosson, &amp; Nora, 2005). Compared with men,
women who had been exposed to discrimination or harassment
were significantly more likely to report that the experience
influenced their choice of specialty (45% vs. 16%) and residency
rankings (25% vs. 11%). General surgery was the area in which
women were most likely to experience discrimination or
harassment during the residency selection process. This study,
based on a large sample (n 5 1,314), documents the frequency
of talented professional women’s exposure to discrimination and
the extent to which it affects their career choices. A related study
of women in academic medicine found that 40% of the
respondents ranked sex discrimination first out of 11 possible
factors hindering their careers in that field (P.L. Carr, Szalacha,
Barnett, Caswell, &amp; Inui, 2003).</p>
      <p>Focusing on earlier stages of the career process, another study
surveyed 477 first-year and 324 final-year undergraduates in
male-dominated fields (math, science, engineering) and
femaledominated fields (arts, education, humanities, social science;
J. Steele, James, &amp; Barnett, 2002). Women in the math, science,
and engineering fields reported significantly more sex
discrimination than men reported in their fields and than women
reported in female-dominated fields. Moreover, they also
anticipated experiencing more sex discrimination in the future if
they went into a career in that field. Women in the math, science,
and engineering fields were also the most likely to report
thinking about changing their major.</p>
      <p>There has been only one study of sexism in the scientific
peerreview process that was based on an analysis of peer-review
scores (Wenneras &amp; Wold, 1997). In an investigation of the
reasons why women in Sweden are less likely to succeed in
science and mathematics, two investigators studied the
peerreview process that is used to award postdoctoral fellowships.</p>
      <p>Sweden has been named as the ‘‘leading country in the world
with respect to equal opportunities for men and women’’ (p. 343),
so it is likely that if sexism were found in their peer-review
process, it exists in other countries as well. Scientific peer
review is shrouded in secrecy. When the investigators requested
the data on peer review from the Swedish Medical Review
Council, they were denied access. Similar requests to the
National Science Foundation in the United States were met with
the response that the data are not available in a format that
allows comparisons of women and men (Ceci, Wiliams, &amp;
Barnett, 2007). However, the Swedish Freedom of Press Act
grants public access to all government documents, except those
classified as secret for reasons related to national security. An
Administrative Court granted the investigators access to the
documents relating to peer review. The investigators found
that female applicants for postdoctoral fellowships received
lower mean scores in all three of the areas in which they were
evaluated: scientific competence, quality of proposed
methodology, and relevance of the research proposal. Because final
scores are computed by multiplying all three scores, small
differences are enlarged with this procedure for computing total
scores. Of course, lower mean scores are not evidence of sexism,
as it is possible that the women applicants were, in fact, less
qualified. To test this possibility, the investigators computed
scientific productivity indices six different ways, using variables
such as number of publications, number of first-author
publications, impact factors as indicators of the quality of each
publication, and number of scientific citations. In the authors’
own words: ‘‘Did men and women with equal scientific
productivity receive the same competence rating by the MRC
reviewers? No!’’ (p. 387). The most productive group of female
researchers (total of more than 100 total impact points) were
rated as comparable in ability to the least productive male
researchers (total impact points less than 20). All other women
were rated below all of the men.</p>
      <p>Wenneras and Wold (1997) found that being affiliated with a
committee member (what they call a ‘‘friendship bonus’’) and
being male were the two most important factors in determining
how research applicants were rated. The effect of having a
personal relationship with members of the review committee—
which included being a student of a member or working on a
project with a committee member—was significant even though
committee members with relationships with applicants recused
themselves from rating these applicants. Still, those
relationships were known among the other members of the committee,
who apparently were influenced by that knowledge. The authors
of this study conclude that the peer-review process in what is
arguably the most gender-equal nation in the world is rife with
nepotism and sexism. In Sweden, women receive 44% of
biomedical doctoral degrees but hold only 25% of postdoctoral
positions and 7% of professional positions. The authors believe
that some portion of these discrepancies is caused by sexism.</p>
      <p>The policy of secrecy has prevented similar investigations into
the peer-review process in other countries. Even if nepotism and
sexism operate without conscious awareness, they are no less
insidious. At a time when the United States and other countries
are facing serious shortages of scientists and mathematicians,
we can only wonder if biases in the peer-review process are
contributing to the loss of talented women in these areas. There
are no reasons to believe that scientists in the United States
would be any more immune to prejudice and nepotism than
those in Sweden; these results provide strong reasons for making
the peer-review process more transparent and open for peer
review.</p>
      <p>Women’s Roles
Although there has been a major shift over the last several
decades toward equalizing men’s and women’s roles in the home,
employed women still spend significantly more time with their
children than men do (Sandberg &amp; Hofferth, 2001). Achieving
high levels of success in a math or science career requires
substantially more than 40 hours of work per week. In thinking
about future careers, women may believe that such a career
would interfere with family life, particularly with having
children. And, once in a math or science career, women who
have children may find themselves choosing between time with
children and the extra hours needed to perform brilliantly.</p>
      <p>Women with engineering degrees, for example, are more likely
than their male peers to be working part time, and the most
common reason given for the part-time work is family (Morgan,
2000).</p>
      <p>Women who choose nontraditional careers, for example in
math or science, may be penalized in the marriage market. For
instance, women portrayed as being in a traditionally masculine
occupation (e.g., orthopedic surgeon, chemical engineer) are
rated as less attractive than women in traditionally feminine
occupations (Badgett &amp; Folbre, 2003). Women engineers are
less likely to be married and more likely to be childless than men
engineers are (Jagacinski, 1987). Thus, it appears that women
entering careers in science and engineering face more difficult
life trade-offs than their male peers do.</p>
      <p>One study pitted several of these explanations against each
other, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth, a national probability sample of 12,686 young men and
women who ranged in age from 14 to 21 in 1979 and who were
followed until 1993 (Okamoto &amp; England, 1999). According to
neoclassical economic theory, women choose traditional female
jobs such as secretary or teacher because they anticipate
interruptions in their employment (e.g., for childbearing and
child rearing); therefore, they purportedly choose occupations
that can accommodate this pattern. However, in this large data
set, teenagers’ anticipation of future employment breaks did
not predict whether women were in female or male occupations
14 years later. Being married and having children later in life
did. This pattern held only for White women and Latinas. For
Black women, having children predicted being in a male
occupation. The researchers explored a second hypothesis,
driven by gender-socialization theory, holding that children are
socialized from an early age and develop sex-typed interests,
preferences, and skills as a result. One of these socializing
forces is parents and whether they model working in a highly
sex-segregated occupation. However, the sex composition of
parents’ jobs was unrelated to the composition of the women’s
jobs. A third hypothesis predicted that women with more liberal
sex-role attitudes would be employed in jobs with a lower
percentage of females. This hypothesis was confirmed: Women with
more liberal sex-role attitudes in 1979 were more likely to be in
male jobs in 1993. This study, then, provides some evidence of
the influence of women’s roles—marriage and children—and
women’s sex-role attitudes on whether women enter male
occupations.</p>
      <p>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this review of the current state of the evidence for cognitive
and interest differences between the sexes and their putative
biological, evolutionary, and social/environmental origins, we
have presented a summary of what is known about sex
differences and similarities in mathematical and science abilities
based on the best available scientific evidence. The popular
media have sensationalized findings of sex differences, often
presenting the latest finding without assessing the quality of the
research that it was based on or using ‘‘person on the street
interviews’’ about beliefs about sex differences as though they
were as valid as a carefully executed program of research (e.g.,
Conlin, 2003). This monograph represents a consensus of expert
opinion, from a group of scientists with diverse backgrounds, to
the questions about sex and math and science achievement. We
addressed questions concerning whether and when (in the life
span) there are differences between males and females in the
cognitive abilities that are important for success in careers
requiring aptitude for and achievement in mathematics and
science, and the extent to which sex differences in math and
science abilities can be attributed to ‘‘innate’’ explanations,
socialization, or the way these two types of influences
reciprocally influence each other. In this review, we have focused on a
wide range of research in which reasonable data have
accumulated that address these issues, which we summarize and
draw conclusions from below.</p>
      <p>Average Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities
Psychologists often look for sex differences very early in life as
clues to the relative contribution of biological and
environmental contributions, reasoning that newborns have had fewer
social interactions, so the earlier that sex differences are reliably
found, the more likely they are assumed to be biological in
origin. This assumption is not fully supported by the biological
literature because, for many species, sex differences are not
evident in infancy and often do not emerge until the age of
reproductive maturation. The simple distinction between
cognitive sex differences that emerge early in life and those that
emerge later does not rule out environmental effects, because
the uterine environment affects the development of a fetus. The
role of prenatal environmental factors is an excellent example of
the interaction of biological and environmental variables, which
often become indistinguishable in their effects. It does not
necessarily follow that differences found later in life are caused
by social or environmental factors, because there are
developmental timelines for biological processes, including the timing
of puberty, the development of the forebrain, and the aging
processes, all of which are also influenced by the environment.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the tasks that infants can handle may be qualitatively
different from tasks designed for adolescents, even if they are
both labeled the same. For example, a verbal or spatial task for
an infant is qualitatively different than a verbal or spatial task
for an adolescent. With these caveats in mind, the usual finding
across tasks is that males and females develop equally well in
early cognitive skills that relate to quantitative thinking and
knowledge of objects in the environment.</p>
      <p>By the end of grade school and beyond, females perform better
on assessments of verbal abilities when assessments are heavily
weighted with writing and the language-usage items cover topics
with which females are familiar; sex differences favoring
females are much larger in these conditions than when
assessments of verbal abilities do not including writing. In contrast,
males excel on certain visuospatial-ability measures. Yet, of all
the sex differences in cognitive abilities, differences in
quantitative abilities have received the most attention because of the
marked differences favoring males at the highest end of the
ability distribution and because of their importance in so many
occupations. Male performance is more variable than that of
females in quantitative and visuospatial abilities, which means
that there are also more males at the low-ability end of these
distributions. Because males tend to be more variable, the
average difference in performance between females and males
for most assessments is smaller than it is at the high- and
low-ability tails of the distributions, and the size of the average
between-sex difference is larger for tests such as the GRE that
are administered to selective samples than it is for less selective
tests such as the SAT or a high-school admissions test. The fact
that females achieve higher grades in school-based math and
science tests and lower average scores on standardized exams
used for college admissions and graduate school may point to
differences in the strategies males and females use to solve novel
problems (Gallagher &amp; Cahalan, in press) and to the tendency of
females to do better in most school contexts (Willingham &amp; Cole,
1997). Of course, the factors that enter into earning a high grade
in a class are also different from those leading to high test scores
on a standardized test.</p>
      <p>Sex Differences in Math and Science Performance in the
Tails of the Distribution
Substantial evidence suggests that the male advantage in
mathematics is largest at the upper end of the ability distribution,
a result that could provide important clues to the origin of this
sex difference. In addition, a ‘‘tilt’’ favoring visuospatial or
mathematical abilities compared to verbal, regardless of level of
ability, is more frequently exhibited by males than by females.</p>
      <p>Females tend to be more balanced in their ability profiles, which
may lead them to choose mathematics or science careers less
frequently than their male counterparts do. These differences
can be seen as early as adolescence, and, therefore, a greater
number of males than females may qualify for advanced training
in disciplines that place a premium on mathematical reasoning
and/or visuospatial abilities. Any differences that exist are
increased if interests and activities that are correlated with
abilities are considered.</p>
      <p>An Evolutionary Account of Sex Differences in
Mathematics and Science
From an evolutionary perspective, sex differences in advanced
math and science have not evolved in any direct way but could
be indirectly related to differences in interests and to specific
brain and cognitive systems that differ for females and males.</p>
      <p>Evolutionary theories predict sex differences that arise from
patterns of intrasexual competitions (for both males and
females) and intersexual choice (for both females and males),
including pressures that accompany the male-biased activities
of hunters and warriors who traveled long distances in novel
territory. Although a large body of data was presented that
supports this theory, numerous criticisms have been raised as
well. Many of its predictions remain to be tested, although
several patterns are consistent with observed differences in
interest and ability profiles.</p>
      <p>Sex Differences in Brain Structure and Function
Studies of brain structure and function have suggested some
potential biological mechanisms for the observed sex
differences in ability. In general, females have a higher percentage of
gray-matter brain tissue, whereas males have a higher volume of
connecting white-matter tissue—with the exception of the
splenium of the corpus callosum, which is more bulbous and,
thus, larger in females than in males. Furthermore, male brains
show greater volumetric asymmetries than female brains do. The
higher white-matter volume seems associated with better spatial
performance in males, while the greater bilateral symmetry
seems associated with better language processing in females.</p>
      <p>Although the advent of noninvasive techniques for functional
brain imaging has allowed a rapid increase in the number of
studies investigating sex differences in the regional functional
specialization for cognition, these studies are in their infancy.</p>
      <p>Future research of this type should involve larger and more
carefully selected sample populations to avoid strong and
potentially confounding cohort effects, and should employ
longitudinal designs. Finally, hormones have been documented
to affect cognition through their organizing effects on the brain.</p>
      <p>Sociocultural Forces, Sex, and Math and Science Abilities
Sociocultural forces also influence sex differences in math
and science abilities, academic-course choices, occupational
choices, and occupational success in math and science careers.</p>
      <p>Compared with girls, boys seem to benefit more from enriched
neighborhoods and to be hurt more by deprived neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>Schools certainly influence students’ learning and performance;
research has documented systematic, subtle differences in the
ways that teachers treat males compared with the ways they treat
females in math and science classrooms. Cross-cultural research
demonstrates that the magnitude of sex differences in math
performance varies across nations. In no country is the overall
sex difference large prior to the end of secondary school, when
the size of the sex difference begins to increase, although larger
differences sometimes emerge earlier in specific mathematical
areas (e.g., geometry). Moreover, the magnitude of the sex
difference correlates negatively with measures of gender
equality in the country. Many women in math and science areas
do report significant sex discrimination, and these experiences
likely shape the direction their careers take. Finally, women’s
roles may be part of the equation, as women still bear more
responsibility for child care than do men and they work fewer hours.</p>
      <p>It also seems that being successful in a nontraditional career, such
as engineering, may penalize women in the marriage market.
There cannot be any single or simple answer to the many complex
questions about sex differences in math and science. Readers
expecting a single conclusion—such as that we can explain sex
differences in science and math by knowing about hormones, or
by knowing how stereotypes affect performance, or by knowing
how our ancestors met the challenges in their lives—are surely
disappointed. Just as there are many related questions about sex
differences in test scores and career choices, there are many
variables that work together to present a level of complexity that is
inherent in understanding complicated questions about the way
people think and behave. We have presented several conclusions,
including a definition of the problem and the systems of variables
that make us both social and biological animals. There are caveats
to these conclusions because of methodological limitations of
individual studies. Nonetheless, they are based on sound science,
and we relied on meta-analyses of large bodies of research, when
those were available. There is no single factor by itself that has
been shown to determine sex differences in science and math.</p>
      <p>Early experience, biological constraints, educational policy, and
cultural context each have effects, and these effects add and
interact in complex and sometimes unpredictable ways.</p>
