Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999400166666667">
The relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success has been the source of numerous controversies. The present
paper conducted a meta-analysis of the longitudinal studies that have investigated intelligence as a predictor of success (as measured
by education, occupation, and income). In order to better evaluate the predictive power of intelligence, the paper also includes metaanalyses of parental socioeconomic status (SES) and academic performance (school grades) as predictors of success. The results
demonstrate that intelligence is a powerful predictor of success but, on the whole, not an overwhelmingly better predictor than parental
SES or grades. Moderator analyses showed that the relationship between intelligence and success is dependent on the age of the
sample but there is little evidence of any historical trend in the relationship.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996073476190476">
Decades of research on human mental abilities have
demonstrated that the scores of intelligence tests are
positively correlated with several desirable outcomes
and negatively correlated with several undesirable
outcomes. One of the central and personally most relevant desirable outcomes is socioeconomic success (or
career success), which is usually measured by the educational level, occupational prestige, and income of an
individual in adulthood. Although it is sometimes claimed in popular press and textbooks that intelligence has
no relationship to important real-life outcomes (see
Barrett &amp; Depinet, 1991, for a review of such claims), the
scientific research on the topic leaves little doubt that
people with higher scores on IQ tests are better educated,
hold more prestigious occupations, and earn higher
incomes than people with lower scores (Gottfredson,
1997, 2003; Jensen, 1980, 1998; Schmidt &amp; Hunter,
2004).
Thus, the existence of an overall positive correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success
is beyond doubt. But quite surprisingly, the mere
existence of this correlation seems to be the only fact
that is established beyond doubt after many decades of
research. Several major questions are still without
definite answers and continue to arouse heated debates

(the debate about The Bell Curve being a prominent
example in recent decades; see Herrnstein &amp; Murray,
1994; Fischer et al., 1996). First, what is the
approximate size of the correlation between intelligence and success? Is it large enough to be of any
practical importance? While some researchers have
said that this correlation is “larger than most found in
psychological research” (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004:
162), others are convinced that “IQ is just not an
important enough determinant of economic success”
(Bowles &amp; Gintis, 2002: 12). Second, how does the
predictive power of intelligence compare to the
predictive power of other variables, such as parental
socioeconomic status (SES) or school grades? On the
one hand there are studies showing that “individual
ability is by far the strongest influence on occupational achievement” (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999: 217).
And yet other studies conclude that “the effect of
socioeconomic background on each of the three adult
status variables – schooling, income, and occupational status – is greater than the effect of childhood
IQ” (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974: 44). Third, are there
any age-related or historical changes in the relationship between intelligence and success? The question
of historical changes in the importance of IQ has been
particularly controversial with some authors warning
against increasing cognitive stratification (Herrnstein

&amp; Murray, 1994) and others trying to disprove these
claims (Hauser &amp; Huang, 1997).

<bodyText confidence="0.949567333333333">
The present paper will address these questions by
conducting a meta-analysis of the longitudinal research
on the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. I will concentrate on longitudinal studies
(where intelligence is measured before the actual success) because only longitudinal research design allows
us to make conclusions about the possible causal impact
of intelligence on success.

2. A brief history
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998817314285714">
Longitudinal studies on the relationship between intelligence and career success have been conducted since
the first decades of the 20th century (Ball, 1938; Thorndike et al., 1934). And these studies have invariably
uncovered a positive relationship. The early studies,
however, did not consider other possible determinants of
success, most importantly parental SES. Therefore, they
were open to the criticism that the positive relationship
between intelligence and success might actually be the
result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp;
Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s,
with the inception of the status attainment research
paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that considered several determinants of success at the same time
(Duncan, 1968; Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp;
Ohlendorf, 1970).
But it was with the publication of The Bell Curve in
1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the question of
intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to
public attention. Analyzing a representative longitudinal
data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray
found that intelligence is a better predictor of several
desirable outcomes (e.g., not living in poverty, not being
arrested) than is parental SES. They also found evidence
that the role of intelligence in status attainment has been
growing throughout the 20th century and concluded that
the social structure of American society is increasingly
based on mental ability. The ideas of The Bell Curve
have been severely criticized for a number of reasons.
Fischer et al. (1996) argued that Herrnstein and Murray
used an inappropriate measure of parental SES and,
therefore, underestimated its importance. Hauser and
Huang (1997) argued that the claim about the growing
importance of intelligence is simply a misinterpretation
of previous research. Other researchers have, however,
supported the ideas of The Bell Curve (Gottfredson,
2003; Jensen, 1998) saying that its central claims have
been convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459).

At the same time in Great Britain, a similar discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who,
analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from
Great Britain, found that intelligence is a better
predictor of occupational attainment than is parental
SES and concluded that England is, to a large extent,
a meritocratic society (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999;
Saunders, 1997, 2002). These conclusions were
challenged by Breen and Goldthorpe (1999, 2001)
who argued that Saunders greatly overestimated the
importance of intelligence by using inappropriate
analytic techniques.

3. Previous reviews
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996114375">
There have been surprisingly few attempts to systematically review the literature on intelligence and
socioeconomic success. Reviewers typically cite only a
couple of studies (see e.g., Brody, 1997; Farkas, 2003;
Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Some of the most comprehensive reviews have been conducted by Jencks (see
Jencks et al., 1972, 1979). Two meta-analyses have so
far addressed the relationship between intelligence and
socioeconomic success. Both of them used income as a
measure of success. The more comprehensive one of
the two was conducted by Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne
(2001). They assembled 65 estimates from 24 studies
to estimate the relationship between intelligence and
income. The mean standardized regression coefficient
of intelligence on income is .15 according to their study
(p. 1154). In addition to that, Bowles et al. (2001)
reported that there is no time trend in the size of the
coefficients between the years 1960 and 1995 and that
the age of the sample at the time of ability testing has
no effect on the results.
The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. is a valuable
contribution but it suffers from several shortcomings.
First, it considered only one measure of success, income, thereby ignoring education and occupation. Second, the meta-analytic estimate of .15 was not derived
from zero-order correlations as is usually required by
the textbooks of meta-analysis (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt,
2004: 475) but from regression equations that included
several predictors in addition to intelligence. Peterson
and Brown (2005) have recently suggested that the use
of partial effect sizes, instead of zero-order ones, does
not affect the meta-analytic results very much but it is
nevertheless obvious that the use of disparate studies
makes the results difficult to interpret. Third, the metaanalysis of Bowles et al. was not based on independent
samples. The authors stated that they used 65 estimates
from 24 studies (p. 1154) but neither of these figures

represents the number of independent samples. Inspection of the appendix (not published but available from
the authors) leaves no doubt that some samples
contributed more than one coefficient to the final
meta-analytic estimate thereby ignoring the requirement of independent data (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt,
2004, chapter 10). Fourth, their meta-analysis mixed
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The distinction
between cross-sectional and longitudinal study design
is vital in the present context because only the latter can
answer questions about the causal impact of intelligence on career success.
Another, more recent, meta-analysis was conducted
by Ng, Eby, Sorensen, and Feldman (2005) who
collected 8 studies and found an average correlation of
.27 between intelligence and salary. The meta-analysis
of Ng et al. (2005) was, unlike the one by Bowles et al.,
based on zero-order correlations and avoided the use of
non-independent samples but it failed to separate crosssectional and longitudinal studies.
4. Topics addressed in the present paper
4.1. The size of the correlation between intelligence and
success
Meta-analyses are often conducted with the aim to
determine if a statistical relationship between two variables is significantly different from zero. This cannot be
the only aim of the present meta-analysis because very
few social scientists would doubt that there is a positive
correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic
success. Having acknowledged that, the next logical
question is: what is the approximate size of the correlation? Answers to this question are far from uniform.
Take the correlation between intelligence and income:
Jensen has suggested that it is somewhere around .40
(Jensen, 1998: 568) while Bowles et al. (2001) have
found that it is only about .15. That is why the first aim
of the present meta-analysis is to estimate the
approximate sizes of the correlations between intelligence and measures of success. The importance of the
correlations can be evaluated using Cohen&amp;apos;s classification scheme which classifies correlations as small if
they are below .30, medium-sized if they are between
.30 and .50, and large if they are over .50 (Cohen,
1988). Knowing the size of the correlation between
intelligence and career success would allow us to
compare it to other, well-established, correlations in the
social scientific literature; e.g., the correlation of .51
between intelligence and job performance (Schmidt &amp;
Hunter, 1998).
4.2. Intelligence and other predictors of success
It is difficult to evaluate the importance of a predictor
in isolation; it would be informative to compare the
predictive power of intelligence to the predictive power
of other relevant predictors of socioeconomic success.
This paper will, therefore, analyze two additional
predictors – parental SES (e.g., father&amp;apos;s occupation)
and academic performance (e.g., school grades) – with
the aim to determine if intelligence is a better predictor
of success than the other two variables. Parental SES
and academic performance have often been treated as
the main “competitors” of intelligence in predicting
career success because, as explained shortly, they
represent different views about a typical path to success.
Including them in this paper will, consequently, allow us
to better evaluate the role of intelligence in people&amp;apos;s
career.
4.2.1. Intelligence versus parental SES
The question about the relative importance of intelligence and parental SES in predicting success is one of
the central questions of status attainment research. This
is a question about the nature of the society we live in:
whether a typical western society rewards people for
their own abilities or their social background (Saunders,
1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a
definite answer to this question. Some authors have
found that intelligence outcompetes parental SES as a
predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998;
Saunders, 1997). Others have replied that parental SES,
if properly measured, is actually a better predictor
(Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The
seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in
some studies results from the failure to correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles
&amp; Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important
aspects of parental status (most importantly, parental
income) among the predictors (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974;
Fischer et al., 1996).
Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation
between intelligence and success with the correlation
between parental SES and success. To accomplish that,
the present paper will include a meta-analysis of the
relationship between the different aspects of parental
SES (parental education, occupation, and income) and
socioeconomic success. Research on this relationship is,
of course, voluminous and several narrative and quantitative reviews of it are available (see Ganzeboom,
Luijkx, &amp; Treiman, 1989; Haveman &amp; Wolf, 1995;
Mulligan, 1999). Ganzeboom et al. (1989), for instance,
gathered 149 studies from 35 countries to analyze the
T. Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426
association between father&amp;apos;s occupation and son&amp;apos;s occupation, and concluded that the association is stronger in
non-industrialized societies and has been weakening
during the 20th century. But none of these reviews has
presented the results in a manner that would make them
directly usable in this paper, hence the need for a
separate meta-analysis.1
4.2.2. Intelligence versus academic performance
The question about the relative importance of mental
ability and academic performance in predicting success
has also been recognized as important (see Jencks &amp;
Phillips, 1999). It is a question of what really matters for
career success: is it one&amp;apos;s general ability (as measured
by IQ tests) or the things one has learned at school and
motivation to learn (as measured by school grades)? Not
many studies have explicitly compared the predictive
power of IQ scores and school grades (e.g., Taubman &amp;
Wales, 1974, chapter 3). But the more general question
about the usefulness of grades as predictors of success
has been the object of considerable debate (see Roth,
BeVier, Switzer, &amp; Schippmann, 1996; Roth &amp; Clark,
1998). The meta-analysis by Roth and Clark (1998), for
instance, found an average correlation of .28 between
grades and salary. Thus, contrary to some earlier claims
(e.g., McClelland, 1973), grades have turned out to be
good predictors of success. This literature is somewhat
limited by being almost exclusively restricted to college
grades. If the purpose is to compare grades and IQ test
scores as predictors of career success, then high school
grades would be a better choice because college
students constitute a rather selected group that does
not represent the full range of career attainments in
society. High school grades have been meta-analytically
related to job performance (Dye &amp; Reck, 1988) and
college grades (Robbins et al., 2004) but there is
currently no meta-analysis about the relationship
between high school grades and general socioeconomic
success (as measured by education, occupation, and
income). The present paper will, thus, conduct such a
meta-analysis.
4.3. Moderators of the correlation between intelligence
and success
In order to further clarify the role of intelligence in
people&amp;apos;s career, the effects of three moderator variables
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99567">
405
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997890042553192">
(age at testing, age at success, and year of success) on
intelligence–success correlation will be studied. These
moderator variables have been analyzed in several
studies but with rather conflicting results.
4.3.1. Age at the time of testing
The first moderator analysis concerns age at testing
(age of individuals at the time the IQ test was taken)
and how it affects the correlation between intelligence
and success. Analysis of the effect of age at testing
reveals something about the mechanism behind the
intelligence–success correlation. If intelligence predicts
success irrespective of the age at which it is measured,
then there is reason to believe that the differences in
people&amp;apos;s career success are the result of the stable
individual differences measured by IQ tests (Jencks &amp;
Phillips, 1999). If however, the predictive power of IQ
tests changes with age, then different interpretations
are possible depending on how we believe the test
score to be affected by genes and environment.
According to the standard sociological interpretation,
the test scores of older individuals should be more
affected by life experiences than the scores of children
(because older individuals simply have had more
experiences) and consequently, if intelligence tested
at an older age should turn out to be a better predictor
career success, then it would mean that the test scores
probably reflect some career-relevant experiences
which the older individuals have had more time to
accumulate (Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1999). The other
interpretation is based on behavior genetic research
which has found that genetic influences on IQ scores
increase with age and environmental influences
decrease (McCartney, Harris, &amp; Bernieri, 1990); from
these results one can conclude that if the test scores of
older individuals are better predictors of success, then
it can be attributed to the growing effect of some
career-relevant genes.2
Empirical evidence concerning age at testing is rather
contradictory. A study by McCall (1977) found a clear
upward trend in the correlations between intelligence
and success; that is, correlations grew stronger as age at
testing increased. Some of the studies reviewed by
Jencks and Phillips (1999) have found a similar trend.
The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. (2001), however,
found that age at testing has no effect on the association
between intelligence and income. Jencks et al. (1979)
reached a similar conclusion in their review.

A related issue concerns the age of the individuals at
the time their career success is measured. According to
the so-called gravitational hypothesis, the correlation
between intelligence and success should grow stronger
as individuals grow older because (as a result of selfselection and competition) individuals “gravitate”
towards the positions that correspond to their ability
levels as they progress in their careers. This reasoning
has been used to support the idea that intellectual
differences cumulate over life course and become
progressively more important (see Gottfredson, 2003;
Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996). Other researchers have
suggested that exactly the opposite is true: the
predictive validity of IQ scores should decline as time
goes by because less able people have time to
accumulate skills to compensate for their initial lack
of ability (Ackerman, 1987; Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001).
These opposing views can be reconciled by saying that
the idea of declining importance of IQ applies to the
performance of specific tasks that become automatic
after some practice and the idea of growing importance
applies complex long term activities, such as attaining
and maintaining social status, that never cease to be
cognitively demanding. But so far as socioeconomic
success can depend on the performance of specific work
tasks, the possibility of declining validity of IQ is not
completely ruled out.
Several studies have correlated intelligence with
success at different points in people&amp;apos;s life course. Some
of them have found that the correlations indeed increase
with age as predicted by the gravitational hypothesis
(Brown &amp; Reynolds, 1975; Deary et al., 2005; Wilk &amp;
Sackett, 1996), others have found no clear trend (Hauser, Warren, Huang, &amp; Carter, 1996; Warren, Sheridan,
&amp; Hauser, 2002). The reviews by Hulin, Henry, and
Noon (1990) and Keil and Cortina (2001) found support
for the declining validity thesis but it should be noted
that many of the studies reviewed in these papers used
specific laboratory tasks as dependent variables and are,
therefore, not directly comparable to the studies reviewed in the present paper.
4.3.3. Year of the measurement of success
A particularly controversial issue concerns the historical changes in the relationship between intelligence and
success. It was one of the central claims of The Bell
Curve that the association between mental ability and
career success in western societies has been growing
throughout the 20th century (Herrnstein &amp; Murray,
1994). The logic behind this idea is similar to the gravitational hypothesis, discussed in the previous section –
in both cases individuals are increasingly drawn towards
the positions that correspond to their ability as time goes
by – but in this case the gravitation does not take place
during a life course of a single individual but over several
generations.
Several studies have investigated changes in the
association between intelligence and success during past
decades. Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded
that “the main point seems beyond dispute” (1994: 52)
and some studies have found support for this point
(Murnane, Willett, &amp; Levy, 1995), there are still serious
reasons to doubt that the importance of intelligence is or
has been growing. Neither the meta-analysis by Bowles
et al. (2001) nor the review by Jencks et al. (1979) found
any clear trend in the correlations between intelligence
and success. The same conclusion was reached by Flynn
(2004) and Hauser and Huang (1997). Breen and
Goldthorpe (2001) found that the association between
intelligence and occupational status in England is, if
anything, declining.

Educational level was measured by the number of years
spent in full time education or the highest level of education
completed. Occupational level was typically measured by
such occupational scales as Duncan Socioeconomic Index,
International Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status,
NORC prestige scale, etc. These scales provide detailed
numerical measures of occupational status (see Ganzeboom &amp; Treiman, 1996a, for a general discussion). In some
studies, less detailed occupational classifications were
used. Irrespective of the level of detail, all the occupational
variables in this paper had a common property of ordering
occupations on a single hierarchical dimension with higher
values designating more desirable and prestigious occupations. Income was measured by salary or total monetary
income, which had to refer to the personal income of an
individual, not to family or household income. If possible, I
preferred income measured on a logarithmic scale because
logarithmic transformation removes the skew typically
found in income distribution.

5.1.2. Intelligence

<bodyText confidence="0.971098655172414">
Intelligence, or general mental ability, of an individual was measured by a score on a test of intelligence. It
is not always easy, however, to decide if a given test is a
test of intelligence. The definitions of intelligence state
that it is an abstract ability that is not tied to any specific
domain of knowledge. Therefore, only the tests that are
designed to measure such ability should be used in the
meta-analysis. If we take the traditional threefold
distinction between ability, aptitude, and achievement
tests (Jensen, 1981), then the present study should use
only ability and aptitude test scores. Although some
researchers have contended that achievement tests can
also be treated as measures of general ability (Boudreau,
Boswell, Judge, &amp; Bretz, 2001), and even everyday life
can be interpreted as an IQ test (Gordon, 1997), the
present study took a more conservative approach and
included only those tests that are generally regarded as
tests of intelligence (see e.g., Anastasi &amp; Urbina, 1997;
Jensen, 1980, chapter 7, for a discussion and classification of different tests).
There are numerous “classical” tests (e.g., Henmon–
Nelson, Lorge–Thorndike, Otis–Lennon, Raven Progressive Matrices, Stanford–Binet, Wechsler tests) for
which there seems to be a general consensus that
these are indeed tests of general mental ability. Such
multiple aptitude test batteries as Armed Services
Vocational Aptitude Battery or General Aptitude Test
Battery are also often treated as measures of general
ability. The most problematic ones are the tests that
are specifically constructed for use in a single data
set. Such unique tests have been used in several large
and influential data sets (e.g., National Child

the manuals of the data sets and studies that are based on
the data. If the test was derived from other IQ tests or if it
was described as a test of intelligence, then I included it
in my study. Studies using well-known achievement
tests, such as Iowa Test of Basic Skills (Smokowski,
Mann, Reynolds, &amp; Fraser, 2004), were excluded. The
names of all the IQ tests used in this paper are listed in the

5.1.3. Parental SES
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98125275">
Five measures of parental socioeconomic status
(SES) were used in this paper; the first four were
father&amp;apos;s education, mother&amp;apos;s education, father&amp;apos;s occupation, and parental income. The measurement of these
variables was similar to the measurement of respondent&amp;apos;s own education, occupation, and income (see
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99457">

above). Parental income refers to father&amp;apos;s income or
total income of parents. Because too few studies
reported data on mother&amp;apos;s occupation, this variable
was not included. In addition to these four, I also used
a general index of SES, which combines several
parental characteristics into one variable. A number of
studies have used a composite index on the assumption that it is a better indicator of social advantages
than any of the single variables that make up the index
and, therefore, also a better predictor of success (see
White, 1982, for supporting evidence). A correlation
with SES index was included in the present metaanalysis if the index was composed of the following
components — parental education (education of one
or both parents), parental occupation (occupation of
one or both parents), and material well-being of the
parental home. The latter was measured by parental
income or by a “possession index” which indicates
how many of the valued items (e.g., a car, TV set,
computer) were present at home. If a study did not use
an index of SES but presented intercorrelations among
the necessary variables, then I used the formulas
reported by Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 433) to
calculate a composite score correlation between SES
index and success.

Academic performance was in most studies measured by a grade point average (GPA) obtained in high
school or the years preceding high school. In some
studies, rank in class (i.e., how well the student
performed in comparison with other students in the

interchangeably with GPA (see Kuncel, Crede, &amp;

Reference sections of review papers were also searched.

general criteria had to be met. First, the measurement of
the variables had to correspond to the descriptions
presented in Section 5.1. Second, the data had to be
longitudinal; that is, the predictors (intelligence, parental
SES, and academic performance) had to be measured at
an earlier time and career success (education, occupation,

and income) at a later time.3 Third, the interval between
the measurement of predictors and dependent variables
had to be at least 3 years because studies with shorter
intervals would have very little advantage over crosssectional studies. Fourth, the study had to report a zeroorder correlation between the variables and another
measure of association transformable into a zero-order
correlation.
Fifth, majority of individuals in the sample had to be at
least 20 years old at the time the career success was
measured because it makes little sense to talk about the
career success of individuals younger than 20. Sixth,
majority of individuals had to be less than 25 years old at
the time the IQ test was taken because, to properly
investigate the effect of intelligence on career, intelligence
should be tested before the individuals start a career.
Obviously, even individuals tested in their early twenties
might already have started a career, but since these
individuals can be used for comparison with younger
individuals, they were included. Information on parental
SES and academic performance had to refer to the time the
respondents were approximately 12–18 years old (the
time these variables presumably have their greatest impact
on subsequent career). Seventh, the study had to be
conducted in a “western” society; that is, in the United
States, Canada, Europe, Australia, or New Zealand. Additional criteria are described in Section 5.4.
It is rather common for published studies not to
report the information necessary for meta-analysis (the
lack of zero-order correlations is a typical problem). But
fortunately, the raw data of several well-known data sets
(e.g., General Social Survey, National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth) are available for public use. Because it
would be a serious waste of information to leave these
sources unused, I decided to use the available raw data
to calculate the correlations if none of the published
sources reported the necessary information or if the
information in the published source was deficient in
some way (e.g., if the correlations were reported separately for men and women but not for the complete

That does not mean that all the studies had to actually include at
least two waves of measurement because one of the predictors,
parental SES, can be measured retrospectively (by asking adult
respondents questions like “what was your father&amp;apos;s occupation at the
time you were 16?”). It is important, however, that the information
about father&amp;apos;s occupation or parental income obtained from adult
respondents refers to parents&amp;apos; past (not current) occupation or
income. The latter requirement was not applied to parental education
because parents&amp;apos; education is unlikely to change while children grow
up. In some studies (e.g. Duncan &amp; Hodge, 1963), father&amp;apos;s occupation
was rather vaguely referred to as father&amp;apos;s “usual occupation” or
“longest occupation”. These studies were also included.
sample). Most of the raw data sets had been prepared for
public use and contained all the necessary variables in a
ready-to-use form. In some cases, minor statistical procedures were implemented before calculating the correlations (e.g., summing the standardized scores of subtests
to obtain the score of general intelligence; transforming
the original occupational variable into a more appropriate
prestige scale using the methodological tools provided by
Ganzeboom and Treiman (1996b). The raw data sets used
in this paper are listed in the Appendix.
Several longitudinal data sets contain data from more
than one follow up. Career success has been measured
repeatedly for the same individuals in these data sets
(up to 20 times in some cases). In some data sets,
the predictors (intelligence, parental SES, or academic
performance) have also been measured repeatedly. In
order to ascertain that every sample contributed only
one correlation to one analysis, I averaged all the correlations that were derived from the same sample. If
the sample sizes of the averaged correlations were
different, mean sample size was used. The procedures
for moderator analyses are described in Sections 6.3
and 6.4.
5.3. Correcting for unreliability
Ideally, every correlation should be corrected with the
reliability coefficients obtained from the same sample as
the correlation that needs to be corrected (Hunter &amp;
Schmidt, 2004, chapter 3). However, such reliability
coefficients were available for only a small minority of
studies included in the present meta-analysis. The correlations from these studies were corrected with these
reliability coefficients. But for the majority of studies,
mean reliabilities (estimated from various sources, as
described below) were used. Each study was then corrected individually with the appropriate reliability coefficient. The nature and sources of reliability information
are described next.

<bodyText confidence="0.938980897959184">
Information on education, occupation, and income
can be obtained from three sources. The first source is
institutional record (e.g., tax records of income). Following the common practice, data from such objective
sources were assumed to have a reliability of 1. The
second and by far the most common source is self-report.
Self-reports are not perfectly reliable, however. The
amount of error is usually measured by asking the
same individuals to report their socioeconomic characteristics again after a few months and then correlating the
first and second reports (producing a test–retest
T. Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426
correlation). Several estimates of these correlations,
derived from nationally representative samples, are
available. Using the data presented by Bowles (1972)
and Jencks et al. (1979), I calculated the average test–
retest correlations for educational level (.89), occupational
status (.88), and income (.83). These values were used to
correct the correlations with self-reported socioeconomic
success. The third possibility is to obtain the information
from the spouse, parent, sibling, or child of the focal
individual. Because these sources would introduce
unnecessary complications and an unknown degree of
error, the studies using these sources were excluded
unless they contained correlations between intelligence
and success (these correlations are too valuable to be
discarded).4
5.3.2. Intelligence
When correcting for unreliability in the test scores,
test–retest alternate-form reliability (the correlation
between parallel forms of the same test administered
on two separate occasions) is generally considered to be
the most appropriate form of reliability (Schmidt &amp;
Hunter, 1999). But since these coefficients are rarely
available, simple test–retest reliability is often taken as
the second best option in meta-analytic studies of the
predictive power of IQ scores (Judge, Colbert, &amp; Ilies,
2004; Salgado, Anderson, Moscoso, Bertua, &amp; Fruyt,
2003). Because test–retest reliability coefficients were
reported in only a few studies, an average test–retest
coefficient, obtained from the meta-analysis of Salgado
et al. (2003), was used for most of the studies. Salgado
et al. averaged 31 test–retest correlations of different
general mental ability tests (the mean interval between
test and retest being 6 months) and obtained an average
coefficient of .83. This value is similar to average test–
retest correlations obtained in other reviews: e.g., .82 in
Parker, Hanson, and Hunsley (1988) or .85 in Kuncel,
Hezlett, and Ones (2004). Thus, the reliability of .83
seems to be a representative estimate and was used in the
present study.

reported education, occupation, and income. Second, it
can be reported by the children. Children&amp;apos;s reports on
parental characteristics are known to suffer from
considerable error. Probably the best estimate of this
error is the correlation between child&amp;apos;s report and
parent&amp;apos;s own report on a given characteristic. Looker
(1989) has presented a comprehensive review of these
correlations for father&amp;apos;s education, mother&amp;apos;s education,
and father&amp;apos;s occupation. Using the information in Table
3 in Looker&amp;apos;s paper, I calculated the average correlations between child&amp;apos;s report and parent&amp;apos;s report. The
average correlations are .80 for father&amp;apos;s education, .79
for mother&amp;apos;s education, and .78 for father&amp;apos;s occupation.
These values were used to correct the correlations that
involved children&amp;apos;s reports on parental SES.5 Information on the reliability of children&amp;apos;s reports on parental
income is harder to find. I could locate two studies
(Bell, Senese, &amp; Elliott, 1984; Massagli &amp; Hauser,
1983) that provided reliability estimates from three
samples. The estimates ranged from .45 to .59. with an
average of .51 that was used in the present paper. The
third source of information on parental SES is
objective data (e.g., tax records of income) that was
assumed to have a reliability of 1. Internal consistency
method (Cronbach alpha) was used to correct for
unreliability in the SES index. This method was
recommended by Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 438)
for composite variables. For all but two studies, the
alpha value of the SES index was obtained from the
same sample as the correlation itself. For the remaining
two, the average alpha of all the other studies (.71) was
used.

perfectly reliable. The reliability of self-reports is
assessed by the correlation between self-reported GPA

records. A recent meta-analysis by Kuncel et al. (2005)
found that this correlation is .82 for high school GPA
and .77 for high school rank. These values were used

GPA or rank.

strategy was preferred because most of the studies
that satisfied the inclusion criteria (see Section 5.2)
were based on samples that were fairly representative
of the general population and did not require the
correction for range restriction. It is, therefore,
appropriate to limit the current meta-analysis to
representative studies and exclude the studies that
exhibit signs of considerable range restriction.6 More
specifically, I excluded the studies that sampled only

(e.g., Eckland, 1965), (b) employees of a single

(such as engineers or managers; see e.g., Sackett, Gruys,

research where the problem of range restriction is
particularly serious (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004). I
also excluded the correlation if the range of one (or both)
of the correlated variables was deliberately restricted by
the research design. For example, in the study of gifted
children by Terman and Oden (1947), the range of
intelligence was severely restricted by sampling only
individuals with IQs over 135; in the Polish study by
Firkowska-Mankiewicz (2002), the range of intelligence
was restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs
below 86 or over 130. The correlations obtained from
Fergusson, Horwood, and Ridder (2005) and Kuh and
Wadsworth (1991) were the only ones that had to be
corrected for dichotomization.
5.5. Moderator variables
In order to investigate the issues described in Section
4.3, the following moderator variables were coded for
every study: the mean age of the sample at the time of
testing, the mean age of the sample at the time of the

Of course, one cannot expect the samples to be representative in
terms of every possible characteristic (such as age, gender, or race). It
is enough if the samples are reasonably representative in terms of the
variables that are analyzed in the present study.

In a couple of cases, the study itself was based on a representative

measurement of success, and the year of the measurement of success. The moderator analyses are meaningful
only if every sample, included in a particular analysis, is
reasonably homogenous in terms of the moderator variables (i.e., all the individuals in the sample should be of
approximately the same age and studied at the same
time). To achieve that, I excluded a study from a moderator analysis if the range of the moderator variable in
question exceeded 10 years. It should be noted, however,
that the majority of the samples that provided data on
intelligence were rather homogenous in terms of all the
moderator variables because longitudinal surveys typically concentrate on a specific cohort. The moderator
analyses were conducted in two steps: first a more
conventional subgroup analysis and then a meta-regression analysis. The details of these analyses are
described in Sections 6.3 and 6.4.

5.6. Meta-analytic calculations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99670456">
In order to estimate the strength of the relationship
between predictors and success, three averages were
calculated: a simple average correlation, a sample size
weighted average correlation, and a sample size
weighted average correlation corrected for unreliability
and dichotomization in the correlated variables. The
latter constitutes the central meta-analytic result of the
present paper. Other averages can be used for comparison to see how much the results are affected by
weighting and correcting the original correlations.
Because the sample sizes were highly variable (from
60 to 339,951 with a median of 518), weighting the
correlations by sample size would allow the few very
large studies to overly dominate the results. To prevent
that, all the samples with the size over 7000 individuals
(about 5% of the samples in this study) were set equal to
7000 for the weighting procedure.
In order to estimate the variability of the correlations,
the standard deviation of original correlations and corrected standard deviation of corrected correlations (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 126) were calculated. The 95%
credibility intervals of sample size weighted corrected
correlations were calculated to assess the presence of
moderators. Moderators are present if the credibility
intervals are large (over 0.11 according to Koslowsky &amp;
Sagie, 1993) or include zero (see Whitener, 1990).
Finally, 95% confidence intervals of the sample size
weighted corrected correlations were calculated using

the formula for heterogeneous studies (Whitener, 1990:
317). Confidence intervals can be used to assess the
significance of the correlations (correlation is significantly different from zero if the confidence intervals do

not include zero) as well as to compare correlations
(according to a simple and conservative rule of thumb,
two correlations are significantly different from one
another if their confidence intervals do not intersect).

<bodyText confidence="0.982000916666667">
Data from 85 data sets (135 samples) were used in the
present meta-analysis; 49 data sets (65 samples) provided
information on the relationship between intelligence and
socioeconomic success. All the data sets used in this paper
are listed in the Appendix, detailed information on the
data is available at www.zone.ee/tstrenze/meta.xls. The
United States is the most important source of data: 36 data
sets containing information on intelligence and career
success originate from the U.S.A.; United Kingdom is
represented by 6 data sets, New Zealand by 2; Australia,
Estonia, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden are all
represented by one data set.8

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999511090909091">
Table 1 presents the general meta-analytic description
of the relationship between predictors and measures of
socioeconomic success. The table is divided into three
sections with every section presenting the results for one
measure of success. It can be observed that, for every
predictor, the correlation with education is the strongest
one and the correlation with income the weakest one.
The first row in every section of Table 1 presents the
general results for intelligence as a predictor of success.
The phrase “all studies” in parentheses indicates that all
the studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria are
included in these analyses. As expected, intelligence is
positively correlated with education, occupation, and
income; the sample size weighted and corrected correlations ( p) are .56, .43, and .20, respectively. The fact that
the 95% credibility intervals exceed 0.11 suggests the
presence of moderators according to Koslowsky and
Sagie (1993). Comparing the three averages (r, rw, and
p) in every row to one another demonstrates that
weighting the correlations by sample size tends to
reduce the average. This means that larger studies
produced smaller correlations indicating in turn that
smaller, and potentially less representative, samples

Note that these figures apply to the data sets that contain

were used to obtain correlations between parental SES and success or
between academic performance and success (see Appendix).

overestimate the correlation between intelligence and
success.
The results, just described, can be criticized for including several samples that are somewhat inappropriate for
studying the causal influence of intelligence on success. In
some studies, most of the individuals were already in their
early twenties at the time the IQ test was taken. It is possible
that many individuals in these samples had already started a
career by that time, which makes the direction of influence
between intelligence and career success rather ambiguous.
Furthermore, in several studies the individuals were still in
their twenties at the time their career success was measured.
It seems reasonable to assume, however, that individuals
under 30 cannot yet be reliably classified as more successful or less successful. Taking these observations into
account, the second row in every section of Table 1, containing the phrase “best studies” in parentheses, includes
only samples with the average age of less than 19 at testing
and over 29 at the measurement of success. If raw data were
used, then the individuals of inappropriate age were simply
excluded.
Looking at the “best studies”, we can observe the
corrected sample size weighted correlations of .56, .45,
and .23 between intelligence and education, occupation,
and income, respectively. These correlations can be treated
as the most appropriate estimates of the relationship
between intelligence and socioeconomic success. The
averages of the “best studies” are somewhat higher than
the averages of “all studies” indicating that the inclusion of
the less appropriate samples among the latter lowers the
meta-analytic results. It is surprising how much the
number of samples (k) included among the “best studies”
differs from the number of “all studies” — almost two
thirds of the correlations with education had to be
excluded for the analysis of the “best studies”. It shows
that much of the research on intelligence and success is
being conducted with samples that are either too old at the
time of testing or too young at the measurement of success.
Having characterized the predictive power of intelligence in general, the next step is to compare it to the
predictive power of parental SES and academic performance. Table 1 presents the meta-analytic results for the
five indicators of parental SES (father&amp;apos;s education,
mother&amp;apos;s education, father&amp;apos;s occupation, parental income,
and the SES index). Not surprisingly, all the correlations are
positive but, judging by the confidence intervals, several of
the correlations (e.g., the one between father&amp;apos;s education
and education, p = .50, or father&amp;apos;s occupation and occupation, p= .35) are significantly smaller than the respective
correlations for intelligence. On the other hand, none of the
parental variables is a significantly stronger predictor than
intelligence. The SES index is the most successful predictor

A reviewer suggested that a useful strategy for comparing the
predictive power of two variables would be to look at the samples that
provide information on both predictors and then make comparisons
within each sample. The advantage of such within-sample comparisons would be the elimination of between-study methodological
differences. I used this strategy to compare the correlations with
intelligence and SES index (arguably the best measure of social
background). The significance of the difference between the
correlations was tested with the formula for comparing dependent
correlations (Meng, Rosenthal, &amp; Rubin, 1992: 173). With education
as the measure of success, there were 15 samples that provided
correlations with both IQ and SES index; in 11 of these samples, the
correlations were significantly different (p b .05, 2-tailed); 8 of the
significant differences were in favor of IQ. With occupation as the
measure of success, 14 comparisons were made; 7 of the differences
were significant, all in favor of IQ. With income as the measure of
success, 12 comparisons were made; 5 were significant, 2 of them in
favor of IQ. These results suggest that there seems to be an overall
tendency for IQ to be a better predictor but this tendency is not
consistently found in every occasion.
The results for academic performance are presented
in the last rows of the three sections of Table 1. The
correlations of academic performance with education
(p = .53) and occupation ( p = .37) demonstrate that
academic performance is an important predictor of
educational and occupational success. The predictive
power in relation to income, however, is weak
(p = .09).
6.3. Moderator analysis using subgroups
As a first step in analyzing the influence of
moderator variables, the analysis of subgroups was
performed. The moderator variables were divided into
the following categories: age at testing into 1–10, 11–
15, 16–18, 19–25; age at success into 20–24, 25–29,
30–34, 35–39, 40–44, 45–49, and over 49; and the
year of success into pre-1960, 1960–1969, 1970–
1979, 1980–1989, post-1989. The raw data sets were
exploited to the full extent by dividing the samples into
appropriate subgroups by age or year. Every sample

contributed only one correlation to a moderator
category. If a sample could contribute more than one
correlation, then the most appropriate of the available
correlations (the one that best fitted into the moderator
category) was used. Equally appropriate correlations
were averaged.
Table 2 presents the results of the moderator
analysis. The table is divided into three sections with
every section presenting the results for one moderator
variable. In the first section of Table 2, age at testing
(i.e., mean age of the sample at the time of ability
testing) is used as a moderator variable. The
youngest sample in this analysis was, on average,
3 years old at the time of testing, the oldest one was
23 years old. The results of the analysis are quite
clear-cut with regard to education and occupation as
measures of success: the correlations increase as age
at testing increases. The correlation between intelligence and income does not exhibit any obvious trend
but even here the largest correlation comes from the
oldest group.
In the next section of Table 2, the moderator
variable is age at success (i.e., the mean age of the
sample at the time of the measurement of socioeconomic success). Age at success ranges from 20 to 78
in the present study. The results are rather different
for different measures of success. The correlation
between intelligence and education remains more or
less stable. The correlation between intelligence and
occupation takes a noticeable upward leap during the
twenties – from .35 in the 20–24 group to the .44 in
the 25–29 group – and then levels off. The
correlation between intelligence and income undergoes the most dramatic changes: the correlation is
barely above zero in the 20–24 group but jumps to
the value of .20 in the 25–29 group, and then takes
another jump to the value of .27 in the 30–34 group;
after the age of 40, the correlation appears to decline
again but not as low as the values it had before the
age of 30.
The influence of the third moderator variable, year of
success (i.e., year of the measurement of success), is
analyzed in the third section of Table 2. Year of success
ranges from 1929 to 2003 in the present meta-analysis.
Judging by the sample size weighted corrected correlations ( p), there appears to be no historical trend for any
one of the moderator variables: correlations with education and occupation remain more or less stable
throughout the period under study; correlations with
income fluctuate more but without any obvious
direction. Quite surprisingly, if unweighted and uncorrected correlations ( r) are observed instead, then the

Moderator analyses in the previous section can be
criticized for ignoring the fact that the moderator
variables might not be completely independent of each
other, which makes it possible to claim that some of
the results can be explained by the intercorrelations
among the moderator variables (Steel &amp; KammeyerMueller, 2002). In order to take account of this
possibility, I conducted multiple linear regression
analyses using the moderator variables as independent
variables and the correlations between intelligence and
measures of success as dependent variables. Such
meta-regression analysis is a common meta-analytic
tool (see Ganzeboom et al., 1989; Robbins et al.,
2004).
The analyses that follow differ from the preceding
moderator analyses in an important respect: in order to
use all the available information, I gave up the
requirement of independent data and included all the
available correlations. If mental ability or socioeconomic success was measured repeatedly for the same
sample, then all the correlations were included making
it possible for one sample to contribute more than one
correlation to the analysis.10 Naturally, this strategy
results in some samples providing much more correlations than others. In order to control for the effects of
overrepresented samples, I constructed dummy variables for all the data sets that contributed more than 2
correlations from the same sample to a given moderator
analysis. The dummy variables were inserted into
regression models as independent variables. In some
raw data sets that were large enough, the sample was
broken down into smaller samples. For example, the
National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women was
divided into three subsamples according to the age at
the start of the survey – the 14–17, 18–20, and 21–
24 year olds – and these subsamples were then used as
separate samples in the regression analyses. This was
done to obtain samples that are more homogenous in
In order to understand the necessity of this methodological
decision, consider the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. This
data set contains annual or biennial information on the career success
of its respondents for a period of more than 20 years, thus providing
an ideal opportunity to study age-related and historical changes in the
relationship between intelligence and career. All this information
would be lost, however, if only one correlation was allowed to
represent one sample.

effects of moderator variables.11
The results of the meta-regression analyses are
presented in Table 3. There are three dependent variables in the table: the uncorrected correlations of
intelligence with education, occupation, and income.12
The independent variables are the three moderator
variables (age at testing, age at success, and year of
study) and data set dummies. In order to provide a
rough control for possible international differences, I
also included a dummy variable that equals 1 if the
study was conducted in the United States. Furthermore, in order to control for possible methodological
differences that might arise from using raw data (see
Section 5.3), I constructed a dummy variable that
equals 1 if the correlation was calculated from raw
data. Following the suggestions made by Steel and
Kammeyer-Mueller (2002), weighted least squares
regression analysis was used: each correlation was
weighted by the inverse of its sampling error variance
as described in Steel and Kammeyer-Mueller (2002:
100–101).

It would make very little difference if corrected correlations
(rather than uncorrected ones) were used in these analyses because
almost all correlations would be corrected with the same reliability

The results of the meta-regression analysis in
Table 3 are not radically different from the results of
the previous moderator analysis in Table 2. The
moderating effect of age at testing is positive and
significant in all the three regression models. Age at
success has a positive effect on the correlations with
occupation and income and a weak negative effect of
the correlation with education. Year of success
provides some surprises by having a weak positive
effect of the correlation with education and a strong
negative effect on the correlation with occupation. It
is of interest that the U.S.A. dummy is not significant
in any of the regression models indicating that the
effect of IQ in the United States is similar to its effect
in other western societies. The raw data dummy has a
highly significant negative effect on the correlation
with education and a barely significant positive effect
on the correlation with occupation. Therefore, it
seems that the inclusion of raw data is more likely
to introduce a downward (rather than upward) bias
into the meta-analysis thus making the results
conservative.

7.1. Intelligence as a predictor of socioeconomic
success
Intelligence plays an influential and yet controversial role in people&amp;apos;s career (Gottfredson, 1997). In
order to investigate this role, the relationship between
intelligence and socioeconomic success was analyzed
using meta-analytic techniques. The first aim of the
paper was to estimate the strength of this relationship.
The overall correlations were .56 (between intelligence and education), .43 (between intelligence and
occupation), and .20 (between intelligence and
income). Exclusion of the samples that were too old
(over 18) at the time of testing or too young (below
30) at the measurement of success resulted in
somewhat larger correlations: .56, .45, and .23,
respectively. These results demonstrate that intelligence, when it is measured before most individuals
have finished their schooling, is a powerful predictor
of career success 12 or more years later when most
individuals have already entered stable careers. Two
of the correlations – with education and occupation –
are of substantial magnitude according to the usual
standards of social science (Cohen, 1988); the
correlation with education even surpasses the wellestablished correlation of .51 between intelligence and
job performance (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998). The
</bodyText>

correlation with income is considerably lower,
perhaps even disappointingly low, being about the
average of the previous meta-analytic estimates (.15
by Bowles et al., 2001; and .27 by Ng et al., 2005).
But it should be noted that other predictors, studied in
this paper, are not doing any better in predicting
income, which demonstrates that financial success is
difficult to predict by any variable. This claim is
further corroborated by the meta-analysis of Ng et al.
(2005) where the best predictor of salary was
educational level with a correlation of only .29. It
should also be noted that the correlation of .23 is
about the size of the average meta-analytic result in
psychology (Hemphill, 2003) and cannot, therefore,
be treated as insignificant.
The second aim of the meta-analysis was to
compare the predictive power of intelligence to the
predictive power of other prominent predictors of
success, parental SES and academic performance.
Such comparisons are informative because different
predictors represent different paths to a successful
career: intelligence represents one&amp;apos;s general ability,
parental SES represents the social advantages or
disadvantages experienced by a person, and academic
performance represents school-related learning and
motivation. Meta-analysis demonstrated that parental
SES and academic performance are indeed positively
related to career success but the predictive power of
these variables is not stronger than that of
intelligence (see Table 1). In fact, intelligence
exhibited several correlations with the measures of
success that were larger than the respective correlations for other predictors suggesting that intelligence
is, after all, a better predictor of success. Still, the
differences in favor of intelligence were not as
overwhelming as one would have expected based on
the results of Herrnstein and Murray (1994). The
index of parental SES, arguably the most representative measure of social background, did not differ
significantly from intelligence in its predictive power
(see Table 1). The same is true about the predictive
power of academic performance in relation to
education and occupation.
It has been observed before that meta-analyses
typically do not provide support for extreme scientific
positions (Lytton &amp; Romney, 1991). This is also true
in the present case because the extreme positions
favoring intelligence (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) or
parental SES (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976) were not
supported by the results. The reasonable conclusion is
rather modest: while intelligence is one of the central
determinants of one&amp;apos;s socioeconomic success, parental

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.993151222222222">
SES and academic performance also play an important
role in the process of status attainment. Despite the
modest conclusion, these results are important because
they falsify a claim often made by the critics of the
“testing movement”: that the positive relationship
between intelligence and success is just the effect of
parental SES or academic performance influencing
them both (see Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; Fischer et al.,
1996; McClelland, 1973). If the correlation between
intelligence and success was a mere byproduct of the
causal effect of parental SES or academic performance, then parental SES and academic performance
should have outcompeted intelligence as predictors of
success; but this was clearly not so. These results
confirm that intelligence is an independent causal
force among the determinants of success; in other
words, the fact that intelligent people are successful is
not completely explainable by the fact that intelligent
people have wealthy parents and are doing better at
school.
A number of moderator analyses of the intelligence–success correlation were also performed with
the aim of further clarifying the relationship between
intelligence and success. The effects of three moderator variables – age at testing, age at success, and year
of success – were analyzed. With regard to age at
testing, the results in Tables 2 and 3 clearly
demonstrate that the test scores of older individuals
are better predictors of success than the scores of
younger individuals. As discussed in Section 4.3.1,
there are two conflicting explanations for this result.
On the one hand, if we assume that the test scores of
older individuals are more “contaminated” by experiences, then this result suggests that experiences make
a contribution to the correlation between intelligence
and success. But on the other hand, if we assume that
the test scores of older individuals are more “contaminated” by genetic influences, then it would mean that
genes make a contribution to this correlation. Yet
another explanation would be that IQ scores of
children are simply less reliable and the predictive
validity of childhood IQ was, therefore, underestimated. But contrary to this explanation, preliminary
examination of some evidence on the stability of
intelligence among children (e.g., Burchinal, Campbell, Bryant, Wasik, &amp; Ramey, 1997; Jensen, 1980:
279) suggested that the test–retest coefficients among
children below 10 are, on the whole, rather similar to
the test–retest coefficients among older individuals. It
appears that the age-related changes in the predictive
validity of test scores cannot be explained by
differential reliability of the scores.
Analyses of age at success in Tables 2 and 3
demonstrate that correlations with occupation and
income grow stronger as individuals grow older. This
result confirms the ideas of the gravitational
hypothesis about intellectual differences cumulating
throughout life course leading people increasingly
towards the social positions that correspond to their
ability (Gottfredson, 2003). The fact that declining
validity hypothesis (Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001) received
no support for occupational and income attainment
indicates that being successful in these areas is a
complex activity that never ceases to be cognitively
demanding. But as for educational attainment, the
negative impact of age at success on the IQeducation correlation in Table 3 provides some
support for the declining validity hypothesis and
suggests that, in educational career, intellectual
differences might indeed become somewhat less
important as people get older. The difference
between education and other measures of success
can be explained by the fact that climbing the
educational ladder is, in a sense, easier than climbing
the occupational or financial ladder (because once
you have acquired a certain level of education, you
can never loose it again, which is clearly not the
case with occupation or income).
Year of the measurement of success had no
obvious effect on the corrected correlations ( p)
between intelligence and success in Table 2. The
meta-regression analysis in Table 3 showed that there
is a slight tendency for correlation between intelligence and education to increase over the years. This
is the only bit of evidence there is to support the
claims of Herrnstein and Murray (1994) about the
growing importance of mental ability and increasing
cognitive stratification. This evidence is rather weak
in comparison with the much stronger declining trend
exhibited by the correlation with occupation in
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.80976">
Table 3. It would be difficult to come up with

<bodyText confidence="0.98375975">
explanations why intelligence might have become
more important with respect to one criterion and less
important with respect to another. Therefore, the
safest conclusion from Tables 2 and 3 seems to be
that the correlation between intelligence and success
has not changed in any consistent direction over the
past decades. It should be noted that the present
paper analyzed changes in the absolute importance
of intelligence (measured by zero-order correlations);
the results so far discussed do not exclude the
possibility of growing relative importance of intelligence (i.e., importance relative to other predictors).
However, the analyses of Bowles et al. (2001) and
T. Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426
Hauser and Huang (1997) found no evidence of any
trend in the relative importance.
7.2. Possible limitations and implications for future
research
Like all research, the present meta-analysis
contains several limitations that can be amended in
future research. One limitation concerns the metaanalytic database. Although the present meta-analysis
is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive review
of the longitudinal research on intelligence and
socioeconomic success, it does not cover all the
existing data. I am aware of several additional
longitudinal data sets that contain information on
intelligence and success but from which I have been
unable to obtain necessary data (see Jæger &amp; Holm,
2003; Meghir &amp; Palme, 2005; Nyborg &amp; Jensen,
2001; Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1994). There are probably
others. Efforts to collect information about the
existing data sets should be continued. This applies
especially to the data from outside the United States
because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in
the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data
from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France)
demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct
is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has
not been very enthusiastically accepted in other
scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been
studied in continental Europe (see e.g., Flynn, 1987;
Sternberg, 2004; Weinert &amp; Schneider, 1999) but I
have not been able to find suitable data for the
present study.
The present study can also be criticized for
underestimating the importance of the predictors of
success; arguments can be offered for any of the three
predictors (intelligence, parental SES, or academic
performance) as to why their importance was underestimated. First, the present study used only three
measures of social background (parental education,
occupation, and income) and therefore, could have
underestimated its importance. Although these three
have always been the central indicators of social
advantages, several additional measures of social
background could have an independent effect on
career success (Fischer et al., 1996). Future metaanalyses could, therefore, benefit from considering
other variables, such as neighborhood quality
(Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000), number of
siblings (Blake, 1989), or parental divorce (Amato
&amp; Keith, 1991), to get a more comprehensive picture
of the effects of social background. Second, the use
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993639">
417
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999441958333334">
of grade point average and class rank as the only
measures of academic performance can be criticized
for ignoring between-school differences; i.e., the same
average grade or rank can have different meanings in
different schools depending on the quality of the
schools (Bassiri &amp; Schulz, 2003). A more comprehensive study of the importance of academic
performance should, therefore, also take account of
the quality of the school the individual is attending.
Third, as already discussed in Section 7.1, the
predictive power of intelligence in younger samples
could have been underestimated by using a single
test–retest reliability coefficient for all studies that
did not provide reliability coefficients of their own.
Although it was concluded above that the underestimation was minimal, it would still be desirable to
pay more attention to this problem in the future
research.
As a possible limitation and implication for future
research, it should also be noted that one of the big
questions that looms behind every paper that deals
with intelligence and success, the question of genetic
versus environmental influences on IQ and social
status, was not directly addressed in this paper. The
fact that IQ scores predict socioeconomic success
does not, in itself, tell us whether the effect of
intelligence can be attributed to genes or environment. On the one hand, there is clear evidence that
children&amp;apos;s IQ scores are correlated with parental SES
(White, 1982), this result together with the fact that
parental SES predicts socioeconomic success (see
Table 1) can be interpreted as showing that environment is the “final cause” of one&amp;apos;s success or
failure. This conclusion has been criticized for
ignoring the genetic influences on parental SES
(Jensen, 1998). On the other hand, the evidence on
the heritability of intelligence (Devlin, Daniels, &amp;
Roeder, 1997) and socioeconomic success (Rowe,
Vesterdal, &amp; Rodgers, 1999) together with the
evidence on the relationship between intelligence
and success (see Table 1) can be taken as proof that
parents&amp;apos; and children&amp;apos;s social status are both
determined by the genes for intelligence that run in
the family. This conclusion has been challenged by
Bowles and Gintis (2002) who argued that,
although socioeconomic success might be heritable,
the genetic inheritance of IQ, in particular, plays
only a very minor part in this process. The results
of the present meta-analysis, although not directly
addressing these issues, can be useful in these
discussions if combined with the results from other
studies.

If possible, the official title of the data set is given; if no official title was reported, the location or the name of the principal author is used to identify the data set.
For several data sets, data were obtained from different sources; all the sources that provided correlations are listed in the Appendix. For every raw data set, a web site address is given where further
information about the data is available.
c
In several data sets, more than one test was used. The tests that were combined into a single measure of intelligence are separated by a plus sign (+); the tests that were administered to different portions
of the sample are separated by a comma (,); the tests that were administered in different waves of the longitudinal survey are separated by a semicolon (;).
d
The uncorrected correlations used in the analysis all studies (see Table 1) are reported in the Appendix. All the correlations reported in the Appendix (or anywhere in the text) were rounded to two
decimal places; if more precise values were available, then these values were used in the calculations.

This reasoning has been used to support the idea that intellectual differences cumulate over life course and become progressively more important (see Gottfredson, 2003; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996). Other researchers have suggested that exactly the opposite is true: the predictive validity of IQ scores should decline as time goes by because less able people have time to accumulate skills to compensate for their initial lack of ability (Ackerman, 1987; Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001). These opposing views can be reconciled by saying that the idea of declining importance of IQ applies to the performance of specific tasks that become automatic after some practice and the idea of growing importance applies complex long term activities, such as attaining and maintaining social status, that never cease to be cognitively demanding. But so far as socioeconomic success can depend on the performance of specific work tasks, the possibility of declining validity of IQ is not completely ruled out.

First, the present study used only three measures of social background (parental education, occupation, and income) and therefore, could have underestimated its importance. Although these three have always been the central indicators of social advantages, several additional measures of social background could have an independent effect on career success (Fischer et al., 1996). Future metaanalyses could, therefore, benefit from considering other variables, such as neighborhood quality (Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000), number of siblings (Blake, 1989), or parental divorce (Amato &amp; Keith, 1991), to get a more comprehensive picture of the effects of social background. Second, the use 417 of grade point average and class rank as the only measures of academic performance can be criticized for ignoring between-school differences; i.e., the same average grade or rank can have different meanings in different schools depending on the quality of the schools (Bassiri &amp; Schulz, 2003). A more comprehensive study of the importance of academic performance should, therefore, also take account of the quality of the school the individual is attending.

If we take the traditional threefold distinction between ability, aptitude, and achievement tests (Jensen, 1981), then the present study should use only ability and aptitude test scores. Although some researchers have contended that achievement tests can also be treated as measures of general ability (Boudreau, Boswell, Judge, &amp; Bretz, 2001), and even everyday life can be interpreted as an IQ test (Gordon, 1997), the present study took a more conservative approach and included only those tests that are generally regarded as tests of intelligence (see e.g., Anastasi &amp; Urbina, 1997; Jensen, 1980, chapter 7, for a discussion and classification of different tests). There are numerous “classical” tests (e.g., Henmon– Nelson, Lorge–Thorndike, Otis–Lennon, Raven Progressive Matrices, Stanford–Binet, Wechsler tests) for which there seems to be a general consensus that these are indeed tests of general mental ability. Such multiple aptitude test batteries as Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery or General Aptitude Test Battery are also often treated as measures of general ability. The most problematic ones are the tests that are specifically constructed for use in a sing</context>

The present paper will address these questions by conducting a meta-analysis of the longitudinal research on the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. I will concentrate on longitudinal studies (where intelligence is measured before the actual success) because only longitudinal research design allows us to make conclusions about the possible causal impact of intelligence on success. 2. A brief history Longitudinal studies on the relationship between intelligence and career success have been conducted since the first decades of the 20th century (Ball, 1938; Thorndike et al., 1934). And these studies have invariably uncovered a positive relationship. The early studies, however, did not consider other possible determinants of success, most importantly parental SES. Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that</context>

One of the central and personally most relevant desirable outcomes is socioeconomic success (or career success), which is usually measured by the educational level, occupational prestige, and income of an individual in adulthood. Although it is sometimes claimed in popular press and textbooks that intelligence has no relationship to important real-life outcomes (see Barrett &amp; Depinet, 1991, for a review of such claims), the scientific research on the topic leaves little doubt that people with higher scores on IQ tests are better educated, hold more prestigious occupations, and earn higher incomes than people with lower scores (Gottfredson, 1997, 2003; Jensen, 1980, 1998; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Thus, the existence of an overall positive correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success is beyond doubt. But quite surprisingly, the mere existence of this correlation seems to be the only fact that is established beyond doubt after many decades of research. Several major </context>

A more comprehensive study of the importance of academic performance should, therefore, also take account of the quality of the school the individual is attending. Third, as already discussed in Section 7.1, the predictive power of intelligence in younger samples could have been underestimated by using a single test–retest reliability coefficient for all studies that did not provide reliability coefficients of their own. Although it was concluded above that the underestimation was minimal, it would still be desirable to pay more attention to this problem in the future research. As a possible</context>

The third source of information on parental SES is objective data (e.g., tax records of income) that was assumed to have a reliability of 1. Internal consistency method (Cronbach alpha) was used to correct for unreliability in the SES index. This method was recommended by Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 438) for composite variables.

First, the present study used only three measures of social background (parental education, occupation, and income) and therefore, could have underestimated its importance. Although these three have always been the central indicators of social advantages, several additional measures of social background could have an independent effect on career success (Fischer et al., 1996). Future metaanalyses could, therefore, benefit from considering other variables, such as neighborhood quality (Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000), number of siblings (Blake, 1989), or parental divorce (Amato &amp; Keith, 1991), to get a more comprehensive picture of the effects of social background.

While some researchers have said that this correlation is “larger than most found in psychological research” (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004: 162), others are convinced that “IQ is just not an important enough determinant of economic success” (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 2002: 12). Second, how does the predictive power of intelligence compare to the predictive power of other variables, such as parental socioeconomic status (SES) or school grades? On the one hand there are studies showing that “individual ability is by far the strongest influence on occupational achievement” (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999: 217). And yet other studies conclude that “the effect of socioeconomic background on each of the three adult status variables – schooling, income, and occupational status – is greater than the effect of childhood IQ” (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974: 44). Third, are there any age-related or historical changes in the relationship between intelligence and success? The question of historical changes in the importance of IQ has been particularly controversial with some authors warning against increasing cognitive stratification (Herrnstein T. Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426 &amp; Murray, 1994) and ot</context>

Other researchers have, however, supported the ideas of The Bell Curve (Gottfredson, 2003; Jensen, 1998) saying that its central claims have been convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459). 403 At the same time in Great Britain, a similar discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who, analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from Great Britain, found that intelligence is a better predictor of occupational attainment than is parental SES and concluded that England is, to a large extent, a meritocratic society (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999; Saunders, 1997, 2002). These conclusions were challenged by Breen and Goldthorpe (1999, 2001) who argued that Saunders greatly overestimated the importance of intelligence by using inappropriate analytic techniques. 3. Previous reviews There have been surprisingly few attempts to systematically review the literature on intelligence and socioeconomic success. Reviewers typically cite only a couple of studies (see e.g., Brody, 1997; Farkas, 2003; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Some of the most comprehensive reviews have been conducted by Jencks (see Jencks et al., 1972, 1979). Two meta-analyses have</context>

The definitions of intelligence state that it is an abstract ability that is not tied to any specific domain of knowledge. Therefore, only the tests that are designed to measure such ability should be used in the meta-analysis. If we take the traditional threefold distinction between ability, aptitude, and achievement tests (Jensen, 1981), then the present study should use only ability and aptitude test scores. Although some researchers have contended that achievement tests can also be treated as measures of general ability (Boudreau, Boswell, Judge, &amp; Bretz, 2001), and even everyday life can be interpreted as an IQ test (Gordon, 1997), the present study took a more conservative approach and included only those tests that are generally regarded as tests of intelligence (see e.g., Anastasi &amp; Urbina, 1997; Jensen, 1980, chapter 7, for a discussion and classification of different tests). There are numerous “classical” tests (e.g., Henmon– Nelson, Lorge–Thorndike, Otis–Lennon, Raven Progressive Matrices, Stanford–Binet, Wechsler tests) for which there seems to be a general consensus that these are indeed tests of general mental ability.

The second and by far the most common source is self-report. Self-reports are not perfectly reliable, however. The amount of error is usually measured by asking the same individuals to report their socioeconomic characteristics again after a few months and then correlating the first and second reports (producing a test–retest T. Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426 correlation). Several estimates of these correlations, derived from nationally representative samples, are available. Using the data presented by Bowles (1972) and Jencks et al. (1979), I calculated the average test– retest correlations for educational level (.89), occupational status (.88), and income (.83). These values were used to correct the correlations with self-reported socioeconomic success.

Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that considered several determinants of success at the same time (Duncan, 1968; Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp; Ohlendorf, 1970). But it was with the publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the question of intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to public attention. Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray f</context>

The index of parental SES, arguably the most representative measure of social background, did not differ significantly from intelligence in its predictive power (see Table 1). The same is true about the predictive power of academic performance in relation to education and occupation. It has been observed before that meta-analyses typically do not provide support for extreme scientific positions (Lytton &amp; Romney, 1991). This is also true in the present case because the extreme positions favoring intelligence (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) or parental SES (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976) were not supported by the results. The reasonable conclusion is rather modest: while intelligence is one of the central determinants of one&amp;apos;s socioeconomic success, parental 416 T. Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426 SES and academic performance also play an important role in the process of status attainment. Despite the modest conclusion, these results are important because they falsify a claim often made by the critics of the “testing movement”: that the positive relationship between intelligence and success is just the effect of parental SES or academic performance influencing them bo</context>

This conclusion has been criticized for ignoring the genetic influences on parental SES (Jensen, 1998). On the other hand, the evidence on the heritability of intelligence (Devlin, Daniels, &amp; Roeder, 1997) and socioeconomic success (Rowe, Vesterdal, &amp; Rodgers, 1999) together with the evidence on the relationship between intelligence and success (see Table 1) can be taken as proof that parents&amp;apos; and children&amp;apos;s social status are both determined by the genes for intelligence that run in the family. This conclusion has been challenged by Bowles and Gintis (2002) who argued that, although socioeconomic success might be heritable, the genetic inheritance of IQ, in particular, plays only a very minor part in this process. The results of the present meta-analysis, although not directly addressing these issues, can be useful in these discussions if combined with the results from other studies. 418 Appendix A Data sets used in the meta-analysis Country Source (s) b Test (s) c Correlationd between IQ and Data on Education Occupation Income SESe GPAf Albany– Schenectady– Troy sample Annual Twins Day sample Australian sample, 1965 Australian sample, 1967 Aust</context>

First, what is the approximate size of the correlation between intelligence and success? Is it large enough to be of any practical importance? While some researchers have said that this correlation is “larger than most found in psychological research” (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004: 162), others are convinced that “IQ is just not an important enough determinant of economic success” (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 2002: 12). Second, how does the predictive power of intelligence compare to the predictive power of other variables, such as parental socioeconomic status (SES) or school grades? On the one hand there are studies showing that “individual ability is by far the strongest influence on occupational achievement” (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999: 217). And yet other studies conclude that “the effect of socioeconomic background on each of the three adult status variables – schooling, income, and occupational status – is greater than the effect of childhood IQ” (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974: 44).

This is a question about the nature of the society we live in: whether a typical western society rewards people for their own abilities or their social background (Saunders, 1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a definite answer to this question. Some authors have found that intelligence outcompetes parental SES as a predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998; Saunders, 1997). Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a better predictor (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important aspects of parental status (most importantly, parental income) among the predictors (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation between intelligence and success with the correlation between parental SES and success. To accomplish that, the present paper will include a meta-analysis of the relati</context>

Some of the most comprehensive reviews have been conducted by Jencks (see Jencks et al., 1972, 1979). Two meta-analyses have so far addressed the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. Both of them used income as a measure of success. The more comprehensive one of the two was conducted by Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001). They assembled 65 estimates from 24 studies to estimate the relationship between intelligence and income. The mean standardized regression coefficient of intelligence on income is .15 according to their study (p. 1154). In addition to that, Bowles et al. (2001) reported that there is no time trend in the size of the coefficients between the years 1960 and 1995 and that the age of the sample at the time of ability testing has no effect on the results. The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. is a valuable contribution but it suffers from several shortcomings. First, it considered only one measure of success, income, thereby ignoring education and occupation. Second, the meta-analytic estimate of .15 was not derived from zero-order correlations as is usually required by the textbooks of meta-analysis (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 475) but from regression equ</context>

This cannot be the only aim of the present meta-analysis because very few social scientists would doubt that there is a positive correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success. Having acknowledged that, the next logical question is: what is the approximate size of the correlation? Answers to this question are far from uniform. Take the correlation between intelligence and income: Jensen has suggested that it is somewhere around .40 (Jensen, 1998: 568) while Bowles et al. (2001) have found that it is only about .15. That is why the first aim of the present meta-analysis is to estimate the approximate sizes of the correlations between intelligence and measures of success. The importance of the correlations can be evaluated using Cohen&amp;apos;s classification scheme which classifies correlations as small if they are below .30, medium-sized if they are between .30 and .50, and large if they are over .50 (Cohen, 1988). Knowing the size of the correlation between intelligence and career success would allow us to compare it to other, well-established, correlations in the social s</context>

A study by McCall (1977) found a clear upward trend in the correlations between intelligence and success; that is, correlations grew stronger as age at testing increased. Some of the studies reviewed by Jencks and Phillips (1999) have found a similar trend. The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. (2001), however, found that age at testing has no effect on the association between intelligence and income. Jencks et al. (1979) reached a similar conclusion in their review. 1 Ganzeboom et al. (1989) analyzed social mobility tables, Mulligan (1999) analyzed bivariate unstandardized regression coefficients; for this paper, however, bivariate standardized regression coefficients (i.e., correlations) are needed. 2 I am grateful to a reviewer for pointing this interpretation out to me. 406 T.

Several studies have investigated changes in the association between intelligence and success during past decades. Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded that “the main point seems beyond dispute” (1994: 52) and some studies have found support for this point (Murnane, Willett, &amp; Levy, 1995), there are still serious reasons to doubt that the importance of intelligence is or has been growing. Neither the meta-analysis by Bowles et al. (2001) nor the review by Jencks et al. (1979) found any clear trend in the correlations between intelligence and success. The same conclusion was reached by Flynn (2004) and Hauser and Huang (1997). Breen and Goldthorpe (2001) found that the association between intelligence and occupational status in England is, if anything, declining. 5. Method 5.1.

Two of the correlations – with education and occupation – are of substantial magnitude according to the usual standards of social science (Cohen, 1988); the correlation with education even surpasses the wellestablished correlation of .51 between intelligence and job performance (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998). The 415 correlation with income is considerably lower, perhaps even disappointingly low, being about the average of the previous meta-analytic estimates (.15 by Bowles et al., 2001; and .27 by Ng et al., 2005). But it should be noted that other predictors, studied in this paper, are not doing any better in predicting income, which demonstrates that financial success is difficult to predict by any variable. This claim is further corroborated by the meta-analysis of Ng et al. (2005) where the best predictor of salary was educational level with a correlation of only .29. It should also be noted that the correlation of .23 is about the size of the average meta-analytic result in psychology (Hemphill, 2003) and cannot, therefore, be treated as insignificant.

Therefore, the safest conclusion from Tables 2 and 3 seems to be that the correlation between intelligence and success has not changed in any consistent direction over the past decades. It should be noted that the present paper analyzed changes in the absolute importance of intelligence (measured by zero-order correlations); the results so far discussed do not exclude the possibility of growing relative importance of intelligence (i.e., importance relative to other predictors). However, the analyses of Bowles et al. (2001) and T. Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426 Hauser and Huang (1997) found no evidence of any trend in the relative importance. 7.2. Possible limitations and implications for future research Like all research, the present meta-analysis contains several limitations that can be amended in future research.

But on the other hand, if we assume that the test scores of older individuals are more “contaminated” by genetic influences, then it would mean that genes make a contribution to this correlation. Yet another explanation would be that IQ scores of children are simply less reliable and the predictive validity of childhood IQ was, therefore, underestimated. But contrary to this explanation, preliminary examination of some evidence on the stability of intelligence among children (e.g., Burchinal, Campbell, Bryant, Wasik, &amp; Ramey, 1997; Jensen, 1980: 279) suggested that the test–retest coefficients among children below 10 are, on the whole, rather similar to the test–retest coefficients among older individuals. It appears that the age-related changes in the predictive validity of test scores cannot be explained by differential reliability of the scores. Analyses of age at success in Tables 2 and 3 demonstrate that correlations with occupation and income grow stronger as individuals grow older.

Take the correlation between intelligence and income: Jensen has suggested that it is somewhere around .40 (Jensen, 1998: 568) while Bowles et al. (2001) have found that it is only about .15. That is why the first aim of the present meta-analysis is to estimate the approximate sizes of the correlations between intelligence and measures of success. The importance of the correlations can be evaluated using Cohen&amp;apos;s classification scheme which classifies correlations as small if they are below .30, medium-sized if they are between .30 and .50, and large if they are over .50 (Cohen, 1988). Knowing the size of the correlation between intelligence and career success would allow us to compare it to other, well-established, correlations in the social scientific literature; e.g., the correlation of .51 between intelligence and job performance (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998). 4.2. Intelligence and other predictors of success It is difficult to evaluate the importance of a predictor in isolation; it would be informative to compare the predictive power of intelligence to the predictive power of other relevant predictors of socioeconomic success. This paper will, therefore, analyze two additi</context>

Exclusion of the samples that were too old (over 18) at the time of testing or too young (below 30) at the measurement of success resulted in somewhat larger correlations: .56, .45, and .23, respectively. These results demonstrate that intelligence, when it is measured before most individuals have finished their schooling, is a powerful predictor of career success 12 or more years later when most individuals have already entered stable careers. Two of the correlations – with education and occupation – are of substantial magnitude according to the usual standards of social science (Cohen, 1988); the correlation with education even surpasses the wellestablished correlation of .51 between intelligence and job performance (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998). The 415 correlation with income is considerably lower, perhaps even disappointingly low, being about the average of the previous meta-analytic estimates (.15 by Bowles et al., 2001; and .27 by Ng et al., 2005). But it should be noted that other predictors, studied in this paper, are not doing any better in predicting income, which demonstrates that financial success is difficult to predict by any variable.

But so far as socioeconomic success can depend on the performance of specific work tasks, the possibility of declining validity of IQ is not completely ruled out. Several studies have correlated intelligence with success at different points in people&amp;apos;s life course. Some of them have found that the correlations indeed increase with age as predicted by the gravitational hypothesis (Brown &amp; Reynolds, 1975; Deary et al., 2005; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996), others have found no clear trend (Hauser, Warren, Huang, &amp; Carter, 1996; Warren, Sheridan, &amp; Hauser, 2002). The reviews by Hulin, Henry, and Noon (1990) and Keil and Cortina (2001) found support for the declining validity thesis but it should be noted that many of the studies reviewed in these papers used specific laboratory tasks as dependent variables and are, therefore, not directly comparable to the studies reviewed in the present paper. 4.3.3.

On the one hand, there is clear evidence that children&amp;apos;s IQ scores are correlated with parental SES (White, 1982), this result together with the fact that parental SES predicts socioeconomic success (see Table 1) can be interpreted as showing that environment is the “final cause” of one&amp;apos;s success or failure. This conclusion has been criticized for ignoring the genetic influences on parental SES (Jensen, 1998). On the other hand, the evidence on the heritability of intelligence (Devlin, Daniels, &amp; Roeder, 1997) and socioeconomic success (Rowe, Vesterdal, &amp; Rodgers, 1999) together with the evidence on the relationship between intelligence and success (see Table 1) can be taken as proof that parents&amp;apos; and children&amp;apos;s social status are both determined by the genes for intelligence that run in the family. This conclusion has been challenged by Bowles and Gintis (2002) who argued that, although socioeconomic success might be heritable, the genetic inheritance of IQ, in particular, plays only a very minor part in this process.

It is, therefore, appropriate to limit the current meta-analysis to representative studies and exclude the studies that exhibit signs of considerable range restriction.6 More specifically, I excluded the studies that sampled only (a) college students or individuals with a college degree (e.g., Eckland, 1965), (b) employees of a single organization (e.g., Dreher &amp; Bretz, 1991), or (c) representatives of one specific occupational group (such as engineers or managers; see e.g., Sackett, Gruys, &amp; Ellingson, 1998).7 These criteria exclude much of the personnel selection research, which is the kind of research where the problem of range restriction is particularly serious (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004). I also excluded the correlation if the range of one (or both) of the correlated variables was deliberately restricted by the research design. For example, in the study of gifted children by Terman and Oden (1947), the range of intelligence was severely restricted by sampli</context>

The early studies, however, did not consider other possible determinants of success, most importantly parental SES. Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that considered several determinants of success at the same time (Duncan, 1968; Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp; Ohlendorf, 1970). But it was with the publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the question of intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to public attention. Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray found that intelligence is a better predictor of several desirable outcomes (e.g., not living in poverty, not being arrested) than is parental SES. They also found evidence that the role of intelligence in status attainment has been growing throughout the 20th centur</context>

It is important, however, that the information about father&amp;apos;s occupation or parental income obtained from adult respondents refers to parents&amp;apos; past (not current) occupation or income. The latter requirement was not applied to parental education because parents&amp;apos; education is unlikely to change while children grow up.

This strategy was preferred because most of the studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria (see Section 5.2) were based on samples that were fairly representative of the general population and did not require the correction for range restriction. It is, therefore, appropriate to limit the current meta-analysis to representative studies and exclude the studies that exhibit signs of considerable range restriction.6 More specifically, I excluded the studies that sampled only (a) college students or individuals with a college degree (e.g., Eckland, 1965), (b) employees of a single organization (e.g., Dreher &amp; Bretz, 1991), or (c) representatives of one specific occupational group (such as engineers or managers; see e.g., Sackett, Gruys, &amp; Ellingson, 1998).7 These criteria exclude much of the personnel selection research, which is the kind of research where the problem of range restriction is particularly serious (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004).

These conclusions were challenged by Breen and Goldthorpe (1999, 2001) who argued that Saunders greatly overestimated the importance of intelligence by using inappropriate analytic techniques. 3. Previous reviews There have been surprisingly few attempts to systematically review the literature on intelligence and socioeconomic success. Reviewers typically cite only a couple of studies (see e.g., Brody, 1997; Farkas, 2003; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Some of the most comprehensive reviews have been conducted by Jencks (see Jencks et al., 1972, 1979). Two meta-analyses have so far addressed the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. Both of them used income as a measure of success. The more comprehensive one of the two was conducted by Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001). They assembled 65 estimates from 24 studies to estimate the relationship between intelligence and income. The mean standardized regression coefficient of intelligence on income is .15 according to their study (p. 1154). In ad</context>

First, what is the approximate size of the correlation between intelligence and success? Is it large enough to be of any practical importance? While some researchers have said that this correlation is “larger than most found in psychological research” (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004: 162), others are convinced that “IQ is just not an important enough determinant of economic success” (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 2002: 12).

Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray found that intelligence is a better predictor of several desirable outcomes (e.g., not living in poverty, not being arrested) than is parental SES. They also found evidence that the role of intelligence in status attainment has been growing throughout the 20th century and concluded that the social structure of American society is increasingly based on mental ability. The ideas of The Bell Curve have been severely criticized for a number of reasons. Fischer et al. (1996) argued that Herrnstein and Murray used an inappropriate measure of parental SES and, therefore, underestimated its importance. Hauser and Huang (1997) argued that the claim about the growing importance of intelligence is simply a misinterpretation of previous research. Other researchers have, however, supported the ideas of The Bell Curve (Gottfredson, 2003; Jensen, 1998) saying that its central claims have been convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459). 403 At the same time in Great Britain, a similar discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who, analyzing a representative longitudin</context>

This is a question about the nature of the society we live in: whether a typical western society rewards people for their own abilities or their social background (Saunders, 1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a definite answer to this question. Some authors have found that intelligence outcompetes parental SES as a predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998; Saunders, 1997). Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a better predictor (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important aspects of parental status (most importantly, parental income) among the predictors (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation between intelligence and success with the correlation between parental SES and success. To accomplish that, the present paper will include a meta-analysis of the relationship between the diff</context>

The reasonable conclusion is rather modest: while intelligence is one of the central determinants of one&amp;apos;s socioeconomic success, parental 416 T. Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426 SES and academic performance also play an important role in the process of status attainment. Despite the modest conclusion, these results are important because they falsify a claim often made by the critics of the “testing movement”: that the positive relationship between intelligence and success is just the effect of parental SES or academic performance influencing them both (see Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; Fischer et al., 1996; McClelland, 1973). If the correlation between intelligence and success was a mere byproduct of the causal effect of parental SES or academic performance, then parental SES and academic performance should have outcompeted intelligence as predictors of success; but this was clearly not so. These results confirm that intelligence is an independent causal force among the determinants of success; in other words, the fact that intelligent people are successful is not completely explainable by the fact that intelligent people have wealthy parents and are doing better at school.

First, the present study used only three measures of social background (parental education, occupation, and income) and therefore, could have underestimated its importance. Although these three have always been the central indicators of social advantages, several additional measures of social background could have an independent effect on career success (Fischer et al., 1996). Future metaanalyses could, therefore, benefit from considering other variables, such as neighborhood quality (Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000), number of siblings (Blake, 1989), or parental divorce (Amato &amp; Keith, 1991), to get a more comprehensive picture of the effects of social background. Second, the use 417 of grade point average and class rank as the only measures of academic performance can be criticized for ignoring between-school differences; i.e., the same average grade or rank can have different meanings in different schools depending on the quality of the schools (Bassiri &amp; Schulz,</context>

Efforts to collect information about the existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been studied in continental Europe (see e.g., Flynn, 1987; Sternberg, 2004; Weinert &amp; Schneider, 1999) but I have not been able to find suitable data for the present study.

Several studies have investigated changes in the association between intelligence and success during past decades. Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded that “the main point seems beyond dispute” (1994: 52) and some studies have found support for this point (Murnane, Willett, &amp; Levy, 1995), there are still serious reasons to doubt that the importance of intelligence is or has been growing. Neither the meta-analysis by Bowles et al. (2001) nor the review by Jencks et al. (1979) found any clear trend in the correlations between intelligence and success. The same conclusion was reached by Flynn (2004) and Hauser and Huang (1997). Breen and Goldthorpe (2001) found that the association between intelligence and occupational status in England is, if anything, declining. 5. Method 5.1. Definition of variables The present meta-analysis investigated the relationship between three measures of socioeconomic success (educational level, occupational level, and income) and three predictors (intelligence, parental SES, and academic performance).

Therefore, only the tests that are designed to measure such ability should be used in the meta-analysis. If we take the traditional threefold distinction between ability, aptitude, and achievement tests (Jensen, 1981), then the present study should use only ability and aptitude test scores. Although some researchers have contended that achievement tests can also be treated as measures of general ability (Boudreau, Boswell, Judge, &amp; Bretz, 2001), and even everyday life can be interpreted as an IQ test (Gordon, 1997), the present study took a more conservative approach and included only those tests that are generally regarded as tests of intelligence (see e.g., Anastasi &amp; Urbina, 1997; Jensen, 1980, chapter 7, for a discussion and classification of different tests). There are numerous “classical” tests (e.g., Henmon– Nelson, Lorge–Thorndike, Otis–Lennon, Raven Progressive Matrices, Stanford–Binet, Wechsler tests) for which there seems to be a general consensus that these are indeed tests of general mental ability.

Although it is sometimes claimed in popular press and textbooks that intelligence has no relationship to important real-life outcomes (see Barrett &amp; Depinet, 1991, for a review of such claims), the scientific research on the topic leaves little doubt that people with higher scores on IQ tests are better educated, hold more prestigious occupations, and earn higher incomes than people with lower scores (Gottfredson, 1997, 2003; Jensen, 1980, 1998; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Thus, the existence of an overall positive correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success is beyond doubt. But quite surprisingly, the mere existence of this correlation seems to be the only fact that is established beyond doubt after many decades of research.

The raw data dummy has a highly significant negative effect on the correlation with education and a barely significant positive effect on the correlation with occupation. Therefore, it seems that the inclusion of raw data is more likely to introduce a downward (rather than upward) bias into the meta-analysis thus making the results conservative. 7. Discussion 7.1. Intelligence as a predictor of socioeconomic success Intelligence plays an influential and yet controversial role in people&amp;apos;s career (Gottfredson, 1997). In order to investigate this role, the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success was analyzed using meta-analytic techniques. The first aim of the paper was to estimate the strength of this relationship. The overall correlations were .56 (between intelligence and education), .43 (between intelligence and occupation), and .20 (between intelligence and income). Exclusion of the samples that were too old (over 18) at the time of testing or too young (below 30) at the measurement of success resulted in somewhat larger correlations: .56, .45, and .23, respectively.

The ideas of The Bell Curve have been severely criticized for a number of reasons. Fischer et al. (1996) argued that Herrnstein and Murray used an inappropriate measure of parental SES and, therefore, underestimated its importance. Hauser and Huang (1997) argued that the claim about the growing importance of intelligence is simply a misinterpretation of previous research. Other researchers have, however, supported the ideas of The Bell Curve (Gottfredson, 2003; Jensen, 1998) saying that its central claims have been convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459). 403 At the same time in Great Britain, a similar discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who, analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from Great Britain, found that intelligence is a better predictor of occupational attainment than is parental SES and concluded that England is, to a large extent, a meritocratic society (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999; Saunders, 1997, 2002). These conclusions were challenged by Breen and Goldthorpe (1999, 2001) who argued that Saunders greatly overestima</context>

According to the so-called gravitational hypothesis, the correlation between intelligence and success should grow stronger as individuals grow older because (as a result of selfselection and competition) individuals “gravitate” towards the positions that correspond to their ability levels as they progress in their careers. This reasoning has been used to support the idea that intellectual differences cumulate over life course and become progressively more important (see Gottfredson, 2003; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996). Other researchers have suggested that exactly the opposite is true: the predictive validity of IQ scores should decline as time goes by because less able people have time to accumulate skills to compensate for their initial lack of ability (Ackerman, 1987; Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001). These opposing views can be reconciled by saying that the idea of declining importance of IQ applies to the performance of specific tasks that become automatic after some practice and the idea of growing importance applies complex long term activities, such as attaining and maintaining social s</context>

It appears that the age-related changes in the predictive validity of test scores cannot be explained by differential reliability of the scores. Analyses of age at success in Tables 2 and 3 demonstrate that correlations with occupation and income grow stronger as individuals grow older. This result confirms the ideas of the gravitational hypothesis about intellectual differences cumulating throughout life course leading people increasingly towards the social positions that correspond to their ability (Gottfredson, 2003). The fact that declining validity hypothesis (Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001) received no support for occupational and income attainment indicates that being successful in these areas is a complex activity that never ceases to be cognitively demanding. But as for educational attainment, the negative impact of age at success on the IQeducation correlation in Table 3 provides some support for the declining validity hypothesis and suggests that, in educational career, intellectual differences might indeed become somewhat less important as people get older.

Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded that “the main point seems beyond dispute” (1994: 52) and some studies have found support for this point (Murnane, Willett, &amp; Levy, 1995), there are still serious reasons to doubt that the importance of intelligence is or has been growing.

The same conclusion was reached by Flynn (2004) and Hauser and Huang (1997). Breen and Goldthorpe (2001) found that the association between intelligence and occupational status in England is, if anything, declining. 5. Method 5.1. Definition of variables The present meta-analysis investigated the relationship between three measures of socioeconomic success (educational level, occupational level, and income) and three predictors (intelligence, parental SES, and academic performance). The operationalization of these variables is described next. 5.1.1. Socioeconomic success Educational level was measured by the number of years spent in full time education or the highest</context>

Therefore, the safest conclusion from Tables 2 and 3 seems to be that the correlation between intelligence and success has not changed in any consistent direction over the past decades. It should be noted that the present paper analyzed changes in the absolute importance of intelligence (measured by zero-order correlations); the results so far discussed do not exclude the possibility of growing relative importance of intelligence (i.e., importance relative to other predictors). However, the analyses of Bowles et al. (2001) and T. Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426 Hauser and Huang (1997) found no evidence of any trend in the relative importance. 7.2. Possible limitations and implications for future research Like all research, the present meta-analysis contains several limitations that can be amended in future research. One limitation concerns the metaanalytic database. Although the present meta-analysis is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive review of the longitudinal research on intelligence and socioeconomic success, it does not cover all the existing data. I am aware of several additional longitudinal data sets that contain information on intelligence and success but </context>
<context position="8946" citStr="Hauser &amp; Huang, 1997" startWordPosition="2358" endWordPosition="2361"> that “the effect of socioeconomic background on each of the three adult status variables – schooling, income, and occupational status – is greater than the effect of childhood IQ” (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974: 44). Third, are there any age-related or historical changes in the relationship between intelligence and success? The question of historical changes in the importance of IQ has been particularly controversial with some authors warning against increasing cognitive stratification (Herrnstein T. Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426 &amp; Murray, 1994) and others trying to disprove these claims (Hauser &amp; Huang, 1997). The present paper will address these questions by conducting a meta-analysis of the longitudinal research on the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. I will concentrate on longitudinal studies (where intelligence is measured before the actual success) because only longitudinal research design allows us to make conclusions about the possible causal impact of intelligence on success. 2. A brief history Longitudinal studies on the relationship between intelligence and career success have been conducted since the first decades of the 20th century (Ball, 1938; Thorndike et</context>

But so far as socioeconomic success can depend on the performance of specific work tasks, the possibility of declining validity of IQ is not completely ruled out. Several studies have correlated intelligence with success at different points in people&amp;apos;s life course. Some of them have found that the correlations indeed increase with age as predicted by the gravitational hypothesis (Brown &amp; Reynolds, 1975; Deary et al., 2005; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996), others have found no clear trend (Hauser, Warren, Huang, &amp; Carter, 1996; Warren, Sheridan, &amp; Hauser, 2002). The reviews by Hulin, Henry, and Noon (1990) and Keil and Cortina (2001) found support for the declining validity thesis but it should be noted that many of the studies reviewed in these papers used specific laboratory tasks as dependent variables and are, therefore, not directly comparable to the studies reviewed in the present paper. 4.3.3.

Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation between intelligence and success with the correlation between parental SES and success. To accomplish that, the present paper will include a meta-analysis of the relationship between the different aspects of parental SES (parental education, occupation, and income) and socioeconomic success. Research on this relationship is, of course, voluminous and several narrative and quantitative reviews of it are available (see Ganzeboom, Luijkx, &amp; Treiman, 1989; Haveman &amp; Wolf, 1995; Mulligan, 1999). Ganzeboom et al. (1989), for instance, gathered 149 studies from 35 countries to analyze the T. Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426 association between father&amp;apos;s occupation and son&amp;apos;s occupation, and concluded that the association is stronger in non-industrialized societies and has been weakening during the 20th century.

But it should be noted that other predictors, studied in this paper, are not doing any better in predicting income, which demonstrates that financial success is difficult to predict by any variable. This claim is further corroborated by the meta-analysis of Ng et al. (2005) where the best predictor of salary was educational level with a correlation of only .29. It should also be noted that the correlation of .23 is about the size of the average meta-analytic result in psychology (Hemphill, 2003) and cannot, therefore, be treated as insignificant. The second aim of the meta-analysis was to compare the predictive power of intelligence to the predictive power of other prominent predictors of success, parental SES and academic performance. Such comparisons are informative because different predictors represent different paths to a successful career: intelligence represents one&amp;apos;s general ability, parental SES represents the social advantages or disadvantages experienced by a person, and academic performance represents school-related learning and motivation.

Meta-analysis demonstrated that parental SES and academic performance are indeed positively related to career success but the predictive power of these variables is not stronger than that of intelligence (see Table 1). In fact, intelligence exhibited several correlations with the measures of success that were larger than the respective correlations for other predictors suggesting that intelligence is, after all, a better predictor of success. Still, the differences in favor of intelligence were not as overwhelming as one would have expected based on the results of Herrnstein and Murray (1994). The index of parental SES, arguably the most representative measure of social background, did not differ significantly from intelligence in its predictive power (see Table 1). The same is true about the predictive power of academic performance in relation to education and occupation. It has been observed before that meta-analyses typically do not provide support for extreme scientific positions (Lytton &amp; Romney, 1991). This is also true in the present case because the extreme positions favoring intelligence (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) or parental SES (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976) were not supporte</context>

Year of the measurement of success had no obvious effect on the corrected correlations ( p) between intelligence and success in Table 2. The meta-regression analysis in Table 3 showed that there is a slight tendency for correlation between intelligence and education to increase over the years. This is the only bit of evidence there is to support the claims of Herrnstein and Murray (1994) about the growing importance of mental ability and increasing cognitive stratification. This evidence is rather weak in comparison with the much stronger declining trend exhibited by the correlation with occupation in Table 3. It would be difficult to come up with explanations why intelligence might have become more important with respect to one criterion and less important with respect to another. Therefore, the safest conclusion from Tables 2 and 3 seems to be that the correlation between intelligence and success has not changed in any consistent direction over the past decades.

First, what is the approximate size of the correlation between intelligence and success? Is it large enough to be of any practical importance? While some researchers have said that this correlation is “larger than most found in psychological research” (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004: 162), others are convinced that “IQ is just not an important enough determinant of economic success” (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 2002: 12). Second, how does the predictive power of intelligence compare to the predictive power of other variables, such as parental socioeconomic status (SES) or school grades? </context>

Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that considered several determinants of success at the same time (Duncan, 1968; Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp; Ohlendorf, 1970). But it was with the publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the question of intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to public attention. Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray found that intelligence is a better predictor of several desirable outcomes (e.g., not living in poverty, not being arrested) than is parental SES. They also found evidence that the role of intelligence in status attainment has been growing throughout the 20th century and concluded that the social structure of American society is increasingly based on mental ability. The ideas of The Bell Curve have been sev</context>

Intelligence versus parental SES The question about the relative importance of intelligence and parental SES in predicting success is one of the central questions of status attainment research. This is a question about the nature of the society we live in: whether a typical western society rewards people for their own abilities or their social background (Saunders, 1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a definite answer to this question. Some authors have found that intelligence outcompetes parental SES as a predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998; Saunders, 1997). Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a better predictor (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important aspects of parental status (most importantly, parental income) among the predictors (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation between intelligence </context>

Year of the measurement of success A particularly controversial issue concerns the historical changes in the relationship between intelligence and success. It was one of the central claims of The Bell Curve that the association between mental ability and career success in western societies has been growing throughout the 20th century (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994). The logic behind this idea is similar to the gravitational hypothesis, discussed in the previous section – in both cases individuals are increasingly drawn towards the positions that correspond to their ability as time goes by – but in this case the gravitation does not take place during a life course of a single individual but over several generations. Several studies have investigated changes in the association between intelligence and success during past decades. Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded that “the main point seems beyond dispute” (1994: 52) and some studies have found supp</context>

The index of parental SES, arguably the most representative measure of social background, did not differ significantly from intelligence in its predictive power (see Table 1). The same is true about the predictive power of academic performance in relation to education and occupation. It has been observed before that meta-analyses typically do not provide support for extreme scientific positions (Lytton &amp; Romney, 1991). This is also true in the present case because the extreme positions favoring intelligence (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) or parental SES (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976) were not supported by the results. The reasonable conclusion is rather modest: while intelligence is one of the central determinants of one&amp;apos;s socioeconomic success, parental 416 T. Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426 SES and academic performance also play an important role in the process of status attainment. Despite the modest conclusion, these results are important because they falsify a claim often made by the critics of the “testing movement”: that the positive relationship between intelligence and success is just the effect of parental SES or </context>

A correlation with SES index was included in the present metaanalysis if the index was composed of the following components — parental education (education of one or both parents), parental occupation (occupation of one or both parents), and material well-being of the parental home. The latter was measured by parental income or by a “possession index” which indicates how many of the valued items (e.g., a car, TV set, computer) were present at home. If a study did not use an index of SES but presented intercorrelations among the necessary variables, then I used the formulas reported by Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 433) to calculate a composite score correlation between SES index and success. 5.1.4. Academic performance Academic performance was in most studies measured by a grade point average (GPA) obtained in high school or the years preceding high school. In some studies, rank in class (i.e., how well the student performed in comparison with other students in the class) was used instead of GPA. Rank is generally used interchangeably with GPA (see Kuncel, Crede, &amp; Thomas, 2005), therefore, these studies were also included. 5.2.

I could locate two studies (Bell, Senese, &amp; Elliott, 1984; Massagli &amp; Hauser, 1983) that provided reliability estimates from three samples. The estimates ranged from .45 to .59. with an average of .51 that was used in the present paper. The third source of information on parental SES is objective data (e.g., tax records of income) that was assumed to have a reliability of 1. Internal consistency method (Cronbach alpha) was used to correct for unreliability in the SES index. This method was recommended by Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 438) for composite variables. For all but two studies, the alpha value of the SES index was obtained from the same sample as the correlation itself.

(2001) reported that there is no time trend in the size of the coefficients between the years 1960 and 1995 and that the age of the sample at the time of ability testing has no effect on the results. The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. is a valuable contribution but it suffers from several shortcomings. First, it considered only one measure of success, income, thereby ignoring education and occupation. Second, the meta-analytic estimate of .15 was not derived from zero-order correlations as is usually required by the textbooks of meta-analysis (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 475) but from regression equations that included several predictors in addition to intelligence. Peterson and Brown (2005) have recently suggested that the use of partial effect sizes, instead of zero-order ones, does not affect the meta-analytic results very much but it is nevertheless obvious that the use of disparate studies makes the results difficult to interpret. Third, the metaanalysis of Bowles et al. was not based on independent samples. The authors stated that they used 65 estimates from 24 studies (p. 1154) but neither of these figures 404 T.

In order to ascertain that every sample contributed only one correlation to one analysis, I averaged all the correlations that were derived from the same sample. If the sample sizes of the averaged correlations were different, mean sample size was used. The procedures for moderator analyses are described in Sections 6.3 and 6.4. 5.3. Correcting for unreliability Ideally, every correlation should be corrected with the reliability coefficients obtained from the same sample as the correlation that needs to be corrected (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004, chapter 3). However, such reliability coefficients were available for only a small minority of studies included in the present meta-analysis. The correlations from these studies were corrected with these reliability coefficients. But for the majority of studies, mean reliabilities (estimated from various sources, as described below) were used. Each study was then corrected individually with the appropriate reliability coefficient. The nature and sources of reliability information are described next. 5.3.1.

I also excluded the correlation if the range of one (or both) of the correlated variables was deliberately restricted by the research design. For example, in the study of gifted children by Terman and Oden (1947), the range of intelligence was severely restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs over 135; in the Polish study by Firkowska-Mankiewicz (2002), the range of intelligence was restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs below 86 or over 130.

Because the sample sizes were highly variable (from 60 to 339,951 with a median of 518), weighting the correlations by sample size would allow the few very large studies to overly dominate the results. To prevent that, all the samples with the size over 7000 individuals (about 5% of the samples in this study) were set equal to 7000 for the weighting procedure. In order to estimate the variability of the correlations, the standard deviation of original correlations and corrected standard deviation of corrected correlations (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 126) were calculated. The 95% credibility intervals of sample size weighted corrected correlations were calculated to assess the presence of moderators. Moderators are present if the credibility intervals are large (over 0.11 according to Koslowsky &amp; Sagie, 1993) or include zero (see Whitener, 1990). Finally, 95% confidence intervals of the sample size weighted corrected correlations were calculated using the formula for heterogeneous studies (Whitener, 1990: 317). Confidence intervals can be used to assess the significance of the correlations (correlation is significantly different from zer</context>

Possible limitations and implications for future research Like all research, the present meta-analysis contains several limitations that can be amended in future research. One limitation concerns the metaanalytic database. Although the present meta-analysis is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive review of the longitudinal research on intelligence and socioeconomic success, it does not cover all the existing data. I am aware of several additional longitudinal data sets that contain information on intelligence and success but from which I have been unable to obtain necessary data (see Jæger &amp; Holm, 2003; Meghir &amp; Palme, 2005; Nyborg &amp; Jensen, 2001; Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1994). There are probably others. Efforts to collect information about the existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other scientific cultures.

A study by McCall (1977) found a clear upward trend in the correlations between intelligence and success; that is, correlations grew stronger as age at testing increased. Some of the studies reviewed by Jencks and Phillips (1999) have found a similar trend. The meta-analysis of Bowles et al.

Several studies have investigated changes in the association between intelligence and success during past decades. Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded that “the main point seems beyond dispute” (1994: 52) and some studies have found support for this point (Murnane, Willett, &amp; Levy, 1995), there are still serious reasons to doubt that the importance of intelligence is or has been growing. Neither the meta-analysis by Bowles et al. (2001) nor the review by Jencks et al. (1979) found any clear trend in the correlations between intelligence and success. The same conclusion was reached by Flynn (2004) and Hauser and Huang (1997). Breen and Goldthorpe (2001) found that the association between intelligence and occupational status in England is, if anything, declining. 5. Method 5.1.

The second and by far the most common source is self-report. Self-reports are not perfectly reliable, however. The amount of error is usually measured by asking the same individuals to report their socioeconomic characteristics again after a few months and then correlating the first and second reports (producing a test–retest T. Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426 correlation). Several estimates of these correlations, derived from nationally representative samples, are available. Using the data presented by Bowles (1972) and Jencks et al. (1979), I calculated the average test– retest correlations for educational level (.89), occupational status (.88), and income (.83). These values were used to correct the correlations with self-reported socioeconomic success. The third possibility is to obtain the information from the spouse, parent, sibling, or child of the focal individual. Because these sources would introduce unnecessary complications and an unknown degree of error, the studies using these sources were excluded unless they contained correlations between intelligence and success (these correlations are too valuable to be discarde</context>

But none of these reviews has presented the results in a manner that would make them directly usable in this paper, hence the need for a separate meta-analysis.1 4.2.2. Intelligence versus academic performance The question about the relative importance of mental ability and academic performance in predicting success has also been recognized as important (see Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1999). It is a question of what really matters for career success: is it one&amp;apos;s general ability (as measured by IQ tests) or the things one has learned at school and motivation to learn (as measured by school grades)? Not many studies have explicitly compared the predictive power of IQ scores and school grades (e.g., Taubman &amp; Wales, 1974, chapter 3). But the more general question about the usefulness of grades as predictors of success has been the object of considerable debate (see Roth, BeVier, Switzer, &amp; Schippmann, 1996; Roth &amp; Clark, 1998).

Age at the time of testing The first moderator analysis concerns age at testing (age of individuals at the time the IQ test was taken) and how it affects the correlation between intelligence and success. Analysis of the effect of age at testing reveals something about the mechanism behind the intelligence–success correlation. If intelligence predicts success irrespective of the age at which it is measured, then there is reason to believe that the differences in people&amp;apos;s career success are the result of the stable individual differences measured by IQ tests (Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1999). If however, the predictive power of IQ tests changes with age, then different interpretations are possible depending on how we believe the test score to be affected by genes and environment. According to the standard sociological interpretation, the test scores of older individuals should be more affected by life experiences than the scores of children (because older individuals simply have had more experiences) and consequently, if intelligence tested at an older age should turn out to be a better predictor career success, then it would mean that the test scores probably reflect some career</context>

Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that considered several determinants of success at the same time (Duncan, 1968; Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp; Ohlendorf, 1970). But it was with the publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the question of intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to public attention. Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray found that intelligence is a better predictor of several desirable outcomes (e.g., not living in poverty, not being arrested) than is parental SES. They also found evidence that the role of intelligence in status attainment has been growing throughout the 20th century and concluded that </context>

These conclusions were challenged by Breen and Goldthorpe (1999, 2001) who argued that Saunders greatly overestimated the importance of intelligence by using inappropriate analytic techniques. 3. Previous reviews There have been surprisingly few attempts to systematically review the literature on intelligence and socioeconomic success. Reviewers typically cite only a couple of studies (see e.g., Brody, 1997; Farkas, 2003; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Some of the most comprehensive reviews have been conducted by Jencks (see Jencks et al., 1972, 1979). Two meta-analyses have so far addressed the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. Both of them used income as a measure of success. The more comprehensive one of the two was conducted by Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001). They assembled 65 estimates from 24 studies to estimate the relationship between intelligence and income. The mean standardized regression coefficient of intelligence on income is .15 according to their study (p. 1154). In addition to that, Bowles et al. (2001) reported that there is no time trend in the size of the coefficients between the ye</context>

Although it is sometimes claimed in popular press and textbooks that intelligence has no relationship to important real-life outcomes (see Barrett &amp; Depinet, 1991, for a review of such claims), the scientific research on the topic leaves little doubt that people with higher scores on IQ tests are better educated, hold more prestigious occupations, and earn higher incomes than people with lower scores (Gottfredson, 1997, 2003; Jensen, 1980, 1998; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Thus, the existence of an overall positive correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success is beyond doubt. But quite surprisingly, the mere existence of this correlation seems to be the only fact that is established beyond doubt after many decades of research.

But on the other hand, if we assume that the test scores of older individuals are more “contaminated” by genetic influences, then it would mean that genes make a contribution to this correlation. Yet another explanation would be that IQ scores of children are simply less reliable and the predictive validity of childhood IQ was, therefore, underestimated. But contrary to this explanation, preliminary examination of some evidence on the stability of intelligence among children (e.g., Burchinal, Campbell, Bryant, Wasik, &amp; Ramey, 1997; Jensen, 1980: 279) suggested that the test–retest coefficients among children below 10 are, on the whole, rather similar to the test–retest coefficients among older individuals. It appears that the age-related changes in the predictive validity of test scores cannot be explained by differential reliability of the scores.

Intelligence Intelligence, or general mental ability, of an individual was measured by a score on a test of intelligence. It is not always easy, however, to decide if a given test is a test of intelligence. The definitions of intelligence state that it is an abstract ability that is not tied to any specific domain of knowledge. Therefore, only the tests that are designed to measure such ability should be used in the meta-analysis. If we take the traditional threefold distinction between ability, aptitude, and achievement tests (Jensen, 1981), then the present study should use only ability and aptitude test scores.

The ideas of The Bell Curve have been severely criticized for a number of reasons. Fischer et al. (1996) argued that Herrnstein and Murray used an inappropriate measure of parental SES and, therefore, underestimated its importance. Hauser and Huang (1997) argued that the claim about the growing importance of intelligence is simply a misinterpretation of previous research. Other researchers have, however, supported the ideas of The Bell Curve (Gottfredson, 2003; Jensen, 1998) saying that its central claims have been convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459). 403 At the same time in Great Britain, a similar discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who, analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from Great Britain, found that intelligence is a better predictor of occupational attainment than is parental SES and concluded that England is, to a large extent, a meritocratic society (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999; Saunders, 1997, 2002).

This cannot be the only aim of the present meta-analysis because very few social scientists would doubt that there is a positive correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success. Having acknowledged that, the next logical question is: what is the approximate size of the correlation? Answers to this question are far from uniform. Take the correlation between intelligence and income: Jensen has suggested that it is somewhere around .40 (Jensen, 1998: 568) while Bowles et al. (2001) have found that it is only about .15. That is why the first aim of the present meta-analysis is to estimate the approximate sizes of the correlations between intelligence and measures of success. The importance of the correlations can be evaluated using Cohen&amp;apos;s classification scheme which classifies correlations as small if they are below .30, medium-sized if they are between .30 and .50, and large if they are over .50 (Cohen, 1988).

The fact that IQ scores predict socioeconomic success does not, in itself, tell us whether the effect of intelligence can be attributed to genes or environment. On the one hand, there is clear evidence that children&amp;apos;s IQ scores are correlated with parental SES (White, 1982), this result together with the fact that parental SES predicts socioeconomic success (see Table 1) can be interpreted as showing that environment is the “final cause” of one&amp;apos;s success or failure. This conclusion has been criticized for ignoring the genetic influences on parental SES (Jensen, 1998). On the other hand, the evidence on the heritability of intelligence (Devlin, Daniels, &amp; Roeder, 1997) and socioeconomic success (Rowe, Vesterdal, &amp; Rodgers, 1999) together with the evidence on the relationship between intelligence and success (see Table 1) can be taken as proof that parents&amp;apos; and children&amp;apos;s social status are both determined by the genes for intelligence that run in the family.

Intelligence When correcting for unreliability in the test scores, test–retest alternate-form reliability (the correlation between parallel forms of the same test administered on two separate occasions) is generally considered to be the most appropriate form of reliability (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1999). But since these coefficients are rarely available, simple test–retest reliability is often taken as the second best option in meta-analytic studies of the predictive power of IQ scores (Judge, Colbert, &amp; Ilies, 2004; Salgado, Anderson, Moscoso, Bertua, &amp; Fruyt, 2003). Because test–retest reliability coefficients were reported in only a few studies, an average test–retest coefficient, obtained from the meta-analysis of Salgado et al. (2003), was used for most of the studies. Salgado et al. averaged 31 test–retest correlations of different general mental ability tests (the mean interval between test and retest being 6 months) and obtained an average coefficient of .83. This value is similar to average test– retest correlations obtained in other reviews: e.g., .82 in Parker, Hanson, and Hunsley (1988) or .8</context>

Several studies have correlated intelligence with success at different points in people&amp;apos;s life course. Some of them have found that the correlations indeed increase with age as predicted by the gravitational hypothesis (Brown &amp; Reynolds, 1975; Deary et al., 2005; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996), others have found no clear trend (Hauser, Warren, Huang, &amp; Carter, 1996; Warren, Sheridan, &amp; Hauser, 2002). The reviews by Hulin, Henry, and Noon (1990) and Keil and Cortina (2001) found support for the declining validity thesis but it should be noted that many of the studies reviewed in these papers used specific laboratory tasks as dependent variables and are, therefore, not directly comparable to the studies reviewed in the present paper. 4.3.3.

This reasoning has been used to support the idea that intellectual differences cumulate over life course and become progressively more important (see Gottfredson, 2003; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996). Other researchers have suggested that exactly the opposite is true: the predictive validity of IQ scores should decline as time goes by because less able people have time to accumulate skills to compensate for their initial lack of ability (Ackerman, 1987; Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001). These opposing views can be reconciled by saying that the idea of declining importance of IQ applies to the performance of specific tasks that become automatic after some practice and the idea of growing importance applies complex long term activities, such as attaining and maintaining social status, that never cease to be cognitively demanding. But so far as socioeconomic success can depend on the performance of specific work tasks, the possibility of declining validity of IQ is not completely ruled out.

The fact that declining validity hypothesis (Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001) received no support for occupational and income attainment indicates that being successful in these areas is a complex activity that never ceases to be cognitively demanding. But as for educational attainment, the negative impact of age at success on the IQeducation correlation in Table 3 provides some support for the declining validity hypothesis and suggests that, in educational career, intellectual differences might indeed become somewhat less important as people get older.

The first row in every section of Table 1 presents the general results for intelligence as a predictor of success. The phrase “all studies” in parentheses indicates that all the studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria are included in these analyses. As expected, intelligence is positively correlated with education, occupation, and income; the sample size weighted and corrected correlations ( p) are .56, .43, and .20, respectively. The fact that the 95% credibility intervals exceed 0.11 suggests the presence of moderators according to Koslowsky and Sagie (1993). Comparing the three averages (r, rw, and p) in every row to one another demonstrates that weighting the correlations by sample size tends to reduce the average. This means that larger studies produced smaller correlations indicating in turn that smaller, and potentially less representative, samples 8 Note that these figures apply to the data sets that contain information on intelligence and success.

To prevent that, all the samples with the size over 7000 individuals (about 5% of the samples in this study) were set equal to 7000 for the weighting procedure. In order to estimate the variability of the correlations, the standard deviation of original correlations and corrected standard deviation of corrected correlations (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 126) were calculated. The 95% credibility intervals of sample size weighted corrected correlations were calculated to assess the presence of moderators. Moderators are present if the credibility intervals are large (over 0.11 according to Koslowsky &amp; Sagie, 1993) or include zero (see Whitener, 1990). Finally, 95% confidence intervals of the sample size weighted corrected correlations were calculated using the formula for heterogeneous studies (Whitener, 1990: 317). Confidence intervals can be used to assess the significance of the correlations (correlation is significantly different from zero if the confidence intervals do T. Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426 not include zero) as well as to compare correlations (according to a simple and conservative rule of thumb, two correlations are significantly different from one another if their confidenc</context>

I also excluded the correlation if the range of one (or both) of the correlated variables was deliberately restricted by the research design. For example, in the study of gifted children by Terman and Oden (1947), the range of intelligence was severely restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs over 135; in the Polish study by Firkowska-Mankiewicz (2002), the range of intelligence was restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs below 86 or over 130. The correlations obtained from Fergusson, Horwood, and Ridder (2005) and Kuh and Wadsworth (1991) were the only ones that had to be corrected for dichotomization. 5.5.

Students&amp;apos; selfreports on their GPA or rank are, of course, not perfectly reliable. The reliability of self-reports is assessed by the correlation between self-reported GPA (or rank) and GPA (or rank) obtained from school records. A recent meta-analysis by Kuncel et al.

First, the present study used only three measures of social background (parental education, occupation, and income) and therefore, could have underestimated its importance. Although these three have always been the central indicators of social advantages, several additional measures of social background could have an independent effect on career success (Fischer et al., 1996). Future metaanalyses could, therefore, benefit from considering other variables, such as neighborhood quality (Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000), number of siblings (Blake, 1989), or parental divorce (Amato &amp; Keith, 1991), to get a more comprehensive picture of the effects of social background. Second, the use 417 of grade point average and class rank as the only measures of academic performance can be criticized for ignoring between-school differences; i.e., the same average grade or rank can have different meanings in different schools depending on the quality of the schools (Bassiri &amp; Schulz, 2003). A more comprehensive study of the importance of academic performance should, therefore, also take account of the quality of the school</context>

Children&amp;apos;s reports on parental characteristics are known to suffer from considerable error. Probably the best estimate of this error is the correlation between child&amp;apos;s report and parent&amp;apos;s own report on a given characteristic.

The estimates ranged from .45 to .59. with an average of .51 that was used in the present paper. The third source of information on parental SES is objective data (e.g., tax records of income) that was assumed to have a reliability of 1. Internal consistency method (Cronbach alpha) was used to correct for unreliability in the SES index. This method was recommended by Hunter and Schmidt (2004: 438) for composite variables.

A brief history Longitudinal studies on the relationship between intelligence and career success have been conducted since the first decades of the 20th century (Ball, 1938; Thorndike et al., 1934). And these studies have invariably uncovered a positive relationship. The early studies, however, did not consider other possible determinants of success, most importantly parental SES. Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that considered several determinants of success at the same time (Duncan, 1968; Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp; Ohlendorf, 1970). But it was with the publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the question of intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to public attention. Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray found that intellige</context>
<context position="20541" citStr="McClelland, 1973" startWordPosition="4118" endWordPosition="4119">ts) or the things one has learned at school and motivation to learn (as measured by school grades)? Not many studies have explicitly compared the predictive power of IQ scores and school grades (e.g., Taubman &amp; Wales, 1974, chapter 3). But the more general question about the usefulness of grades as predictors of success has been the object of considerable debate (see Roth, BeVier, Switzer, &amp; Schippmann, 1996; Roth &amp; Clark, 1998). The meta-analysis by Roth and Clark (1998), for instance, found an average correlation of .28 between grades and salary. Thus, contrary to some earlier claims (e.g., McClelland, 1973), grades have turned out to be good predictors of success. This literature is somewhat limited by being almost exclusively restricted to college grades. If the purpose is to compare grades and IQ test scores as predictors of career success, then high school grades would be a better choice because college students constitute a rather selected group that does not represent the full range of career attainments in society. High school grades have been meta-analytically related to job performance (Dye &amp; Reck, 1988) and college grades (Robbins et al., 2004) but there is currently no meta-analysis ab</context>

Strenze / Intelligence 35 (2007) 401–426 SES and academic performance also play an important role in the process of status attainment. Despite the modest conclusion, these results are important because they falsify a claim often made by the critics of the “testing movement”: that the positive relationship between intelligence and success is just the effect of parental SES or academic performance influencing them both (see Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; Fischer et al., 1996; McClelland, 1973). If the correlation between intelligence and success was a mere byproduct of the causal effect of parental SES or academic performance, then parental SES and academic performance should have outcompeted intelligence as predictors of success; but this was clearly not so. These results confirm that intelligence is an independent causal force among the determinants of success; in other words, the fact that intelligent people are successful is not completely explainable by the fact that intelligent people have wealthy parents and are doing better at school.

One limitation concerns the metaanalytic database. Although the present meta-analysis is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive review of the longitudinal research on intelligence and socioeconomic success, it does not cover all the existing data. I am aware of several additional longitudinal data sets that contain information on intelligence and success but from which I have been unable to obtain necessary data (see Jæger &amp; Holm, 2003; Meghir &amp; Palme, 2005; Nyborg &amp; Jensen, 2001; Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1994). There are probably others. Efforts to collect information about the existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other scientific cultures.

The advantage of such within-sample comparisons would be the elimination of between-study methodological differences. I used this strategy to compare the correlations with intelligence and SES index (arguably the best measure of social background). The significance of the difference between the correlations was tested with the formula for comparing dependent correlations (Meng, Rosenthal, &amp; Rubin, 1992: 173). With education as the measure of success, there were 15 samples that provided correlations with both IQ and SES index; in 11 of these samples, the correlations were significantly different (p b .05, 2-tailed); 8 of the significant differences were in favor of IQ. With occupation as the measure of success, 14 comparisons were made; 7 of the differences were significant, all in favor of IQ. With income as the measure of success, 12 comparisons were made; 5 were significant, 2 of them in favor of IQ.

Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation between intelligence and success with the correlation between parental SES and success. To accomplish that, the present paper will include a meta-analysis of the relationship between the different aspects of parental SES (parental education, occupation, and income) and socioeconomic success. Research on this relationship is, of course, voluminous and several narrative and quantitative reviews of it are available (see Ganzeboom, Luijkx, &amp; Treiman, 1989; Haveman &amp; Wolf, 1995; Mulligan, 1999).

Several studies have investigated changes in the association between intelligence and success during past decades. Although Herrnstein and Murray concluded that “the main point seems beyond dispute” (1994: 52) and some studies have found support for this point (Murnane, Willett, &amp; Levy, 1995), there are still serious reasons to doubt that the importance of intelligence is or has been growing. Neither the meta-analysis by Bowles et al. (2001) nor the review by Jencks et al. (1979) found any clear trend in the correlations between intelligence and success.

Intelligence versus parental SES The question about the relative importance of intelligence and parental SES in predicting success is one of the central questions of status attainment research. This is a question about the nature of the society we live in: whether a typical western society rewards people for their own abilities or their social background (Saunders, 1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a definite answer to this question. Some authors have found that intelligence outcompetes parental SES as a predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998; Saunders, 1997). Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a better predictor (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important aspects of parental status (most importantly, parental income) among the predictors (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). Therefore, it is necessary to compare the correlation between intelligence and success wi</context>

Fourth, their meta-analysis mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The distinction between cross-sectional and longitudinal study design is vital in the present context because only the latter can answer questions about the causal impact of intelligence on career success. Another, more recent, meta-analysis was conducted by Ng, Eby, Sorensen, and Feldman (2005) who collected 8 studies and found an average correlation of .27 between intelligence and salary. The meta-analysis of Ng et al. (2005) was, unlike the one by Bowles et al., based on zero-order correlations and avoided the use of non-independent samples but it failed to separate crosssectional and longitudinal studies. 4. Topics addressed in the present paper 4.1. The size of the correlation between intelligence and success Meta-analyses are often conducted with the aim to determine if a statistical relationship between two variables is significantly different from zero. This cannot be the only aim of the present meta-analysis because very few social scientists would doubt that there is a positive correlation between intellig</context>

Two of the correlations – with education and occupation – are of substantial magnitude according to the usual standards of social science (Cohen, 1988); the correlation with education even surpasses the wellestablished correlation of .51 between intelligence and job performance (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998). The 415 correlation with income is considerably lower, perhaps even disappointingly low, being about the average of the previous meta-analytic estimates (.15 by Bowles et al., 2001; and .27 by Ng et al., 2005). But it should be noted that other predictors, studied in this paper, are not doing any better in predicting income, which demonstrates that financial success is difficult to predict by any variable. This claim is further corroborated by the meta-analysis of Ng et al. (2005) where the best predictor of salary was educational level with a correlation of only .29. It should also be noted that the correlation of .23 is about the size of the average meta-analytic result in psychology (Hemphill, 2003) and cannot, therefore, be treated as insignificant. The second aim of the meta-analysis was to co</context>

The ideas of The Bell Curve have been severely criticized for a number of reasons. Fischer et al. (1996) argued that Herrnstein and Murray used an inappropriate measure of parental SES and, therefore, underestimated its importance. Hauser and Huang (1997) argued that the claim about the growing importance of intelligence is simply a misinterpretation of previous research. Other researchers have, however, supported the ideas of The Bell Curve (Gottfredson, 2003; Jensen, 1998) saying that its central claims have been convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459). 403 At the same time in Great Britain, a similar discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who, analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from Great Britain, found that intelligence is a better predictor of occupational attainment than is parental SES and concluded that England is, to a large extent, a meritocratic society (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999; Saunders, 1997, 2002). These conclusions were challenged by Breen and Goldthorpe (1999, 2001) who argued that Saunders greatly overestimated the importance of intelligence by using inappropriate analytic techniques. 3.

One limitation concerns the metaanalytic database. Although the present meta-analysis is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive review of the longitudinal research on intelligence and socioeconomic success, it does not cover all the existing data. I am aware of several additional longitudinal data sets that contain information on intelligence and success but from which I have been unable to obtain necessary data (see Jæger &amp; Holm, 2003; Meghir &amp; Palme, 2005; Nyborg &amp; Jensen, 2001; Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1994). There are probably others. Efforts to collect information about the existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been studied in continental Europe (see e.g.</context>

The meta-analysis of Bowles et al. is a valuable contribution but it suffers from several shortcomings. First, it considered only one measure of success, income, thereby ignoring education and occupation. Second, the meta-analytic estimate of .15 was not derived from zero-order correlations as is usually required by the textbooks of meta-analysis (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 475) but from regression equations that included several predictors in addition to intelligence. Peterson and Brown (2005) have recently suggested that the use of partial effect sizes, instead of zero-order ones, does not affect the meta-analytic results very much but it is nevertheless obvious that the use of disparate studies makes the results difficult to interpret. Third, the metaanalysis of Bowles et al. was not based on independent samples. The authors stated that they used 65 estimates from 24 studies (p. 1154) but neither of these figures 404 T.

Thus, contrary to some earlier claims (e.g., McClelland, 1973), grades have turned out to be good predictors of success. This literature is somewhat limited by being almost exclusively restricted to college grades. If the purpose is to compare grades and IQ test scores as predictors of career success, then high school grades would be a better choice because college students constitute a rather selected group that does not represent the full range of career attainments in society. High school grades have been meta-analytically related to job performance (Dye &amp; Reck, 1988) and college grades (Robbins et al., 2004) but there is currently no meta-analysis about the relationship between high school grades and general socioeconomic success (as measured by education, occupation, and income). The present paper will, thus, conduct such a meta-analysis. 4.3. Moderators of the correlation between intelligence and success In order to further clarify the role of intelligence in people&amp;apos;s career, the effects of three moderator variables 405 (age at testing, age at success, and year of success) on intelligence–success correlation will be studied. These moderator variables have been analyzed in several studies but wi</context>

In order to take account of this possibility, I conducted multiple linear regression analyses using the moderator variables as independent variables and the correlations between intelligence and measures of success as dependent variables. Such meta-regression analysis is a common meta-analytic tool (see Ganzeboom et al., 1989; Robbins et al., 2004). The analyses that follow differ from the preceding moderator analyses in an important respect: in order to use all the available information, I gave up the requirement of independent data and included all the available correlations. If mental ability or socioeconomic success was measured repeatedly for the same sample, then all the correlations were included making it possible for one sample to contribute more than one correlation to the analysis.10 Naturally, this strategy results in some samples providing much more correlations than others.

It is a question of what really matters for career success: is it one&amp;apos;s general ability (as measured by IQ tests) or the things one has learned at school and motivation to learn (as measured by school grades)? Not many studies have explicitly compared the predictive power of IQ scores and school grades (e.g., Taubman &amp; Wales, 1974, chapter 3). But the more general question about the usefulness of grades as predictors of success has been the object of considerable debate (see Roth, BeVier, Switzer, &amp; Schippmann, 1996; Roth &amp; Clark, 1998). The meta-analysis by Roth and Clark (1998), for instance, found an average correlation of .28 between grades and salary. Thus, contrary to some earlier claims (e.g., McClelland, 1973), grades have turned out to be good predictors of success.

On the one hand, there is clear evidence that children&amp;apos;s IQ scores are correlated with parental SES (White, 1982), this result together with the fact that parental SES predicts socioeconomic success (see Table 1) can be interpreted as showing that environment is the “final cause” of one&amp;apos;s success or failure. This conclusion has been criticized for ignoring the genetic influences on parental SES (Jensen, 1998).

This conclusion has been challenged by Bowles and Gintis (2002) who argued that, although socioeconomic success might be heritable, the genetic inheritance of IQ, in particular, plays only a very minor part in this process.

It is, therefore, appropriate to limit the current meta-analysis to representative studies and exclude the studies that exhibit signs of considerable range restriction.6 More specifically, I excluded the studies that sampled only (a) college students or individuals with a college degree (e.g., Eckland, 1965), (b) employees of a single organization (e.g., Dreher &amp; Bretz, 1991), or (c) representatives of one specific occupational group (such as engineers or managers; see e.g., Sackett, Gruys, &amp; Ellingson, 1998).7 These criteria exclude much of the personnel selection research, which is the kind of research where the problem of range restriction is particularly serious (see Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004). I also excluded the correlation if the range of one (or both) of the correlated variables was deliberately restricted by the research design. For example, in the study of gifted children by Terman and Oden (1947), the range of intelligence was severely restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs over 135; in the Polish study by Firkowska-Mankiewicz (2002), the range of intelligence was restricted by </context>

Other researchers have, however, supported the ideas of The Bell Curve (Gottfredson, 2003; Jensen, 1998) saying that its central claims have been convincingly confirmed (Nyborg, 2003: 459). 403 At the same time in Great Britain, a similar discussion was inspired by the work of Saunders who, analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from Great Britain, found that intelligence is a better predictor of occupational attainment than is parental SES and concluded that England is, to a large extent, a meritocratic society (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999; Saunders, 1997, 2002). These conclusions were challenged by Breen and Goldthorpe (1999, 2001) who argued that Saunders greatly overestimated the importance of intelligence by using inappropriate analytic techniques. 3. Previous reviews There have been surprisingly few attempts to systematically review the literature on intelligence and socioeconomic success. Reviewers typically cite only a couple of studies (see e.g., Brody, 1997; Farkas, 2003; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Some of the most comprehensive reviews have been conducted by Jencks (see Jencks et al., 1972, 1979). Two meta-analyses have so far addresse</context>

Including them in this paper will, consequently, allow us to better evaluate the role of intelligence in people&amp;apos;s career. 4.2.1. Intelligence versus parental SES The question about the relative importance of intelligence and parental SES in predicting success is one of the central questions of status attainment research. This is a question about the nature of the society we live in: whether a typical western society rewards people for their own abilities or their social background (Saunders, 1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a definite answer to this question. Some authors have found that intelligence outcompetes parental SES as a predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998; Saunders, 1997). Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a better predictor (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important aspects of parenta</context>

One limitation concerns the metaanalytic database. Although the present meta-analysis is, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive review of the longitudinal research on intelligence and socioeconomic success, it does not cover all the existing data. I am aware of several additional longitudinal data sets that contain information on intelligence and success but from which I have been unable to obtain necessary data (see Jæger &amp; Holm, 2003; Meghir &amp; Palme, 2005; Nyborg &amp; Jensen, 2001; Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1994). There are probably others. Efforts to collect information about the existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been studied in continental Europe (see e.g., Flynn, 1987; Sternberg,</context>

The importance of the correlations can be evaluated using Cohen&amp;apos;s classification scheme which classifies correlations as small if they are below .30, medium-sized if they are between .30 and .50, and large if they are over .50 (Cohen, 1988). Knowing the size of the correlation between intelligence and career success would allow us to compare it to other, well-established, correlations in the social scientific literature; e.g., the correlation of .51 between intelligence and job performance (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998). 4.2. Intelligence and other predictors of success It is difficult to evaluate the importance of a predictor in isolation; it would be informative to compare the predictive power of intelligence to the predictive power of other relevant predictors of socioeconomic success. This paper will, therefore, analyze two additional predictors – parental SES (e.g., father&amp;apos;s occupation) and academic performance (e.g., school grades) – with the aim to determine if intelligence is a better predictor of success than the other two variables. Parental SES and academic performance have often been treated as t</context>

These results demonstrate that intelligence, when it is measured before most individuals have finished their schooling, is a powerful predictor of career success 12 or more years later when most individuals have already entered stable careers. Two of the correlations – with education and occupation – are of substantial magnitude according to the usual standards of social science (Cohen, 1988); the correlation with education even surpasses the wellestablished correlation of .51 between intelligence and job performance (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998). The 415 correlation with income is considerably lower, perhaps even disappointingly low, being about the average of the previous meta-analytic estimates (.15 by Bowles et al., 2001; and .27 by Ng et al., 2005). But it should be noted that other predictors, studied in this paper, are not doing any better in predicting income, which demonstrates that financial success is difficult to predict by any variable. This claim is further corroborated by the meta-analysis of Ng et al. (2005) where the best predictor of salary was educational level with a correlation of only .29. It should also be noted</context>

Because these sources would introduce unnecessary complications and an unknown degree of error, the studies using these sources were excluded unless they contained correlations between intelligence and success (these correlations are too valuable to be discarded).4 5.3.2. Intelligence When correcting for unreliability in the test scores, test–retest alternate-form reliability (the correlation between parallel forms of the same test administered on two separate occasions) is generally considered to be the most appropriate form of reliability (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1999). But since these coefficients are rarely available, simple test–retest reliability is often taken as the second best option in meta-analytic studies of the predictive power of IQ scores (Judge, Colbert, &amp; Ilies, 2004; Salgado, Anderson, Moscoso, Bertua, &amp; Fruyt, 2003). Because test–retest reliability coefficients were reported in only a few studies, an average test–retest coefficient, obtained from the meta-analysis of Salgado et al. (2003), was used for most of the studies. Salgado et al. averaged 31 test–retest correlations of different general mental ability tests (the mean interval betwee</context>

Although it is sometimes claimed in popular press and textbooks that intelligence has no relationship to important real-life outcomes (see Barrett &amp; Depinet, 1991, for a review of such claims), the scientific research on the topic leaves little doubt that people with higher scores on IQ tests are better educated, hold more prestigious occupations, and earn higher incomes than people with lower scores (Gottfredson, 1997, 2003; Jensen, 1980, 1998; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Thus, the existence of an overall positive correlation between intelligence and socioeconomic success is beyond doubt. But quite surprisingly, the mere existence of this correlation seems to be the only fact that is established beyond doubt after many decades of research.

First, what is the approximate size of the correlation between intelligence and success? Is it large enough to be of any practical importance? While some researchers have said that this correlation is “larger than most found in psychological research” (Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004: 162), others are convinced that “IQ is just not an important enough determinant of economic success” (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 2002: 12). Second, how does the predictive power of intelligence compare to the predictive power of other variables, such as parental socioeconomic status (SES) or school grades? On the one hand there are studies showing that “individual ability is by far the strongest influence on occupational achievement” (Bond &amp; Saunders, 1999: 217). And yet other studies conclude that “the effect of socioeconomic background on each of the three adult status variables – schooling, income,</context>

These conclusions were challenged by Breen and Goldthorpe (1999, 2001) who argued that Saunders greatly overestimated the importance of intelligence by using inappropriate analytic techniques. 3. Previous reviews There have been surprisingly few attempts to systematically review the literature on intelligence and socioeconomic success. Reviewers typically cite only a couple of studies (see e.g., Brody, 1997; Farkas, 2003; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 2004). Some of the most comprehensive reviews have been conducted by Jencks (see Jencks et al., 1972, 1979). Two meta-analyses have so far addressed the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. Both of them used income as a measure of success. The more comprehensive one of the two was conducted by Bowles, Gintis, and Osborne (2001). They assembled 65 estimates from 24 studies to estimate the relationship between intelligence and income. The mean standardized regression coefficient of intelligence on income is .15 according to their study (p. 1154). In addition to that, Bowles et</context>

Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that considered several determinants of success at the same time (Duncan, 1968; Jencks et al., 1972; Sewell, Haller, &amp; Ohlendorf, 1970). But it was with the publication of The Bell Curve in 1994 (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) that the question of intelligence and socioeconomic success really came to public attention. Analyzing a representative longitudinal data set from the United States, Herrnstein and Murray found that intelligence is a better predictor of several desirable outcomes (e.g., not living in poverty, not being arrested) than is parental SES. They also found evidence that the role of intelligence in status attainment has been growing throughout the 20th century and concluded that the social structure of American so</context>

If the test was derived from other IQ tests or if it was described as a test of intelligence, then I included it in my study.

In order to provide a rough control for possible international differences, I also included a dummy variable that equals 1 if the study was conducted in the United States. Furthermore, in order to control for possible methodological differences that might arise from using raw data (see Section 5.3), I constructed a dummy variable that equals 1 if the correlation was calculated from raw data. Following the suggestions made by Steel and Kammeyer-Mueller (2002), weighted least squares regression analysis was used: each correlation was weighted by the inverse of its sampling error variance as described in Steel and Kammeyer-Mueller (2002: 100–101). 11 10 Dependent variables There is, of course, a threat that breaking the original sample into smaller samples might limit the variance of the variables.

Efforts to collect information about the existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been studied in continental Europe (see e.g., Flynn, 1987; Sternberg, 2004; Weinert &amp; Schneider, 1999) but I have not been able to find suitable data for the present study. The present study can also be criticized for underestimating the importance of the predictors of success; arguments can be offered for any of the three predictors (intelligence, parental SES, or academic performance) as to why their importance was underestimated. First, the present study used only three measures of social background (parental education, occupation, and income) and therefore, could have underestimated its importance.

Intelligence versus academic performance The question about the relative importance of mental ability and academic performance in predicting success has also been recognized as important (see Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1999). It is a question of what really matters for career success: is it one&amp;apos;s general ability (as measured by IQ tests) or the things one has learned at school and motivation to learn (as measured by school grades)? Not many studies have explicitly compared the predictive power of IQ scores and school grades (e.g., Taubman &amp; Wales, 1974, chapter 3). But the more general question about the usefulness of grades as predictors of success has been the object of considerable debate (see Roth, BeVier, Switzer, &amp; Schippmann, 1996; Roth &amp; Clark, 1998). The meta-analysis by Roth and Clark (1998), for instance, found an average correlation of .28 between grades and salary. Thus, contrary to some earlier claims (e.g., McClelland, 1973), grades have turned out to be good predictors of success. This literature is somewhat limited by being almost exclusively restricted to college grades. If the purpose is to compare grades and IQ test scor</context>

I also excluded the correlation if the range of one (or both) of the correlated variables was deliberately restricted by the research design. For example, in the study of gifted children by Terman and Oden (1947), the range of intelligence was severely restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs over 135; in the Polish study by Firkowska-Mankiewicz (2002), the range of intelligence was restricted by sampling only individuals with IQs below 86 or over 130.

The present paper will address these questions by conducting a meta-analysis of the longitudinal research on the relationship between intelligence and socioeconomic success. I will concentrate on longitudinal studies (where intelligence is measured before the actual success) because only longitudinal research design allows us to make conclusions about the possible causal impact of intelligence on success. 2. A brief history Longitudinal studies on the relationship between intelligence and career success have been conducted since the first decades of the 20th century (Ball, 1938; Thorndike et al., 1934). And these studies have invariably uncovered a positive relationship. The early studies, however, did not consider other possible determinants of success, most importantly parental SES. Therefore, they were open to the criticism that the positive relationship between intelligence and success might actually be the result of parental SES influencing them both (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 1976; McClelland, 1973). At the end of 1960s, with the inception of the status attainment research paradigm, investigators started to construct more sophisticated models of career advancement that considered several deter</context>

Including them in this paper will, consequently, allow us to better evaluate the role of intelligence in people&amp;apos;s career. 4.2.1. Intelligence versus parental SES The question about the relative importance of intelligence and parental SES in predicting success is one of the central questions of status attainment research. This is a question about the nature of the society we live in: whether a typical western society rewards people for their own abilities or their social background (Saunders, 1997; Turner, 1960)? But we are far from having a definite answer to this question. Some authors have found that intelligence outcompetes parental SES as a predictor (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994; Murray, 1998; Saunders, 1997). Others have replied that parental SES, if properly measured, is actually a better predictor (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974; Fischer et al., 1996). The seemingly greater predictive power of intelligence in some studies results from the failure to correct for measurement error in the measures of parental SES (Bowles &amp; Nelson, 1974) and the failure to include important aspects of parental status (most </context>

But so far as socioeconomic success can depend on the performance of specific work tasks, the possibility of declining validity of IQ is not completely ruled out. Several studies have correlated intelligence with success at different points in people&amp;apos;s life course. Some of them have found that the correlations indeed increase with age as predicted by the gravitational hypothesis (Brown &amp; Reynolds, 1975; Deary et al., 2005; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996), others have found no clear trend (Hauser, Warren, Huang, &amp; Carter, 1996; Warren, Sheridan, &amp; Hauser, 2002). The reviews by Hulin, Henry, and Noon (1990) and Keil and Cortina (2001) found support for the declining validity thesis but it should be noted that many of the studies reviewed in these papers used specific laboratory tasks as dependent variables and are, therefore, not directly comparable to the studies reviewed in the present paper. 4.3.3.

Efforts to collect information about the existing data sets should be continued. This applies especially to the data from outside the United States because U.S. data were clearly overrepresented in the present paper (see Section 6.1). Lack of data from continental Europe (e.g., Germany or France) demonstrates that intelligence as a scientific construct is primarily an Anglo-American invention and has not been very enthusiastically accepted in other scientific cultures. Of course, intelligence has been studied in continental Europe (see e.g., Flynn, 1987; Sternberg, 2004; Weinert &amp; Schneider, 1999) but I have not been able to find suitable data for the present study. The present study can also be criticized for underestimating the importance of the predictors of success; arguments can be offered for any of the three predictors (intelligence, parental SES, or academic performance) as to why their importance was underestimated. First, the present study used only three measures of social background (parental education, occupation, and income) and therefore, could have underestimated its importance. Although these three have always been the central indicators of social advantages, several a</context>

Parental income refers to father&amp;apos;s income or total income of parents. Because too few studies reported data on mother&amp;apos;s occupation, this variable was not included. In addition to these four, I also used a general index of SES, which combines several parental characteristics into one variable. A number of studies have used a composite index on the assumption that it is a better indicator of social advantages than any of the single variables that make up the index and, therefore, also a better predictor of success (see White, 1982, for supporting evidence). A correlation with SES index was included in the present metaanalysis if the index was composed of the following components — parental education (education of one or both parents), parental occupation (occupation of one or both parents), and material well-being of the parental home. The latter was measured by parental income or by a “possession index” which indicates how many of the valued items (e.g., a car, TV set, computer) were present at home. If a study did not use an index of SES but presented intercorrelations among the necessary variables, then I used the f</context>

As a possible limitation and implication for future research, it should also be noted that one of the big questions that looms behind every paper that deals with intelligence and success, the question of genetic versus environmental influences on IQ and social status, was not directly addressed in this paper. The fact that IQ scores predict socioeconomic success does not, in itself, tell us whether the effect of intelligence can be attributed to genes or environment. On the one hand, there is clear evidence that children&amp;apos;s IQ scores are correlated with parental SES (White, 1982), this result together with the fact that parental SES predicts socioeconomic success (see Table 1) can be interpreted as showing that environment is the “final cause” of one&amp;apos;s success or failure. This conclusion has been criticized for ignoring the genetic influences on parental SES (Jensen, 1998). On the other hand, the evidence on the heritability of intelligence (Devlin, Daniels, &amp; Roeder, 1997) and socioeconomic success (Rowe, Vesterdal, &amp; Rodgers, 1999) together with the evidence on the relationship between intelligence and success (see Table 1) can be taken as proof that parents&amp;apos; and ch</context>

In order to estimate the variability of the correlations, the standard deviation of original correlations and corrected standard deviation of corrected correlations (Hunter &amp; Schmidt, 2004: 126) were calculated. The 95% credibility intervals of sample size weighted corrected correlations were calculated to assess the presence of moderators. Moderators are present if the credibility intervals are large (over 0.11 according to Koslowsky &amp; Sagie, 1993) or include zero (see Whitener, 1990). Finally, 95% confidence intervals of the sample size weighted corrected correlations were calculated using the formula for heterogeneous studies (Whitener, 1990: 317). Confidence intervals can be used to assess the significance of the correlations (correlation is significantly different from zero if the confidence intervals do T.

According to the so-called gravitational hypothesis, the correlation between intelligence and success should grow stronger as individuals grow older because (as a result of selfselection and competition) individuals “gravitate” towards the positions that correspond to their ability levels as they progress in their careers. This reasoning has been used to support the idea that intellectual differences cumulate over life course and become progressively more important (see Gottfredson, 2003; Wilk &amp; Sackett, 1996). Other researchers have suggested that exactly the opposite is true: the predictive validity of IQ scores should decline as time goes by because less able people have time to accumulate skills to compensate for their initial lack of ability (Ackerman, 1987; Keil &amp; Cortina, 2001). These opposing views can be reconciled by saying that the idea of declining importance of IQ applies to the performance of specific tasks that become automatic after some practice and the idea of growing importance applies complex long term activities, such as attaining and maintaining social status, that never cease</context>
