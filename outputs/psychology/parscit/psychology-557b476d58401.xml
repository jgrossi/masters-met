Descriptive and transverse study aimed to examine the relationship between the level
of depression and the pattern of alcohol consumption in students of a public school
in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico. The sample reached 175 students of both sexes
between 15 and 19 years old selected by simple random sampling. It was used a document
containing personal data, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and the AUDIT test. It
was found that 96.6% of participants presented some level of depression, 97.9% were
women and 95.1% were men. Regarding the consumption of alcohol, 58.3% reported
consuming it, 14.3% with risk consumption, 2.9% with harmful use and 1.1% already
showed dependence. It was found that most young people consume alcohol and have

Introduction
Depression is considered a public health problem and
one of the most common disorders among the people of
different countries, currently occupying the fourth place
among the diseases with the greatest lack of capacity and
approximately 200 million people suffer from the same (1).
The World Health Organization estimates that by
2020 depression will be one of the most common disorders
and will occupy the second place among the causes of
disease(2); depression is classified within the disorders of
affect and is characterized by subjective feelings of grief,
sorrow, discouragement, loneliness and isolation with
changes in thought, behavior and somatic and affective
side which may hinder the normal functioning of the
human being(3).
www.eerp.usp.br/resmad
In Mexico it is estimated a prevalence of depression
of 12% to 20% among population of 18-65 years old,
5.8% of them are women and 2.5% are men(4). In the
state of Veracruz there is currently a rate of depression of
60.6% among the young population(5). Adolescence itself
is considered as a difficult phase that young people must
face, where it runs the risk of suffering from depression,
and the manifestations vary according to gender, values,
emotional adjustment and educational level, as well as the
environment where young people develop themselves(2).
Sometimes it presents itself as a transient and
common problem, where symptoms can be masked and
manifest themselves, in many cases, with substance abuse,
including alcohol and other drugs, as well as aggressive
SMAD, Rev. Eletrônica Saúde Mental Álcool Drog. Sept.-Dec. 2012;8(3):142-7.
behavior, learning disorders, propensity to automobile
accidents, excessive sexual conduct, compulsion to games
or food, diseases or reckless acts that endanger the lives of
young people(2).
With regard to alcohol consumption half of the
world’s population consumes it, even though there are
large differences among and within the countries, this
activity is part of the social and cultural practices in many
regions of the world(6).
Alcohol is a psychoactive substance that affects
the brain and most body organs of the consumer, also
impacting the people around them, relates to family
violence and fatal traffic accidents(6). Moreover,
contribute significantly to the overall number of deaths,
and is the fifth overall risk factor for premature death and
the lack of ability to work. It is estimated that in 2004 2.5
million people around the world died from causes related
to alcohol consumption, including 320,000 young people
of 15 to 19 years old(7).
In Mexico, the National Survey of Addictions
(N) 2008, indicates that nearly 27 million of Mexicans
between 12 and 65 drink large amounts of alcohol, and
higher levels of consumption are presented from 18 to 29
years old, highlighting a significant increase, especially
among teenagers. For Mexican adolescents beer is the
preferred drink, after the distillate and in a significantly
lower proportion, prepared drinks and wine(8).
Particularly in the state of Veracruz the ENA 2008
reports that the daily consumption of alcohol for men
(0.9%) is below the national average and women do not
present prevalence of daily consumption. The abuse/
dependence is find in both men (10.2%) and women
(1.5%), numbers within the national average, but that
represent a problem in the state of delicate health by the
absence of regulation on the sale to minors(8).
In young people the combination of curiosity, the
behavior associated with the tendency to take risks and
social pressures are important predisposing factors due
to the attitudes of approval and identification by the peers
constitute an important factor associated with alcohol
consumption in adolescents(9).
Repetitive and regular consumption of alcohol in
leisure moments may generate other problems such as
anxiety and depression, and then some adolescents use
alcohol regularly to compensate the anxiety, depression
and lack of positive social qualities(10).
As noted currently the consumption of alcohol by
adolescents is a threat to public health, not only a negative
impact on biological and physical, but also psychological
in those who consume it, which can cause many
psychiatric disorders, among which identifies depression,
and was identified that women are 3.7 times more likely to
experience a depressive episode than men(11).
According to what has been explained above this study
aimed to examine if there is a relationship between the
level of depression and the pattern of alcohol consumption
by students of a public school of the city of Coatzacoalcos,
Veracruz, Mexico.

Methodology

<bodyText confidence="0.998841541666666">
The design of this study was descriptive and
transversal. The population was formed by students
from a school located in the suburban area of the city of
Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico. 175 students of both
sexes participated in the sample, registered in the period
of 2010 and who was studying in the second and fourth
semester, selected by simple random probability sampling.
To collect the data were used a document with
identification data and two instruments, the first was Zung
Self-Rating Depression Scale, consisting of 20 Likert type
questions with four response options: 1 (nothing or a few
times) 2 (sometimes), 3 (often) and 4 (always); divided
into four categories: affective, physiological, psychomotor
and psychological. To determine the level of depression
the results were classified as follows: a score less than or
equal to 28 points means no depression, 29 to 41 is mild
depression, 42-53 is moderate depression and 54 points
or more is severe depression. Although the high scores
do not imply a diagnosis, allow to analyze the depressive
syndrome in its different symptomatic aspects(12,13). In this
study the reliability reported by this scale was 80.
The second instrument was the proof of Identification
of Alcohol Use Disorders AUDIT, an instrument with crosscultural validity used to identify excessive consumption of
alcohol; it is composed of 10 reactive, examines the use of
alcohol during the past 12 months and was approved in the
Mexican population. It has a maximum value of 40 points
and a minimum value of zero, the higher score means
higher alcohol consumption, dependence and harm(14).
The internal consistency of the instrument reported in this
study was 0.86.
In the ethical aspect the research was based on the
provisions of the general law of health in research for
health issued by the Health Secretary in 1987(15). For the
realization of the project it was expected the approval of
the ethics committee of the nursing college of Minatitlan
campus of Veracruzana University as well as approval
of the authorities of the institution of education. To
collect the first information it was sought the school,
where through a list were selected the students who
participate in this study and were informed about the
informed consent to ensure the reliability of information
and that they would not be identified in any part of the
study. After formalized with the signing of the consent,
it was proceeded the implementation of the instruments
in a time of approximately 25 minutes. At the end of
data collection, its storage and analysis was proceeded
through Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
[SPSS] statistical program, Spanish version 17.0.

Due to the level of depression the findings show
that 96.6% of the participant showed some level of
depression according to the measuring scale of Zung.
This is a worrying result as this situation may represent a
failure in young people to respond to the demands of the
environment, putting them at risk of making poor decisions
that can severely affect their mental health.

By analyzing the levels of depression by gender, it is
observed in Table 1 that women have a greater tendency
to depression 97.9%, highlighting 3.2% that presents
indicators of severe depression which could be affecting
the mental and physics health of these young people. In
men this variable is presented as a lower number (95.1%).
Although the difference is minimal it is noteworthy that
mild depression (51.3%) was greater in men than in
women, representing that the depressive phenomenon
already impacts in this group of the population with
common health implications in this situation.
With regard to alcohol consumption, it is observed in
Table 2 that 58.3% of these young people indicated to have
consumed alcohol, 40% do this consumption as normal,
however 14.3% are consuming within the risk standard;
stands out 2.9% that informs to consume in a harmful way
and 1.1% that is already showing signs of dependence
according to the AUDIT scale parameters, which can mean
that these young people have reflexes in their physical
and mental health in short or long term if they continue
consuming within these parameters.

Analyzing alcohol consumption according to gender
it is observed in Table 3 that the gender difference is not
very large due to 67.5% of men and 50.5% of women who
have already consumed alcohol. According to the risky
consumption, 13.8% of men manifest this pattern fewer
than reported by women, since 14.7% of those who reported
drinking alcoholic beverages do this in a risky way, data
that highlight that these young teens are consuming more
than men, which could trigger an increase in consumption
levels if they continue with that habitual consumption,
without discarding a possible future dependency. About
the harmful and damaging consumption they are presented
only in men with 6.3% and 2.5% respectively, data that
show the age so low of these young people, it looks like
they have already problems with their way of consuming
alcohol.
When performing the analysis of the relationship
between alcohol consumption and depression, Table 4
shows that 98.3% of young people reported consuming
alcohol and had some level of depression, but it is
important to mention that the majority of students who
said not drinking alcohol also reported some level of
depression, as only 1.7% of abstainers did not show any
level of depression.
It is worth noting the presence of severe depression
levels in 3 students, of which 2 reported consuming
without risk and one does not consume alcohol.

The results of this study identified the prevalence
of depression and alcohol consumption in young students
of a public school of Coatzacoalcos city, Veracruz,
Mexico. It was found that 96.6% of young people between
15 and 19 years old had some level of depression, this is
similar to the results of Balcázar and Col.(2), in their study
they mentioned that adolescence is a stage of life where
young people are more vulnerable to present some level of
depression.
In relation to gender and the presence of
depression, it was found 97.9% in women and 95.1% in
men, which coincides with that reported by CONADIC,
when it mentions that in women there is more likely to
have a depressive episode than in men(11). Although the
difference is minimal, which follows the characteristic of
females with greater predisposition to suffer depression, it
is alarming to note that men are showing a higher percentage
of mild depression, which also gives the estimated by
WHO(6), indicating that this suffering will increase and that
depression will be one of the most common disorders and
will occupy the second place among the causes of illness
in the general population.
With regard to alcohol consumption was identified
that 40.7% of this population reports being abstinent,
58.3% consumes alcohol, 40% drinks as a normal way,
17.2% are within the risk standard and 1.1% already have
a probable dependence. What coincides reported by the
www.eerp.usp.br/resmad
ENA of the state of Veracruz(8) which indicates that the
abuse/dependence is within the national average. However
it is important to note that be within the national average
does not mean normality and these young people are
suffering physical and/or emotional problems due to their
drinking.
In relation to gender was observed that men are
showing higher consumption than women. However, this
study finds that it is women who are consuming in a risky
way, fact checking with the national ENA reported in 2008
(8)
which reflects a notable increase in the consumption of
alcohol by female adolescents.
Regarding the consumption of alcohol and the
level of depression this study found that levels of moderate
and severe depression were presented more frequently
in young people who reported consuming alcohol in the
normal, dependent and harmful ways than those who
reported not consuming. A possible relationship between
alcohol consumption and the depression, similar to the
way identified study Christie Burke and Cols.(15), supported
the research which found a high relationship between
depression and alcohol consumption.
Conclusion
The results showed that most young people have
levels of depression and alcohol consumption. Depression
predominated in women and students consumers. This
highlights that the mental health of these young people
Hernández-Cortaza BA, Cortaza-Ramírez L, Costa Jr ML.
are being affected by the levels of depression that they
present, situation which, if continues without being
resolved, could increase the risky behaviors, including
alcohol consumption, that is only one alternative in which
young people find a free expression for their sad emotions.
