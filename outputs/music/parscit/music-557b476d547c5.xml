Abstract This work explores the study of interaction through discourse as a means for
analysing and understanding the process of teaching and learning music. Over the course of
a didactic sequence, we assess classroom conversations dealing with the analysis of a music
score constituted as the reference for the process of creating a joint music composition. The
group is made up of a teacher and second-year elementary pupils (aged 9–10 years) at a
music school. Eight categories of discourse are identified that help to understand the
strategies used to construct shared musical meanings. This knowledge is important for
practitioners when reflecting on the teaching-learning process. It is also useful for teacher
training.

Shared meaning . Sociocultural perspective
This study forms part of a set of investigations whose objective is to understand the
teaching and learning processes that occur during the elementary cycle of music studies
(8–12 years). The description, analysis and comprehension of these processes,
specifically progress in the acquisition of knowledge and joint construction, are
approached from the interdisciplinary perspective of the psychology of education and
the didactics of music.
The study forms part of a teaching innovation project (in development since 1998) at a
municipal school of music in a town in the Vallès Occidental region of Barcelona, in
collaboration with lecturers and researchers from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona
(UAB).
The innovation, research and teacher-training project was initially defined on the basis of
some innovative principles of teaching and learning (Malagarriga 2002) aimed at bringing
about substantial changes in the way the school operates. The way content is organised and
presented in class is the consequence of a major shift in methodology, and poses the
teachers unresolved questions concerning evaluation (Viladot et al. 2005; Malagarriga et al.
2008). For this reason, the school staff and the researchers are seeking to progressively
establish a shared theoretical framework by which to guide analysis and reflection
regarding what is done in practice (Viladot 2005).
Musical activity as a shared meaning activity
A consensus regarding the characterisation of the constructivist approach in education has
been identified in recent years, which has led to the development of applications and
research. Examples of this are the first formulation in the Spanish context by César Coll
(1990) and the recent compilation and analysis of constructivist perspectives in education
by Rosario Cubero (2005).
The constructivist framework applied to education processes by these and other
authors constitutes the integration of principles originating from different psychological
traditions. Our option also assumes the postulations of the sociocultural perspective
whose origins lie in the work of Vygotsky and his followers. This tradition postulates that
cognition begins in social situations in which children, pupils or inexpert people share
responsibility for an activity with an adult, teacher or expert during the production of a
joint project. Contingent forms of assistance, those which are established and provided
depending on what the learner is unable to do alone, make it possible for any specific
project to be completed. In other words, through shared interaction and activity, the
expert or educator supplements the learner during his or her first attempts at
appropriation, and progressively structures the system of assistance needed (Bruner

1975, 1978). This scaffolding guides interest towards the task; it reduces the degree of
difficulty or simplifies the situation in such a way that the learner is able to manipulate the
components of the process; it maintains the activity by directing the actions, highlighting
aspects, by controlling frustration and risk during resolution, and by providing models
(Wood et al. 1976, 1978). The structure may consist of more intensive practical assistance
during the first phase of the process, which is gradually reduced and replaced by the
provision of psychological support; that is, by monitoring the progressive increase in the
apprentice’s skills from a distance.
Bruner (1975, 1978) and Rogoff (1990), among other authors, characterise these
processes, and describe the creation of situations that favour the transfer of responsibilities
from adults to children, progressively developing their autonomy. These same processes
could occur in a classroom situation although the relationship is not purely adult-to-child, as
classmates can also be a source of help to each other.
The sociocultural approach in education gives relevance to teaching, and it is also a
means of facilitating the appropriation of cultural instruments, which leads to the
development of higher psychological processes. In the words of Vygotsky (1978), it is
the process of interiorisation that makes it possible to reconstruct inter-psychological
operations on an intra-psychological level within the context of social phenomena or
activities using signs. So, in short, children’s participation in cultural activities under the
guidance of others enables them to internalise their community’s tools for thinking. This
vision is particularly useful for understanding the teaching and learning processes
produced in musical instruction, both in instrument classes and in the teaching of musical
language. Following the Vygotskian approach, musical language can be understood as a
sign or code, with the musical instrument that the child learns to play being the cultural
tool.
Therefore, the approach presented seems especially adequate and useful for the context
in which we undertake our activities. A music school is a place where new generations are
helped in the appropriation of the highly appreciated cultural content of music and where
the activity of making music is shared.
Under the aforementioned prism, interactions are considered to be the central axis of
educational practice. Through these, participants construct and reconstruct their mental
representations in relation to socially established meanings. It is essential to take into
consideration the group as the true subject of the teaching and learning process. Part of the
construction and appropriation of musical knowledge is explained on the basis of discourse,
produced and negotiated in the context of an activity shared by the group. Thus, learning in
the classroom becomes possible thanks to the communication that occurs and is developed
among the participants; it could thus be described as a conversation in which teachers and
pupils are involved. Along these lines, Potter (1996) defines discourse through speech and
classroom texts as actions that are situated, articulated and co-constructed in the ambit of
social interaction.
Musical activity and discourse in the classroom
In musical education, there is a certain tradition of using different modes of representation
(kinaesthetic, visual and verbal) as tools for a progressive approximation to the
conceptualisation of musical language. Gesture, graphic representations and speech come
together to facilitate the processes of perception, experimentation, symbolization and
representation of actions during the course of musical teaching and learning activities.

L. Viladot et al.
Each mode of representation offers different potential meanings and limitations. In the
classroom, a change between modes represents a change in the learner’s mental possibilities
and demands in intellectual and affective terms. In this sense, action, image, gesture and
discourse construct meaning and offer the way to modulate the pupils’ vision of the world
(Franks and Jewitt 2001).
Having recognised the implication and pattern of all these forms of expression in
musical education (Malagarriga and Viladot 2004; Viladot 2005), we take a didactic
sequence as the object of study and show how verbal language supports a certain type of
activity that promotes the appropriation of musical language content.
In socioconstructivist terms, verbal language is the language that constitutes the material
support of communicational activity and regulates the teaching and learning processes, even
though musical language is the main content being taught. Classroom conversation makes it
possible to present, analyse, comment upon and evaluate the characteristics of the music
being heard, being produced, or being observed in written form, and helps to foster and
elaborate upon musical knowledge (Viladot et al. 2008a, b). In this sense, and taking the
lead from Lemke (1993) when he sustains that “learning science means learning to talk
science”, we could hypothesise that learning music means learning to talk music. In this
study, conversation is treated in Mercer’s terms, as a form of intellectual activity, as a social
way of thinking (Mercer 2004).
There are number of authors who have studied discourse analysis as a means of
understanding teaching and learning processes (see, for example: Edwards and Mercer
1987; Mercer 1995, 1997, 2000, 2004; Barnes and Todd 1995; Coll 2001; Nerland 2007).
However, while it is much more present in other areas of the curriculum the perspective of
discourse analysis has received little attention so far in music-teaching research. In the
Spanish context, we could make particular mention of the work by Nussbaum (2001) and
Camps (2006) on the didactics of language; Jiménez et al. (2003) on the didactics of
science; and Gorgorió and Planas (2004) and Planas (2005) on mathematics. This research
takes inspiration from the above-mentioned authors and constitutes an attempt to explore
and evaluate the usefulness of this type of analysis in the comprehension of teaching and
learning processes within the field of music.
Objectives and methodology
The aim of the work is to explore the study of classroom interaction through discourse
analysis in order to understand the process of the teaching and learning of musical content.
We work on the hypothesis that the analysis of classroom conversation is useful for
showing some of the principles defended above.
Throughout a didactic sequence of six sessions, we identify modalities of discourse and
analyse the meanings that the participants construct. We employ the qualitativeinterpretative paradigm and adopt the case study, which enables our in-depth comprehension of complex real-world settings (Stake 1994).
The class group chosen for the case study is made up of seven girls and five boys of
between 9 and 10 years of age, attending second-year elementary-grade music language
classes (music theory and sol-fa) at a music school. The instruments that form part of the
sound world of the classroom, since they are used in these classes, are five violins, two
pianos (one wall piano and one electric), two concert flutes, one recorder, one cello and one
guitar.

This class group was selected for different reasons: for 3 years, they had followed the
pilot methodological innovation programme; they were used to the presence of a researcher
in the classroom and to being observed and recorded on video. The age of the members
made it possible to treat the interview as a complementary methodological instrument and
to obtain data about their perceptions of their own learning processes.
The principles that guided the methodological innovations were taken from Malagarriga’s
work, where she proposes some goals for organising the music curricula for 5-year-olds at
unspecialised schools. They are as follows: to combine creation, interpretation and listening;
to integrate sound experimentation and elements of the cultural heritage; and to consider
the teaching-learning process as communicative and guided involvement in the common
activity (Malagarriga 2002).
A way of introducing and adapting those principles to a music school is by working on a
project-based approach divided into learning units. Each unit contains songs and pieces of
music that students listen to or play, and with some constitutive music elements they can
identify. This way of working also presents different proposals about the creation (musicmaking) in which educators and learners are urged to use the musical elements discovered
in the aforementioned pieces, which are taken as a reference.
The six-session didactic sequence subject to analysis uses different reference works and
activities that enable music to be approached and experienced through different possibilities
and demands. For this study, we selected activities based around Cuban Landscape with Rain,
by L. Brouwer (see Appendix I), which were carried out during the entire sequence. These
were varied activities and they make reference to both Brouwer’s original piece and to the
musical composition that the group created during the sessions, inspired by the structure and
rhythms of the aforementioned work. So, for example, in the first session, the teacher
presented the piece by speaking about the composer; the class listened to it for the first time;
they experienced it with free body movements; they talked about its structure; and, finally,
they expressed certain movements agreed by the group. However, in session 6, the process
of constructing their work of music came to an end, whereupon they reviewed its structure
and then fine-tuned certain elements while performing it together.
The case was approached through direct and non-participant observation (one of the
researchers was present in the classroom during the sessions); classroom notes; and semistructured interviews with the teacher and with students. We used video recordings of the
six musical-language classes (2 h a week) that constitute the teaching sequence, as well as
transcriptions of discourse fragments.
We focused our analysis on the four moments of the sequence dedicated to the
observation and analysis of L. Brouwer’s score, as these are considered a key activity
through which elements they have heard are identified and expressed corporally, new
elements are discovered, the structure of the piece is highlighted, an analysis is made of the
graphical representation (this implies the metre, tune, notes, rhythms and rhythmic and
melodic interpretation of the melody played by the four guitars), and the composer’s
decisions are commented upon. The proposals serve as a source for the configuration and
analysis of the group&apos;s own composition.
The fragments of the discourse corresponding to the study are produced as follows:

On a first level of analysis, we broke each session down into different types of activities
depending on the change in content, the structure of the social participation and the
objectives (see Appendix II). We then selected the activities dealing with the observation
and analysis of the score titled Cuban Landscape with Rain, we transcribed the
conversations (the original discourse was in Catalan) and divided each of the participants’
interventions into corresponding units, and we grouped the interventions into broader,
interactive units. Most of these units correspond to the successive series of IRF (Initiation–
Response–Follow up/Feedback) sequences in classroom conversations (Sinclair and
Coulthard 1975). We added the first comments to the units in order to analyse the
meanings constructed by the participants. To do this, we took into account classroom notes
and information provided by the teacher. We present one example on continuation
(Table 1).
Successive redevelopment of the analyses enabled us to construct categories. The
different modalities of the discourse identified through the four analysed conversations
were reduced into eight discursive categories that correspond to the strategies used by
the teacher to conduct the activity towards the proposed objective. Van Dijk and
Kintsch (1983) defined discursive strategies as linguistic and extra-linguistic resources
that the speaker uses intentionally to increase the efficiency of communication. This
includes the strictly verbal, but also other forms of representation (gestures, music,
pictures, etc). Wood et al. (1976, 1978) identified strategies to solve problems in the joint
construction. We also use the term strategy because the forms of discourse that we
analysed constitute resources whose objective is to regulate the students’ process of
constructing meaning.
We decided to qualify the categories as interactive only if we were able to consider that
what the teacher and learners said or did was elaborated upon in the conversation and was
related to an element of the content being dealt with. The categories all arose on the basis of
the analysis of the discourse and were created inductively in consideration of the underlying
intentions, depending on the context, of each of the interventions. The observer and

researchers worked on the recorded and transcribed data until they reached a consensus
regarding the formulation and description of the categories.
To delimit the categories, a consensus procedure was followed systematically: two
analysts working independently deduced the first categories from the available data
(transcriptions and first notes); they contrasted the results and discussed their discrepancies,
refining the description of the categories throughout the process. This process was repeated
continually until the two analysts coincided in their categorisation of the whole of the
corpus.

Propose and resolve a question (PQ)
A question is formulated that involves thinking about the answer. Sometimes this happens
by pointing at the score. This is the format corresponding to the first phase of IRF linguistic
structure (Initiation).
PQ seeks to cognitively draw attention towards a specific aspect. This educational
discourse is the format most commonly used in classroom interaction and seeks to guide
learners’ construction of knowledge in an active and personal manner on the basis of one’s
own thought processes.
In this case, PQ makes it possible to situate oneself at a similar phase of development to
that of the students: “[...] Can you read these notes that are so high?” It helps to resolve
questions by getting a more able learner to act as a bridge between the teacher and the rest
of the group: “[...] so which one is it? This one.” The teacher points at it and Be answers:
“The A.” The teacher continues: “This is A. Did you all know that? Did you all know that
this is high A?” And PQ makes increasingly more complex demands by encouraging
thought and deduction: “Ah! And how many extra lines, ledgers, do we add to the staff?
Because it looks like we have to add them to the staff...”
Refer to and elaborate on the content using examples (CE)
The content is treated inductively through identification of elements on the score that refer
to it or that are constituent parts of the same. For example: “What note does Brouwer&apos;s Rain
start with?” And Be replies: “It’s a D.” And another example is: “Do you know where it
says that? Can you see where it says that? We musicians write it like that; we use this

abbreviation, times four. It’s written there. Show us, Be.” Be points to where “×4” is
written.
CE is an aid for consolidating the construction of specific concepts when we find
ourselves in difficult situations and moments.
Refer to the content with the help of general features (CG)
CG is a resource that involves the introduction of conventional terminology and helps
configure concepts by explaining a given characteristic. This helps develop shared
reference terms and mental representations. For example: “But it does not go in
neighbouring tones. It doesn’t go in neighbouring tones, does it? It jumps, like arpeggios
do. We musicians say that it goes up and down in arpeggios”.
Relate to one’s own experience (RE)
An exercise in reflection by which learners become aware of whether content is present in
other personal-learning situations—for example, whether or not they use their instruments
to play the kind of notes that appear for the first time.
RE implies raising awareness of the instruments that form part of the group, which
makes them feel more like the protagonists of the teaching and learning process. It is
stimulating, because they share what they know, and this goes on to form part of
collective knowledge. This involves asking: “Do you ever have to read such high
notes?” “I do sometimes.” It involves being reflexive: “And you flautists, do you only
read ledger lines above the staff?” “And C below!” And it involves relating: “On the
other hand, does Ra (cellist) have to read such high notes?” “I read them, but in the key
of F.”
Reinforce and delimit a response (RR)
An answer is repeated or reformulated in order to reinforce it and also to delimit it when it
is right. At the same time, precisions or new information can be added. It is used to reaffirm
that what was said was right, which moves the content along. For example: “And you
flautists, do you only read ledger lines above the staff?” Be replies: “And C below!” The
teacher follows up with: “And C below. Well, we all know C below, don’t we? That one’s
easy”.
RR forms a characteristic part of the IRF linguistic structure present in classroom
conversations for any subject (follow up or feedback). It is used to accredit what has been
learned and shared. What is common and valid adds continuity to the discourse.
Resituate to maintain the content being dealt with (RC)
The content is re-established through reformulation, execution or listening in order to
continue with the analysis. It can play the role of eliciting content dealt with before for
purposes of reuse, or to synthesise or present the context as a whole that needs further work.
For example: “Ah! So you did part of a scale, did you? With neighbouring tones that go up
and down! G-A-B-C-D, D-C-B-A-G. G-A-B-C-D, D-C-B-A-G and I told you: “I think
musicians do something similar. Look, I’ll bring you the enlarged score.”

L. Viladot et al.
Structure social participation (SP)
The tasks and the participation of the members of the group in the shared task are delimited.
These are moments when a transition occurs in the activity and it is useful to resituate forms
of participation (what each person should do) in order to continue the session. For example:
“Did you see that? It’s repeated four times. And the second raindrop, who was it, Mi? Who
didn’t come out the other day? Come on, La. And the third drop? You come up, Xa, and
fourth, Jo.” Here the teacher puts on the music and Cr starts pointing at the score while
following the beat.
Identify and interpret error (IE)
The errors produced in verbal and nonverbal discourse are identified and explained. In a
guided and directed exercise it is hard for errors to occur frequently. But they do happen.
The identification of errors contributes to learning, especially when they are commented
upon. For example: “It was a bit fast, OK, but that can happen in the first bars because it’s
hard to catch the tempo. But what else? What else happened, Ra?” “It needs to be in the
same bar.”
Table 2 indicates the frequency of the different categories per session.
The categories appearing most frequently are 5 and 1 (RR and PC). Both are related to
and are part of the formats that involve the most frequent interaction in the class
conversation context. These are followed by 2 (CE) and 4 (RE), which appear 12 and 11
times, respectively. Category 3 (CG) rarely appears, as it is specific to occasions when new
content is introduced.
Some of the categories identified, specifically Refer to the content with the help of
general features (CG), Reinforce and delimit a response (RR) and Resituate in order to
maintain the content being dealt with (RC), highlight the function of attracting, eliciting
and maintaining the content for its explanation, negotiation and elaboration by the
participants in the form of a joint construction.
The most analytical aspect of learning can be identified in the category Refer to and
elaborate upon the content using examples (CE) and in Identify and interpret error (IE).
These refer to elements of the musical-language content being dealt with.

The search for sense in the learning process is identifiable in the category of Relate
things to our own experiences (RE), given that reference to other contexts benefits the
constitution of meaningful learning.
Structure social participation (SP) and Propose and resolve a question (PQ) are more
aimed at the function of approaching the task in such a way that the group functions
efficiently and collaboratively.
Categories 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, very much in evidence in the first conversation,
indicate a greater desire to guide the class on the part of the teacher at the beginning
of the activity concerned with the analysis of the score—in other words, more intense
intervention in order to orientate and regulate the process during the initial stages of
the activity.

<bodyText confidence="0.999464">
Through the analysis of the didactic sequence, we observe that the teacher makes no
attempt to avoid the possible difficulties implicit in the score of the chosen piece, as this
would reduce the significance of the whole process. The complete original score is
presented, and through discourse and listening to fragments, its different elements are
specified. The aim is to guide the group’s activity and provide support when any obstacles
arise. Therefore, when new content emerges, such as ledger notes, it is dealt with even
though it may not form part of the programme that the children of this age are currently
studying. The teacher uses her students’ differing knowledge to encourage them to
exchange experiences. They have to refer to their instruments: they have to reflect on and
relate the content they are dealing with to their own experiences as musicians.
Conversation among this class group benefits the social construction of knowledge.
Shared interaction and activity generates a process of transferring signs—for example,
ledger line notes, the symbol for repeating bars and how many times (×4), ascending and
descending scales that do not use neighbouring tones, arpeggio. The teacher’s intervention
is the key to these processes of exchange and negotiation, for it is through the processes of
guided participation (Rogoff 1990) that she mediates, assists and guides the process of
identifying elements, introducing concepts, generalising, relating to one’s own experiences,
etc.
It is also the teacher who looks for the chance to transfer responsibilities. She appeals to
the knowledge of a student who is more advanced in terms of the specific content, in order
for that student to participate in the process. An example of this is the moment when a
learner anticipates the reading of the next bar after the one the teacher is singing, thus
showing that she has taken in what the task involves and, in turn, she is able to deduce the
answer herself without having to be asked explicitly to identify another note of the same
characteristics (see Table 1).
The style of teaching observed ties in perfectly with the focus of the methodological
proposal that characterises teaching innovation in the centre under study. We could describe
it as a constructivist style of teaching that favours meaningful learning. The explicit
principles of the didactic approach—to combine creation, interpretation and listening; to
integrate sound experimentation and elements of the cultural heritage; and to consider the
teaching-learning as a communicative process and a guided participation in the common
activity—are reflected in the resulting discursive strategies.
Our analysis also refers us back to the contributions of other authors, in particular the
work of Cecilia Hultberg. In the results of her research (Hultberg 2002) we observe two

L. Viladot et al.
possible approaches to music notation made by the music pupils in the interpretation
activity: reproductive and exploratory. In her proposal concerning a theory of instrumental
training where three models of teaching are represented, we identified the analysed practice
with the third model, described as follows: the teacher uses the printed score as a tool for
communicating with the composer, and at the same time establishes a dialogue with the
students constructing musical meaning, taking into account the students’ ideas about the
notation. We consider this way of teaching to be constructivist, and this is also the case of
our study.
In addition, we recalled the scaffolding strategies identified by Wood et al. (1976) and
mentioned by Kennell (2002) in his revision: Recruitment; Marking Critical Features;
Task Manipulation; Demonstration; Direction Maintenance; Frustration Control.
Although the educational context of these authors is very different from ours, and also
the tasks and ages of the participants, we are able to identify parallelisms in the strategies
that have a regulating role in the activity. The category Structure social participation
corresponds to Recruitment, even though the latter refers to the synchronisation of
attention and action between teacher and student and in our case we are referring to group
management during a shared activity. We also note similarities between Identify and
interpret error and Marking critical features, because both make explicit the discrepancies between what a learner says or does and what the teacher or tutor would recognise
as satisfactory work. As regards frustration control, we have no strategy corresponding to
this function. But, on the other hand, we put forward Propose and resolve a question and
Relate to one’s own experience (RE) which are not represented in the work of the
aforementioned authors.
The remaining categories respond clearly to the characteristics of the task and, as we
said above, they are of a very different nature. Thus, Task Manipulation, Demonstration
and Direction Maintenance are particular to the manipulative task proposed by Wood,
Bruner &amp; Ross, while Reinforce and delimit a response and Resituate to maintain the
content being dealt with correspond to an analytical task.
In the context of this sequence, learning progress materialises in the form of an increase
in score-reading skills; interpretation in the sense proposed by Casas and Pozo (2008) as
the process of reading and comprehending a piece before moving on to its musical
production. This process gradually enables the group to make decisions in relation to their
own musical composition.
... is it what? Easy for us to try? They’ve decided that their music will do this: go up
and down, up and down. That’s what they do (pointing at the flautists). Rising and
falling. Oh yes! Rising and falling and in neighbouring tones, right?” (fragment
corresponding to the third session, Table 4)
The composition of the group’s own piece of music is the objective that embodies the result
of a process of establishing a context in which it is possible to talk to make sense of what is
being done and to negotiate meanings.
In this dialogue context, the interlocutors construct and reconstruct their mental
representations of the musical content. For Edwards and Mercer (1987), these representations are shared terms of reference, in that they are understood to be the intermental and
intersubjective reference that defines, creates and involves the participants in the
communication process. Participants therefore share the same definition of the
situation and bring different semiotic mechanisms into play that arise in specific uses
of the language and appropriate forms of discourse (Wertsch 1985). Thus, the learner
Sharing meanings in the music classroom

<bodyText confidence="0.977802840909091">
grasps the criteria that music uses by legitimating one particular explanation as opposed
to others.
The specific terminology of the field is not only used to refer to such new content as
ledger line notes or arpeggio but rather it is used as a means for appropriation throughout
the entire discourse in general: the names of specific notes are mentioned, graphic symbols
are analysed, musical instruments are spoken about and terminology for the characteristics
of sound are used. This ties in with the ideas of Lemke (1993), when he says that the
use of discourse in accordance with the rules of the particular context characterises
progress in the knowledge of a specific area, be it scientific or artistic. We consider that
the appropriation of specific discourse, of a form of activity in which words are used to
construct the meaning of the experience, facilitates the conceptual learning of music, as in
the case studied.
Final remarks
Analysis of educational discourse shows how musical content emerges from the totality of
the observation of a general score. Such analysis also shows the kind of methodological
approaches and linguistic structures that accompany it.
The methodological perspective of discourse analysis can therefore help understand
the teaching and learning processes and the process of students’ construction of musical
content in the music classroom. We are convinced of the usefulness of discourse
analysis and the identification of discursive strategies in order to understand the teacher
and the learners’ actions and to try to explain the mutual influences involved in joint
action and the construction of shared meanings. As teacher trainers, we are also
convinced of the usefulness of this knowledge for teacher training. And as teacher
trainers we are involved in the attempt to make clear the required relationship between
theory and practice.
The analysis of interaction through discourse shows itself to be useful in the field
of research shared by the psychology of education and by specific didactics because it
enables us to describe and explain a number of didactic strategies and learning
processes.
We are aware that our work is only of an exploratory nature and that we need to carry
out further research to provide more evidence, especially in view of the fact that we are
involved in the field of music education where little work has been done and, moreover, in
the context of non-compulsory schooling. Different musical education activities need to be
analysed and contrasted with different didactic sequences. Looking for common ground and
differences in the application of the school curriculum (maths, verbal language, etc.) would
be interesting and useful for teacher training practice. Furthermore, the similarities we have
found between work done 30 years ago (see Wood et al. 1976) and our own are a source of
encouragement with regard to carrying out further research. Although it is not easy, our aim
is to continue exploring this methodological approach in order to look in more depth at the
inter- and intra-psychological processes that arise in the classroom.
Acknowledgments We would like to thank Mariona Martínez and all the children in the group for kindly
welcoming us into their music language classes. We are also grateful to Sant Cugat del Vallès City Council

In this sense, and taking the lead from Lemke (1993) when he sustains that “learning science means learning to talk science”, we could hypothesise that learning music means learning to talk music. In this study, conversation is treated in Mercer’s terms, as a form of intellectual activity, as a social way of thinking (Mercer 2004). There are number of authors who have studied discourse analysis as a means of understanding teaching and learning processes (see, for example: Edwards and Mercer 1987; Mercer 1995, 1997, 2000, 2004; Barnes and Todd 1995; Coll 2001; Nerland 2007). However, while it is much more present in other areas of the curriculum the perspective of discourse analysis has received little attention so far in music-teaching research. In the Spanish context, we could make particular mention of the work by Nussbaum (2001) and Camps (2006) on the didactics of language; Jiménez et al. (2003) on the didactics of science; and Gorgorió and Planas (2004) and Planas (2005) on mathematics.

The structure may consist of more intensive practical assistance during the first phase of the process, which is gradually reduced and replaced by the provision of psychological support; that is, by monitoring the progressive increase in the apprentice’s skills from a distance. Bruner (1975, 1978) and Rogoff (1990), among other authors, characterise these processes, and describe the creation of situations that favour the transfer of responsibilities from adults to children, progressively developing their autonomy. These same processes could occur in a classroom situation although the relationship is not purely adult-to-child, as classmates can also be a source of help to each other. The sociocultural approach in education gives relevance to teaching, and it is also a means of facilitating the appropriation of cultural instruments, which leads to the development of higher psychol</context>

Participants therefore share the same definition of the situation and bring different semiotic mechanisms into play that arise in specific uses of the language and appropriate forms of discourse (Wertsch 1985).

We could describe it as a constructivist style of teaching that favours meaningful learning. The explicit principles of the didactic approach—to combine creation, interpretation and listening; to integrate sound experimentation and elements of the cultural heritage; and to consider the teaching-learning as a communicative process and a guided participation in the common activity—are reflected in the resulting discursive strategies. Our analysis also refers us back to the contributions of other authors, in particular the work of Cecilia Hultberg. In the results of her research (Hultberg 2002) we observe two 60 L. Viladot et al. possible approaches to music notation made by the music pupils in the interpretation activity: reproductive and exploratory. In her proposal concerning a theory of instrumental training where three models of teaching are represented, we identified the analysed practice with the third model, described as follows: the teacher uses the printed score as a tool for communicating with the composer, and at the same time establishes a dialogue with the students constructing musical meaning, taking into account the students’ ideas about the notation.

The specific terminology of the field is not only used to refer to such new content as ledger line notes or arpeggio but rather it is used as a means for appropriation throughout the entire discourse in general: the names of specific notes are mentioned, graphic symbols are analysed, musical instruments are spoken about and terminology for the characteristics of sound are used. This ties in with the ideas of Lemke (1993), when he says that the use of discourse in accordance with the rules of the particular context characterises progress in the knowledge of a specific area, be it scientific or artistic. We consider that the appropriation of specific discourse, of a form of activity in which words are used to construct the meaning of the experience, facilitates the conceptual learning of music, as in the case studied.

The principles that guided the methodological innovations were taken from Malagarriga’s work, where she proposes some goals for organising the music curricula for 5-year-olds at unspecialised schools. They are as follows: to combine creation, interpretation and listening; to integrate sound experimentation and elements of the cultural heritage; and to consider the teaching-learning process as communicative and guided involvement in the common activity (Malagarriga 2002). A way of introducing and adapting those principles to a music school is by working on a project-based approach divided into learning units. Each unit contains songs and pieces of music that students listen to or play, and with some constitutive music elements they can identify. This way of working also presents different proposals about the creation (musicmaking) in which educators and learners are urged to use the musical elements discovered in the aforementioned pieces, which are taken as a reference.

It is essential to take into consideration the group as the true subject of the teaching and learning process. Part of the construction and appropriation of musical knowledge is explained on the basis of discourse, produced and negotiated in the context of an activity shared by the group. Thus, learning in the classroom becomes possible thanks to the communication that occurs and is developed among the participants; it could thus be described as a conversation in which teachers and pupils are involved. Along these lines, Potter (1996) defines discourse through speech and classroom texts as actions that are situated, articulated and co-constructed in the ambit of social interaction. Musical activity and discourse in the classroom In musical education, there is a certain tradition of using different modes of representation (kinaesthetic, visual and verbal) as tools for a progressive approximation to the conceptualisation of musical language. Gesture, graphic representations and speech come together to facilitate the processes of perception, experimentation, symbolization and representation of actions during the course of mus</context>

The structure may consist of more intensive practical assistance during the first phase of the process, which is gradually reduced and replaced by the provision of psychological support; that is, by monitoring the progressive increase in the apprentice’s skills from a distance. Bruner (1975, 1978) and Rogoff (1990), among other authors, characterise these processes, and describe the creation of situations that favour the transfer of responsibilities from adults to children, progressively developing their autonomy. These same processes could occur in a classroom situation although the relationship is not purely adult-to-child, as classmates can also be a source of help to each other. The sociocultural approach in education gives relevance to teaching, and it is also a means of facilitating the appropriation of cultural instruments, which leads to the development of higher psychological processes.

Conversation among this class group benefits the social construction of knowledge. Shared interaction and activity generates a process of transferring signs—for example, ledger line notes, the symbol for repeating bars and how many times (×4), ascending and descending scales that do not use neighbouring tones, arpeggio. The teacher’s intervention is the key to these processes of exchange and negotiation, for it is through the processes of guided participation (Rogoff 1990) that she mediates, assists and guides the process of identifying elements, introducing concepts, generalising, relating to one’s own experiences, etc. It is also the teacher who looks for the chance to transfer responsibilities. She appeals to the knowledge of a student who is more advanced in terms of the specific content, in order for that student to participate in the process. An example of this is the moment when a learner anticipates the reading of the next bar after the one the teacher is singing, thus showing that she has taken in what the task involves and, in turn, she is able to ded</context>

We then selected the activities dealing with the observation and analysis of the score titled Cuban Landscape with Rain, we transcribed the conversations (the original discourse was in Catalan) and divided each of the participants’ interventions into corresponding units, and we grouped the interventions into broader, interactive units. Most of these units correspond to the successive series of IRF (Initiation– Response–Follow up/Feedback) sequences in classroom conversations (Sinclair and Coulthard 1975). We added the first comments to the units in order to analyse the meanings constructed by the participants. To do this, we took into account classroom notes and information provided by the teacher. We present one example on continuation (Table 1). Successive redevelopment of the analyses enabled us to construct categories. The different modalities of the discourse identified through the four analysed conversations were reduced into eight discursive categories that correspond to the strategies used by the teacher to conduct the activity towards the proposed objective.

The sociocultural approach in education gives relevance to teaching, and it is also a means of facilitating the appropriation of cultural instruments, which leads to the development of higher psychological processes. In the words of Vygotsky (1978), it is the process of interiorisation that makes it possible to reconstruct inter-psychological operations on an intra-psychological level within the context of social phenomena or activities using signs. So, in short, children’s participation in cultural activities under the guidance of others enables them to internalise their community’s tools for thinking. This vision is particularly useful for understanding the teaching and learning processes produced in musical instruction, both in instrument classes and in the teaching of musical language.

Participants therefore share the same definition of the situation and bring different semiotic mechanisms into play that arise in specific uses of the language and appropriate forms of discourse (Wertsch 1985). Thus, the learner Sharing meanings in the music classroom 61 grasps the criteria that music uses by legitimating one particular explanation as opposed to others. The specific terminology of the field is not only used to refer to such new content as ledger line notes or arpeggio but rather it is used as a means for appropriation throughout the entire discourse in general: the names of specific notes are mentioned, graphic symbols are analysed, musical instruments are spoken about and terminology for the characteristics of sound are used. This ties in with the ideas of Lemke (1993), when he sa</context>

This scaffolding guides interest towards the task; it reduces the degree of difficulty or simplifies the situation in such a way that the learner is able to manipulate the components of the process; it maintains the activity by directing the actions, highlighting aspects, by controlling frustration and risk during resolution, and by providing models (Wood et al. 1976, 1978). The structure may consist of more intensive practical assistance during the first phase of the process, which is gradually reduced and replaced by the provision of psychological support; that is, by monitoring the progressive increase in the apprentice’s skills from a distance. Bruner (1975, 1978) and Rogoff (1990), among other authors, characterise these processes, and describe the creation of situations that favour the transfer of responsibilities from adults to children, progressively developing their autonomy. These same processes could occur in a classroom situation although the </context>

The different modalities of the discourse identified through the four analysed conversations were reduced into eight discursive categories that correspond to the strategies used by the teacher to conduct the activity towards the proposed objective. Van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) defined discursive strategies as linguistic and extra-linguistic resources that the speaker uses intentionally to increase the efficiency of communication. This includes the strictly verbal, but also other forms of representation (gestures, music, pictures, etc). Wood et al. (1976, 1978) identified strategies to solve problems in the joint construction. We also use the term strategy because the forms of discourse that we analysed constitute resources whose objective is to regulate the students’ process of constructing meaning. We decided to qualify the categories as interactive only if we were able to consider that what the teacher and learners said or did was elaborated upon in the conversation and was related to an element of the content being dealt with. The categories all arose on the basis of the analysis of the discourse and were created inductively in considerat</context>

In her proposal concerning a theory of instrumental training where three models of teaching are represented, we identified the analysed practice with the third model, described as follows: the teacher uses the printed score as a tool for communicating with the composer, and at the same time establishes a dialogue with the students constructing musical meaning, taking into account the students’ ideas about the notation. We consider this way of teaching to be constructivist, and this is also the case of our study. In addition, we recalled the scaffolding strategies identified by Wood et al. (1976) and mentioned by Kennell (2002) in his revision: Recruitment; Marking Critical Features; Task Manipulation; Demonstration; Direction Maintenance; Frustration Control. Although the educational context of these authors is very different from ours, and also the tasks and ages of the participants, we are able to identify parallelisms in the strategies that have a regulating role in the activity. The category Structure social participation corresponds to Recruitment, even though the latter refers to the synchronisation of attention and action between teacher and student and in our case we are refe</context>

Different musical education activities need to be analysed and contrasted with different didactic sequences. Looking for common ground and differences in the application of the school curriculum (maths, verbal language, etc.) would be interesting and useful for teacher training practice. Furthermore, the similarities we have found between work done 30 years ago (see Wood et al. 1976) and our own are a source of encouragement with regard to carrying out further research. Although it is not easy, our aim is to continue exploring this methodological approach in order to look in more depth at the inter- and intra-psychological processes that arise in the classroom.
