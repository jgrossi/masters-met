Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995336">
A musician and a mathematics educator create and implement a set of elementary school lessons integrating music
and math. Students learn the basics of music theory including identifying notes and learning their fractional values.
They learn about time signatures and how to determine correct note values per measure. Students are motivated
by listening to popular culture music such as Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber and clapping to the beat. The culminating
activity involves students creating their own four-bar phrase using their knowledge of time signature, note values,
and fraction addition. Finally, the music teacher or capable student can sing or perform student-created phrases. The
lessons described in this article provide strategies to help music educators and elementary school classroom teachers
integrate music with math.

The National Standards for Arts Education (Consortium
of National Arts Education Associations, 1994) and
the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics
(National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000)
encourage teachers to help students make connections
between the arts, mathematics, and other disciplines inside
and outside the classroom. Some researchers have found
increases in academic achievement for students who study
music (e.g., Catterall, Chapleau, &amp; Iwanaga, 1999;
Fitzpatrick, 2006) compared with students who have not
studied music. This is, in part, due to the overlap between
music skills and math skills. For example, Rauscher and
Hinton (2006) assert the part-whole concept that is necessary for understanding fractions, decimals, and percentages is highly relevant in understanding rhythm.
Although most classroom teachers believe in the
importance of teaching with and about the arts, few feel
qualified or comfortable in doing so (Bohannon &amp;
McDowell, 2010). Argabright (2005) acknowledges that
the current trend in education has focused on accountability based on student achievement. As such, general music
teachers are being asked to “facilitate the integration of
state language-arts and math standards with their general
music curriculum” (p. 5). The purpose of this article is to
illustrate how music educators and elementary school
classroom teachers can collaborate to teach music with
math. In an effort to exploit this overlap in skills, the
authors of this article have created a set of lessons with
explicit instruction on connecting music and math. The
lessons described in this article provide strategies to help
integrate music (reading and notating music) and match
(development of understanding fractions as part of unit
wholes).
The authors, a musician and a mathematics educator,
were motivated to create these lessons after co-presenting
several math conference sessions about music and math
connections for teachers and also a one-day math conference for middle school students. Interjecting pop stars
such as Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Michael Jackson, and
others to exhibit music and math connections proved to
be an engaging motivation tool. Planning and implementing these sessions with teachers and students provided the
authors with invaluable information in creating the following lessons.

the classroom teacher, students were introduced to the
concept that rhythm measures time. The information discussed in this introduction included basic terminology.
When putting a piece of music on paper, the notes are
divided into measures (or bars) each representing the
same unit of time. Within each measure, the number of
beats is organized by the time signature. As we know, the
time signature resembles a fraction with the “numerator”
telling us how many beats are in each measure and the
“denominator” telling us what type of note gets the beat
(Garland &amp; Kahn, 1995). Students learned how to identify the notes and the fractional value of each note (see
Figure 1). This chart will be a valuable resource for the
classroom teacher who may not be familiar with what is
taught in music class. The bottom row of the chart can be
used by the music teacher to make a connection between
the number of beats and the powers of two.
Once students have learned the note values, we further
examine the time signature. For example, a time signature of 44 tells us that we need four quarter notes per measure (or combinations of other notes that equal four
quarter notes). At this time, we could ask students what
other combinations of notes would equal four quarter
notes (one whole note, two half notes, a half note, and
two quarter notes, etc.). We asked students to name a few
songs and we then sang the songs to “feel” the beats. You
can also have songs ready to play on a CD and ask students to sing along if they know the songs or clap along if
they do not. We then played the Bee Gee’s song Staying
Alive because it is easy to clap along and “find the beat.”
As students sing or clap the songs, they begin to “feel”
the 44 count (1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .) to determine the
time signature.
“Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star”
(Lesson One, Part II)
To gauge student understanding of time signature, measures, and note value, we used a familiar song, “Twinkle,
Twinkle, Little Star” (see Figure 2). The worksheet consisted of the sheet music with the complete lyrics of the
song and some of the corresponding missing notes.
Students were asked to fill in the missing note values
based on the 44 time signature. It was our intention to
keep the focus on the fractional value of the notes; therefore, we excluded any information about the pitches of
the notes. (Although the students at our sessions were not
asked to properly place the notes on the staff, it could be
appropriate at this time for the music teacher to continue
with instruction on the notes and the pitches of the corresponding lyrics.) After finding the missing notes, students were asked to show the fraction addition sentence
for each bar. A fraction addition sentence shows the fractions added including the plus sign and equal sign to
achieve a sum of 44 in math talk, or one whole. An example of this is shown here 14 + 14 + 14 + 14 = 44 = 1 and also
shown at the bottom of Figure 2. Some students used
their knowledge of fractions to find the missing note values and some students used their knowledge of the number of beats because they were already familiar with
number of beats from their music classes. Another example of how students found the missing note values is in
the second bar of the song. The students were given the
lyrics, “Lit-tle-Star” and two quarter notes under “Little.” They might then show that 14 + 14 = 12 and therefore
a half note was needed to complete the bar. Many students did not show that 14 + 14 = 12 because when asked,

they said they did that part in their head. If they completed the missing notes because they knew how to count
the number of beats, they were asked to also show the
fraction sentences at the bottom of the page to prove their
number of beats. If students finished early, they were
given another song, “Mary Had a Little Lamb” to complete. (The “Little Lamb” worksheet could also be used
for homework.) A follow-up discussion and further activities on equivalent fractions and fraction addition is
appropriate at this time for the classroom teacher.
During our first session with middle school students,
we found that students knew a connection between reading music and fractions existed. However, they rarely
used that connection when asked to find the missing note
values. Instead, they used the number of beats based on
the time signature. This is great, but why not help these
same students use the fraction connection as well? The
student work shown in Figure 2 is representative of the
many students who had little or no prior music instruction. Instead, these students quickly “found” the missing

that 24 is equivalent to 2 and therefore the missing note
was a half note. We believe that by sixth grade the equivalence of 24 and 12 is so basic that students do not feel the
need to explain. The missing notes activity is appropriate
for students in Grades 4 to 6.

Differentiating Instruction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984642">
After learning the basic notes we proceeded to dotted
notes, which can be used to differentiate instruction. A
dot is worth a half of the value of the note it follows. For
example, a dotted half note is a half note plus half of a
half note. For younger and less capable students, you can

Assessment

<bodyText confidence="0.989018">
To assess students’ knowledge of all the notes, including
dotted notes, students were given a worksheet of seven
bars of music with notes. They used fraction addition
(and multiplication) to show which bars were correct and
which were not. Students were allowed to work with a
partner. The collaboration among students was great and
although some students were able to figure this out using
the note values, they were asked to show fraction sentences to prove their decision (see Figure 3). The time
signature for the first seven problems was 44 . If students
finished early they were able to move on to other time
signatures, including 34 , and 86 . Students who moved
ahead to other time signatures were later asked to explain
their work to the class.

Popular Culture Music (Lesson Two,
Part I)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.979750842105263">
To make a real life connection to the previous lesson, we
had students listen to popular culture music (e.g., The
Climb by Miley Cyrus) and clap to the beat and then identify the time signature. This was a lot of fun because
although students were told that most songs are in 44
time, this activity helped to reinforce this point. We also
listened to a few older tunes as well such as Kool and the
Gang’s Celebrate and The Beatles’ Yesterday.
Students were now ready to write four-bars using
correct note values. The first time we did this activity,
more students had problems than we anticipated. The
task was for students to write four bars using each note
value (whole note to 16th note) at least once. Although
we had reviewed time signatures, bars, and notes, students were overwhelmed when confronted with the task

activity with another group of students, we added in a
visual exercise in which students were given a worksheet with five squares. They had to divide the squares
into parts of a whole using the note values of whole

note, 2 note, 4 note, 8 note, and 16 note. They were
encouraged to try different combinations of notes/fractions to make sums of one on their squares. For example, a student could divide the square into four equal
parts and show that each part is equal to one fourth (see
Figure 4). Once students completed five squares, they
were instructed to choose four of the squares to create
their four-bar phrase. Each of the four squares would be
translated into the notes of each bar. For the example
given, the student would write 14 + 14 + 14 + 14 = 1 mea4
sure in 4 underneath the square to show the math and
then draw four quarter notes in one measure on the
music sheet to represent the square being divided into
quarters. The students were surprised to learn that the
square activity connected directly with the writing of
their phrase. An example of a divided square is shown in

The culminating activity was very exciting because
students were able to hear their music come to life. This
is a perfect time to have the general music teacher or a
capable student play the student-created’ four-bar phrases.
One of the presenters of the conference session is a pianist. Because there is usually not a piano available, he
played a sample of students’ songs on the melodica along
with prerecorded and edited accompaniment music.
Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean” was edited as a two-bar
drum intro to engage students to clap to the beat. The next
four bars were the string bass and drums. This allowed
the melodica to be used to perform the four bars of students’ phrases (whom again had not focused on pitch).
The melodica performances were done in an improvisational pentatonic minor scale. Other accompaniment
music featured basic I, IV, V cadences for students that
used diatonic scale choices (see Figure 5, Student Two).
Student Three even wrote words to create “Key Krazy.”
The accompaniment music was a popular hip hop/pop
beat. The pianist played the chords on the melodica and
the student was challenged to sing his song. Each student
received a rousing ovation for each effort. A practical
alternative to this form of playback could be for the music
teacher to use Orff instruments so that students can
perform their own phrases. Remember that the sessions
described above were done with students of varying
music abilities and music instruction experiences.
Subsequent lessons will depend on the unit
objective(s). These lessons are appropriate for the music
educator to teach on their own and would satisfy the call
for connecting music with other disciplines. As we know,
music integrates well with many disciplines, mathematics is but one of them.
In the student work shown above, each student shows
a different level of understanding of the concept of
rhythm and note values in music as well as fraction addition. Student One has the correct fraction addition in each
bar; however, the student uses mostly all like denominators

Final Thoughts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999716764705882">
Much of the literature connecting music and mathematics has focused on either students listening to music or
students having music instruction in school as well as
private instruction. On the other hand, little research has
been done on the effects of learning music and math
when the two are taught in an integrated way. The scope
of this article falls short of researching this phenomenon;
however, the authors acknowledge that this is a necessary next step. The authors further agree with Argabright
(2005) when she said, “since children naturally love
music, we [music educators] become natural funnels for
integrating other areas of learning” (p. 5). The integration of music and math in classroom instruction becomes
more accessible for both music and classroom teachers
with materials specifically created for that purpose
(Colwell, 2008). The lessons presented in this article are
the first steps in the creation of such materials. It is the
authors’ hope that the materials help to facilitate future
research to add to the literature on the effects of teaching
music and math in an integrated fashion.

Within each measure, the number of beats is organized by the time signature.

The information discussed in this introduction included basic terminology. When putting a piece of music on paper, the notes are divided into measures (or bars) each representing the same unit of time. Within each measure, the number of beats is organized by the time signature. As we know, the time signature resembles a fraction with the “numerator” telling us how many beats are in each measure and the “denominator” telling us what type of note gets the beat (Garland &amp; Kahn, 1995). Students learned how to identify the notes and the fractional value of each note (see Figure 1). This chart will be a valuable resource for the classroom teacher who may not be familiar with what is taught in music class. The bottom row of the chart can be used by the music teacher to make a connection between the number of beats and the powers of two. Once students have learned the note values, we further examine the time signature. For example, a time signature of 44 tells us that we need four quarter notes per measure (or combinations of other notes that equal four quarter notes). At this</context>

Some researchers have found increases in academic achievement for students who study music (e.g., Catterall, Chapleau, &amp; Iwanaga, 1999; Fitzpatrick, 2006) compared with students who have not studied music. This is, in part, due to the overlap between music skills and math skills. For example, Rauscher and Hinton (2006) assert the part-whole concept that is necessary for understanding fractions, decimals, and percentages is highly relevant in understanding rhythm. Although most classroom teachers believe in the importance of teaching with and about the arts, few feel qualified or comfortable in doing so (Bohannon &amp; McDowell, 2010). Argabright (2005) acknowledges that the current trend in education has focused on accountability based on student achievement.

As such, general music teachers are being asked to “facilitate the integration of state language-arts and math standards with their general music curriculum” (p. 5). The purpose of this article is to illustrate how music educators and elementary school classroom teachers can collaborate to teach music with math. In an effort to exploit this overlap in skills, the authors of this article have created a set of lessons with explicit instruction on connecting music and math. The lessons de</context>

Final Thoughts Much of the literature connecting music and mathematics has focused on either students listening to music or students having music instruction in school as well as private instruction. On the other hand, little research has been done on the effects of learning music and math when the two are taught in an integrated way. The scope of this article falls short of researching this phenomenon; however, the authors acknowledge that this is a necessary next step. The authors further agree with Argabright (2005) when she said, “since children naturally love music, we [music educators] become natural funnels for integrating other areas of learning” (p. 5). The integration of music and math in classroom instruction becomes more accessible for both music and classroom teachers with materials specifically created for that purpose (Colwell, 2008). The lessons presented in this article are the first steps in the creation of such materials. It is the authors’ hope that the materials help to facilitate future research to add to the literature on the effects of teaching music and math in an integrated fashion</context>
