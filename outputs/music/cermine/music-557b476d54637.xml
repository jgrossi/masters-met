      <abstract>
        <p>Although much has been written about professional development in general education and music education literature, little has addressed the benefits of music-making as meaningful professional development for music teachers. For music teachers, music-making and meanings of music-making have been connected with teachers' identity, well-being, beliefs, and effectiveness, as well as being a powerful pedagogical tool and a way to develop presence in teaching. Presence in teaching is linked with self-awareness, attentiveness, and pedagogical knowledge. The purpose of this article is to explore the benefits of music-making for music teachers in order to convince policymakers of the value of music-making as a professional development activity for music teachers. This article explores theories from psychology and education that link engagement, well-being, and identity to lay the foundation for a justification of broadening professional development policies. Then, literature is presented that connects teachers' art-making experiences (past and present), identity, teaching, and student learning. The third section draws on my previous work to illustrate the intersections between teachers' music-making and teaching. Then, suggestions for implementing professional development programs with music-making components are made. Although there are many ways musicmaking could be included as professional development, I offer four suggestions: including music-making in departmental or district-wide meetings, granting professional development credit to music teachers who make music outside of the classroom, setting up in-classroom reflection opportunities/action research based on integrating music-making and music teaching, and initiating a collaborative teacher study group that includes chamber music collaboration.</p>

      <p>development of presence in teaching (Beijaard et al. 2005;
Day 2010; Day and Gu 2010; Day et al. 2006; Korthagen
2004; Meijer, Korthagen, and Vasalos 2009; Rodgers and
Raider-Roth 2006; Sammons et al. 2007).</p>
      <p>For music teachers, the area of music-making and
its meanings can be connected with teachers’ beliefs,
identity, well-being, social connections, and presence in
teaching, and can serve as a powerful pedagogical tool
(Dolloff 2006; Dolloff 2007; Fredrickson 2006; Isbell 2006;
Jorgensen 2006, 2008; Pellegrino 2010; Russell 2009; Scheib
2006; Stephens 2007; Stanley 2009). Music education
researchers have begun to consider the potential of
musicmaking as a valuable professional development activity
(Fredrickson 2006; Scheib 2006; Stanley 2009; Pellegrino
2010).</p>
      <p>The purpose of this article is to explore the benefits of
music-making for music teachers in order to convince
policymakers of the value of music-making as a professional
development activity for music teachers. In an educational
climate in which the president has initiated the Race to the
Top program calling for “relevant coaching, induction, and/or
professional development,” this article argues that
professional development that includes music-making is relevant
for music teachers (U.S. Department of Education 2009). I
first present theories from psychology and education that
explore the connections among engagement, well-being, and
identity to lay the foundation for a justification of
broadening professional development policies. The next section
addresses the intersections among teachers’ art-making
experiences (past and present), identity, teaching, and student
learning. The third section draws on my previous work to
illustrate these intersections between teachers’ music-making
and teaching. The fourth section provides suggestions for
implementing professional development programs with
musicmaking components.</p>
      <p>COMPLETE ENGAGEMENT, WELL-BEING,</p>

    <sec id="2">
      <title>AND PRESENCE IN TEACHING</title>
      <p>Drawing on research in the field of psychology, this
section describes the theory of “flow” (Cs´ıkszentmiha´lyi 1991),
psychological presence at work (Kahn 1990; 1992), positive
psychology (Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkad 2005;
Seligman and Cs´ıkszentmiha´lyi 2000), and the theory of presence
in teaching (Rodgers and Raider-Roth 2006). Finally, I will
present research that connected teachers’ personal lives and
teacher effectiveness/student learning.
In numerous studies, Cs´ıkszentmiha´lyi examined hundreds
of “artists, athletes, musicians, chess masters, and surgeons
. . . people who seemed to spend their time in precisely those
activities they preferred” (Cs´ıkszentmiha´lyi 1991, 4). These
studies formed the basis for his theory of “flow” that he
developed to describe “optimal experience.” Flow is a
psychological state of intense interest, a time when someone becomes
fully engaged in a challenging activity that causes them to
lose sense of time and self and results in feelings of
satisfaction and well-being. In this state, “concentration is so intense
that there is no attention left over to think about anything
irrelevant, or to worry about problems. Self-consciousness
disappears, and the sense of time becomes distorted” (71).</p>
      <p>Cs´ıkszentmiha´lyi claimed that understanding this theory
would help people improve their quality of life. He also
suggested the possibility of turning “all of life into a unified
flow experience,” explaining that:</p>
      <p>If a person sets out to achieve a difficult enough goal, from
which all other goals logically follow, and if he or she invests
all energy in developing skills to reach that goal, then actions
and feelings will be in harmony, and the separate parts of life
will fit together—and each activity will “make sense” in the
present, as well as in view of the past and of the future. In
such a way, it is possible to give meaning to one’s entire life.
(Cs´ıkszentmiha´lyi 1991, 214–15)</p>
      <p>In brief, the theory of flow presents a holistic approach to
life, in which one’s actions and feelings are aligned.
Psychological Presence at Work
Within the field of organizational behavior, Kahn (1990;
1992) explored the concept of psychological presence, a
state in which one draws on one’s personal, authentic self
(thoughts, feelings, beliefs, identities, and skills) while at
work. The concept of presence is linked to the idea of
personal engagement, which entails the ability to use and
express oneself in multiple ways—physically, cognitively, and
emotionally—and connect work with individual interests and
self-image. In the same vein, workers need to feel valued by
and connected to their coworkers.</p>
      <p>In his 1990 study, Kahn found that people become
engaged in or disengaged from their work as a result of three
psychological conditions: meaningfulness, safety, and
availability. Psychological meaningfulness is higher when a
person is engaged in tasks that are challenging and varied and
have clear expectations and creative aspects, as well as when
workers are allowed a level of autonomy. The availability
of opportunities to demonstrate competence using previous
skills and to learn and grow by developing new skills can also
positively affect meaningfulness. The condition of
psychological availability is dependent on physical and emotional
energy, feelings of security or insecurity, and stability in the
individual’s outside life.</p>
      <p>Kahn’s 1992 study builds on his prior work and describes
the elements and benefits of presence. He defines the four
dimensions of presence as attentiveness, connection,
integration, and focus. When combined, these dimensions
contribute to one’s ability to (a) continue learning; (b) question
assumptions, imagine solutions, and implement change; and
(c) be productive. By understanding oneself, others, and the
situation, the present worker can formute solutions without
becoming tangled in emotions of panic. From an
organization’s standpoint, the benefits of employing individuals who
are present at work include increased job performance and
job satisfaction.</p>
      <p>Some physical signs of being present include the
maintenance of eye contact; appearing physically grounded: the use
of speech that includes inflection, variety (e.g., laugh, varied
dynamics, speech patterns), and words that fit one’s
personality; and the ability to stay on track with the conversation.
This ability is demonstrated by the types of questions asked
and the display of appropriate nonverbal reactions such as
facial expressions, nodding, and other body language.</p>
      <p>The development of the theories of flow and presence
marked a different avenue of inquiry than had been previously
followed in psychology. In the next section, I provide a brief
overview of the linked area of positive psychology.
Positive psychology is dedicated to better understanding both
the ability to be in the moment and the benefits of flow.
According to Seligman and Cs´ıkszentmiha´lyi, this field aims
to study:</p>
      <p>Valued subjective experiences: wellbeing, contentment, and
satisfaction (in the past); hope and optimism (for the future);
and flow and happiness (in the present). At the individual
level, it is about positive individual traits; the capacity for love
and vocation, courage, interpersonal skill, aesthetic
sensibility, perseverance, forgiveness, originality, future mindedness,
spirituality, high talent, and wisdom. At the group level, it is
about civic virtues and the institutions that move individuals
toward better citizenship: responsibility, nurturance,
altruism, civility, moderation, tolerance, and work ethic. (2000,
5)</p>
      <p>Working off the premise that being happy is a catalyst
for better health; better social relationships; and increased
work outcomes, energy, coping skills, and citizen
dispositions, Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkad (2005) present a
theory of sustained happiness. This theory takes into account
three components: genetic set point range, intentional
activity, and circumstances. For the purposes of this article, I focus
on intentional activity.</p>
      <p>Intentional activity is defined as “actions or practices in
which people can choose to engage . . . [and which] require
some degree of effort to enact” (Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and
Schkad 2005, 118); the researchers suggest that this concept
might contribute to an individual’s discovery of sustainable
happiness. More closely examining aspects of intentional
activity, one key idea that appears is “person-activity fit,”
which refers to choosing an activity that fits an individual’s
“strengths, interests, values, and inclinations that
undoubtedly predispose them to benefit more from some strategies
than others” (122). Two important features of maintaining an
activity on an ongoing basis are finding meaning and value
in the activity and varying its practice.</p>
      <p>These interrelated psychological theories form the
foundation for my justification of policymakers including
musicmaking in professional development activity. They also form
the basis for the theory of presence found in education
literature. “Presence from the teacher’s point of view is the
experience of bringing one’s whole self to full attention so
as to perceive what is happening in the moment” (Rodgers
and Raider-Roth 2006, 267).</p>
      <p>Theory of Presence in Teaching
Rodgers and Raider-Roth (2006) present a theory of
presence in teaching that combines the aspects of self-awareness,
connection to students, connection to subject matter, and
pedagogical knowledge. The authors view teaching as
“engaging in an authentic relationship with students where teachers
know and respond with intelligence and compassion to
students and their learning” (265–66). They define presence as:
[A] state of alert awareness, receptivity and connectedness
to the mental, emotional and physical workings of both the
individual and the group in context of their learning
environments and the ability to respond with a considered and
compassionate best next step. . . . Reflective teaching cannot
be reduced to a series of behaviors or skills, but is a practice
that demands presence. As such, it involves self-knowledge,
trust, relationship and compassion. (266)</p>
      <p>Rodgers and Raider-Roth connect classroom life—”the
relationships, the affective and cognitive interactions
between students and teachers, the construction of genuine
learning experiences and a hospitable school climate” with
past research suggesting that the teacher/student relationship
is a “keystone in student achievement, motivation and
engagement and in their capacity to trust what they know.”
They argue that “what allows this relationship to flourish is
complex and calls upon the mental, physical, emotional, and
relational resources of the teacher” (2006, 266).</p>
      <p>After exploring each of the four aspects of
psychological presence, the authors conclude that being present in the
context of education means “to be awake to one’s self, to
one’s students and to their learning in such a way that
learning is served through skillful and compassionate analysis
and access to both subject matter knowledge and
pedagogical strategies” (Rodgers and Raider-Roth 2006, 284). They
suggest that teachers should pay more attention to how
students interact with the subject matter, even if the teacher must
slow the classroom pace and possibly lose the opportunity
to cover everything. From Rodgers and Raider’s perspective,
a teacher’s presence is directly connected to observing and
understanding student learning and letting student learning
drive the teaching.</p>
      <p>Research Connecting Teachers’ Personal Lives and
Teacher Effectiveness/Student Learning</p>
      <p>The merging of the personal and professional lives of
teachers has been connected with identity, job satisfaction,
and student learning. Two recent studies (Day et al. 2006;
Sammons et al. 2007) have considered the influence of a
teacher’s identity on job satisfaction. Both studies drew on an
existing database involving three hundred teachers from one
hundred British schools over a four-year period and worked
from the assumption that a teacher’s identity influences
factors such as commitment, motivation, self-efficacy, job
satisfaction, and sense of purpose. Datasets were generated from
interviews, teacher and pupil surveys, and national student
assessment data (Sammons et al. 2007, 684). Linkages were
found among identity, well-being, and effectiveness.</p>
      <p>In a literature review, Smith and Gillespie (2007)
also linked professional development, teachers’ personal
self-efficacy, teacher knowledge, and teacher
effectiveness/student learning. In addition, they recommended
jobembedded professional development: “site-based learning
communities where professional development is woven into
the fabric of the school community, balanced at times with the
cross-fertilization of new ideas from outside the school. . . .
The focus is on developing teacher knowledge in the content
area, analyzing student thinking, and identifying how that
knowledge can be applied to changes in instructional
practices” (219). Based on research, they suggested that these
job-embedded professional development programs are more
effective when they also include: (a) a focus on helping
teachers to study their students’ thinking, (b) collaborative
learning activities among teachers, (c) activities in which teachers
make use of student performance data, and (d) help from
facilitators to organize job-embedded professional
development.</p>
      <p>Meijer, Korthagen, and Vasalos’s (2009) mixed-methods
case study followed the experiences of a secondary social
studies teacher in The Netherlands. The authors built on the
concept that teachers need to have “total encounters” with
their students to influence them educationally. This study was
also based partially on Rodgers and Raider-Roth’s (2006)
theory of presence in teaching and the theories of positive
psychology.</p>
      <p>Meijer, Korthagen, and Vasalos developed an approach to
professional development that sought to support teachers as
they developed necessary teaching competencies in a way
that would be aligned with “who they are and what
motivated them to become a teacher” (2009, 298). The goals of
this approach include connecting or integrating a teacher’s
personal and professional lives and “promoting the teacher’s
awareness and actualization of personal strengths,” which
would optimally lead to “developing more optimism and
hope” (306–07).</p>
      <p>Data collection for this study occurred over the course
of a single school year and was drawn from two
semistructured interviews with the teacher; two semi-structured
interviews with the teacher’s supervisor; seven hour-long
meetings with teacher and supervisor; the teacher’s journal;
and the Questionnaire on Core Qualities (QCQ), completed
by both teacher and supervisor in October and June of the
same year. The questionnaire measured thinking
(creativity, structuredness, clarity, accuracy), feeling (commitment,
empathy, compassion, trust, tolerance, care), and wanting
(decisiveness, perseverance, courage). The purpose of the
study was to better understand “core reflection approach” as
professional development for teachers.</p>
      <p>Over the course of the year, the teacher involved in this
professional development program showed an increase in
QCQ scores, especially in the thinking and feeling categories.
The authors believed that a shift in awareness was responsible
for the integration of her personal and professional lives.
The teacher’s work on reflection helped her shift her focus
from her problems and issues to her strengths, presence, and
conception of how she wanted to teach. Meijer, Korthagen,
and Vasalos attributed this shift to her increased ability to
work with more meaningful layers of her teaching, which
they named identity and mission. These layers helped the
teacher develop behaviors that brought her personal self into
her job and improved her ability to be in the moment and
both notice and react to students’ needs in more meaningful
and effective ways. The teacher described her new focus as
“being-while-teaching.”</p>
      <p>Finally, Day and Gu (2010) wrote a book based on
previous research conducted by Day et al. (2006) and Sammons
et al. (2007). This book included unused data from those
studies to develop portraits of eighteen teachers. In-depth
exploration of these teachers’ experiences allowed the authors to
summarize five qualities of good teachers and good teaching.
They concluded that teaching resulting in successful learning
requires: (a) the combination of technical competencies, deep
subject knowledge, and empathy for learners; (b) care for and
about learning and learners; (c) the maintenance of a strong
sense of identity and agency; (d) an emotional
understanding of self and others; and (e) hopefulness and resilience.
However, these five qualities are not widely supported in
educational systems or policies. The authors offer several
suggestions to increase support for the development of these
qualities. First, teachers need to review, refine, and update
their subject and pedagogical knowledge “through
combinations of formal development programmes and in-school
learning through mentorship, coaching and critical
friendship” (Day and Gu 2010, 183). In addition, professional
development programs should find a way to support a teacher’s
identity because “these findings suggest that a secure sense
of professional identity, commitment and well being are
central to teachers’ capacity to be and remain effective”
(Day 2010).</p>
      <p>ARTS AND MUSIC LITERATURE
Similar issues have been explored in arts and music in-service
teacher/professional development literature. This literature
links art-making to identity issues, teacher effectiveness, job
satisfaction, and student learning. In the following sections,
I explore the literature on (a) holistic sense of identity; (b)
music-making and well-being; (c) the connections among
music-making and job satisfaction, retention, recruitment,
and student learning; and (d) music-making linked to
presence in teaching.</p>
      <p>Holistic Sense of Identity
Scheib has argued that “if fine arts teachers hold and value
their identities as artists, then it stands to reason that to keep
them holistically fulfilled with their arts teaching career,
professional development should not only include support
of their arts teacher identity, but also their identity as artists”
(2006, 8–9). Thornton defines an artist teacher as “an
individual who both makes and teaches art and is dedicated to
both activities as a practitioner” (2005, 167). He explores an
inherent identity issue for the artist-teacher in depth:
In art and art education there are tensions and debates
regarding the roles and identities of artists and teachers that present
practitioners in these fields with problems to be negotiated.
. . . Teachers of art, particularly in the secondary and tertiary
sectors, will usually have developed an identity as an artist
or art specialist of one kind or another before embarking on
a career in teaching. . . . The artist teacher is one in which
three worlds must be straddled or interrelated: the world of
art; the world of education; and the world of art education.
(167)</p>
      <p>However, although Thornton articulates the potential
problems of an identity split for artist teachers, Ball (1990)
has written about the ways that her artist identity has informed
her teaching. Heck (1991) and Elliott (1995) observe the
connections between art-making and knowing that also inform
teaching. Heck, especially, portrays artist-teachers as those
educators who have developed a sense of presence in their
personhood and teaching. Heck describes an artist-teacher as
a “whole, awake, and compassionate person” concerned with
the “development of self, active and meaningful teaching and
learning experiences, [and] authentic engagement with
others” (1991, 142). This description is congruent with the ideas
of merging personal and professional lives and developing
presence in teaching.</p>
      <p>Music teacher identity and socialization have long been
topics of interest within the profession, but have garnered
a lot of attention in the past two decades (Pellegrino 2009;
Pellegrino 2010; Woodford 2002). Although discussion has
primarily focused on the identity conflicts of musicians and
music teachers, a more recent trend has explored how the
musician and music-maker identity are part of the music
teacher (Bernard 2004; Bernard 2005; Dust 2006; Dolloff
2006; Nielsen 2006; Ruud 2006; Sta˚lhammar 2006; Bouij
2007; Dolloff 2007; Regelski 2007; Roberts 2007; Stephens
2007).</p>
      <p>In her dissertation, Stanley (2009) describes how the
experiences of a collaborative teacher study group (CTSG)
consisting of three elementary music teachers and herself led to
transformative professional development that impacted their
teaching and learning, as well as student learning. She does
question, however, whether her CTSG could have been more
musical and suggests centering a future CTSG on chamber
music performance “to see if the added layer of making music
would add further dimension to . . . interactions” (308). She
further suggests “incorporat[ing] some type of musicianship
building exercises within a CTSG to see if the experience
of being music learners together changes [the] dialogue”
(308–09). Her reasons for including music-making in her
professional development CTSG mirrors Heck’s
understanding of an artist-teacher as a compassionate person concerned
with meaningful teaching and learning experiences.
Remembering what it is like to be a music learner has the potential
to impact one’s teaching and student learning.</p>
      <p>Music-Making and Well-Being</p>
      <p>We should always remember the importance of music itself
in the lives of the (music) teachers. I am coming to the
conclusion that reintroducing teachers to the things about the
study of music that captivated them when they were students
might be a better way to reinvigorate those who are
straining under the weight of the educational system. (Fredrickson
2006, 7)</p>
      <p>Fredrickson suggests that encouraging music teachers to
engage in music-making might offer a way to enhance
music teachers’ sense of well-being. The concept of finding
well-being through engaging in music-making appears in the
literature of a variety of fields. In the field of music therapy,
Ruud has found:</p>

      <sec id="2-4">
        <title>4. Music experiences create a sense of meaning and co</title>
        <p>Three music education scholars have addressed the
connections between music-making and well-being in different
ways. Stefanakis has written about music as a “holistic way in
which we come to know ourselves and our relationship with
the world” (2005, 14). Dolloff (2006) believes that musicians
often experience powerful emotional affects by participating
in intense, moving musical experiences. She describes
feelings of “utter joy” while music-making, observing that
“music and music making [are] ripe with emotions and emotional
potential” that are “an important feature in why we came to
music and music teaching in the first place” (127).</p>
        <p>Kokotsaki and Hallam (2007) have found that group
music-making can help participants create a strong sense
of social unity and can foster uplifting, exhilarating, and
motivating feelings. Participants in their study commented on
“enhanced moods whilst performing,” “exhilaration while
in ‘flow’—almost like a drug at its best,” “getting lost in a
sense of timelessness in the musical act,” and a feeling of
“escapism” during performances (99). Social benefits noted
by participants included a sense of belonging, satisfaction,
and flow experiences. Personal benefits included increased
motivation, concentration, stamina, self-confidence,
selfefficacy, and a stronger sense of identity (107).</p>
        <p>All of these outcomes can be beneficial to music
teachers. Although some may argue that helping teachers feel a
sense of well-being is not a concern for professional
development programs, the literature suggests that connections
exist among music-making; well-being; and increased
vitality, awareness, motivation, concentration, stamina,
selfconfidence, and self-efficacy. These outcomes would be
worthwhile benefits of a professional development program.
Music-Making Linked to Recruitment, Retention,
Job Satisfaction, and Student Learning
Isbell’s (2006) study investigated the socialization and
occupational identity of undergraduate music education majors
and offered suggestions for attracting future music
teachers to the profession similar to those of of Gillespie and
Hamann (1999): “Performance- and teaching- related
experiences may have a mutually reinforcing effect on the
socialization of young music students, particularly in situations
where the student perceives the school music teacher as being
both a strong musician and excellent educator” (Isbell 2006,
151). Russell found that “string teachers who saw themselves
as equal teacher and musician were more satisfied with their
job than teachers who saw themselves as more teacher than
musician” and suggested that “teachers who remain active as
a musician are more likely to be more satisfied than string
teachers who have not remained as active as a musician
outside of their K–12 position” (2009, 54). All of these studies
link music-making to recruitment of future music teachers,
the socialization of preservice music teachers, and job
satisfaction for in-service string teachers.</p>
        <p>Combining music-making with teaching seems a
common practice in string teacher culture, as many teachers are
encouraged to teach with “instrument in hand.” In Strategies
for Teaching Strings: Building a Successful String and
Orchestra Program, Hamann and Gillespie suggest twenty-one
“keys to the development of playing technique in the string
class,” with the second being:</p>
        <p>Use modeling in your teaching. It is an excellent practice
to teach with an instrument in your hands, showing them,
through demonstration, what you want. Modeling provides
for a nonverbal or at least a limited verbal teaching event,
and it is effective and efficient and tends to keep students on
task. (2003, 139)</p>
        <p>In the second edition (2009) of this work, the authors also
suggest modeling as a strategy to help students with different
learning styles (e.g., visual, tactile, auditory) and efficiently
teach playing skills. Although they note that “research
suggests that students in early instrumental classes learn the
most efficiently by watching teachers model skills and then
attempting to imitate on their instruments,” (38) they do not
explicitly cite this research. However, some scholars who
have suggested modeling as an efficient tool for instrumental
teaching include Dickey (1991), Goolsby (1996), and Haston
(2007).</p>
        <p>The concept of modeling has also been addressed in
philosophical writings. Jorgensen (2008) writes that “the
musician-teacher” acts as an exemplar who does not merely
tell, but also shows. She situates this approach in the idea of
enculturation and how musicians can learn that music can be
a way of life and not just an activity. In this way, modeling
is used for more than teaching skills.</p>
        <p>Music-Making Linked to Presence in Teaching
Jorgensen (2008) also explores the importance of
engagement in activities that bring happiness to one’s life for music
teachers. She claims that “the closer our lived lives are to our
own desires and the closer we are to what makes us happiest,
the more joyful our lives can be and the greater blessing we
may be to others” (106) and asserts that music is connected
to both teaching and who we are. She defines a musician as:
A vocation, or a deeply spiritual calling . . . a way of life.
. . . We can have the sense that our work as musicians is
merged with the rest of lived life rather than apart from it.
A spiritual sense of the wholeness of our lives arises out
of the imperative and calling we sense to participate in a
life of music and enrich the lives of others through music.
Viewed in this way, life is invested with meaning and a sense
of profound importance. Our passion about our art involves
mind, soul, and body, and we live in its service and in service
for others. (103)</p>
        <p>In this context, Jorgensen stresses the importance of
being “in the moment” and points to earlier philosophers and
the different terms they used to refer to this experience in
slightly different ways: Whitehead’s “religious moments,”
Langer’s “virtual time,” and Maslow’s “peak experience.”
Cs´ıkszentmiha´lyi’s concept of flow is included in this
discussion as a way of describing the magical moments that
evoke “sheer joy, relaxation, and quietness of mind—a sense
that one has come face-to-face with transcendence and
imminence,” defined as “a sense of things beyond or above
oneself, and . . . a deeply felt sense of things within oneself
(23).</p>
        <p>Connecting these ideas with music, Jorgensen avers that
musicians “create rehearsals and performances that are
captivating and entrancing, beyond normal and lived experience
yet one with it, where the various elements combine to
create pieces of music or performances that are more than the
sum of their parts” (2008, 98). When these performances are
successful, she claims that “the result of this endeavor may
be seen to be art—a deeply spiritual and sensual process and
product that is recognized as artful and crafty by musicians
and their publics” (98).</p>
        <p>Lastly, she submits that all teachers have the
responsibility to find balance and bring a refreshed and enriched self
to their students both to sustain their teaching careers and to
possess “things of significance to pass on to [their] students”
(Jorgensen 2008, 187). For all of these reasons, current
music education policies should be examined to recognize and
perhaps even establish programs that promote music-making
as a professional development approach.
For my dissertation (Pellegrino 2010), I worked with four
string teacher participants who echoed many of the ideas
presented previously, including the benefits of modeling
(music-making inside the classroom), the benefits of
conducting music-making activities both alone and in groups
outside of the classroom, and the connections between
musicmaking and well-being. They also added another reason
for including music-making in the professional development
curriculum: the benefits of expanding their knowledge of
and experience with repertoire and different genres through
music-making.</p>
        <p>One participant recommended that “working specifically
on repertoire that might lend itself to being performed” would
be a worthwhile reason to include music-making in
professional development (300). All participants worked with
music of different genres and introduced these to their students;
however, only those genres of music with which the
participants were familiar were brought into their classrooms.
Therefore, offering professional development programs that
focus on listening, understanding, and playing music from a
variety of styles would likely result in teachers introducing
more genres of music to their students.</p>
        <p>My dissertation was designed to explore the intersections
between music-making and teaching. Datasets included
interviews, classroom observations, and a focus group
interview that included a music-making session. Participants used
music-making inside the classroom to model playing
technique and musicality, believing it to be an efficient teaching
tool that benefits student learning. They were also modeling
their love and values of music-making. Reasons for
musicmaking outside the classroom included nurturing themselves,
gaining credibility with students, and remembering what it
was like to be a musical learner. One participant said that two
advantages of music-making are to develop “the relationship
you have as a doer with the person and understanding both
sides of the podium” (263).</p>
        <p>Music-Making Aids Presence in Teaching
One participant described how treating her students like
members of a chamber music group was able to elevate her
teaching:</p>
        <p>I feel like I’m a member of their quartet and so we’re all
playing together and I can show much more—and I teach
better. I teach and, at the same time, I am a musician. . . .
I stop thinking about how I’m going to teach it when I’m
playing music with them. . . . I just treat them as if we are all
music colleagues together making music together and talk
to them how I would talk to my quartet members instead
of talking to them like the teacher who knows everything.
(Pellegrino 2010, 229)</p>
        <p>This participant had previously described “letting go” and
“losing [her]self” while music-making. I interpreted these
statements as descriptions of flow. In this state, her worries
about classroom management, pacing, and content delivery
receded. When music-making with her students, she was also
able to “let go” and be in the present again.</p>
        <p>Music-making brought part of the participants’ personal
lives into their teaching and provided them with inspiration.
In the classroom, music-making captured students’ interest
and attention and served as a tool for proactive classroom
management and inspiring students. Music-making became
a way for participants to share what they loved and influence
the next generation of music-makers.</p>
        <p>My findings point to music-making’s potential as a
transformative professional development activity. Music-making
can be inspirational and return excitement to a teacher who
has been feeling burned-out; it can also elevate teaching and
help teachers be more present in the classroom. Therefore,
as Day and Gu (2010) suggest, helping music teachers
refine, review, and update their subject matter, and integrating
their musician/performer and teacher identities with the goal
of promoting presence in teaching could form the basis of
advocacy for music-making as a professional development
activity.
In this article, I have presented research and theories
developed over two decades that link teacher engagement in
meaningful, challenging activities with well-being. The state
of feeling intellectually challenged and safe and being
physically and emotionally available is connected with continuing
learning, questioning assumptions, imagining solutions,
implementing change, and being productive. Finding meaning
and value in an activity and varying its practice are connected
to the ability to find sustained happiness; in turn, happiness
acts as a catalyst for better health, better social relationships,
and increased work outcomes, energy, coping skills, and
citizen dispositions.</p>
        <p>Presence in teaching is linked to self-awareness,
teachers’ ability to connect to students and the subject matter,
and pedagogical knowledge. Links have also been found
among identity, well-being, and teacher effectiveness.
Finally, music-making is linked to music teachers’ identity,
well-being, and effectiveness, and serves as a way for music
teachers to find presence in teaching. All of these connections
have been explored in order to present data-informed support
for including music-making in professional development.</p>
        <p>SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTING
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WITH A</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="3">
      <title>MUSIC-MAKING COMPONENT</title>
      <p>Although there are many ways that music-making could be
included as a professional development component, I offer
four suggestions here: including music-making in
departmental or districtwide meetings, granting professional
development credit to music teachers who make music outside
of the classroom, creating in-class reflection opportunities or
action research through the integration of music-making into
music teaching, and initiating a collaborative teacher study
group that includes chamber music collaboration.</p>
      <p>The recent Race to the Top initiative calls for “increased
learning time . . . to include additional time for . . .
teachers to collaborate, plan, and engage in professional
development within and across grades and subjects” (U.S.
Department of Education 2009). Schools and districts
often offer professional development opportunities for
teachers that have little pertinence for music teachers’ professional
development needs or interests. Offering music-making
professional development opportunities that allow teachers to
share music arrangements that they have used with
success would be both beneficial and inexpensive. Such an
approach would also fulfill the goal of focusing professional
development around subject matter or content knowledge
(see Conway 2007; Darling-Hammond et al. 2009; Day and
Gu 2010).</p>
      <p>Another idea for including music-making in departmental
or districtwide meetings would be to share different teachers’
expertise in a variety of styles. For instance, a music teacher
in the district might play jazz, rock, or fiddling music. This
teacher could bring in snippets of music and teach some of
the foundational skills and techniques associated with that
genre, as well as offer suggestions for other pieces or artists
that might spark interest. Many general music teachers
incorporate music from around the world into their
curricula. Sharing literature and background information about the
genre or style could be helpful. If the music teacher chose to
teach rote songs from different countries, each music teacher
could choose to sing or play the song on his or her instrument
of choice. Each could experience the music and then discuss
appropriate additions to the melody to make an arrangement
specific to different ensembles. Music-making in these ways
could increase teachers’ interest and confidence in sharing
new arrangements and genres with their students.</p>
      <p>For professional development, a music-making approach
might be adopted through either formal programs or more
individual, informal ways. I suggest that districts and schools
approve and encourage music-making outside of the
classroom as an acceptable professional development activity.
Rehearsing and performing in a community orchestra, band,
choir, or chamber music group could be counted toward
development if documentation such as concert programs and
videotaped portions of rehearsals and concerts were
submitted. If a music teacher formed a small chamber ensemble,
performing for students in the district’s schools could
demonstrate the value that music teachers assign to music-making
in their lives. This example might inspire students by
showing the levels of music-making that are achievable, and might
help recruit ensemble music students, enrich the general
population of students, and encourage other music teachers who
are interested in engaging in music-making.</p>
      <p>There are a multitude of music-making possibilities to
consider. Should practicing one’s own instrument or
sightreading music alone or with others count toward development
if videotaped evidence is provided? Should written reflection
about the value of these music-making activities be required?
How many hours would be acceptable? Each state’s
department of education would undoubtedly have its own opinion
on these subjects.</p>
      <p>Professional development programs could be created to
provide opportunities for teachers to better understand and
refine the ways in which they integrate music-making and
teaching. Standerfer (2008) suggests that meaningful
professional development consists of five elements: it is
voluntary, it is long-term, it occurs in the teachers’
classroom contexts, it is reflective, and teachers have collegial
support while engaging in it. These five elements should
be incorporated into future professional development
programs designed to help teachers better understand and
refine how they integrate music-making into their
classrooms. In-classroom reflection opportunities and action
research should be encouraged within the community of
music teachers. For instance, a year-long program could be
developed that includes such activities as asking teachers
to videotape themselves in the process of music-making
in the classroom with their students. A reflection
protocol might ask teachers to answer questions about why
they chose to play their instruments at that moment, what
they thought their students were learning at that moment,
and what they noticed about student reactions. Both
videotaped segments and these reflections could form the
basis for more in-depth discussion within a group of music
teachers.</p>
      <p>Protocols and discussion could also be designed to
help teachers better understand the role of music-making
in their own and their students’ lives. Discussions could
be based around questions such as: Describe what made
music-making meaningful to you as an elementary,
middle, or high school student. Describe what makes
musicmaking meaningful to you now. Are these reasons
different? Describe obstacles to continuing your music-making.
Why do you think your students want to make music?
Are these reasons similar to the reasons you had for
making music? In my experience, participants in such groups
are able to come to new realizations about themselves as
they engage in conversations about their music-making and
teaching.</p>
      <p>Teachers might then ask their students: What do you like
about music-making? What is you favorite piece and why?
What is your favorite part of this class? Why do you continue
to make music in this class? Do you make music in other
ways? How do you think you will continue making music in
the future?</p>
      <p>This process of reflective questioning can help teachers
better understand how music-making and teaching intersect.
Such discussion also provides an opportunity for teachers
to observe students, reflect on their own practice, and learn
from other music teachers’ experiences. This approach could
be adopted through a separate professional development
program or incorporated into a collaborative teacher study group.
In-classroom reflection and sharing might constitute a
portion of the sessions, but a significant part of each session
should be devoted to music-making of both music that
students are already playing and music that is chosen for the
purpose of enjoyment.</p>
      <p>CONCLUSION: MUSIC-MAKING AS A</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="4">
      <title>PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="5">
      <title>FOR MUSIC TEACHERS</title>
      <p>Conway, Albert, Hibbard, and Hourigan (2005) have
questioned whether it is possible for arts teachers to have a voice
in designing and implementing their own professional
development. Professional development policies vary from state
to state, but recent efforts have shown the possibility of
creating professional development requirements that are
relevant for each teacher. In Rhode Island, for instance, teachers
have “individual professional development plans,” known as
“I-Plans,” which are intended to help teachers focus on
“personal and professional goals, student achievement, teaching
and learning, and school improvement initiatives” (Rhode
Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education
2010).</p>
      <p>Policymakers in other states may need to be convinced
of music-making’s connection to music teaching and
student learning. Instead of portraying an individual teacher’s
music-making as unrelated to the job of teaching music, this
activity should be framed as a source of inspiration for both
the teacher involved in the music-making and his or her
students. Three benefits of this approach for students might be
cited as: (a) the ability to see as role models those teachers
who balance engagement with their art forms and teaching;
(b) the presence of excellent instrumental models in the
classroom, fostering more efficient student learning; and (c) the
presence of inspired and passionate teaching about playing
and performing. Reasons for using music-making as a
professional development activity might include teachers’ ability to
(a) learn literature and new genres of music to bring back to
students; (b) develop strategies for helping students through
engagement in personal music-making; (c) maintain their
listening and playing skills at high levels to provide excellent
models for students, as well as support their own identity as
musicians, increasing their sense of efficacy and agency; (d)
relate to students as learners and become more empathetic
to the challenges these learners are facing; and (f ) combat
burn-out.</p>
      <p>As Hammel (2007) notes, it is not beneficial to have a
one-size-fits-all approach to professional development. I am
not suggesting that there is one way to be a successful music
teacher or that all music teachers must devote significant time
to music-making. However, many music teachers do not think
of music-making and music teaching as two separate aspects
of being music teachers. Instead, in my experience, they
describe music-making and teaching as two essential aspects
of their identities that intersect to form and inform the music
teacher and positively influence student learning in a
multitude of ways (Pellegrino 2010). Therefore, I argue that
musicmaking is a powerful personal and pedagogical tool in music
education for many music teachers, and I urge policymakers
to recognize the benefits explored in this article and provide
opportunities for music teachers to engage in professional
development that includes a music-making component.</p>
