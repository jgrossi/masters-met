        <p>The purpose of this article is to introduce the characteristics of Korean rhythmic patterns and provide effective ways to teach Korean rhythms based on the theoretical and pedagogical approaches derived from 5,000 years of Korean musical tradition. First, we have provided the fundamental principles of Korean rhythms that represent the culture from which the music originated. Then, we have introduced the pedagogical process of Korean music, which includes the use of gu-em (Korean verbal syllables of music) and improvisatory practice. Finally, we have offered the resource of composition and the schoolwide performance using Korean rhythms that would be suitable to a contemporary educational context. By doing this, music educators will gain an understanding of the characteristics of Korean rhythms and acquire the skills necessary to teach them in the classrooms; as a consequence, they can confidently incorporate Korean rhythms in general music classes.</p>

      <p>One of the most important purposes of teaching world
musics in a general music classroom is to introduce
unfamiliar music to students. Since the Tanglewood
symposium, which posited the importance of “music of all
periods, styles, forms, and cultures” (Robert, Charles,
Charles, &amp; Wersen, 1967, p. 51), the National Association
for Schools of Music made world music training a
mandatory part of the music education sequence in 1972, and
the National Standards for Art Education has
emphasized the importance of having students understand
music in relation to history and culture (Consortium of
National Arts Education Associations, 1994). In
addition, the Housewright Declaration (Madsen, 2000)
supported the inclusion of all types of music, stating, “All
music has a place in the curriculum. Not only does the
Western art tradition need to be preserved and
disseminated” (p. 219).</p>
      <p>However, it is difficult for music teachers to actively
introduce those unfamiliar musical styles into the music
curriculum without understanding the musical tradition
through research, such as reading, performing, or
listening (Campbell, 2004). In addition, music teachers also
need access to high-quality multicultural materials that
provide an appropriate strategy of how to teach those
distinctive characteristics (McCarthy, 1997). This would be
an important issue because in teaching music from
unfamiliar cultures to students in the classroom, instructors
should incorporate not only the musical style itself but
also the way the music is taught within that culture
(Senders &amp; Davidson, 2000).</p>
      <p>The purpose of this article is to introduce the
characteristics of Korean rhythmic patterns and provide
effective ways to teach Korean rhythms in the general music
classroom setting. Since Korea has 5,000 years of history,
Koreans have developed their own musical tradition.
Most musical characteristics are well preserved and have
been passed down to contemporary generations; rhythm
patterns are one of them. Moreover, this project suggests
effective ways to teach Korean rhythms based on the
theoretical and pedagogical approaches derived from the
Korean musical tradition, which includes improvisatory
practices. Last, we will suggest the idea of teaching
composition and performance to students by using these
newly learned Korean rhythms, as an approach to bridge
the Korean musical tradition and current practices of
music education in the United States.</p>

      <title>Characteristics of Korean Rhythms</title>
      <p>In traditional Korean music, rhythm cycles play an
important role, distinguishing the musical tradition of
Korea from Western music, where melody and harmony
take the primary place (Harwood, 1976; So, 2002). Most
Korean musical pieces, including both art and folk music,
have rhythmic cycles that underpin the entirety of the
music. This rhythmic cycle is called jangdan, literally
meaning “long and short.” Jangdan consists of small
rhythm sets of duple or triple beats that comprise either
symmetrical or asymmetrical patterns (Lee, 1997).</p>
      <p>There are two ways in which jangdan has been used in
the Korean music tradition. In the first case, jangdan
serves as a major means of accompanying music.
Regardless of vocal or instrumental music, a cycle is
repeated for a whole section, similar to the Western
concept of ostinato. However, whereas ostinato tends to
preserve the same rhythm patterns and a steady beat, Korean
jangdan is repeated with lots of improvised variants.
When jangdan is adopted for accompaniment, it is mainly
played using the Korean hourglass-shaped drum named
janggu (see Figure 1).</p>
      <p>In the second case, jangdan is performed as its own
form of folk music mainly played with percussion
instruments. Among percussion ensembles, samulnori
(meaning “playing the four objects”) is the most popular
throughout the country and abroad. In samulnori, the four
Korean percussion instruments play jangdan in an
artistically elaborate manner, not only with lots of improvised
variants but also with increasingly accelerated tempo.
The four percussion instruments include janggu (Korean
hourglass drum), kkwanggwari (Korean small flat gong),
buk (Korean barrel drum), and jing (Korean large gong;
see Figure 2).</p>
      <p>Jangdan includes either symmetrical or asymmetrical
patterns, depending on the different allocations of duple or
triple beats. For example, when the four triple beats
comprise one jangdan of 12 beats, this jangdan becomes a
symmetrical pattern in 12/8 meter. Figure 3 presents
musical excerpts of the symmetrical 12-beat jangdan from the
Sam-chae percussion ensemble piece (Howard, 1992).</p>
      <p>However, the different allocation of duple and triple
beats can often comprise one jangdan. Although the
jangdan generally remains as a 12-beat cycle, as different sets
of duple or triple beats combine up to 12 beats, it sounds
asymmetrical. The musical excerpt in Figure 4 is from the
same percussion ensemble piece, Sam-chae (Choi, 2000,
p. 140). It sounds irregular because of the different
allocation of 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3.</p>
      <p>The different allocations can happen across more than
one jangdan cycle. Figure 5, drawn from a Korean folk
instrumental piece (Moon, 1989), presents an example of
the asymmetric allocation of rhythm sets occurring within
the two cycles of 12-beat jangdans across 24 beats; this
process exaggerates its rhythmic asymmetry to listeners.</p>
      <p>These asymmetrical combinations of duple and triple
beats can comprise various jangdans as short as five beats
(duple + triple or triple + duple) and up to as long as 36
beats (Lee, 1997). Figure 6, excerpted from another
Korean percussion piece titled Chil-chae, is the longest
rhythmic pattern that consists of 36 beats. As shown in
Figure 6, this 36-beat jangdan could also be divided into
sets in this manner: 5 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5. Moreover,
it could be further subdivided into 5 (3 + 2) + 5 (3 + 2) +
6 (3 + 3) + 5 (3 + 2) + 5 (3 + 2) + 5 (3 + 2). Therefore, the
long asymmetrical jangdan creates smaller jangdans
within a larger one.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, in Korea, aural and oral transmission
has been a major means of teaching and learning music.
Korea has developed its unique notational systems; but
because of the already broad scope of this article, they
will not be explained in detail. Korean notational systems
have not been considered as reliable a source of critical
musical information as Western music. Instead, a
notational system has been devised to help musicians
remember or recall a lesson, or to preserve and conserve the
music (Campbell, 1991a; Paek, 2007). Following the
example of Korean folk music tradition, in this article, the
structure of the rhythmic patterns is described in terms of
Western rhythm and Western rhythmic notation in order
to help readers who are educators remember or recall a
lesson or to preserve and conserve the rhythmic patterns
they want to teach. However, it is advisable not to use
notation when teaching students. Adopting an oral and
aural teaching process is a recommendable way to help
students grasp and perform musical structures when
teaching Korean rhythms.</p>
      <p>Students can practice oral and aural transmission with
the use of gu-em presented under Western notation in the
example of chil-chae in Figure 7. Gu-em are Korean
verbal syllables of music, and it literally means “mouth
tone.” Gu-em is an effective tool to aid learners in
memorizing music, since in this manner, some folk music
is transmitted from generation to generation in Korea (So,
2002). With the nuance and strength of each phoneme,
gu-em provides a sense of rhythmic length and dynamics
to practitioners; in this way, it resembles Kodaly rhythm
syllables. For example, as shown in Figure 7,
kkwdanggwari gu-em indicates the long and strong beat as “gan”
and the short and weak beat as “ji.” Therefore, if learners
verbalize this gu-em, they could acquire rhythmic
structure and could be able to play the music accordingly.
Gu-em primarily imitates the sounds of each instrument
(So, 2002); each syllable in the words “gan ji,” “dung
de,” gung gu,” and “jing” represents the instrumental
sounds of kkwanggwari (Korean small flat gong), janggu
(Korean hourglass drum), buk (Korean barrel drum), and
jing (Korean large gong), respectively. Gu-em is also
referred to as yukbo, meaning “physical notation” (So,
2002), which may imply that Korean music educators
tried to “inscribe” or “notate” music inside of the
learners’ bodies and minds by using those syllables. Therefore,
the purpose of using gu-em or yukbo is more than just
memorizing music; rather, it is about having students
internalize music.</p>
      <p>One of the unique characteristics of jangdan lies in its
improvisatory practice. Among the characteristics of this
improvisation are elaboration and spontaneity, both of
which can be found particularly in folk music
performance, such as percussion ensembles or virtuoso
instrumental solo pieces (Campbell, 1991b; Lee, 1980). Every
jangdan begins with the basic pattern of slow tempo and
soft dynamics. The more a cycle is repeated, the more
elaboration and spontaneity take place by subdividing
beats and adding the micro beats of ornamentation;
variation on the basic pattern is unlimited (Choi, 2000).
Moreover, along with this procedure, the tempo is
gradually accelerated until performers and audiences reach
their musical and emotional peak (Choi, 2000). In this
manner, Korea’s musical tradition has provided a certain
degree of freedom to performers, which can be attributed
to the improvisatory characteristics of Korean music.</p>
      <p>Teaching procedures of the aforementioned Korean
rhythms will be provided in the following sections. The
procedures will use the traditional Korean learning style,
gu-em, in order to teach repeated rhythmic cycles of
symmetry and asymmetry, improvisatory practices, and tempo
changes, primarily based on Korean musical tradition in
terms of musical style and learning method. In addition,
the procedures will include ideas about teaching
composition and performance with the use of these newly-learned
Korean rhythms to reconcile the Korean music tradition
with contemporary music education practices.
The proposed lesson plan is designed for use in upper
elementary and secondary music classrooms over several
class periods. Through the steps that follow, students will
learn basic rhythmic cycles (jangdan) of symmetry and
asymmetry, how to develop the basic rhythmic cycle in
the process of improvisation, and how to create and
perform their own rhythmic cycles. The following lesson
plan is divided into three main sections with detailed
explanations of lesson procedures for each step.
The 12-Beat Rhythmic Cycle</p>
      <p>Step 1: The symmetrical 12-beat rhythmic cycle
(jangdan): The primary goal of Step 1 is for students
to learn to play the symmetrical 12-beat rhythmic</p>
      <p>cycle (see Video 1 in the supplementary material).
Before students play classroom instruments, they will
learn to enunciate duple or triple beats using Korean
verbal syllables (gu-em) that provide the students
with a sense of rhythmic length and appropriate
dynamics (see Figure 8). In Figure 8, rhythm (a) is
pronounced “gahn-gee,” “gahn” being long and
strong and “gee” weak and short. Rhythm (b) is
enunciated “ge-gahn” Here, the short note preceding a
long note indicates the short note should be weak;
thus, the rhythm (b) is pronounced with emphasis on
“gahn.” Rhythm (c) is pronounced “ge-ge-ge,” with
the first “ge” accented and stronger than the others.
Rhythm (d) is pronounced “gahn” and should be long
and strong. One rhythmic cycle consisting of 12 beats
has the appropriate length for students to begin to
learn Korean rhythms; the 12-beat rhythm will also
become familiar to students as it frequently appears in
Korean folk music. In this step, the teacher instructs
the students to imitate symmetrical 12-beat rhythmic
cycles until the students become familiar with the
Korean verbal syllables. Examples of various 12-beat
cycles are shown in Figure 9 (see Figure 9; see also
Video 4 in the supplementary material). Once
students internalize the cycles using verbal syllables,</p>
      <p>they can practice replicating them on instruments,
maintaining the correct rhythms and placing accents
in the appropriate places.</p>
      <p>Step 2: The asymmetrical 12-beat rhythmic cycle
(jangdan): The second step of the lesson plan involves
practicing the allocations of duple and triple beats in
the asymmetrical 12-beat rhythmic cycle. To help
students acquire a sense of the patterns of an
asymmetrical 12-beat rhythmic cycle, the teacher instructs
students by chanting several rhythmic cycles
containing different allocations of duple or triple beats (see
Figure 10; see also Video 2 in the supplementary
material) using Korean verbal syllables. Afterwards,
students practice the rhythmic cycles on the classroom
instruments
Step 3: Improvisatory practice in the 12-beat
rhythmic cycle: After students recognize and become
familiar with both symmetrical and asymmetrical 12-beat
rhythmic cycles, they can begin learning the process of
improvisation with these rhythmic cycles through the
following steps. The teacher first provides students with
the symmetrical 12-beat rhythmic cycle (see Figure 9)
that the students practiced in the first step. Students play
the provided rhythmic cycle several times until they are
familiar with the basic pattern. Afterward, they are
encouraged to add micro beats of ornamentation to the
basic patterns. When an ornamental note precedes any
note, it is pronounced “gə-rahng”; gə should be weak
and added to the following note as quickly as possible
and “rahng” should be strong (see Figure 11; see also</p>
      <p>Video 5 in the supplementary material). Then,
instructors can encourage students to allocate different rhythm
sets of duple and triple beats within 12 beats. During
this process, tempo is increasingly accelerated from
slow to fast. The more the rhythm peaks in the fast
tempo, the more the beat tends to be subdivided with
the loudest dynamics. In this process, initial beats of the
duple and triples beats should be accented so as to avoid
blurring the border between duple and triple beats
(Video 6 in the supplementary material).
After sufficient practice of the 12-beat cycle, the teacher can
instruct students to play longer rhythmic cycles, such as the
symmetrical 24-beat rhythmic cycle or the asymmetrical
36-beat rhythmic cycle through the same steps as the 12-beat
rhythms. The teacher uses two rhythmic cycles of Sam-chae
(24-beat cycle) and the chil-chae rhythmic cycle (36-beat
cycle) so as to teach longer rhythmic cycles, because both
frequently appear in the well-known Korean percussion
ensemble pieces, such as samulnori (see Figure 2).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="3">
      <title>Composition and Performance</title>
      <p>So far, students have learned and performed the
symmetrical and asymmetrical rhythmic cycles drawn from
Korean tradition. Now, we suggest the next step of
composition and performance to allow students to extend the
rhythmic cycles to any longer patterns and make their
own performances, creating a link between the Korean
and Western music tradition.</p>
      <p>For the compositional activity, the teacher divides the
class into groups of four students and then asks each
group to choose two different types of rhythmic cycles.
For example, one group might select a rhythmic cycle
consisting of 12 and 24 beats, and another group might
choose 12 and 28 beats. Next, students determine the
allocations of duple and triple beats in their rhythmic
cycles (e.g., 28 beats: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 +
2 + 2; see Figure 12). Following the allocation, the
students design the overall structure of their composition:
for instance, (A) 28 beats × 4 times (B) 12 beats (A) 28
beats × 4 times, and so on. Finally, each group performs
its own rhythmic cycles for the class with the use of
instruments (either traditional Korean instruments or
classroom instruments), which could result in an
expanded percussion piece for an extended version of a
classroom composition-based activity. The two examples
(Videos 7 and 8 in the supplementary material) are
extended versions of classroom composition based on the
same Korean rhythmic structure explained above. If
authentic Korean instruments are available to you, it is
advisable that you provide your students with an
opportunity to learn to play and perform their own rhythms. If
you do not have Korean traditional instruments, you
could borrow these authentic instruments from the
Korean student union at a local university or Korean
Hangul schools where Korean American children usually
learn Korean culture and language.</p>
      <p>However, realistically, most music teachers have been
faced with limited access to traditional instruments in
their classrooms. In school systems where traditional
instruments are unavailable, it is acceptable, practical, and
effective to use classroom instruments so as to provide
students with opportunities to experience active and
participatory music-making activities with diverse musical
cultures (Bartolome, 2011; Klinger, 1996). Teachers can
also take advantage of technology by bringing
i-instruments and applications for mobile devices to world music
lessons in the general music classroom. With these
opportunities, teachers can aid students in experiencing
indigenous instruments in an indirect manner.</p>
      <p>In addition, teachers can frequently use handmade
instruments created to resemble the appearance and
sounds of traditional ethnic instruments to encourage
students to engage in performing and making music
(Anderson &amp; Campbell, 2011). For example, a
gallonsized plastic milk carton can be a substitute for a Korean
drum because the mechanics of vibration of both are
similar. The Korean metal instrument kkwanggwari (a small
gong) can be replaced by a metal bowl because both are
made of metal. The students of each group are provided
with everyday-item instruments attached to pictures of
authentic instruments. By drawing associations between
performances on handmade instruments with images of
the traditional instruments they simulate, teachers can
effectively and accurately introduce students to different
musical cultures (Anderson &amp; Campbell, 2011). More
important, the teacher should allow the students to
compare recordings (see Video 9 in the supplementary
material) of “the original music” played with traditional
instruments to the “students’ recreations of it” played
with the classroom instruments or ordinary objects
(Campbell, 2004; Szego, 2005). By linking the authentic
sounds of world music to their compositions (Anderson
&amp; Campbell, 2011; Campbell, 2004), teachers can
effectively “tune students’ ears to the sounds of the musicians”
(Bartolome, 2011).</p>
      <p>Reflections on Future Teaching in</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="4">
      <title>the World Music Class</title>
      <p>Schippers and Campbell (2012) reported that music
teachers have faced some challenges associated with
teaching multicultural music including teachers’ fear of
being inauthentic, presenting the music out of context, a
limited understanding of pedagogical processes, and lack
of the necessary resources. In this article, we have tried to
provide some practical guidance to teach Korean rhythms
in order to help teachers resolve those challenges. First,
we have provided the fundamental principles of Korean
rhythms so as to provide musical authenticity. Also, we
have introduced the pedagogical process of Korean
music, which includes the use of gu-em and
improvisatory practice. Last, we have provided the resources of
composition and performance using Korean rhythm that
would be suitable in a contemporary educational context.
In this manner, students would be able to experience
Korean musical tradition, which has been practically
adapted for use in current general music classrooms.
More world music materials satisfying both the original
musical tradition and practicability should be developed
and disseminated to the music classroom, not only from
Korean music but also from various music cultures. By
doing this, music teacher educators will gain an
understanding of each characteristic of music from different
cultures and acquire the skills necessary to teach them in
their classrooms; as a consequence, they can confidently
incorporate world music in general music classes.
We would like to express the deepest appreciation to Keith P.
Thompson, professor emeritus in music education, for guidance
and help.</p>
