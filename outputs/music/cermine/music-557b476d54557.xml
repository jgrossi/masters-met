        <p>This study is concerned with the question whether, and to what extent, listeners' previous exposure to music in everyday life, and expertise as a result of formal musical training, play a role in making expressive timing judgments in music. This was investigated by using a Web-based listening experiment in which listeners with a wide range of musical backgrounds were asked to compare 2 recordings of the same composition (15 pairs, grouped in 3 musical genres), 1 of which was tempo-transformed (manipulating the expressive timing). The results show that expressive timing judgments are not so much influenced by expertise levels, as is suggested by the expertise hypothesis, but by exposure to a certain musical idiom, as is suggested by the exposure hypothesis. As such, the current study provides evidence for the idea that some musical capabilities are acquired through mere exposure to music, and that these abilities are more likely enhanced by active listening (exposure) than by formal musical training (expertise).</p>

      <p>The ability to make, perceive, and enjoy music is generally
regarded as an evolutionary by-product of more important
functions, such as those involved in language (Pinker, 1997). However,
there is increasing evidence that humans are born with musical
biases and predispositions that are unique to human cognition
(Hannon &amp; Trehub, 2005; Peretz, 2006; Zatorre, 2005). Although
it remains unclear whether this evidence can be interpreted as a
sign that a capacity for music is rooted in nature, rather than
nurture, there is little controversy around the idea that musical
competence is a special human capacity that is shared across ages
and cultures (Blacking, 1974; Jackendoff &amp; Lerdahl, 2006;
Mithen, 2005; Sloboda, 2000; Trehub, 2003). In the present article
we concentrate on the question whether musical competence—the
perceptual skills and musical knowledge that are required to
perceive and appreciate musical input—is influenced by extensive
formal musical training (explicit knowledge), or whether it can
also be interpreted as a result of mere exposure to music (implicit
knowledge).</p>
      <p>Although some older studies argue that musical competence is a
special, innate talent (“musicians are born, not made”; cf. Sloboda,
1994), the most common view is that musical abilities are shaped
mostly by intense musical training (Dienes &amp; Longuet-Higgins,
2004; Sloboda, 1994; Smith, 1997; Wolpert, 2000) and that they
remain rather rough in untrained listeners (Jackendoff &amp; Lerdahl,
2006). Some authors even suggest that after the age of 10, musical
abilities no longer evolve without explicit musical training
(France`s, Zenatti, &amp; Imberty, 1979). These studies give support to
the common idea that musicians, due to their specific musical
talent and training, are more aware of musical detail (such as
nuances in expressive timing,1 discussed in the present study) than
are average listeners (Sloboda, 1994). We refer to this view as the
expertise hypothesis, in which explicit knowledge and extensive
musical training are considered the main contributors to musical
competence.</p>
      <p>Another, more recent view is that listeners without formal
musical training, when given sufficient exposure (e.g., listening to
music in everyday life, moving and dancing to music, attending
concerts) to a certain musical idiom, might actually perform
similarly in a task when compared with musically trained listeners
(Levitin, 2006; Schellenberg, 2006), especially when they are
asked to do a musical task that uses realistic and ecologically valid
stimuli. With regard to the latter, it could be argued that the
differences in musical competence between musicians and
non</p>

        <title>1 Expressive timing is the term used to refer to the minute deviations</title>
        <p>from regularity that contribute to the quality of a music performance
(Clarke, 1999; Palmer, 1997).
musicians, as suggested by the literature, could well be an artifact
of tasks using explicit naming—a situation in which musically
trained listeners would have an advantage over untrained listeners.
We refer to this view as the exposure hypothesis, in which implicit
knowledge as a result of mere exposure (e.g., listening to one’s
preferred music) is considered the main contributor to musical
competence.</p>
        <p>An example in support of the exposure hypothesis is a study by
Bigand and Poulin-Charronnat (2006), who discovered that
nonmusicians can be as sensitive as musicians to subtle aspects of
music harmony, suggesting that musical training and explicit
knowledge of music theory are unnecessary to acquire
sophisticated knowledge about melody and harmony (Bigand, Tillmann,
Poulin, D’Adamo, &amp; Madurell, 2001; Tillmann, Bharucha, &amp;
Bigand, 2000).2 Furthermore, prolonged exposure to a specific
musical idiom seems to allow nonmusicians, without explicit
knowledge about a certain musical genre, to internalize the rules
that are typical to such a genre and do almost equally well as
musicians in a comparison task. Dalla Bella and Peretz (2005)
found that all listeners—musicians and nonmusicians alike—are
sensitive to styles of Western classical music, arguing that this is
supported by cross-cultural perceptual processes that allow for
discrimination of key perceptual features.</p>
        <p>In the present study we are interested in whether these recent
findings (i.e., the effect of exposure on making sophisticated
musical judgments) also hold in the temporal domain of music
cognition.</p>
        <p>Listening Experiment Using a Comparison Task
To study the effect of exposure and expertise in the temporal
domain, we used a listening task that allows for testing the effect
of different listener groups and different expertise levels on
temporal sensitivity. In this task, participants were asked to compare
two performances of the same composition (15 pairs, grouped in
three musical genres: classical, rock, and jazz; see Tables 1, 2, and
3). Each stimulus pair consisted of an audio recording by one artist
and a manipulated, tempo-transformed audio recording by another
artist. The tempo-transformed version was originally performed at
a different tempo, but was scaled to be similar in overall tempo to
the other performance of the pair. This resulted in stimulus pairs
that have the same tempo, one of which is not manipulated, the
other tempo-transformed. The participants had to indicate which of
the two stimuli sounds more “natural” or musically plausible by
focusing on the expressive timing that could have been
manipulated as a result of the tempo-transformation.</p>
        <p>This particular task was used for a number of reasons. First, the
use of different musical genres (rock, jazz, classical) allows every
participant to be either explicitly or implicitly competent, through
either formal training or listening experience, in at least one
musical genre. Second, expressive timing tends to be characteristic
for a particular genre.3 In fact, Dalla Bella and Peretz (2005)
showed that temporal variability can serve as an index to mark a
certain musical style. Both aspects suggest that expressive timing
could serve as an indicator of temporal sensitivity to a musical
idiom. Third, because expressive timing was shown not to be
perceptually invariant under tempo-transformation (Honing,
2006a), as such it can function as a cue for listeners to decide
whether or not a performance is tempo-transformed. Fourth, the
time-scale algorithm used to make the tempo-transformed stimuli
(Bonada, 2000) allows for manipulating the temporal information
while maintaining musically realistic stimuli. This algorithm
manipulates expressive timing while the original sound quality (e.g.,
attack transients and timbre) is kept perceptually invariant. And
finally, the task (i.e., comparing the quality of the expressive
timing used in a performance) is similar to the “blindfold test” that
is quite popular in media that review new CD recordings (such as
magazines and radio shows). In such a test, a panel of music
professionals is asked to compare and comment on the musical
quality of a number of different recordings of the same music.
Music lovers tend to find such a task attractive and challenging
(Honing &amp; Ladinig, 2008).</p>
        <p>A previous study (Honing, 2006a) showed that experienced
listeners are quite good at this comparison task and can distinguish
between a real and a tempo-transformed performance. In the
current study we investigate whether this is expert behavior or
whether listeners without formal musical training, but with
sufficient exposure to a certain musical idiom (e.g., jazz, rock, or
classical music), can do this equally well. The expertise hypothesis
predicts that experts should do better, independent of musical
genre. The exposure hypothesis predicts that experienced listeners
should do better, independent of the amount of musical training
they have received.</p>
        <p>Invitations were sent to various mailing lists, online forums, and
universities to reach a wide variety of respondents (N 208). Five
gift certificates were raffled among those who responded. The
respondents were between 12 and 63 years old (M 34, SD
11.5, Mode 26) and had various musical backgrounds.
Thirtyfour percent received little or no formal musical training, 29%
could be considered musical experts (i.e., with more than 8 years
of formal musical training and starting at a young age; Ericsson,
Krampe, &amp; Tesch-Ro¨mer, 1993), and the remaining 37% could be
classified as “semimusician.” Finally, 39% mentioned classical
music as their main exposure category; 27%, jazz; and 34%, rock
music.</p>
        <p>We processed the responses in an online version of the
experiment using standard Web browser technologies (see Honing,
2006a, for details). The stimuli were excerpts of commercially
available recordings and were converted to the MPEG-4 file
format to guarantee optimal sound quality on different computer
platforms and to minimize the download time.</p>

        <p>Materials and Stimulus Preparation</p>
        <p>For each of the three genres, 10 audio recordings were selected
from commercially available CDs (see Tables 1–3). Each
performance pair (labeled A and B in the tables) consists of two
recordings of the same composition. These were selected such that
they differed between 20% and 30% in overall tempo. All sound
excerpts were taken from the beginning of a recording and
restricted to instrumental music only (see motivation below). For the
classical and jazz genres it was relatively easy to find such
recordings (see Tables 1 and 2). However, for the rock genre this turned
out to be quite a challenge, because it is less typical to have
recordings of the same song in quite different tempi. However,
using tools like iTunes (giving access to audio fragments of a large
set of commercial recordings),4 we were able to find 10 recordings
that were instrumental and had the desired tempo differences (see
Table 3).</p>
        <p>From each performance pair A and B, two stimulus pairs were
derived (A/B and A /B, with prime indicating a
tempotransformed recording). This resulted in a total of 30 real and 30
tempo-transformed recordings. All 60 stimuli (constructed from
the 30 recordings shown in Tables 1–3) can be found in the
supplemental materials.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the two stimulus pairs derived from each
performance pair were presented to two groups of listeners. This was
done to prevent the respondents from remembering characteristics
of the stimuli in one pair and using them to make a response to the
other pair. Group 1 (n 101) was presented with 15 A/B pairs,
whereas Group 2 (n 107) was presented with 15 A /B pairs.</p>
        <p>For each recording, the tempo was matched with a metronome
to the first four bars and checked perceptually by playing it along
with the music. The resulting tempo estimate (see Tempo column
in the tables) was used to calculate the tempo-scaling factor to
make the stimulus pairs similar in tempo. The average tempo
difference for each genre was about 24% (SD 3.5%).</p>
        <p>The tempo-transformed stimuli were made using state-of-the-art
time-scale modification software (Bonada, 2000). This software
can change the overall tempo of a recording while keeping the
pitch and sound quality (e.g., attack transients and timbre)
invariant. As such, this algorithm minimizes the effect of sound quality
artifacts that could bias the results. This was confirmed by an
earlier study (Experiment 2 in Honing, 2006a) in which audio
experts were presented with original and tempo-transformed
stimuli and asked to identify what they considered a manipulated
recording. Over the whole set of 28 stimuli, audio experts did no
better than chance. Although three stimuli attracted slightly more
responses, these did not bias the overall results (in fact, these
stimuli contained snippets of voice, such as audience coughs and
humming, that apparently caused small phasing effects that some
audio experts could spot when asked to do so).</p>
        <p>In the current study we therefore decided to use the same stimuli
for the classical genre as used in Honing (2006a), minus the pairs
that could have biased the results. Furthermore, we made sure that
the stimuli selected for the jazz and rock genres were instrumental
and did not contain any voice.</p>
        <p>Finally, there are two additional reasons why we think sound
quality is less of an issue in this study. First, participants were
explicitly instructed to base their judgment on the use of
ex</p>
      </sec>

pressive timing, not on the sound quality of the recordings (see
“N.B.” under Procedure). Second, we were interested in
differences between listener groups: With each listener group
listening to the same stimuli, it is unlikely that the occasional
participant ignoring these instructions would influence the
results.</p>
        <p>The presentation of the stimuli was randomized within and
between pairs for each participant, as was the assignment of
participants to either Group 1 or Group 2. Participants could
choose between a Dutch or English version of the instructions.</p>
        <p>Participants were invited to visit a Web page of the online
experiment.5 First, they were asked to test their computer and
audio system with a short sound excerpt and to adjust the
volume to a comfortable level. Second, they were asked to fill
in a questionnaire to obtain information on their musical
background, listening experience, and musical training. Participants
were, for instance, requested to estimate the distribution of their
average listening time over particular musical genres (classical,
jazz, pop, rock, etc.) in percentages. This information was used
for the measures of exposure and expertise (see Analyses).
Finally, they were referred to a Web page containing the actual
experiment. The following instructions were given:
You will be presented with fifteen pairs of audio fragments in three
different repertoires (classical, jazz, and rock): one being a real
recording (by one artist), the other a manipulated tempo-transformed
recording (by another artist). The tempo-transformed version was
originally recorded at a different tempo, but it has been time-stretched
(or time-compressed) to become close in tempo to the other
performance of the pair. Your task is to decide which is which. This might
be quite a challenge.</p>
        <p>Please do the following: 1) Listen to a pair of audio fragments once
and in their entirety (in a quiet environment without distractions or
with headphones). 2) Focus on the use of expressive timing by the
performer (such as note asynchrony, tempo rubato and articulation).</p>
        <sec id="1-4-1">
          <title>3) Then answer the questions listed next to the excerpts, namely: Which is the real (i.e. not tempo-transformed) recording, the top or the bottom excerpt? Are you sure? And, do you know this composition? 4) Please do this for all fifteen pairs of audio fragments presented</title>
          <p>below. N.B. All fragments are processed in some way, so please
ignore sound quality as a possible cue for deciding which is which:
Just focus on the timing of the performer(s).</p>
          <p>The total experiment took, on average, 38 min to complete.6</p>
          <p>The response forms were automatically sent by e-mail to the
authors and converted into a tabulated file for further analysis with
POCO (Honing, 1990), music software for symbolic and
numerical analyses, and SPSS (Version 11), for statistical analyses. To
filter out the occasional nonserious responses, we included only
entirely completed response forms and those responses that took
more than 10 min for the listening part of the experiment. Dropout
(percentage of visitors who did not finalize the experiment or did
it too quickly, e.g., against instruction to listen completely through
each audio fragment) was 36% of all respondents.</p>
          <p>The information as collected in the questionnaire was used to
assign expertise and exposure levels to each participant. With
regard to expertise, participants were classified into three
categories: (a) nonmusicians, who had received less than 3 years of
training or no training at all; (b) expert musicians, with formal
musical training longer than 8 years starting before the age of 9;
and (c) semimusicians, participants that fall between these two
extremes. We refer to these categories as expertise.</p>
          <p>With regard to exposure, participants were also classified into
three categories: classical, jazz, and rock listener. A participant
was assigned to a certain listener category when he or she
indicated preference for one particular genre (with a minimum

        <p>Results and Discussion</p>
        <p>Overall the participants correctly identified the real performance
60.1% of the time (SD 9.7%). In the classical genre this was
65.3% (SD 21.0%); for jazz, 56.6% (SD 19.0%); and for rock,
58.2% (SD 20.2%). The average percentage correct for each of
our nine participant groups (Exposure Expertise) was found to
be significantly above chance level (50%) using a t test ( p .05).
From this we can conclude that each participant group was capable
of distinguishing a real recording from a manipulated,
tempotransformed performance (see Figure 1). As such, we were able to
replicate the main result from Honing (2006a), which used the
same task and partly the same stimuli.8
Effect of Exposure and Expertise</p>
        <p>In this study, however, we were interested in seeing whether
these judgments are the result of expert behavior or whether
listeners without formal training, but with sufficient exposure to a
certain musical genre, can do this equally well.</p>
        <p>To analyze the effect of exposure and expertise on the amount
of correct timing judgments of the participants, we calculated a 3
(exposure) 3 (expertise) 3 (genre) analysis of variance, with
exposure and expertise as between-subject variables and genre,
with the levels classical music, jazz music, and rock music, as a
within-subject variable.</p>
        <p>We found an effect for genre, F(2, 244) 8.19, p .01, p2
.063, showing that the overall performance, regardless of exposure
or expertise, differed for each genre. Contrasts revealed that
subjects performed better for classical music as compared with both
jazz, F(1, 122) 15.77, p .001, and rock, F(1, 122) 8.41, p
.01.9 Furthermore, we did not find effects for either of the
between-subject variables, or an interaction of these variables.
However, we did find a significant three-way interaction of genre,
exposure, and expertise, F(8, 244) 2.14, p .05, 2p .065.</p>
        <p>The interactions are indicated in Figure 1. In the left panel of
Figure 1 the results are grouped according to expertise levels; in
the right panel the results are grouped according to listener type.
The interactions are indicated by asterisks (with an arrow pointing
from the cell that got significantly higher values to the cell with the
lower values). The majority of the interactions between exposure
and expertise occur in the jazz genre. The interactions in the right
panel show that expertise helps in making correct judgments,
especially in the jazz genre. Also, the effect of exposure is visible
in the jazz genre: Belonging to a certain listener group influences
the performance, and this effect is emphasized for experts, less
strong for semimusicians, and not visible for nonmusicians. The
remaining interactions (not depicted in Figure 1) are for the
participant groups “experts exposed to rock” and “naive listeners
exposed to jazz.” Both performed worse in jazz than in the other
genres ( p .05 for classical and p .05 for rock for the rock
listeners, p .05 for rock and p .01 for classical for the jazz
listeners). Finally, the participant group “experts exposed to
classical music” performed better in the classical genre than in the
other genres ( p .05 for jazz, p .01 for rock).</p>
        <p>A possible cause of these interactions, mainly occurring in the
jazz genre (see Figure 1, middle row), could be the special role of
timing in jazz music, often intentionally deviating from standard
patterns (Ashley, 2002). In a previous pilot study as well, timing in
jazz turned out to be more difficult to judge, making even experts
fail to recognize a tempo-transformed recording (Honing, 2007).
Effect of Exposure and Expertise on Sure Judgments</p>
        <p>However, due to the relative difficulty of the task, blurring the
results with responses the participants were unsure about, and that</p>

those judgments that the participants were sure about (referred to
as “correct/sure” responses). For this we calculated a 3

        <p>To view this interaction of genre and exposure in further detail,
we first analyzed the differences in responses with regard to the
different musical genres. For the classical genre, classical listeners
showed higher scores ( p .01) than rock listeners. For the jazz
repertoire, both classical and jazz listeners performed significantly
better ( p .05 and p .01, respectively) than rock listeners. For
the rock repertoire, there were no significant differences between
listener groups.</p>
        <p>Second, we analyzed how the responses differ within the listener
groups. Classical listeners performed better on the classical
repertoire than on the jazz or rock repertoire ( p .05 and p .001,
respectively) and better for the jazz genre than for the rock genre
( p .05). Rock listeners performed better on the rock repertoire
than on the jazz repertoire ( p .05). No significant differences
were found for the jazz listeners (although there was a tendency;
see Figure 2).</p>
        <p>In short, these results are in line with the idea that listeners
perform best in the genre they listen to most, irrespective of
expertise level, as was suggested by the exposure hypothesis.</p>
        <p>This study addresses the influence of exposure versus expertise
in making expressive timing judgments. It involved using an
online listening experiment in which listeners with different
musical preferences (exposure) and music education (expertise) were
asked to compare two performances of the same composition (15
pairs, grouped in three musical genres), one of which was
tempotransformed (manipulating the expressive timing). An earlier study
(Honing, 2006a) showed that expert listeners perform significantly
above chance in such a comparison task. Surprisingly, the current
study reveals that these judgments are not primarily influenced by
expertise level (e.g., years of formal training) but mainly by
exposure to a certain musical idiom. The interplay of familiarity
with a particular genre (exposure) and the level of formal musical
training (expertise) had a significant effect on discriminating a real
from a manipulated performance. In addition, taking into account
confidence, exposure positively influences the performance in a
listener’s preferred genre. In short, performance is not simply a
result of formal musical training, but is enhanced, and for the
confident responses even solely influenced, by listening to one’s
preferred music.</p>
        <p>These results are in line with what has been found in the pitch
domain (Bigand &amp; Poulin-Charronnat, 2006; Tillmann et al.,
2000). These studies found responses of musically untrained
listeners to be highly correlated with those of musically trained
listeners, suggesting a musical capacity for melody and harmony
judgments that is acquired through mere exposure to music,
without the help of explicit training. Although not all listeners might be
able to identify, label, or name explicitly what they perceive
(Honing, 2006b; Schellenberg, 2006), most listeners seem to have
a shared capability to distinguish between quite subtle musical
nuances in a musical task (e.g., making judgments on expressive
timing in the current study), a capability that is normally attributed
to musical experts only.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, these results are in line with Dalla Bella and Peretz
(2005), who found that a sensitivity to Western musical styles is
influenced by, but not conditional on, formal musical training, also
showing an effect of both expertise and exposure.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the current study provides evidence in the
temporal domain for the idea that some musical capabilities are
acquired through exposure to music, and that these abilities are
more likely enhanced by active listening (exposure) than by formal
musical training (expertise).</p>
        <p>10 To make certain the reported result was not simply due to analyzing
part of the data, we also analyzed the “correct/not sure” responses. For
these data we found, however, neither a significant effect of the
independent variables nor an interaction. As such, we can be sure that the results
reported for the correct/sure responses are not an artifact of the selection
made. In addition, we found the same effect of genre as we have in the
genre-specific correct judgments, F(2, 182) 5.45, p .01, p2 .057.
Contrasts revealed that subjects performed better for the classical genre
than the jazz genre, F(1, 91) 10.74, p .001, and the rock genre, F(1,
91) 3.84, p .05.
