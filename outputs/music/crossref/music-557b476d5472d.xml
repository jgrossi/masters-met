Rhythms In traditional Korean music, rhythm cycles play an important role,
distinguishing the musical tradition of Korea from Western music, where melody and
harmony take the primary place (Harwood, 1976; So, 2002). Most Korean musical pieces,
including both art and folk music, have rhythmic cycles that underpin the entirety of
the music. This rhythmic cycle is called jangdan, literally meaning "long and short."
Jangdan consists of small rhythm sets of duple or triple beats that comprise either
symmetrical or asymmetrical patterns (Lee, 1997). There are two ways in which jangdan
has been used in the Korean music tradition. In the first case, jangdan serves as a
major means of accompanying music. Regardless of vocal or instrumental music, a cycle
is repeated for a whole section, similar to the Western concept of ostinato. However,
whereas ostinato tends to preserve the same rhythm patterns and a steady beat, Korean
jangdan is repeated with lots of improvised variants. When jangdan is adopted for
accompaniment, it is mainly played using the Korean hourglass-shaped drum named
janggu (see Figure 1). In the second case, jangdan is performed as its own form of
folk music mainly played with percussion instruments. Among percussion ensembles,
samulnori (meaning "playing the four objects") is the most popular throughout the
country and abroad. In samulnori, the four Korean percussion instruments play jangdan
in an artistically elaborate manner, not only with lots of improvised variants but
also with increasingly accelerated tempo. The four percussion instruments include
janggu (Korean hourglass drum), kkwanggwari (Korean small flat gong), buk (Korean
barrel drum), and jing (Korean large gong; see Figure 2). Jangdan includes either
symmetrical or asymmetrical patterns, depending on the different allocations of duple

the four triple beats comprise one jangdan of 12 beats, this jangdan becomes a
symmetrical pattern in 12/8 meter. Figure 3 presents musical excerpts of the
symmetrical 12-beat jangdan from the Sam-chae percussion ensemble piece (Howard,
1992). However, the different allocation of duple and triple beats can often comprise
one jangdan. Although the jangdan generally remains as a 12-beat cycle, as different
sets of duple or triple beats combine up to 12 beats, it sounds asymmetrical. The
musical excerpt in Figure 4 is from the same percussion ensemble piece, Sam-chae
(Choi, 2000, p. 140). It sounds irregular because of the different allocation of 3 +
2 + 2 + 2 + 3. The different allocations can happen across more than one jangdan
cycle. Figure 5, drawn from a Korean folk instrumental piece (Moon, 1989), presents
an example of the asymmetric allocation of rhythm sets occurring within the two
cycles of 12-beat jangdans across 24 beats; this process exaggerates its rhythmic
asymmetry to listeners.<component x="309.0" y="71.1" width="230.97" height="227.07"

detail. Korean notational systems referred to as yukbo, meaning "physical notation"

that Korean music educators musical information as Western music. Instead, a
notatried to "inscribe" or "notate" music inside of the learnber or recall a lesson,
or to preserve and conserve the music (Campbell, 1991a; Paek, 2007). Following the
example of Korean folk music tradition, in this article, the structure of the
rhythmic patterns is described in terms of Western rhythm and Western rhythmic
notation in order to help readers who are educators remember or recall a lesson or to
preserve and conserve the rhythmic patterns they want to teach. However, it is
advisable not to use notation when teaching students. Adopting an oral and aural
teaching process is a recommendable way to help students grasp and perform musical
structures when teaching Korean rhythms. Students can practice oral and aural
transmission with the use of gu-em presented under Western notation in the example of
chil-chae in Figure 7. Gu-em are Korean verbal syllables of music, and it literally
means "mouth tone." Gu-em is an effective tool to aid learners in tional system has
been devised to help musicians remem- ers' bodies and minds by using those syllables.
Therefore, the purpose of using gu-em or yukbo is more than just memorizing music;
rather, it is about having students internalize music. One of the unique
characteristics of jangdan lies in its improvisatory practice. Among the
characteristics of this improvisation are elaboration and spontaneity, both of which
can be found particularly in folk music performance, such as percussion ensembles or
virtuoso instrumental solo pieces (Campbell, 1991b; Lee, 1980). Every jangdan begins
with the basic pattern of slow tempo and soft dynamics. The more a cycle is repeated,
the more elaboration and spontaneity take place by subdividing beats and adding the
micro beats of ornamentation; variation on the basic pattern is unlimited (Choi,
2000). Moreover, along with this procedure, the tempo is gradually accelerated until
performers and audiences reach their musical and emotional peak (Choi, 2000). In

tradition has provided a certain degree of freedom to performers, which can be
attributed to the improvisatory characteristics of Korean music. Teaching procedures
of the aforementioned Korean rhythms will be provided in the following sections. The
procedures will use the traditional Korean learning style, gu-em, in order to teach
repeated rhythmic cycles of symmetry and asymmetry, improvisatory practices, and
tempo changes, primarily based on Korean musical tradition in terms of musical style
and learning method. In addition, the procedures will include ideas about teaching
composition and performance with the use of these newly-learned Korean rhythms to
reconcile the Korean music tradition with contemporary music education practices.
Classroom Practice Teaching Korean Rhythms The proposed lesson plan is designed for
use in upper elementary and secondary music classrooms over several class periods.
Through the steps that follow, students will learn basic rhythmic cycles (jangdan) of
symmetry and asymmetry, how to develop the basic rhythmic cycle in the process of
improvisation, and how to create and perform their own rhythmic cycles. The following
lesson plan is divided into three main sections with detailed explanations of lesson
procedures for each step. The 12-Beat Rhythmic Cycle Step 1: The symmetrical 12-beat
rhythmic cycle (jangdan): The primary goal of Step 1 is for students to learn to play
the symmetrical 12-beat rhythmic cycle (see Video 1 in the supplementary material).
Before students play classroom instruments, they will learn to enunciate duple or
triple beats using Korean verbal syllables (gu-em) that provide the students with a
sense of rhythmic length and appropriate dynamics (see Figure 8). In Figure 8, rhythm
(a) is pronounced "gahn-gee," "gahn" being long and strong and "gee" weak and short.
Rhythm (b) is enunciated "ge-gahn" Here, the short note preceding a long note
indicates the short note should be weak; thus, the rhythm (b) is pronounced with
emphasis on "gahn." Rhythm (c) is pronounced "ge-ge-ge," with the first "ge" accented
and stronger than the others. Rhythm (d) is pronounced "gahn" and should be long and
strong. One rhythmic cycle consisting of 12 beats has the appropriate length for
students to begin to learn Korean rhythms; the 12-beat rhythm will also become
familiar to students as it frequently appears in Korean folk music. In this step, the
teacher instructs the students to imitate symmetrical 12-beat rhythmic cycles until
the students become familiar with the Korean verbal syllables. Examples of various
12-beat cycles are shown in Figure 9 (see Figure 9; see also Video 4 in the
supplementary material). Once students internalize the cycles using verbal syllables,
they can practice replicating them on instruments, maintaining the correct rhythms
and placing accents in the appropriate places. Step 2: The asymmetrical 12-beat
rhythmic cycle (jangdan): The second step of the lesson plan involves practicing the
allocations of duple and triple beats in the asymmetrical 12-beat rhythmic cycle. To
help students acquire a sense of the patterns of an asymmetrical 12-beat rhythmic
cycle, the teacher instructs students by chanting several rhythmic cycles containing
different allocations of duple or triple beats (see Figure 10; see also Video 2 in
the supplementary material) using Korean verbal syllables. Afterwards, students
practice the rhythmic cycles on the classroom instruments Step 3: Improvisatory
practice in the 12-beat rhythmic cycle: After students recognize and become familiar
with both symmetrical and asymmetrical 12-beat rhythmic cycles, they can begin
learning the process of improvisation with these rhythmic cycles through the
following steps. The teacher first provides students with the symmetrical 12-beat
rhythmic cycle (see Figure 9) that the students practiced in the first step. Students
play the provided rhythmic cycle several times until they are familiar with the basic
pattern. Afterward, they are encouraged to add micro beats of ornamentation to the
basic patterns. When an ornamental note precedes any note, it is pronounced
"g&#x259;-rahng"; g&#x259; should be weak and added to the following note as quickly
as possible and "rahng" should be strong (see Figure 11; see also<component x="63.0"

instructors can encourage students to allocate different rhythm sets of duple and
triple beats within 12 beats. During this process, tempo is increasingly accelerated
from slow to fast. The more the rhythm peaks in the fast tempo, the more the beat
tends to be subdivided with the loudest dynamics. In this process, initial beats of
the duple and triples beats should be accented so as to avoid blurring the border
between duple and triple beats (Video 6 in the supplementary material). The Extended
Rhythmic Cycle (Beyond the 12-Beat Cycle) After sufficient practice of the 12-beat
cycle, the teacher can instruct students to play longer rhythmic cycles, such as the
symmetrical 24-beat rhythmic cycle or the asymmetrical 36-beat rhythmic cycle through
the same steps as the 12-beat rhythms. The teacher uses two rhythmic cycles of
Sam-chae (24-beat cycle) and the chil-chae rhythmic cycle (36-beat cycle) so as to
teach longer rhythmic cycles, because both frequently appear in the well-known Korean
percussion ensemble pieces, such as samulnori (see Figure 2). Composition and
Performance So far, students have learned and performed the symmetrical and
asymmetrical rhythmic cycles drawn from Korean tradition. Now, we suggest the next
step of composition and performance to allow students to extend the rhythmic cycles
to any longer patterns and make their own performances, creating a link between the
Korean and Western music tradition. For the compositional activity, the teacher
divides the class into groups of four students and then asks each group to choose two
different types of rhythmic cycles. For example, one group might select a rhythmic
cycle consisting of 12 and 24 beats, and another group might choose 12 and 28 beats.
Next, students determine the allocations of duple and triple beats in their rhythmic
cycles (e.g., 28 beats: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2; see Figure 12).
Following the allocation, the students design the overall structure of their
composition: for instance, (A) 28 beats &#xD7; 4 times (B) 12 beats (A) 28 beats
&#xD7; 4 times, and so on. Finally, each group performs its own rhythmic cycles for
the class with the use of instruments (either traditional Korean instruments or
classroom instruments), which could result in an expanded percussion piece for an
extended version of a classroom composition-based activity. The two examples (Videos
7 and 8 in the supplementary material) are extended versions of classroom composition
based on the same Korean rhythmic structure explained above. If authentic Korean
instruments are available to you, it is advisable that you provide your students with
an opportunity to learn to play and perform their own rhythms. If you do not have
Korean traditional instruments, you could borrow these authentic instruments from the
Korean student union at a local university or Korean Hangul schools where Korean
American children usually learn Korean culture and language. However, realistically,
most music teachers have been faced with limited access to traditional instruments in
their classrooms. In school systems where traditional instruments are unavailable, it
is acceptable, practical, and effective to use classroom instruments so as to provide
students with opportunities to experience active and participatory music-making
activities with diverse musical cultures (Bartolome, 2011; Klinger, 1996). Teachers
can also take advantage of technology by bringing i-instruments and applications for
mobile devices to world music lessons in the general music classroom. With these
opportunities, teachers can aid students in experiencing indigenous instruments in an
indirect manner. In addition, teachers can frequently use handmade instruments
created to resemble the appearance and sounds of traditional ethnic instruments to
encourage students to engage in performing and making music (Anderson &amp; Campbell,
2011). For example, a gallonsized plastic milk carton can be a substitute for a
Korean drum because the mechanics of vibration of both are similar. The Korean metal
instrument kkwanggwari (a small gong) can be replaced by a metal bowl because both
are made of metal. The students of each group are provided with everyday-item
instruments attached to pictures of authentic instruments. By drawing associations
between performances on handmade instruments with images of the traditional
instruments they simulate, teachers can effectively and accurately introduce students
to different musical cultures (Anderson &amp; Campbell, 2011). More important, the
teacher should allow the students to compare recordings (see Video 9 in the
supplementary material) of "the original music" played with traditional instruments
to the "students' recreations of it" played with the classroom instruments or
ordinary objects (Campbell, 2004; Szego, 2005). By linking the authentic sounds of
world music to their compositions (Anderson &amp; Campbell, 2011; Campbell, 2004),
teachers can effectively "tune students' ears to the sounds of the musicians"
(Bartolome, 2011). Reflections on Future Teaching in the World Music Class Schippers
and Campbell (2012) reported that music teachers have faced some challenges
associated with teaching multicultural music including teachers' fear of being
inauthentic, presenting the music out of context, a limited understanding of
pedagogical processes, and lack of the necessary resources. In this article, we have
tried to provide some practical guidance to teach Korean rhythms in order to help
teachers resolve those challenges. First, we have provided the fundamental principles
of Korean rhythms so as to provide musical authenticity. Also, we have introduced the
pedagogical process of Korean music, which includes the use of gu-em and
improvisatory practice. Last, we have provided the resources of composition and
performance using Korean rhythm that would be suitable in a contemporary educational
context. In this manner, students would be able to experience Korean musical
tradition, which has been practically adapted for use in current general music
classrooms. More world music materials satisfying both the original musical tradition
and practicability should be developed and disseminated to the music classroom, not
only from Korean music but also from various music cultures. By doing this, music
teacher educators will gain an understanding of each characteristic of music from
different cultures and acquire the skills necessary to teach them in their
classrooms; as a consequence, they can confidently incorporate world music in general
music classes.<component x="306.0" y="254.24" width="219.52" height="119.07" page="5"

Rhythms In traditional Korean music, rhythm cycles play an important role,
distinguishing the musical tradition of Korea from Western music, where melody and
harmony take the primary place (Harwood, 1976; So, 2002). Most Korean musical pieces,
including both art and folk music, have rhythmic cycles that underpin the entirety of
the music. This rhythmic cycle is called jangdan, literally meaning "long and short."
Jangdan consists of small rhythm sets of duple or triple beats that comprise either
symmetrical or asymmetrical patterns (Lee, 1997). There are two ways in which jangdan
has been used in the Korean music tradition. In the first case, jangdan serves as a
major means of accompanying music. Regardless of vocal or instrumental music, a cycle
is repeated for a whole section, similar to the Western concept of ostinato. However,
whereas ostinato tends to preserve the same rhythm patterns and a steady beat, Korean
jangdan is repeated with lots of improvised variants. When jangdan is adopted for
accompaniment, it is mainly played using the Korean hourglass-shaped drum named
janggu (see Figure 1). In the second case, jangdan is performed as its own form of
folk music mainly played with percussion instruments. Among percussion ensembles,
samulnori (meaning "playing the four objects") is the most popular throughout the
country and abroad. In samulnori, the four Korean percussion instruments play jangdan
in an artistically elaborate manner, not only with lots of improvised variants but
also with increasingly accelerated tempo. The four percussion instruments include
janggu (Korean hourglass drum), kkwanggwari (Korean small flat gong), buk (Korean
barrel drum), and jing (Korean large gong; see Figure 2). Jangdan includes either
symmetrical or asymmetrical patterns, depending on the different allocations of duple

the four triple beats comprise one jangdan of 12 beats, this jangdan becomes a
symmetrical pattern in 12/8 meter. Figure 3 presents musical excerpts of the
symmetrical 12-beat jangdan from the Sam-chae percussion ensemble piece (Howard,
1992). However, the different allocation of duple and triple beats can often comprise
one jangdan. Although the jangdan generally remains as a 12-beat cycle, as different
sets of duple or triple beats combine up to 12 beats, it sounds asymmetrical. The
musical excerpt in Figure 4 is from the same percussion ensemble piece, Sam-chae
(Choi, 2000, p. 140). It sounds irregular because of the different allocation of 3 +
2 + 2 + 2 + 3. The different allocations can happen across more than one jangdan
cycle. Figure 5, drawn from a Korean folk instrumental piece (Moon, 1989), presents
an example of the asymmetric allocation of rhythm sets occurring within the two
cycles of 12-beat jangdans across 24 beats; this process exaggerates its rhythmic
asymmetry to listeners.<component x="309.0" y="71.1" width="230.97" height="227.07"

that Korean music educators musical information as Western music. Instead, a
notatried to "inscribe" or "notate" music inside of the learnber or recall a lesson,
or to preserve and conserve the music (Campbell, 1991a; Paek, 2007). Following the
example of Korean folk music tradition, in this article, the structure of the
rhythmic patterns is described in terms of Western rhythm and Western rhythmic
notation in order to help readers who are educators remember or recall a lesson or to
preserve and conserve the rhythmic patterns they want to teach. However, it is
advisable not to use notation when teaching students. Adopting an oral and aural
teaching process is a recommendable way to help students grasp and perform musical
structures when teaching Korean rhythms. Students can practice oral and aural
transmission with the use of gu-em presented under Western notation in the example of
chil-chae in Figure 7. Gu-em are Korean verbal syllables of music, and it literally
means "mouth tone." Gu-em is an effective tool to aid learners in tional system has
been devised to help musicians remem- ers' bodies and minds by using those syllables.
Therefore, the purpose of using gu-em or yukbo is more than just memorizing music;
rather, it is about having students internalize music. One of the unique
characteristics of jangdan lies in its improvisatory practice. Among the
characteristics of this improvisation are elaboration and spontaneity, both of which
can be found particularly in folk music performance, such as percussion ensembles or
virtuoso instrumental solo pieces (Campbell, 1991b; Lee, 1980). Every jangdan begins
with the basic pattern of slow tempo and soft dynamics. The more a cycle is repeated,
the more elaboration and spontaneity take place by subdividing beats and adding the
micro beats of ornamentation; variation on the basic pattern is unlimited (Choi,
2000). Moreover, along with this procedure, the tempo is gradually accelerated until
performers and audiences reach their musical and emotional peak (Choi, 2000). In

tradition has provided a certain degree of freedom to performers, which can be
attributed to the improvisatory characteristics of Korean music. Teaching procedures
of the aforementioned Korean rhythms will be provided in the following sections. The
procedures will use the traditional Korean learning style, gu-em, in order to teach
repeated rhythmic cycles of symmetry and asymmetry, improvisatory practices, and
tempo changes, primarily based on Korean musical tradition in terms of musical style
and learning method. In addition, the procedures will include ideas about teaching
composition and performance with the use of these newly-learned Korean rhythms to
reconcile the Korean music tradition with contemporary music education practices.
Classroom Practice Teaching Korean Rhythms The proposed lesson plan is designed for
use in upper elementary and secondary music classrooms over several class periods.
Through the steps that follow, students will learn basic rhythmic cycles (jangdan) of
symmetry and asymmetry, how to develop the basic rhythmic cycle in the process of
improvisation, and how to create and perform their own rhythmic cycles. The following
lesson plan is divided into three main sections with detailed explanations of lesson
procedures for each step. The 12-Beat Rhythmic Cycle Step 1: The symmetrical 12-beat
rhythmic cycle (jangdan): The primary goal of Step 1 is for students to learn to play
the symmetrical 12-beat rhythmic cycle (see Video 1 in the supplementary material).
Before students play classroom instruments, they will learn to enunciate duple or
triple beats using Korean verbal syllables (gu-em) that provide the students with a
sense of rhythmic length and appropriate dynamics (see Figure 8). In Figure 8, rhythm
(a) is pronounced "gahn-gee," "gahn" being long and strong and "gee" weak and short.
Rhythm (b) is enunciated "ge-gahn" Here, the short note preceding a long note
indicates the short note should be weak; thus, the rhythm (b) is pronounced with
emphasis on "gahn." Rhythm (c) is pronounced "ge-ge-ge," with the first "ge" accented
and stronger than the others. Rhythm (d) is pronounced "gahn" and should be long and
strong. One rhythmic cycle consisting of 12 beats has the appropriate length for
students to begin to learn Korean rhythms; the 12-beat rhythm will also become
familiar to students as it frequently appears in Korean folk music. In this step, the
teacher instructs the students to imitate symmetrical 12-beat rhythmic cycles until
the students become familiar with the Korean verbal syllables. Examples of various
12-beat cycles are shown in Figure 9 (see Figure 9; see also Video 4 in the
supplementary material). Once students internalize the cycles using verbal syllables,
they can practice replicating them on instruments, maintaining the correct rhythms
and placing accents in the appropriate places. Step 2: The asymmetrical 12-beat
rhythmic cycle (jangdan): The second step of the lesson plan involves practicing the
allocations of duple and triple beats in the asymmetrical 12-beat rhythmic cycle. To
help students acquire a sense of the patterns of an asymmetrical 12-beat rhythmic
cycle, the teacher instructs students by chanting several rhythmic cycles containing
different allocations of duple or triple beats (see Figure 10; see also Video 2 in
the supplementary material) using Korean verbal syllables. Afterwards, students
practice the rhythmic cycles on the classroom instruments Step 3: Improvisatory
practice in the 12-beat rhythmic cycle: After students recognize and become familiar
with both symmetrical and asymmetrical 12-beat rhythmic cycles, they can begin
learning the process of improvisation with these rhythmic cycles through the
following steps. The teacher first provides students with the symmetrical 12-beat
rhythmic cycle (see Figure 9) that the students practiced in the first step. Students
play the provided rhythmic cycle several times until they are familiar with the basic
pattern. Afterward, they are encouraged to add micro beats of ornamentation to the
basic patterns. When an ornamental note precedes any note, it is pronounced
"g&#x259;-rahng"; g&#x259; should be weak and added to the following note as quickly
as possible and "rahng" should be strong (see Figure 11; see also<component x="63.0"

instructors can encourage students to allocate different rhythm sets of duple and
triple beats within 12 beats. During this process, tempo is increasingly accelerated
from slow to fast. The more the rhythm peaks in the fast tempo, the more the beat
tends to be subdivided with the loudest dynamics. In this process, initial beats of
the duple and triples beats should be accented so as to avoid blurring the border
between duple and triple beats (Video 6 in the supplementary material). The Extended
Rhythmic Cycle (Beyond the 12-Beat Cycle) After sufficient practice of the 12-beat
cycle, the teacher can instruct students to play longer rhythmic cycles, such as the
symmetrical 24-beat rhythmic cycle or the asymmetrical 36-beat rhythmic cycle through
the same steps as the 12-beat rhythms. The teacher uses two rhythmic cycles of
Sam-chae (24-beat cycle) and the chil-chae rhythmic cycle (36-beat cycle) so as to
teach longer rhythmic cycles, because both frequently appear in the well-known Korean
percussion ensemble pieces, such as samulnori (see Figure 2). Composition and
Performance So far, students have learned and performed the symmetrical and
asymmetrical rhythmic cycles drawn from Korean tradition. Now, we suggest the next
step of composition and performance to allow students to extend the rhythmic cycles
to any longer patterns and make their own performances, creating a link between the
Korean and Western music tradition. For the compositional activity, the teacher
divides the class into groups of four students and then asks each group to choose two
different types of rhythmic cycles. For example, one group might select a rhythmic
cycle consisting of 12 and 24 beats, and another group might choose 12 and 28 beats.
Next, students determine the allocations of duple and triple beats in their rhythmic
cycles (e.g., 28 beats: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2; see Figure 12).
Following the allocation, the students design the overall structure of their
composition: for instance, (A) 28 beats &#xD7; 4 times (B) 12 beats (A) 28 beats
&#xD7; 4 times, and so on. Finally, each group performs its own rhythmic cycles for
the class with the use of instruments (either traditional Korean instruments or
classroom instruments), which could result in an expanded percussion piece for an
extended version of a classroom composition-based activity. The two examples (Videos
7 and 8 in the supplementary material) are extended versions of classroom composition
based on the same Korean rhythmic structure explained above. If authentic Korean
instruments are available to you, it is advisable that you provide your students with
an opportunity to learn to play and perform their own rhythms. If you do not have
Korean traditional instruments, you could borrow these authentic instruments from the
Korean student union at a local university or Korean Hangul schools where Korean
American children usually learn Korean culture and language. However, realistically,
most music teachers have been faced with limited access to traditional instruments in
their classrooms. In school systems where traditional instruments are unavailable, it
is acceptable, practical, and effective to use classroom instruments so as to provide
students with opportunities to experience active and participatory music-making
activities with diverse musical cultures (Bartolome, 2011; Klinger, 1996). Teachers
can also take advantage of technology by bringing i-instruments and applications for
mobile devices to world music lessons in the general music classroom. With these
opportunities, teachers can aid students in experiencing indigenous instruments in an
indirect manner. In addition, teachers can frequently use handmade instruments
created to resemble the appearance and sounds of traditional ethnic instruments to
encourage students to engage in performing and making music (Anderson &amp; Campbell,
2011). For example, a gallonsized plastic milk carton can be a substitute for a
Korean drum because the mechanics of vibration of both are similar. The Korean metal
instrument kkwanggwari (a small gong) can be replaced by a metal bowl because both
are made of metal. The students of each group are provided with everyday-item
instruments attached to pictures of authentic instruments. By drawing associations
between performances on handmade instruments with images of the traditional
instruments they simulate, teachers can effectively and accurately introduce students
to different musical cultures (Anderson &amp; Campbell, 2011). More important, the
teacher should allow the students to compare recordings (see Video 9 in the
supplementary material) of "the original music" played with traditional instruments
to the "students' recreations of it" played with the classroom instruments or
ordinary objects (Campbell, 2004; Szego, 2005). By linking the authentic sounds of
world music to their compositions (Anderson &amp; Campbell, 2011; Campbell, 2004),
teachers can effectively "tune students' ears to the sounds of the musicians"
(Bartolome, 2011). Reflections on Future Teaching in the World Music Class Schippers
and Campbell (2012) reported that music teachers have faced some challenges
associated with teaching multicultural music including teachers' fear of being
inauthentic, presenting the music out of context, a limited understanding of
pedagogical processes, and lack of the necessary resources. In this article, we have
tried to provide some practical guidance to teach Korean rhythms in order to help
teachers resolve those challenges. First, we have provided the fundamental principles
of Korean rhythms so as to provide musical authenticity. Also, we have introduced the
pedagogical process of Korean music, which includes the use of gu-em and
improvisatory practice. Last, we have provided the resources of composition and
performance using Korean rhythm that would be suitable in a contemporary educational
context. In this manner, students would be able to experience Korean musical
tradition, which has been practically adapted for use in current general music
classrooms. More world music materials satisfying both the original musical tradition
and practicability should be developed and disseminated to the music classroom, not
only from Korean music but also from various music cultures. By doing this, music
teacher educators will gain an understanding of each characteristic of music from
different cultures and acquire the skills necessary to teach them in their
classrooms; as a consequence, they can confidently incorporate world music in general
music classes.<component x="306.0" y="254.24" width="219.52" height="119.07" page="5"
