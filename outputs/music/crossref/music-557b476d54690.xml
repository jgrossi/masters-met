and Learning Instructional Strategy for General Music During the course of my life as
a general music teacher in the schools, I have found that by giving students
opportunities to apply what they are learning in creative ways reinforces and
clarifies their understandings of course content and strengthens the development of
skills experienced through instruction and activities in the classroom. Incorporating
improvising and composing activities as a natural outgrowth of course content and
instruction is an excellent way teachers can provide students with opportunities to
reinforce and expand their understanding and skills in the objectives at hand while
simultaneously nurturing their development of creative thinking in music. Inclusion
of improvising and composing in an interconnected curriculum can enable teachers in
providing a comprehensive standards-based music education for their students even
under limited amounts of time that are often given for music classes in the school
schedule. Reimer (2003) recommended a comprehensive music curriculum to develop all
of the multiple intelligences of music students<component x="48.0" y="63.67"

fostering applied creative thinking in students in the early stages of learning: even
in beginning singing and instrument playing experiences (Reimer, 1989, p. 191).
Opportunities for creative work-in this case, assignments in music composition and
improvisation, directly related to conceptual learning in the classroom- embedded
into the curriculum can make this possible and effect students' learning (Guderian,
2003, 2008). Including improvising and composing activities as a natural outgrowth of
an interrelated and interactive curriculum aligns with many theories of learning. As
early as the 19th century, Swiss educator Johann Pestalozzi (Mark &amp; Gary, 1999)
recognized that education should involve the learning, applying, and practicing of
concepts in support of each other, not as components of learning to be addressed
separately. There should be a bringing together of things that were related to each
other. John Dewey's (1900/1990) vision included a teaching and learning environment
in which the individual was allowed to explore and pursue his or her interests and
capabilities. He believed that the child has four interests: (a) that of conversation
or communication, (b) that of inquiry,<component x="294.0" y="149.19" width="232.77"

how to use knowledge in applied, creative ways that would ultimately have an effect
on the quality of human life. "Children can be taught to use creative thinking
abilities in acquiring even traditional learnings" (Torrance, 1963, p. 7). As applied
to music education, Reimer (2003) supported this idea in suggesting the cultivation
of the interdependence of technique and creativity right from the start with
students. From the very first moments of sound-expressing in performance, and
sound-imaging in composition, and imagining-expressing in improvisation, the need

composing process and the meanings inherent in their music. Psychomotor learning is
incorporated into the improvising and composing process as students play, practice,
and often perform their compositions during the "working out process" of assignments.
In effect, improvising and composing involve interplay of all of the defined areas of
Bloom's taxonomy. To create music, students go back and forth between remember ing
and understanding information in order to apply it, and are continuously analyzing
and evaluating their choices as they work out their ideas. Cognitive processes are
revisited as needed and students explore ways to express meaning through sound.

and student- generated original notation often make possible the realization of
complex ideas and whole compositions that the child is able to compose but not able
to notate in traditional Western notation. Therefore, frameworks for learning and
developing creative thinking in music and musicianship skills for composing can take
and be realized in many forms: from creative exercises that reinforce playing and
music reading skills to wholistic creative ventures that give students opportunities
to explore musical concepts and ideas and personal expression of thoughts and
feelings through music. Examples From the Field: Early to Middle and Upper Elementary
At the kindergarten or first grade level, in a creative application activity that
supports the development of understanding and eventual recognition and application of
dynamics in music, a teacher could begin the work on dynamics by teaching children a
new song such as a lullaby and then ask the children to show how they think the piece
should be sung in order to help a baby fall asleep. When the children performed the
song softly, the teacher could start to add aural word associations such as "soft"
and visuals; perhaps a picture of a baby sleeping or a baby bunny to represent
singing or playing music softly. Children could be given an applied creative
assignment at this point to create soft music on a barred instrument that could help
a baby to fall asleep. "Could we make music on this instrument that would help a baby
to fall asleep? Would you like to find the music for the baby on this instrument?"
Further inquiry regarding different associations (a thunder storm, a giant walking,
etc.) and explorations on additional instruments would lead children to understanding
loud in music and other dynamic levels. "Can you make some music that would sound
like a parade that is far, far away coming closer and closer to us? How do you think
it would sound?" Depending on the age of the children, the small cursive p as a
musical tion. These have an important impact on student learn- written or learned.
Additional group activities could include the learning or composing of new works:
Orff ensemble pieces preceded by a priming activity that included listening examples;
suggestions of mood words, poetry, or subject matter that would stimulate ideas for
sound exploration such as a flowing river or a cops and robbers chase scene. In small
groups, students could explore formal structures through composition. "Compose a
piece that has a beginning, a middle and end where the beginning and end are the same
and the middle is contrasting to the beginning and end." Suggestions of this nature
provide students with a point of departure for generating their own ideas through
improvisation and an open-ended framework for the decision-making and organizing
process of composing. As part of the assignment, they would be asked to determine
dynamics for the new piece(s). "Write in the dynamics where you think they should go
and then practice the music the way you have marked it." Reflection questions could
be, "Did you like your music better with or without the dynamics? What happens to the
music when we add dynamics? How does the music make you feel with dynamics added:
without the dynamics?" (Guderian, 2008, 2009a, 2010) In the above scenarios, the
teacher is helping students to both discover and add to conceptual knowledge and
understandings and to develop creative thinking. The processes as described above
reinforce both by having the children apply what they have learned in creative ways.
Small cursive f means to play or sing loudly is a fact: a cultural tool necessary for
effective music reading, per forming, creating, and sharing in Western music
practices. Loud, very loud, very soft, are also factual, conceptual understandings
learned from cultural others. The application of the cultural tools requiring the
students to decide on the expressive markings that would be effective in their music
or to create a piece that would help a baby fall asleep requires divergent thinking
(Guderian, 2008, 2009a). Creative application in support of the development of
reading, writing, and performing music in Western notation can take numerous forms.
In order to provide a framework for sequentially organized teaching and learning,
curriculum documents usually specify particular are familiar to students such as

help students in building conceptual understanding ideas. Having the students
sight-read, clap, and follow a rhythmic idea throughout a piece such as "Bolero" or a
more modern example like "Adiemus" by Karl Jenkins, further clarifies and strengthens
these understandings and provides additional context for students' applied creative
work. These experiences prime students' thinking for creating their own pieces with
rhythmic or musical ideas. Teachers can align these experiences with applied
assignments based on designated curriculum goals. Small group activity: Create a 2-4
bar rhythmic pattern for percussion instruments that contains 8th and 16th notes and
the dotted 8th and 16th note pattern. After you have created the pattern, practice it
in your group to make sure you can perform the pattern. Repeat the pattern 3 times or
more. Change it 2 times by changing the instrumentation. Change it a third time by
notating and performing it in retrograde. quarter and eighth note simple rhythm

"Engine", "Engine Number Nine", "Doggie", "Dogg(ie Where's Your Bone", and the first
half of Haydn's theme (Theme and Variations, Andante, Movement Two of the 94th
symphony) all have the same rhythm pattern. Learning to sing, sign, clap, and move to
these pieces helps the children to develop an understanding of the beat and the
relationship of the longer and shorter note values. Engaging the children in simple
choreography for the Haydn and the songs is a psychomotor way they can experience the
durational values in the rhythm patterns and by using stick notation, still another
way: a visual representation of the rhythm. A form of analysis can be added by
mounting visual posters of the rhythm of the pieces or by placing two or more rhythms
on the board for comparison. This helps the children learn to recognize the patterns
and to develop rhythm-reading skills. "Which picture is a picture of 'This Old Man'?
Which picture is a picture of 'Doggie, Doggie Where's Your Bone'?" Sing the songs and
clap the rhythms with the children while looking at and pointing to the rhythms.
Using craft sticks, the children can notate the rhythm patterns of the songs; they
can take dictation for clapped rhythms or the rhythms of songs they have experienced
previ ously, and finally, they can create their own rhythm pieces by arranging the
sticks in new patterns that they can perform in small and whole class groupings. Over
several days of instruction, various frameworks for creative work would reinforce the
previous listening, performing, and notating experiences. (a) Use the craft sticks to
make a piece that has two parts. Make the first part with the same rhythm as
"Engine", "Engine Number Nine". Make the second part of your piece with a new rhythm
of tis and tahs. Choose percussion instruments to play your piece. Use different
instruments for each part. (b) Use the sticks to make two different ti and tah
patterns for a piece. Use one pattern for the beginning and end of your piece. Use
the other pattern for the middle of your piece. How many parts will your piece have?
Choose different instruments for each pattern. Teachers can also make use of the pro
cess as an assessment measure. For middle to upper elementary grades, creative
application in support of the development of reading, writing, and performing music
in Western music notation might begin with listening, singing and/or playing of
recorder pieces that contain the desired note values and rhythm patterns for
learning. Drawing from listening examples that contain rhythmic or melodic (or both)

not hear ing the sounds in their heads before they embark on experimentations with
and explorations in sound and notation. From my own experience as a child and adult
composer, and my experiences with nurturing composing abilities in students of all
ages, I believe that there are many formal and informal musical experiences, and
numerous teaching and learning strategies that facilitate the development of skills
and understanding necessary for composing music." Not all children will hear music in
their heads in the beginning stages of working creatively with sound, but most, if
not all, will experience and learn in and about music from the process (Guderian,
2009c). For most children, what is important lies not in the possibility that they
will someday be a composer, but in the applied creative music-making process, and the
joys in problem solving, self-expression, and learning in music that this kind of
creative work in the classroom can provide. Through a balanced variety of experiences
in creative application, teachers in schools might be able to offer all students
opportunities to develop musical skills, understanding, and creative thinking in all
areas of a comprehensive general music curriculum. Author's Note Some examples in

improvising and composing activities as a natural outgrowth of course content and

simultaneously nurturing their development of creative thinking in music. Inclusion
of improvising and composing in an interconnected curriculum can enable teachers in
providing a comprehensive standards-based music education for their students even
under limited amounts of time that are often given for music classes in the school

fostering applied creative thinking in students in the early stages of learning: even
in beginning singing and instrument playing experiences (Reimer, 1989, p. 191).
Opportunities for creative work-in this case, assignments in music composition and
improvisation, directly related to conceptual learning in the classroom- embedded
into the curriculum can make this possible and effect students' learning (Guderian,
2003, 2008). Including improvising and composing activities as a natural outgrowth of
an interrelated and interactive curriculum aligns with many theories of learning. As
early as the 19th century, Swiss educator Johann Pestalozzi (Mark &amp; Gary, 1999)
recognized that education should involve the learning, applying, and practicing of
concepts in support of each other, not as components of learning to be addressed
separately. There should be a bringing together of things that were related to each
other. John Dewey's (1900/1990) vision included a teaching and learning environment
in which the individual was allowed to explore and pursue his or her interests and
capabilities. He believed that the child has four interests: (a) that of conversation
or communication, (b) that of inquiry,<component x="294.0" y="149.19" width="232.77"

composing process and the meanings inherent in their music. Psychomotor learning is
incorporated into the improvising and composing process as students play, practice,
and often perform their compositions during the "working out process" of assignments.
In effect, improvising and composing involve interplay of all of the defined areas of
Bloom's taxonomy. To create music, students go back and forth between remember ing
and understanding information in order to apply it, and are continuously analyzing
and evaluating their choices as they work out their ideas. Cognitive processes are
revisited as needed and students explore ways to express meaning through sound.

developing creative thinking in music and musicianship skills for composing can take
and be realized in many forms: from creative exercises that reinforce playing and
music reading skills to wholistic creative ventures that give students opportunities
to explore musical concepts and ideas and personal expression of thoughts and
feelings through music. Examples From the Field: Early to Middle and Upper Elementary
At the kindergarten or first grade level, in a creative application activity that
supports the development of understanding and eventual recognition and application of
dynamics in music, a teacher could begin the work on dynamics by teaching children a
new song such as a lullaby and then ask the children to show how they think the piece
should be sung in order to help a baby fall asleep. When the children performed the
song softly, the teacher could start to add aural word associations such as "soft"
and visuals; perhaps a picture of a baby sleeping or a baby bunny to represent
singing or playing music softly. Children could be given an applied creative
assignment at this point to create soft music on a barred instrument that could help
a baby to fall asleep. "Could we make music on this instrument that would help a baby
to fall asleep? Would you like to find the music for the baby on this instrument?"
Further inquiry regarding different associations (a thunder storm, a giant walking,
etc.) and explorations on additional instruments would lead children to understanding
loud in music and other dynamic levels. "Can you make some music that would sound
like a parade that is far, far away coming closer and closer to us? How do you think
it would sound?" Depending on the age of the children, the small cursive p as a
musical tion. These have an important impact on student learn- written or learned.
Additional group activities could include the learning or composing of new works:
Orff ensemble pieces preceded by a priming activity that included listening examples;
suggestions of mood words, poetry, or subject matter that would stimulate ideas for
sound exploration such as a flowing river or a cops and robbers chase scene. In small
groups, students could explore formal structures through composition. "Compose a
piece that has a beginning, a middle and end where the beginning and end are the same
and the middle is contrasting to the beginning and end." Suggestions of this nature
provide students with a point of departure for generating their own ideas through
improvisation and an open-ended framework for the decision-making and organizing
process of composing. As part of the assignment, they would be asked to determine
dynamics for the new piece(s). "Write in the dynamics where you think they should go
and then practice the music the way you have marked it." Reflection questions could
be, "Did you like your music better with or without the dynamics? What happens to the
music when we add dynamics? How does the music make you feel with dynamics added:
without the dynamics?" (Guderian, 2008, 2009a, 2010) In the above scenarios, the
teacher is helping students to both discover and add to conceptual knowledge and
understandings and to develop creative thinking. The processes as described above
reinforce both by having the children apply what they have learned in creative ways.
Small cursive f means to play or sing loudly is a fact: a cultural tool necessary for
effective music reading, per forming, creating, and sharing in Western music
practices. Loud, very loud, very soft, are also factual, conceptual understandings
learned from cultural others. The application of the cultural tools requiring the
students to decide on the expressive markings that would be effective in their music
or to create a piece that would help a baby fall asleep requires divergent thinking
(Guderian, 2008, 2009a). Creative application in support of the development of
reading, writing, and performing music in Western notation can take numerous forms.
In order to provide a framework for sequentially organized teaching and learning,
curriculum documents usually specify particular are familiar to students such as
Beethoven's Symphony requirements per age. If the desired goal is to have first#5

motive, is a good way students listening and performing experiences that contain to
help students in building conceptual understanding ideas. Having the students
sight-read, clap, and follow a rhythmic idea throughout a piece such as "Bolero" or a
more modern example like "Adiemus" by Karl Jenkins, further clarifies and strengthens
these understandings and provides additional context for students' applied creative
work. These experiences prime students' thinking for creating their own pieces with
rhythmic or musical ideas. Teachers can align these experiences with applied
assignments based on designated curriculum goals. Small group activity: Create a 2-4
bar rhythmic pattern for percussion instruments that contains 8th and 16th notes and
the dotted 8th and 16th note pattern. After you have created the pattern, practice it
in your group to make sure you can perform the pattern. Repeat the pattern 3 times or
more. Change it 2 times by changing the instrumentation. Change it a third time by
notating and performing it in retrograde. quarter and eighth note simple rhythm
patterns. For exam- regarding the way composers explore and expand their ple,
"Engine", "Engine Number Nine", "Doggie", "Dogg(ie Where's Your Bone", and the first
half of Haydn's theme (Theme and Variations, Andante, Movement Two of the 94th
symphony) all have the same rhythm pattern. Learning to sing, sign, clap, and move to
these pieces helps the children to develop an understanding of the beat and the
relationship of the longer and shorter note values. Engaging the children in simple
choreography for the Haydn and the songs is a psychomotor way they can experience the
durational values in the rhythm patterns and by using stick notation, still another
way: a visual representation of the rhythm. A form of analysis can be added by
mounting visual posters of the rhythm of the pieces or by placing two or more rhythms
on the board for comparison. This helps the children learn to recognize the patterns
and to develop rhythm-reading skills. "Which picture is a picture of 'This Old Man'?
Which picture is a picture of 'Doggie, Doggie Where's Your Bone'?" Sing the songs and
clap the rhythms with the children while looking at and pointing to the rhythms.
Using craft sticks, the children can notate the rhythm patterns of the songs; they
can take dictation for clapped rhythms or the rhythms of songs they have experienced
previ ously, and finally, they can create their own rhythm pieces by arranging the
sticks in new patterns that they can perform in small and whole class groupings. Over
several days of instruction, various frameworks for creative work would reinforce the
previous listening, performing, and notating experiences. (a) Use the craft sticks to
make a piece that has two parts. Make the first part with the same rhythm as
"Engine", "Engine Number Nine". Make the second part of your piece with a new rhythm
of tis and tahs. Choose percussion instruments to play your piece. Use different
instruments for each part. (b) Use the sticks to make two different ti and tah
patterns for a piece. Use one pattern for the beginning and end of your piece. Use
the other pattern for the middle of your piece. How many parts will your piece have?
Choose different instruments for each pattern. Teachers can also make use of the pro
cess as an assessment measure. For middle to upper elementary grades, creative
application in support of the development of reading, writing, and performing music
in Western music notation might begin with listening, singing and/or playing of
recorder pieces that contain the desired note values and rhythm patterns for
learning. Drawing from listening examples that contain rhythmic or melodic (or both)

not hear ing the sounds in their heads before they embark on experimentations with
and explorations in sound and notation. From my own experience as a child and adult
composer, and my experiences with nurturing composing abilities in students of all
ages, I believe that there are many formal and informal musical experiences, and
numerous teaching and learning strategies that facilitate the development of skills
and understanding necessary for composing music." Not all children will hear music in
their heads in the beginning stages of working creatively with sound, but most, if
not all, will experience and learn in and about music from the process (Guderian,
2009c). For most children, what is important lies not in the possibility that they
will someday be a composer, but in the applied creative music-making process, and the
joys in problem solving, self-expression, and learning in music that this kind of
creative work in the classroom can provide. Through a balanced variety of experiences
in creative application, teachers in schools might be able to offer all students
opportunities to develop musical skills, understanding, and creative thinking in all
areas of a comprehensive general music curriculum. Author's Note Some examples in
