Education (Consortium of National Arts Education Associations, 1994) and the
Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics, 2000) encourage teachers to help students make connections between the
arts, mathematics, and other disciplines inside and outside the classroom. Some
researchers have found increases in academic achievement for students who study music
(e.g., Catterall, Chapleau, &amp; Iwanaga, 1999; Fitzpatrick, 2006) compared with
students who have not studied music. This is, in part, due to the overlap between
music skills and math skills. For example, Rauscher and Hinton (2006) assert the
part-whole concept that is necessary for understanding fractions, decimals, and
percentages is highly relevant in understanding rhythm. Although most classroom
teachers believe in the importance of teaching with and about the arts, few feel
qualified or comfortable in doing so (Bohannon &amp; McDowell, 2010). Argabright
(2005) acknowledges that the current trend in education has focused on accountability
based on student achievement. As such, general music teachers are being asked to
"facilitate the integration of state language-arts and math standards with their
general music curriculum" (p. 5). The purpose of this article is to illustrate how
music educators and elementary school classroom teachers can collaborate to teach
music with math. In an effort to exploit this overlap in skills, the authors of this
article have created a set of lessons with explicit instruction on connecting music
and math. The<component x="48.0" y="69.4" width="231.53" height="347.07" page="1"

were introduced to the concept that rhythm measures time. The information discussed
in this introduction included basic terminology. When putting a piece of music on
paper, the notes are divided into measures (or bars) each representing the same unit
of time. Within each measure, the number of beats is organized by the time signature.
As we know, the time signature resembles a fraction with the "numerator" telling us
how many beats are in each measure and the "denominator" telling us what type of note
gets the beat (Garland &amp; Kahn, 1995). Students learned how to identify the notes
and the fractional value of each note (see Figure 1). This chart will be a valuable
resource for the classroom teacher who may not be familiar with what is taught in
music class. The bottom row of the chart can be used by the music teacher to make a
connection between the number of beats and the powers of two. Once students have
learned the note values, we further examine the time signature. For example, a time
signa4 ture of tells us that we need four quarter notes per mea4 sure (or
combinations of other notes that equal four quarter notes). At this time, we could
ask students what other combinations of notes would equal four quarter notes (one
whole note, two half notes, a half note, and two quarter notes, etc.). We asked
students to name a few songs and we then sang the songs to "feel" the beats. You can
also have songs ready to play on a CD and ask students to sing along if they know the
songs or clap along if they do not. We then played the Bee Gee's song Staying Alive
because it is easy to clap along and "find the beat." As students sing or clap the
songs, they begin to "feel" 4 the count (1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .) to determine
the 4 time signature. "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" (Lesson One, Part II) To gauge
student understanding of time signature, measures, and note value, we used a familiar
song, "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" (see Figure 2). The worksheet consisted of the
sheet music with the complete lyrics of the song and some of the corresponding
missing notes. Students were asked to fill in the missing note values 4 based on the
time signature. It was our intention to 4 keep the focus on the fractional value of
the notes; therefore, we excluded any information about the pitches of the notes.
(Although the students at our sessions were not asked to properly place the notes on
the staff, it could be appropriate at this time for the music teacher to continue
with instruction on the notes and the pitches of the corresponding lyrics.) After
finding the missing notes, students were asked to show the fraction addition sentence
for each bar. A fraction addition sentence shows the fractions added including the
plus sign and equal sign to 4 achieve a sum of in math talk, or one whole. An exam4 1

of Figure 2. Some students used their knowledge of fractions to find the missing note
values and some students used their knowledge of the number of beats because they
were already familiar with number of beats from their music classes. Another example
of how students found the missing note values is in the second bar of the song. The
students were given the lyrics, "Lit-tle-Star" and two quarter notes under "Lit1 1 1

After learning the basic notes we proceeded to dotted notes, which can be used to
differentiate instruction. A dot is worth a half of the value of the note it follows.
For example, a dotted half note is a half note plus half of a half note. For younger
and less capable students, you can 1 1 use drawings to show of a . For more capable

(Lesson Two, Part I) To make a real life connection to the previous lesson, we had
students listen to popular culture music (e.g., The Climb by Miley Cyrus) and clap to
the beat and then identify the time signature. This was a lot of fun because 4
although students were told that most songs are in 4 time, this activity helped to
reinforce this point. We also listened to a few older tunes as well such as Kool and
the Gang's Celebrate and The Beatles' Yesterday. Students were now ready to write
four-bars using correct note values. The first time we did this activity, more
students had problems than we anticipated. The task was for students to write four
bars using each note value (whole note to 16th note) at least once. Although we had
reviewed time signatures, bars, and notes, students were overwhelmed when confronted
with the task<component x="63.0" y="496.9" width="230.24" height="131.08" page="4"

The next time we did the activity with another group of students, we added in a
visual exercise in which students were given a worksheet with five squares. They had
to divide the squares into parts of a whole using the note values of whole 1 1 1 1
note. They were note, 8 2 note, 4 note, note, and 16 encouraged to try different
combinations of notes/fractions to make sums of one on their squares. For example, a
student could divide the square into four equal parts and show that each part is
equal to one fourth (see Figure 4). Once students completed five squares, they were
instructed to choose four of the squares to create their four-bar phrase. Each of the
four squares would be translated into the notes of each bar. For the example 1 1 1 1
+ + + = given, the student would write 1 mea4 4 4 4 4 sure in underneath the square
to show the math and 4 then draw four quarter notes in one measure on the music sheet
to represent the square being divided into quarters. The students were surprised to
learn that the square activity connected directly with the writing of their phrase.
An example of a divided square is shown in Figure 4.<component x="309.0" y="67.91"

very exciting because students were able to hear their music come to life. This is a
perfect time to have the general music teacher or a capable student play the
student-created' four-bar phrases. One of the presenters of the conference session is
a pianist. Because there is usually not a piano available, he played a sample of
students' songs on the melodica along with prerecorded and edited accompaniment
music. Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" was edited as a two-bar drum intro to engage
students to clap to the beat. The next four bars were the string bass and drums. This
allowed the melodica to be used to perform the four bars of students' phrases (whom
again had not focused on pitch). The melodica performances were done in an
improvisational pentatonic minor scale. Other accompaniment music featured basic I,
IV, V cadences for students that used diatonic scale choices (see Figure 5, Student
Two). Student Three even wrote words to create "Key Krazy." The accompaniment music
was a popular hip hop/pop beat. The pianist played the chords on the melodica and the
student was challenged to sing his song. Each student received a rousing ovation for
each effort. A practical alternative to this form of playback could be for the music
teacher to use Orff instruments so that students can perform their own phrases.

varying music abilities and music instruction experiences. Subsequent lessons will
depend on the unit objective(s). These lessons are appropriate for the music educator
to teach on their own and would satisfy the call for connecting music with other
disciplines. As we know, music integrates well with many disciplines, mathematics is
but one of them. In the student work shown above, each student shows a different
level of understanding of the concept of rhythm and note values in music as well as
fraction addition. Student One has the correct fraction addition in each bar;
however, the student uses mostly all like denominators 1 except in the third bar the
student uses a half note ( ) and 2 2 two quarter notes ( ). In addition, the
placement of the 4 notes on the staff shows this student had little or no prior music
instruction. Student Two has a good understanding of the math and as the song
progressed (bars three and four) and the student began to create a musical flow of
notation and sense of musical cadence using II V I. "Key Krazy" shows that Student
Three has music knowledge and applied our program to the student's desire to show
that he understood both the math and music skills. Bar one has some notation flaws
that if notated correctly would have worked mathematically. The remaining bars Final
Thoughts Much of the literature connecting music and mathematics has focused on
either students listening to music or students having music instruction in school as
well as private instruction. On the other hand, little research has been done on the
effects of learning music and math when the two are taught in an integrated way. The
scope of this article falls short of researching this phenomenon; however, the
authors acknowledge that this is a necessary next step. The authors further agree
with Argabright (2005) when she said, "since children naturally love music, we [music
educators] become natural funnels for integrating other areas of learning" (p. 5).
The integration of music and math in classroom instruction becomes more accessible
for both music and classroom teachers with materials specifically created for that
purpose (Colwell, 2008). The lessons presented in this article are the first steps in
the creation of such materials. It is the authors' hope that the materials help to
facilitate future research to add to the literature on the effects of teaching music
and math in an integrated fashion.<component x="294.0" y="71.73" width="231.37"

were introduced to the concept that rhythm measures time. The information discussed
in this introduction included basic terminology. When putting a piece of music on
paper, the notes are divided into measures (or bars) each representing the same unit
of time. Within each measure, the number of beats is organized by the time signature.
As we know, the time signature resembles a fraction with the "numerator" telling us
how many beats are in each measure and the "denominator" telling us what type of note
gets the beat (Garland &amp; Kahn, 1995). Students learned how to identify the notes
and the fractional value of each note (see Figure 1). This chart will be a valuable
resource for the classroom teacher who may not be familiar with what is taught in
music class. The bottom row of the chart can be used by the music teacher to make a
connection between the number of beats and the powers of two. Once students have
learned the note values, we further examine the time signature. For example, a time
signa4 ture of tells us that we need four quarter notes per mea4 sure (or
combinations of other notes that equal four quarter notes). At this time, we could
ask students what other combinations of notes would equal four quarter notes (one
whole note, two half notes, a half note, and two quarter notes, etc.). We asked
students to name a few songs and we then sang the songs to "feel" the beats. You can
also have songs ready to play on a CD and ask students to sing along if they know the
songs or clap along if they do not. We then played the Bee Gee's song Staying Alive
because it is easy to clap along and "find the beat." As students sing or clap the
songs, they begin to "feel" 4 the count (1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .) to determine
the 4 time signature. "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" (Lesson One, Part II) To gauge
student understanding of time signature, measures, and note value, we used a familiar
song, "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" (see Figure 2). The worksheet consisted of the
sheet music with the complete lyrics of the song and some of the corresponding
missing notes. Students were asked to fill in the missing note values 4 based on the
time signature. It was our intention to 4 keep the focus on the fractional value of
the notes; therefore, we excluded any information about the pitches of the notes.
(Although the students at our sessions were not asked to properly place the notes on
the staff, it could be appropriate at this time for the music teacher to continue
with instruction on the notes and the pitches of the corresponding lyrics.) After
finding the missing notes, students were asked to show the fraction addition sentence
for each bar. A fraction addition sentence shows the fractions added including the
plus sign and equal sign to 4 achieve a sum of in math talk, or one whole. An exam4 1

of Figure 2. Some students used their knowledge of fractions to find the missing note
values and some students used their knowledge of the number of beats because they
were already familiar with number of beats from their music classes. Another example
of how students found the missing note values is in the second bar of the song. The
students were given the lyrics, "Lit-tle-Star" and two quarter notes under "Lit1 1 1

After learning the basic notes we proceeded to dotted notes, which can be used to
differentiate instruction. A dot is worth a half of the value of the note it follows.
For example, a dotted half note is a half note plus half of a half note. For younger
and less capable students, you can 1 1 use drawings to show of a . For more capable

(Lesson Two, Part I) To make a real life connection to the previous lesson, we had
students listen to popular culture music (e.g., The Climb by Miley Cyrus) and clap to
the beat and then identify the time signature. This was a lot of fun because 4
although students were told that most songs are in 4 time, this activity helped to
reinforce this point. We also listened to a few older tunes as well such as Kool and
the Gang's Celebrate and The Beatles' Yesterday. Students were now ready to write
four-bars using correct note values. The first time we did this activity, more
students had problems than we anticipated. The task was for students to write four
bars using each note value (whole note to 16th note) at least once. Although we had
reviewed time signatures, bars, and notes, students were overwhelmed when confronted
with the task<component x="63.0" y="496.9" width="230.24" height="131.08" page="4"

The next time we did the activity with another group of students, we added in a
visual exercise in which students were given a worksheet with five squares. They had
to divide the squares into parts of a whole using the note values of whole 1 1 1 1
note. They were note, 8 2 note, 4 note, note, and 16 encouraged to try different
combinations of notes/fractions to make sums of one on their squares. For example, a
student could divide the square into four equal parts and show that each part is
equal to one fourth (see Figure 4). Once students completed five squares, they were
instructed to choose four of the squares to create their four-bar phrase. Each of the
four squares would be translated into the notes of each bar. For the example 1 1 1 1
+ + + = given, the student would write 1 mea4 4 4 4 4 sure in underneath the square
to show the math and 4 then draw four quarter notes in one measure on the music sheet
to represent the square being divided into quarters. The students were surprised to
learn that the square activity connected directly with the writing of their phrase.
An example of a divided square is shown in Figure 4.<component x="309.0" y="67.91"

very exciting because students were able to hear their music come to life. This is a
perfect time to have the general music teacher or a capable student play the
student-created' four-bar phrases. One of the presenters of the conference session is
a pianist. Because there is usually not a piano available, he played a sample of
students' songs on the melodica along with prerecorded and edited accompaniment
music. Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" was edited as a two-bar drum intro to engage
students to clap to the beat. The next four bars were the string bass and drums. This
allowed the melodica to be used to perform the four bars of students' phrases (whom
again had not focused on pitch). The melodica performances were done in an
improvisational pentatonic minor scale. Other accompaniment music featured basic I,
IV, V cadences for students that used diatonic scale choices (see Figure 5, Student
Two). Student Three even wrote words to create "Key Krazy." The accompaniment music
was a popular hip hop/pop beat. The pianist played the chords on the melodica and the
student was challenged to sing his song. Each student received a rousing ovation for
each effort. A practical alternative to this form of playback could be for the music
teacher to use Orff instruments so that students can perform their own phrases.

varying music abilities and music instruction experiences. Subsequent lessons will
depend on the unit objective(s). These lessons are appropriate for the music educator
to teach on their own and would satisfy the call for connecting music with other
disciplines. As we know, music integrates well with many disciplines, mathematics is
but one of them. In the student work shown above, each student shows a different
level of understanding of the concept of rhythm and note values in music as well as
fraction addition. Student One has the correct fraction addition in each bar;
however, the student uses mostly all like denominators 1 except in the third bar the
student uses a half note ( ) and 2 2 two quarter notes ( ). In addition, the
placement of the 4 notes on the staff shows this student had little or no prior music
instruction. Student Two has a good understanding of the math and as the song
progressed (bars three and four) and the student began to create a musical flow of
notation and sense of musical cadence using II V I. "Key Krazy" shows that Student
Three has music knowledge and applied our program to the student's desire to show
that he understood both the math and music skills. Bar one has some notation flaws
that if notated correctly would have worked mathematically. The remaining bars Final
Thoughts Much of the literature connecting music and mathematics has focused on
either students listening to music or students having music instruction in school as
well as private instruction. On the other hand, little research has been done on the
effects of learning music and math when the two are taught in an integrated way. The
scope of this article falls short of researching this phenomenon; however, the
authors acknowledge that this is a necessary next step. The authors further agree
with Argabright (2005) when she said, "since children naturally love music, we [music
educators] become natural funnels for integrating other areas of learning" (p. 5).
The integration of music and math in classroom instruction becomes more accessible
for both music and classroom teachers with materials specifically created for that
purpose (Colwell, 2008). The lessons presented in this article are the first steps in
the creation of such materials. It is the authors' hope that the materials help to
facilitate future research to add to the literature on the effects of teaching music
and math in an integrated fashion.<component x="294.0" y="71.73" width="231.37"
