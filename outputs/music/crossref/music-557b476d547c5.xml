the study of interaction through discourse as a means for analysing and understanding
the process of teaching and learning music. Over the course of a didactic sequence,
we assess classroom conversations dealing with the analysis of a music score
constituted as the reference for the process of creating a joint music composition.
The - group is made up of a teacher and second-year elementary pupils (aged 9 10
years) at a music school. Eight categories of discourse are identified that help to
understand the strategies used to construct shared musical meanings. This knowledge
is important for practitioners when reflecting on the teaching-learning process. It
is also useful for teacher training. Resume Ce travail explore l'&#xE9;tude de

of investigations whose objective is to understand the teaching and learning
processes that occur during the elementary cycle of music studies - (8 12 years). The
description, analysis and comprehension of these processes, specifically progress in
the acquisition of knowledge and joint construction, are approached from the
interdisciplinary perspective of the psychology of education and the didactics of
music. The study forms part of a teaching innovation project (in development since
1998) at a municipal school of music in a town in the Vall&#xE8;s Occidental region
of Barcelona, in collaboration with lecturers and researchers from the Universitat
Aut&#xF2;noma de Barcelona (UAB). The innovation, research and teacher-training
project was initially defined on the basis of some innovative principles of teaching
and learning (Malagarriga 2002) aimed at bringing about substantial changes in the
way the school operates. The way content is organised and presented in class is the
consequence of a major shift in methodology, and poses the teachers unresolved
questions concerning evaluation (Viladot et al. 2005; Malagarriga et al. 2008). For
this reason, the school staff and the researchers are seeking to progressively
establish a shared theoretical framework by which to guide analysis and reflection
regarding what is done in practice (Viladot 2005).<component x="46.77" y="278.48"

characterisation of the constructivist approach in education has been identified in
recent years, which has led to the development of applications and research. Examples
of this are the first formulation in the Spanish context by C&#xE9;sar Coll (1990)
and the recent compilation and analysis of constructivist perspectives in education
by Rosario Cubero (2005). The constructivist framework applied to education processes
by these and other authors constitutes the integration of principles originating from
different psychological traditions. Our option also assumes the postulations of the
sociocultural perspective whose origins lie in the work of Vygotsky and his
followers. This tradition postulates that cognition begins in social situations in
which children, pupils or inexpert people share responsibility for an activity with
an adult, teacher or expert during the production of a joint project. Contingent
forms of assistance, those which are established and provided depending on what the
learner is unable to do alone, make it possible for any specific project to be
completed. In other words, through shared interaction and activity, the expert or
educator supplements the learner during his or her first attempts at appropriation,
and progressively structures the system of assistance needed (Bruner 1975, 1978).
This scaffolding guides interest towards the task; it reduces the degree of
difficulty or simplifies the situation in such a way that the learner is able to
manipulate the components of the process; it maintains the activity by directing the
actions, highlighting aspects, by controlling frustration and risk during resolution,
and by providing models (Wood et al. 1976, 1978). The structure may consist of more
intensive practical assistance during the first phase of the process, which is
gradually reduced and replaced by the provision of psychological support; that is, by
monitoring the progressive increase in the ' apprentice s skills from a distance.
Bruner (1975, 1978) and Rogoff (1990), among other authors, characterise these
processes, and describe the creation of situations that favour the transfer of
responsibilities from adults to children, progressively developing their autonomy.
These same processes could occur in a classroom situation although the relationship
is not purely adult-to-child, as classmates can also be a source of help to each
other. The sociocultural approach in education gives relevance to teaching, and it is
also a means of facilitating the appropriation of cultural instruments, which leads
to the development of higher psychological processes. In the words of Vygotsky
(1978), it is the process of interiorisation that makes it possible to reconstruct
inter-psychological operations on an intra-psychological level within the context of
social phenomena or ' activities using signs. So, in short, children s participation
in cultural activities under the ' guidance of others enables them to internalise
their community s tools for thinking. This vision is particularly useful for
understanding the teaching and learning processes produced in musical instruction,
both in instrument classes and in the teaching of musical language. Following the
Vygotskian approach, musical language can be understood as a sign or code, with the
musical instrument that the child learns to play being the cultural tool. Therefore,
the approach presented seems especially adequate and useful for the context in which
we undertake our activities. A music school is a place where new generations are
helped in the appropriation of the highly appreciated cultural content of music and
where the activity of making music is shared. Under the aforementioned prism,
interactions are considered to be the central axis of educational practice. Through
these, participants construct and reconstruct their mental representations in
relation to socially established meanings. It is essential to take into consideration
the group as the true subject of the teaching and learning process. Part of the
construction and appropriation of musical knowledge is explained on the basis of
discourse, produced and negotiated in the context of an activity shared by the group.
Thus, learning in the classroom becomes possible thanks to the communication that
occurs and is developed among the participants; it could thus be described as a
conversation in which teachers and pupils are involved. Along these lines, Potter
(1996) defines discourse through speech and classroom texts as actions that are
situated, articulated and co-constructed in the ambit of social
interaction.<component x="46.78" y="49.32" width="345.84" height="180.5" page="2"

lateness="0.23529411764705882" reference_score="6.78">In musical education, there is
a certain tradition of using different modes of representation (kinaesthetic, visual
and verbal) as tools for a progressive approximation to the conceptualisation of
musical language. Gesture, graphic representations and speech come together to
facilitate the processes of perception, experimentation, symbolization and
representation of actions during the course of musical teaching and learning
activities. Each mode of representation offers different potential meanings and
limitations. In the ' classroom, a change between modes represents a change in the
learner s mental possibilities and demands in intellectual and affective terms. In
this sense, action, image, gesture and ' discourse construct meaning and offer the
way to modulate the pupils vision of the world (Franks and Jewitt 2001). Having
recognised the implication and pattern of all these forms of expression in musical
education (Malagarriga and Viladot 2004; Viladot 2005), we take a didactic sequence
as the object of study and show how verbal language supports a certain type of
activity that promotes the appropriation of musical language content. In
socioconstructivist terms, verbal language is the language that constitutes the
material support of communicational activity and regulates the teaching and learning
processes, even though musical language is the main content being taught. Classroom
conversation makes it possible to present, analyse, comment upon and evaluate the
characteristics of the music being heard, being produced, or being observed in
written form, and helps to foster and elaborate upon musical knowledge (Viladot et
al. 2008a, b). In this sense, and taking the " lead from Lemke (1993) when he
sustains that learning science means learning to talk " science , we could
hypothesise that learning music means learning to talk music. In this ' study,
conversation is treated in Mercer s terms, as a form of intellectual activity, as a
social way of thinking (Mercer 2004). There are number of authors who have studied
discourse analysis as a means of understanding teaching and learning processes (see,
for example: Edwards and Mercer 1987; Mercer 1995, 1997, 2000, 2004; Barnes and Todd
1995; Coll 2001; Nerland 2007). However, while it is much more present in other areas
of the curriculum the perspective of discourse analysis has received little attention
so far in music-teaching research. In the Spanish context, we could make particular
mention of the work by Nussbaum (2001) and Camps (2006) on the didactics of language;
Jim&#xE9;nez et al. (2003) on the didactics of science; and Gorgori&#xF3; and Planas
(2004) and Planas (2005) on mathematics. This research takes inspiration from the
above-mentioned authors and constitutes an attempt to explore and evaluate the
usefulness of this type of analysis in the comprehension of teaching and learning
processes within the field of music.<component x="46.77" y="48.87" width="345.83"

explore the study of classroom interaction through discourse analysis in order to
understand the process of the teaching and learning of musical content. We work on
the hypothesis that the analysis of classroom conversation is useful for showing some
of the principles defended above. Throughout a didactic sequence of six sessions, we
identify modalities of discourse and analyse the meanings that the participants
construct. We employ the qualitativeinterpretative paradigm and adopt the case study,
which enables our in-depth comprehension of complex real-world settings (Stake 1994).
The class group chosen for the case study is made up of seven girls and five boys of
between 9 and 10 years of age, attending second-year elementary-grade music language
classes (music theory and sol-fa) at a music school. The instruments that form part
of the sound world of the classroom, since they are used in these classes, are five
violins, two pianos (one wall piano and one electric), two concert flutes, one
recorder, one cello and one guitar. This class group was selected for different
reasons: for 3 years, they had followed the pilot methodological innovation
programme; they were used to the presence of a researcher in the classroom and to
being observed and recorded on video. The age of the members made it possible to
treat the interview as a complementary methodological instrument and to obtain data
about their perceptions of their own learning processes. ' The principles that guided
the methodological innovations were taken from Malagarriga s work, where she proposes
some goals for organising the music curricula for 5-year-olds at unspecialised
schools. They are as follows: to combine creation, interpretation and listening; to
integrate sound experimentation and elements of the cultural heritage; and to
consider the teaching-learning process as communicative and guided involvement in the
common activity (Malagarriga 2002). A way of introducing and adapting those
principles to a music school is by working on a project-based approach divided into
learning units. Each unit contains songs and pieces of music that students listen to
or play, and with some constitutive music elements they can identify. This way of
working also presents different proposals about the creation (musicmaking) in which
educators and learners are urged to use the musical elements discovered in the
aforementioned pieces, which are taken as a reference. The six-session didactic
sequence subject to analysis uses different reference works and activities that
enable music to be approached and experienced through different possibilities and
demands. For this study, we selected activities based around Cuban Landscape with
Rain, by L. Brouwer (see Appendix I), which were carried out during the entire
sequence. These ' were varied activities and they make reference to both Brouwer s
original piece and to the musical composition that the group created during the
sessions, inspired by the structure and rhythms of the aforementioned work. So, for
example, in the first session, the teacher presented the piece by speaking about the
composer; the class listened to it for the first time; they experienced it with free
body movements; they talked about its structure; and, finally, they expressed certain
movements agreed by the group. However, in session 6, the process of constructing
their work of music came to an end, whereupon they reviewed its structure and then
fine-tuned certain elements while performing it together. The case was approached
through direct and non-participant observation (one of the researchers was present in
the classroom during the sessions); classroom notes; and semistructured interviews
with the teacher and with students. We used video recordings of the six
musical-language classes (2 h a week) that constitute the teaching sequence, as well
as transcriptions of discourse fragments. We focused our analysis on the four moments
of the sequence dedicated to the ' observation and analysis of L. Brouwer s score, as
these are considered a key activity through which elements they have heard are
identified and expressed corporally, new elements are discovered, the structure of
the piece is highlighted, an analysis is made of the graphical representation (this
implies the metre, tune, notes, rhythms and rhythmic and ' melodic interpretation of
the melody played by the four guitars), and the composer s decisions are commented
upon. The proposals serve as a source for the configuration and analysis of the
group's own composition. The fragments of the discourse corresponding to the study
are produced as follows: 1. Minute 7:35 of the second session. Teacher and pupils
speak for the first time about - ledger lines as part of their analysis of the score
(bars 1 4). A girl (flautist) who knows ' about these notes acts as a bridge between
her classmates knowledge and that of their teacher. Duration: 2 min and 28 s
(Appendix II, Table 3, first section) 2. Minute 20:18 of the second session. The
teacher resumes the conversation about the score, because something said earlier had
not been made clear. She takes the chance to - play the following fragment (bars 1 6)
and gets a girl to follow the score whilst marking the beat as they listen to the
music. The difficulty lies in keeping this up throughout the respective repetitions
per bar. Duration: 4 min and 10 s (Appendix II, Table 3 fourth section) 3. Minute
8:42 of the third session. The teacher and learners analyse the fragment in - which
the music fills up with sound and the silences disappear (bars 6 9). They discuss and
interpret some rhythmic notations and identify the remaining silences (initial
fragment). Duration: 4 min and 53 s (Appendix II, Table 4, fifth section) " 4. Minute
14:30 of the fifth session. The class speaks about the fragment of running " - water
and identifies the melodic lines in the score (bars 50 70). They read the fragment
and note that the scales are not in neighbouring tones. The teacher presents the
concept of arpeggio. Duration: 4 min and 12 s (Appendix II, Table 5, fifth

we broke each session down into different types of activities depending on the change
in content, the structure of the social participation and the objectives (see
Appendix II). We then selected the activities dealing with the observation and
analysis of the score titled Cuban Landscape with Rain, we transcribed the '
conversations (the original discourse was in Catalan) and divided each of the
participants interventions into corresponding units, and we grouped the interventions
into broader, - interactive units. Most of these units correspond to the successive
series of IRF (Initiation - Response Follow up/Feedback) sequences in classroom
conversations (Sinclair and Coulthard 1975). We added the first comments to the units
in order to analyse the meanings constructed by the participants. To do this, we took
into account classroom notes and information provided by the teacher. We present one
example on continuation (Table 1). Successive redevelopment of the analyses enabled
us to construct categories. The different modalities of the discourse identified
through the four analysed conversations were reduced into eight discursive categories
that correspond to the strategies used by the teacher to conduct the activity towards
the proposed objective. Van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) defined discursive strategies as
linguistic and extra-linguistic resources that the speaker uses intentionally to
increase the efficiency of communication. This includes the strictly verbal, but also
other forms of representation (gestures, music, pictures, etc). Wood et al. (1976,
1978) identified strategies to solve problems in the joint construction. We also use
the term strategy because the forms of discourse that we ' analysed constitute
resources whose objective is to regulate the students process of constructing
meaning. We decided to qualify the categories as interactive only if we were able to
consider that what the teacher and learners said or did was elaborated upon in the
conversation and was related to an element of the content being dealt with. The
categories all arose on the basis of the analysis of the discourse and were created
inductively in consideration of the underlying intentions, depending on the context,
of each of the interventions. The observer and<component x="46.77" y="70.75"

didactic sequence, we observe that the teacher makes no attempt to avoid the possible
difficulties implicit in the score of the chosen piece, as this would reduce the
significance of the whole process. The complete original score is presented, and
through discourse and listening to fragments, its different elements are ' specified.
The aim is to guide the group s activity and provide support when any obstacles
arise. Therefore, when new content emerges, such as ledger notes, it is dealt with
even though it may not form part of the programme that the children of this age are
currently ' studying. The teacher uses her students differing knowledge to encourage
them to exchange experiences. They have to refer to their instruments: they have to
reflect on and relate the content they are dealing with to their own experiences as
musicians. Conversation among this class group benefits the social construction of
knowledge. - Shared interaction and activity generates a process of transferring
signs for example, ledger line notes, the symbol for repeating bars and how many
times (&#xD7;4), ascending and ' descending scales that do not use neighbouring
tones, arpeggio. The teacher s intervention is the key to these processes of exchange
and negotiation, for it is through the processes of guided participation (Rogoff
1990) that she mediates, assists and guides the process of ' identifying elements,
introducing concepts, generalising, relating to one s own experiences, etc. It is
also the teacher who looks for the chance to transfer responsibilities. She appeals
to the knowledge of a student who is more advanced in terms of the specific content,
in order for that student to participate in the process. An example of this is the
moment when a learner anticipates the reading of the next bar after the one the
teacher is singing, thus showing that she has taken in what the task involves and, in
turn, she is able to deduce the answer herself without having to be asked explicitly
to identify another note of the same characteristics (see Table 1). The style of
teaching observed ties in perfectly with the focus of the methodological proposal
that characterises teaching innovation in the centre under study. We could describe
it as a constructivist style of teaching that favours meaningful learning. The
explicit - principles of the didactic approach to combine creation, interpretation
and listening; to integrate sound experimentation and elements of the cultural
heritage; and to consider the teaching-learning as a communicative process and a
guided participation in the common - activity are reflected in the resulting
discursive strategies. Our analysis also refers us back to the contributions of other
authors, in particular the work of Cecilia Hultberg. In the results of her research
(Hultberg 2002) we observe two possible approaches to music notation made by the
music pupils in the interpretation activity: reproductive and exploratory. In her
proposal concerning a theory of instrumental training where three models of teaching
are represented, we identified the analysed practice with the third model, described
as follows: the teacher uses the printed score as a tool for communicating with the
composer, and at the same time establishes a dialogue with the ' students
constructing musical meaning, taking into account the students ideas about the
notation. We consider this way of teaching to be constructivist, and this is also the
case of our study. In addition, we recalled the scaffolding strategies identified by
Wood et al. (1976) and mentioned by Kennell (2002) in his revision: Recruitment;
Marking Critical Features; Task Manipulation; Demonstration; Direction Maintenance;
Frustration Control. Although the educational context of these authors is very
different from ours, and also the tasks and ages of the participants, we are able to
identify parallelisms in the strategies that have a regulating role in the activity.
The category Structure social participation corresponds to Recruitment, even though
the latter refers to the synchronisation of attention and action between teacher and
student and in our case we are referring to group management during a shared
activity. We also note similarities between Identify and interpret error and Marking
critical features, because both make explicit the discrepancies between what a
learner says or does and what the teacher or tutor would recognise as satisfactory
work. As regards frustration control, we have no strategy corresponding to this
function. But, on the other hand, we put forward Propose and resolve a question and '
Relate to one s own experience (RE) which are not represented in the work of the
aforementioned authors. The remaining categories respond clearly to the
characteristics of the task and, as we said above, they are of a very different
nature. Thus, Task Manipulation, Demonstration and Direction Maintenance are
particular to the manipulative task proposed by Wood, Bruner &amp; Ross, while
Reinforce and delimit a response and Resituate to maintain the content being dealt
with correspond to an analytical task. In the context of this sequence, learning
progress materialises in the form of an increase in score-reading skills;
interpretation in the sense proposed by Casas and Pozo (2008) as the process of
reading and comprehending a piece before moving on to its musical production. This
process gradually enables the group to make decisions in relation to their own
musical composition. ' ... is it what? Easy for us to try? They ve decided that their
music will do this: go up ' and down, up and down. That s what they do (pointing at
the flautists). Rising and " falling. Oh yes! Rising and falling and in neighbouring
tones, right? (fragment corresponding to the third session, Table 4) ' The
composition of the group s own piece of music is the objective that embodies the
result of a process of establishing a context in which it is possible to talk to make
sense of what is being done and to negotiate meanings. In this dialogue context, the
interlocutors construct and reconstruct their mental representations of the musical
content. For Edwards and Mercer (1987), these representations are shared terms of
reference, in that they are understood to be the intermental and intersubjective
reference that defines, creates and involves the participants in the communication
process. Participants therefore share the same definition of the situation and bring
different semiotic mechanisms into play that arise in specific uses of the language
and appropriate forms of discourse (Wertsch 1985). Thus, the learner grasps the
criteria that music uses by legitimating one particular explanation as opposed to
others. The specific terminology of the field is not only used to refer to such new
content as ledger line notes or arpeggio but rather it is used as a means for
appropriation throughout the entire discourse in general: the names of specific notes
are mentioned, graphic symbols are analysed, musical instruments are spoken about and
terminology for the characteristics of sound are used. This ties in with the ideas of
Lemke (1993), when he says that the use of discourse in accordance with the rules of
the particular context characterises progress in the knowledge of a specific area, be
it scientific or artistic. We consider that the appropriation of specific discourse,
of a form of activity in which words are used to construct the meaning of the
experience, facilitates the conceptual learning of music, as in the case
studied.<component x="46.77" y="48.87" width="345.85" height="386.7" page="11"

discourse shows how musical content emerges from the totality of the observation of a
general score. Such analysis also shows the kind of methodological approaches and
linguistic structures that accompany it. The methodological perspective of discourse
analysis can therefore help understand ' the teaching and learning processes and the
process of students construction of musical content in the music classroom. We are
convinced of the usefulness of discourse analysis and the identification of
discursive strategies in order to understand the teacher ' and the learners actions
and to try to explain the mutual influences involved in joint action and the
construction of shared meanings. As teacher trainers, we are also convinced of the
usefulness of this knowledge for teacher training. And as teacher trainers we are
involved in the attempt to make clear the required relationship between theory and
practice. The analysis of interaction through discourse shows itself to be useful in
the field of research shared by the psychology of education and by specific didactics
because it enables us to describe and explain a number of didactic strategies and
learning processes. We are aware that our work is only of an exploratory nature and
that we need to carry out further research to provide more evidence, especially in
view of the fact that we are involved in the field of music education where little
work has been done and, moreover, in the context of non-compulsory schooling.
Different musical education activities need to be analysed and contrasted with
different didactic sequences. Looking for common ground and differences in the
application of the school curriculum (maths, verbal language, etc.) would be
interesting and useful for teacher training practice. Furthermore, the similarities
we have found between work done 30 years ago (see Wood et al. 1976) and our own are a
source of encouragement with regard to carrying out further research. Although it is
not easy, our aim is to continue exploring this methodological approach in order to
look in more depth at the inter- and intra-psychological processes that arise in the
classroom.<component x="46.77" y="117.58" width="345.92" height="306.47" page="13"

of investigations whose objective is to understand the teaching and learning
processes that occur during the elementary cycle of music studies - (8 12 years). The
description, analysis and comprehension of these processes, specifically progress in
the acquisition of knowledge and joint construction, are approached from the
interdisciplinary perspective of the psychology of education and the didactics of
music. The study forms part of a teaching innovation project (in development since
1998) at a municipal school of music in a town in the Vall&#xE8;s Occidental region
of Barcelona, in collaboration with lecturers and researchers from the Universitat
Aut&#xF2;noma de Barcelona (UAB). The innovation, research and teacher-training
project was initially defined on the basis of some innovative principles of teaching
and learning (Malagarriga 2002) aimed at bringing about substantial changes in the
way the school operates. The way content is organised and presented in class is the
consequence of a major shift in methodology, and poses the teachers unresolved
questions concerning evaluation (Viladot et al. 2005; Malagarriga et al. 2008). For
this reason, the school staff and the researchers are seeking to progressively
establish a shared theoretical framework by which to guide analysis and reflection
regarding what is done in practice (Viladot 2005).<component x="46.77" y="278.48"

characterisation of the constructivist approach in education has been identified in
recent years, which has led to the development of applications and research. Examples
of this are the first formulation in the Spanish context by C&#xE9;sar Coll (1990)
and the recent compilation and analysis of constructivist perspectives in education
by Rosario Cubero (2005). The constructivist framework applied to education processes
by these and other authors constitutes the integration of principles originating from
different psychological traditions. Our option also assumes the postulations of the
sociocultural perspective whose origins lie in the work of Vygotsky and his
followers. This tradition postulates that cognition begins in social situations in
which children, pupils or inexpert people share responsibility for an activity with
an adult, teacher or expert during the production of a joint project. Contingent
forms of assistance, those which are established and provided depending on what the
learner is unable to do alone, make it possible for any specific project to be
completed. In other words, through shared interaction and activity, the expert or
educator supplements the learner during his or her first attempts at appropriation,
and progressively structures the system of assistance needed (Bruner 1975, 1978).
This scaffolding guides interest towards the task; it reduces the degree of
difficulty or simplifies the situation in such a way that the learner is able to
manipulate the components of the process; it maintains the activity by directing the
actions, highlighting aspects, by controlling frustration and risk during resolution,
and by providing models (Wood et al. 1976, 1978). The structure may consist of more
intensive practical assistance during the first phase of the process, which is
gradually reduced and replaced by the provision of psychological support; that is, by
monitoring the progressive increase in the ' apprentice s skills from a distance.
Bruner (1975, 1978) and Rogoff (1990), among other authors, characterise these
processes, and describe the creation of situations that favour the transfer of
responsibilities from adults to children, progressively developing their autonomy.
These same processes could occur in a classroom situation although the relationship
is not purely adult-to-child, as classmates can also be a source of help to each
other. The sociocultural approach in education gives relevance to teaching, and it is
also a means of facilitating the appropriation of cultural instruments, which leads
to the development of higher psychological processes. In the words of Vygotsky
(1978), it is the process of interiorisation that makes it possible to reconstruct
inter-psychological operations on an intra-psychological level within the context of
social phenomena or ' activities using signs. So, in short, children s participation
in cultural activities under the ' guidance of others enables them to internalise
their community s tools for thinking. This vision is particularly useful for
understanding the teaching and learning processes produced in musical instruction,
both in instrument classes and in the teaching of musical language. Following the
Vygotskian approach, musical language can be understood as a sign or code, with the
musical instrument that the child learns to play being the cultural tool. Therefore,
the approach presented seems especially adequate and useful for the context in which
we undertake our activities. A music school is a place where new generations are
helped in the appropriation of the highly appreciated cultural content of music and
where the activity of making music is shared. Under the aforementioned prism,
interactions are considered to be the central axis of educational practice. Through
these, participants construct and reconstruct their mental representations in
relation to socially established meanings. It is essential to take into consideration
the group as the true subject of the teaching and learning process. Part of the
construction and appropriation of musical knowledge is explained on the basis of
discourse, produced and negotiated in the context of an activity shared by the group.
Thus, learning in the classroom becomes possible thanks to the communication that
occurs and is developed among the participants; it could thus be described as a
conversation in which teachers and pupils are involved. Along these lines, Potter
(1996) defines discourse through speech and classroom texts as actions that are
situated, articulated and co-constructed in the ambit of social
interaction.<component x="46.78" y="49.32" width="345.84" height="180.5" page="2"

lateness="0.23529411764705882" reference_score="6.78">In musical education, there is
a certain tradition of using different modes of representation (kinaesthetic, visual
and verbal) as tools for a progressive approximation to the conceptualisation of
musical language. Gesture, graphic representations and speech come together to
facilitate the processes of perception, experimentation, symbolization and
representation of actions during the course of musical teaching and learning
activities. Each mode of representation offers different potential meanings and
limitations. In the ' classroom, a change between modes represents a change in the
learner s mental possibilities and demands in intellectual and affective terms. In
this sense, action, image, gesture and ' discourse construct meaning and offer the
way to modulate the pupils vision of the world (Franks and Jewitt 2001). Having
recognised the implication and pattern of all these forms of expression in musical
education (Malagarriga and Viladot 2004; Viladot 2005), we take a didactic sequence
as the object of study and show how verbal language supports a certain type of
activity that promotes the appropriation of musical language content. In
socioconstructivist terms, verbal language is the language that constitutes the
material support of communicational activity and regulates the teaching and learning
processes, even though musical language is the main content being taught. Classroom
conversation makes it possible to present, analyse, comment upon and evaluate the
characteristics of the music being heard, being produced, or being observed in
written form, and helps to foster and elaborate upon musical knowledge (Viladot et
al. 2008a, b). In this sense, and taking the " lead from Lemke (1993) when he
sustains that learning science means learning to talk " science , we could
hypothesise that learning music means learning to talk music. In this ' study,
conversation is treated in Mercer s terms, as a form of intellectual activity, as a
social way of thinking (Mercer 2004). There are number of authors who have studied
discourse analysis as a means of understanding teaching and learning processes (see,
for example: Edwards and Mercer 1987; Mercer 1995, 1997, 2000, 2004; Barnes and Todd
1995; Coll 2001; Nerland 2007). However, while it is much more present in other areas
of the curriculum the perspective of discourse analysis has received little attention
so far in music-teaching research. In the Spanish context, we could make particular
mention of the work by Nussbaum (2001) and Camps (2006) on the didactics of language;
Jim&#xE9;nez et al. (2003) on the didactics of science; and Gorgori&#xF3; and Planas
(2004) and Planas (2005) on mathematics. This research takes inspiration from the
above-mentioned authors and constitutes an attempt to explore and evaluate the
usefulness of this type of analysis in the comprehension of teaching and learning
processes within the field of music.<component x="46.77" y="48.87" width="345.83"

explore the study of classroom interaction through discourse analysis in order to
understand the process of the teaching and learning of musical content. We work on
the hypothesis that the analysis of classroom conversation is useful for showing some
of the principles defended above. Throughout a didactic sequence of six sessions, we
identify modalities of discourse and analyse the meanings that the participants
construct. We employ the qualitativeinterpretative paradigm and adopt the case study,
which enables our in-depth comprehension of complex real-world settings (Stake 1994).
The class group chosen for the case study is made up of seven girls and five boys of
between 9 and 10 years of age, attending second-year elementary-grade music language
classes (music theory and sol-fa) at a music school. The instruments that form part
of the sound world of the classroom, since they are used in these classes, are five
violins, two pianos (one wall piano and one electric), two concert flutes, one
recorder, one cello and one guitar. This class group was selected for different
reasons: for 3 years, they had followed the pilot methodological innovation
programme; they were used to the presence of a researcher in the classroom and to
being observed and recorded on video. The age of the members made it possible to
treat the interview as a complementary methodological instrument and to obtain data
about their perceptions of their own learning processes. ' The principles that guided
the methodological innovations were taken from Malagarriga s work, where she proposes
some goals for organising the music curricula for 5-year-olds at unspecialised
schools. They are as follows: to combine creation, interpretation and listening; to
integrate sound experimentation and elements of the cultural heritage; and to
consider the teaching-learning process as communicative and guided involvement in the
common activity (Malagarriga 2002). A way of introducing and adapting those
principles to a music school is by working on a project-based approach divided into
learning units. Each unit contains songs and pieces of music that students listen to
or play, and with some constitutive music elements they can identify. This way of
working also presents different proposals about the creation (musicmaking) in which
educators and learners are urged to use the musical elements discovered in the
aforementioned pieces, which are taken as a reference. The six-session didactic
sequence subject to analysis uses different reference works and activities that
enable music to be approached and experienced through different possibilities and
demands. For this study, we selected activities based around Cuban Landscape with
Rain, by L. Brouwer (see Appendix I), which were carried out during the entire
sequence. These ' were varied activities and they make reference to both Brouwer s
original piece and to the musical composition that the group created during the
sessions, inspired by the structure and rhythms of the aforementioned work. So, for
example, in the first session, the teacher presented the piece by speaking about the
composer; the class listened to it for the first time; they experienced it with free
body movements; they talked about its structure; and, finally, they expressed certain
movements agreed by the group. However, in session 6, the process of constructing
their work of music came to an end, whereupon they reviewed its structure and then
fine-tuned certain elements while performing it together. The case was approached
through direct and non-participant observation (one of the researchers was present in
the classroom during the sessions); classroom notes; and semistructured interviews
with the teacher and with students. We used video recordings of the six
musical-language classes (2 h a week) that constitute the teaching sequence, as well
as transcriptions of discourse fragments. We focused our analysis on the four moments
of the sequence dedicated to the ' observation and analysis of L. Brouwer s score, as
these are considered a key activity through which elements they have heard are
identified and expressed corporally, new elements are discovered, the structure of
the piece is highlighted, an analysis is made of the graphical representation (this
implies the metre, tune, notes, rhythms and rhythmic and ' melodic interpretation of
the melody played by the four guitars), and the composer s decisions are commented
upon. The proposals serve as a source for the configuration and analysis of the
group's own composition. The fragments of the discourse corresponding to the study
are produced as follows: 1. Minute 7:35 of the second session. Teacher and pupils
speak for the first time about - ledger lines as part of their analysis of the score
(bars 1 4). A girl (flautist) who knows ' about these notes acts as a bridge between
her classmates knowledge and that of their teacher. Duration: 2 min and 28 s
(Appendix II, Table 3, first section) 2. Minute 20:18 of the second session. The
teacher resumes the conversation about the score, because something said earlier had
not been made clear. She takes the chance to - play the following fragment (bars 1 6)
and gets a girl to follow the score whilst marking the beat as they listen to the
music. The difficulty lies in keeping this up throughout the respective repetitions
per bar. Duration: 4 min and 10 s (Appendix II, Table 3 fourth section) 3. Minute
8:42 of the third session. The teacher and learners analyse the fragment in - which
the music fills up with sound and the silences disappear (bars 6 9). They discuss and
interpret some rhythmic notations and identify the remaining silences (initial
fragment). Duration: 4 min and 53 s (Appendix II, Table 4, fifth section) " 4. Minute
14:30 of the fifth session. The class speaks about the fragment of running " - water
and identifies the melodic lines in the score (bars 50 70). They read the fragment
and note that the scales are not in neighbouring tones. The teacher presents the
concept of arpeggio. Duration: 4 min and 12 s (Appendix II, Table 5, fifth

we broke each session down into different types of activities depending on the change
in content, the structure of the social participation and the objectives (see
Appendix II). We then selected the activities dealing with the observation and
analysis of the score titled Cuban Landscape with Rain, we transcribed the '
conversations (the original discourse was in Catalan) and divided each of the
participants interventions into corresponding units, and we grouped the interventions
into broader, - interactive units. Most of these units correspond to the successive
series of IRF (Initiation - Response Follow up/Feedback) sequences in classroom
conversations (Sinclair and Coulthard 1975). We added the first comments to the units
in order to analyse the meanings constructed by the participants. To do this, we took
into account classroom notes and information provided by the teacher. We present one
example on continuation (Table 1). Successive redevelopment of the analyses enabled
us to construct categories. The different modalities of the discourse identified
through the four analysed conversations were reduced into eight discursive categories
that correspond to the strategies used by the teacher to conduct the activity towards
the proposed objective. Van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) defined discursive strategies as
linguistic and extra-linguistic resources that the speaker uses intentionally to
increase the efficiency of communication. This includes the strictly verbal, but also
other forms of representation (gestures, music, pictures, etc). Wood et al. (1976,
1978) identified strategies to solve problems in the joint construction. We also use
the term strategy because the forms of discourse that we ' analysed constitute
resources whose objective is to regulate the students process of constructing
meaning. We decided to qualify the categories as interactive only if we were able to
consider that what the teacher and learners said or did was elaborated upon in the
conversation and was related to an element of the content being dealt with. The
categories all arose on the basis of the analysis of the discourse and were created
inductively in consideration of the underlying intentions, depending on the context,
of each of the interventions. The observer and<component x="46.77" y="70.75"

didactic sequence, we observe that the teacher makes no attempt to avoid the possible
difficulties implicit in the score of the chosen piece, as this would reduce the
significance of the whole process. The complete original score is presented, and
through discourse and listening to fragments, its different elements are ' specified.
The aim is to guide the group s activity and provide support when any obstacles
arise. Therefore, when new content emerges, such as ledger notes, it is dealt with
even though it may not form part of the programme that the children of this age are
currently ' studying. The teacher uses her students differing knowledge to encourage
them to exchange experiences. They have to refer to their instruments: they have to
reflect on and relate the content they are dealing with to their own experiences as
musicians. Conversation among this class group benefits the social construction of
knowledge. - Shared interaction and activity generates a process of transferring
signs for example, ledger line notes, the symbol for repeating bars and how many
times (&#xD7;4), ascending and ' descending scales that do not use neighbouring
tones, arpeggio. The teacher s intervention is the key to these processes of exchange
and negotiation, for it is through the processes of guided participation (Rogoff
1990) that she mediates, assists and guides the process of ' identifying elements,
introducing concepts, generalising, relating to one s own experiences, etc. It is
also the teacher who looks for the chance to transfer responsibilities. She appeals
to the knowledge of a student who is more advanced in terms of the specific content,
in order for that student to participate in the process. An example of this is the
moment when a learner anticipates the reading of the next bar after the one the
teacher is singing, thus showing that she has taken in what the task involves and, in
turn, she is able to deduce the answer herself without having to be asked explicitly
to identify another note of the same characteristics (see Table 1). The style of
teaching observed ties in perfectly with the focus of the methodological proposal
that characterises teaching innovation in the centre under study. We could describe
it as a constructivist style of teaching that favours meaningful learning. The
explicit - principles of the didactic approach to combine creation, interpretation
and listening; to integrate sound experimentation and elements of the cultural
heritage; and to consider the teaching-learning as a communicative process and a
guided participation in the common - activity are reflected in the resulting
discursive strategies. Our analysis also refers us back to the contributions of other
authors, in particular the work of Cecilia Hultberg. In the results of her research
(Hultberg 2002) we observe two possible approaches to music notation made by the
music pupils in the interpretation activity: reproductive and exploratory. In her
proposal concerning a theory of instrumental training where three models of teaching
are represented, we identified the analysed practice with the third model, described
as follows: the teacher uses the printed score as a tool for communicating with the
composer, and at the same time establishes a dialogue with the ' students
constructing musical meaning, taking into account the students ideas about the
notation. We consider this way of teaching to be constructivist, and this is also the
case of our study. In addition, we recalled the scaffolding strategies identified by
Wood et al. (1976) and mentioned by Kennell (2002) in his revision: Recruitment;
Marking Critical Features; Task Manipulation; Demonstration; Direction Maintenance;
Frustration Control. Although the educational context of these authors is very
different from ours, and also the tasks and ages of the participants, we are able to
identify parallelisms in the strategies that have a regulating role in the activity.
The category Structure social participation corresponds to Recruitment, even though
the latter refers to the synchronisation of attention and action between teacher and
student and in our case we are referring to group management during a shared
activity. We also note similarities between Identify and interpret error and Marking
critical features, because both make explicit the discrepancies between what a
learner says or does and what the teacher or tutor would recognise as satisfactory
work. As regards frustration control, we have no strategy corresponding to this
function. But, on the other hand, we put forward Propose and resolve a question and '
Relate to one s own experience (RE) which are not represented in the work of the
aforementioned authors. The remaining categories respond clearly to the
characteristics of the task and, as we said above, they are of a very different
nature. Thus, Task Manipulation, Demonstration and Direction Maintenance are
particular to the manipulative task proposed by Wood, Bruner &amp; Ross, while
Reinforce and delimit a response and Resituate to maintain the content being dealt
with correspond to an analytical task. In the context of this sequence, learning
progress materialises in the form of an increase in score-reading skills;
interpretation in the sense proposed by Casas and Pozo (2008) as the process of
reading and comprehending a piece before moving on to its musical production. This
process gradually enables the group to make decisions in relation to their own
musical composition. ' ... is it what? Easy for us to try? They ve decided that their
music will do this: go up ' and down, up and down. That s what they do (pointing at
the flautists). Rising and " falling. Oh yes! Rising and falling and in neighbouring
tones, right? (fragment corresponding to the third session, Table 4) ' The
composition of the group s own piece of music is the objective that embodies the
result of a process of establishing a context in which it is possible to talk to make
sense of what is being done and to negotiate meanings. In this dialogue context, the
interlocutors construct and reconstruct their mental representations of the musical
content. For Edwards and Mercer (1987), these representations are shared terms of
reference, in that they are understood to be the intermental and intersubjective
reference that defines, creates and involves the participants in the communication
process. Participants therefore share the same definition of the situation and bring
different semiotic mechanisms into play that arise in specific uses of the language
and appropriate forms of discourse (Wertsch 1985). Thus, the learner grasps the
criteria that music uses by legitimating one particular explanation as opposed to
others. The specific terminology of the field is not only used to refer to such new
content as ledger line notes or arpeggio but rather it is used as a means for
appropriation throughout the entire discourse in general: the names of specific notes
are mentioned, graphic symbols are analysed, musical instruments are spoken about and
terminology for the characteristics of sound are used. This ties in with the ideas of
Lemke (1993), when he says that the use of discourse in accordance with the rules of
the particular context characterises progress in the knowledge of a specific area, be
it scientific or artistic. We consider that the appropriation of specific discourse,
of a form of activity in which words are used to construct the meaning of the
experience, facilitates the conceptual learning of music, as in the case
studied.<component x="46.77" y="48.87" width="345.85" height="386.7" page="11"

discourse shows how musical content emerges from the totality of the observation of a
general score. Such analysis also shows the kind of methodological approaches and
linguistic structures that accompany it. The methodological perspective of discourse
analysis can therefore help understand ' the teaching and learning processes and the
process of students construction of musical content in the music classroom. We are
convinced of the usefulness of discourse analysis and the identification of
discursive strategies in order to understand the teacher ' and the learners actions
and to try to explain the mutual influences involved in joint action and the
construction of shared meanings. As teacher trainers, we are also convinced of the
usefulness of this knowledge for teacher training. And as teacher trainers we are
involved in the attempt to make clear the required relationship between theory and
practice. The analysis of interaction through discourse shows itself to be useful in
the field of research shared by the psychology of education and by specific didactics
because it enables us to describe and explain a number of didactic strategies and
learning processes. We are aware that our work is only of an exploratory nature and
that we need to carry out further research to provide more evidence, especially in
view of the fact that we are involved in the field of music education where little
work has been done and, moreover, in the context of non-compulsory schooling.
Different musical education activities need to be analysed and contrasted with
different didactic sequences. Looking for common ground and differences in the
application of the school curriculum (maths, verbal language, etc.) would be
interesting and useful for teacher training practice. Furthermore, the similarities
we have found between work done 30 years ago (see Wood et al. 1976) and our own are a
source of encouragement with regard to carrying out further research. Although it is
not easy, our aim is to continue exploring this methodological approach in order to
look in more depth at the inter- and intra-psychological processes that arise in the
classroom.<component x="46.77" y="117.58" width="345.92" height="306.47" page="13"
