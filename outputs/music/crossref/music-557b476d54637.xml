music-making and icymakers and educational leaders often ask whether staff its
meanings can be connected with teachers' beliefs, proving student learning can vary
widely. Over the past three decades, attention has been increasingly directed toward
helping teachers understand the connections between their personal and professional
lives and student learning. These connections include such issues as the influence of
teachers' beliefs on their practices and the development improves student learning,
approaches to im- identity, well-being, social connections, and presence in teaching,
and can serve as a powerful pedagogical tool (Dolloff 2006; Dolloff 2007; Fredrickson

the Top program calling for "relevant coaching, induction, and/or professional

music-making is relevant for music teachers (U.S. Department of Education 2009). I
first present theories from psychology and education that explore the connections
among engagement, well-being, and identity to lay the foundation for a justification
of broadening professional development policies. The next section addresses the
intersections among teachers' art-making experiences (past and present), identity,
teaching, and student learning. The third section draws on my previous work to
illustrate these intersections between teachers' music-making and teaching. The

programs with musicmaking components.<component x="51.63" y="521.95" width="239.12"

field of psychology, this sec tion describes the theory of "flow"
(Cs&#x131;kszentmihalyi 1991), psychological presence at work (Kahn 1990; 1992),
positive psychology (Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkad 2005; Selig man and
Cs&#x131;kszentmihalyi 2000), and the theory of presence in teaching (Rodgers and
Raider-Roth 2006). Finally, I will present research that connected teachers' personal
lives and teacher effectiveness/student learning. Theory of Flow In numerous studies,
Cs&#x131;kszentmihalyi examined hundreds of "artists, athletes, musicians, chess
masters, and surgeons . . . people who seemed to spend their time in precisely those
activities they preferred" (Cs&#x131;kszentmihalyi 1991, 4). These studies formed the
basis for his theory of "flow" that he developed to describe "optimal experience."
Flow is a psychological state of intense interest, a time when someone becomes fully
engaged in a challenging activity that causes them to lose sense of time and self and
results in feelings of satisfaction and well-being. In this state, "concentration is
so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant,
or to worry about problems. Self-consciousness disappears, and the sense of time
becomes distorted" (71). Cs&#x131;kszentmihalyi claimed that understanding this
theory would help people improve their quality of life. He also suggested the
possibility of turning "all of life into a unified flow experience," explaining
that:<component x="51.63" y="362.13" width="239.1" height="92.82" page="2"

presents a holistic approach to life, in which one's actions and feelings are
aligned. Psychological Presence at Work Within the field of organizational behavior,
Kahn (1990; 1992) explored the concept of psychological presence, a state in which
one draws on one's personal, authentic self (thoughts, feelings, beliefs, identities,
and skills) while at work. The concept of presence is linked to the idea of personal
engagement, which entails the ability to use and express oneself in multiple
ways-physically, cognitively, and emotionally-and connect work with individual
interests and self-image. In the same vein, workers need to feel valued by and
connected to their coworkers. In his 1990 study, Kahn found that people become
engaged in or disengaged from their work as a result of three psychological
conditions: meaningfulness, safety, and availability. Psychological meaningfulness is
higher when a person is engaged in tasks that are challenging and varied and have
clear expectations and creative aspects, as well as when workers are allowed a level
of autonomy. The availability of opportunities to demonstrate competence using
previous skills and to learn and grow by developing new skills can also positively
affect meaningfulness. The condition of psychological availability is dependent on
physical and emotional energy, feelings of security or insecurity, and stability in
the individual's outside life. Kahn's 1992 study builds on his prior work and
describes the elements and benefits of presence. He defines the four dimensions of
presence as attentiveness, connection, integration, and focus. When combined, these
dimensions conab tribute to one's ability to ( ) continue learning; ( ) question
assumptions, imagine solutions, and implement change; and c ( ) be productive. By
understanding oneself, others, and the situation, the present worker can formute
solutions without becoming tangled in emotions of panic. From an organization's
standpoint, the benefits of employing individuals who are present at work include
increased job performance and job satisfaction. Some physical signs of being present
include the maintenance of eye contact; appearing physically grounded: the use of
speech that includes inflection, variety (e.g., laugh, varied dynamics, speech
patterns), and words that fit one's personality; and the ability to stay on track
with the conversation. This ability is demonstrated by the types of questions asked
and the display of appropriate nonverbal reactions such as facial expressions,
nodding, and other body language. The development of the theories of flow and
presence marked a different avenue of inquiry than had been previously followed in
psychology. In the next section, I provide a brief overview of the linked area of
positive psychology. Positive Psychology Positive psychology is dedicated to better
understanding both the ability to be in the moment and the benefits of flow.
According to Seligman and Cs&#x131;kszentmihalyi, this field aims to study:<component

being happy is a catalyst for better health; better social relationships; and
increased work outcomes, energy, coping skills, and citizen dispositions,
Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkad (2005) present a theory of sustained happiness. This
theory takes into account three components: genetic set point range, intentional
activity, and circumstances. For the purposes of this article, I focus on intentional
activity. Intentional activity is defined as "actions or practices in . . . which
people can choose to engage [and which] require some degree of effort to enact"
(Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkad 2005, 118); the researchers suggest that this
concept might contribute to an individual's discovery of sustainable happiness. More
closely examining aspects of intentional activity, one key idea that appears is
"person-activity fit," which refers to choosing an activity that fits an individual's
"strengths, interests, values, and inclinations that undoubtedly predispose them to
benefit more from some strategies than others" (122). Two important features of
maintaining an activity on an ongoing basis are finding meaning and value in the
activity and varying its practice. These interrelated psychological theories form the
foundation for my justification of policymakers including musicmaking in professional
development activity. They also form the basis for the theory of presence found in
education literature. "Presence from the teacher's point of view is the experience of
bringing one's whole self to full attention so as to perceive what is happening in
the moment" (Rodgers and Raider-Roth 2006, 267). Theory of Presence in Teaching
Rodgers and Raider-Roth (2006) present a theory of presence in teaching that combines
the aspects of self-awareness, connection to students, connection to subject matter,
and pedagogical knowledge. The authors view teaching as "engaging in an authentic
relationship with students where teachers know and respond with intelligence and
compassion to students and their learning" (265-66). They define presence
as:<component x="58.31" y="125.38" width="239.12" height="343.88" page="3"

classroom life-"the relationships, the affective and cognitive interactions between
students and teachers, the construction of genuine learning experiences and a
hospitable school climate" with past research suggesting that the teacher/student
relationship is a "keystone in student achievement, motivation and engagement and in
their capacity to trust what they know." They argue that "what allows this
relationship to flourish is complex and calls upon the mental, physical, emotional,
and relational resources of the teacher" (2006, 266). After exploring each of the
four aspects of psychological presence, the authors conclude that being present in
the context of education means "to be awake to one's self, to one's students and to
their learning in such a way that learning is served through skillful and
compassionate analysis and access to both subject matter knowledge and pedagogical
strategies" (Rodgers and Raider-Roth 2006, 284). They suggest that teachers should
pay more attention to how students interact with the subject matter, even if the
teacher must slow the classroom pace and possibly lose the opportunity to cover
everything. From Rodgers and Raider's perspective, a teacher's presence is directly
connected to observing and understanding student learning and letting student
learning drive the teaching. ResearchConnectingTeachers'PersonalLivesand
TeacherEffectiveness/StudentLearning The merging of the personal and professional
lives of teachers has been connected with identity, job satisfaction, and student
learning. Two recent studies (Day et al. 2006; Sammons et al. 2007) have considered
the influence of a teacher's identity on job satisfaction. Both studies drew on an
existing database involving three hundred teachers from one hundred British schools
over a four-year period and worked from the assumption that a teacher's identity
influences factors such as commitment, motivation, self-efficacy, job satisfaction,
and sense of purpose. Datasets were generated from interviews, teacher and pupil
surveys, and national student assessment data (Sammons et al. 2007, 684). Linkages
were found among identity, well-being, and effectiveness. In a literature review,
Smith and Gillespie (2007) also linked professional development, teachers' personal
self-efficacy, teacher knowledge, and teacher effectiveness/student learning. In
addition, they recommended jobembedded professional development: "site-based learning
communities where professional development is woven into the fabric of the school
community, balanced at times with the . . . cross-fertilization of new ideas from
outside the school. The focus is on developing teacher knowledge in the content area,
analyzing student thinking, and identifying how that knowledge can be applied to
changes in instructional practices" (219). Based on research, they suggested that
these job-embedded professional development programs are more effective when they
also include: (a) a focus on helping teachers to study their students' thinking, (b)
collaborative learning activities among teachers, (c) activities in which teachers
make use of student performance data, and (d) help from facilitators to organize
job-embedded professional development. Meijer, Korthagen, and Vasalos's (2009)
mixed-methods case study followed the experiences of a secondary social studies
teacher in The Netherlands. The authors built on the concept that teachers need to
have "total encounters" with their students to influence them educationally. This
study was also based partially on Rodgers and Raider-Roth's (2006) theory of presence
in teaching and the theories of positive psychology. Meijer, Korthagen, and Vasalos
developed an approach to professional development that sought to support teachers as
they developed necessary teaching competencies in a way that would be aligned with
"who they are and what motivated them to become a teacher" (2009, 298). The goals of
this approach include connecting or integrating a teacher's personal and professional
lives and "promoting the teacher's awareness and actualization of personal
strengths," which would optimally lead to "developing more optimism and hope"
(306-07). Data collection for this study occurred over the course of a single school
year and was drawn from two semistructured interviews with the teacher; two
semi-structured interviews with the teacher's supervisor; seven hour-long meetings
with teacher and supervisor; the teacher's journal; and the Questionnaire on Core
Qualities (QCQ), completed by both teacher and supervisor in October and June of the
same year. The questionnaire measured thinking (creativity, structuredness, clarity,
accuracy), feeling (commitment, empathy, compassion, trust, tolerance, care), and
wanting (decisiveness, perseverance, courage). The purpose of the study was to better
understand "core reflection approach" as professional development for teachers. Over
the course of the year, the teacher involved in this professional development program
showed an increase in QCQ scores, especially in the thinking and feeling categories.
The authors believed that a shift in awareness was responsible for the integration of
her personal and professional lives. The teacher's work on reflection helped her
shift her focus from her problems and issues to her strengths, presence, and
conception of how she wanted to teach. Meijer, Korthagen, and Vasalos attributed this
shift to her increased ability to work with more meaningful layers of her teaching,
which they named identity and mission. These layers helped the teacher develop
behaviors that brought her personal self into her job and improved her ability to be
in the moment and both notice and react to students' needs in more meaningful and
effective ways. The teacher described her new focus as "being-while-teaching."
Finally, Day and Gu (2010) wrote a book based on previous research conducted by Day
et al. (2006) and Sammons et al. (2007). This book included unused data from those
studies to develop portraits of eighteen teachers. In-depth exploration of these
teachers' experiences allowed the authors to summarize five qualities of good
teachers and good teaching. They concluded that teaching resulting in successful
learning a requires: ( ) the combination of technical competencies, deep b subject
knowledge, and empathy for learners; ( ) care for and c about learning and learners;
( ) the maintenance of a strong d sense of identity and agency; ( ) an emotional
understande ing of self and others; and ( ) hopefulness and resilience. However,
these five qualities are not widely supported in educational systems or policies. The
authors offer several suggestions to increase support for the development of these
qualities. First, teachers need to review, refine, and update their subject and
pedagogical knowledge "through combinations of formal development programmes and
in-school learning through mentorship, coaching and critical friendship" (Day and Gu
2010, 183). In addition, professional development programs should find a way to
support a teacher's identity because "these findings suggest that a secure sense of
professional identity, commitment and well being are central to teachers' capacity to
be and remain effective" (Day 2010).<component x="321.33" y="265.99" width="239.12"

fulfilled with their arts teaching career, professional development should not only
include support of their arts teacher identity, but also their identity as artists"
(2006, 8-9). Thornton defines an artist teacher as "an individual who both makes and
teaches art and is dedicated to both activities as a practitioner" (2005, 167). He

education; and the world of art education. (167)<component x="70.26" y="526.99"

articulates the potential problems of an identity split for artist teachers, Ball
(1990) has written about the ways that her artist identity has informed her teaching.
Heck (1991) and Elliott (1995) observe the connections between art-making and knowing
that also inform teaching. Heck, especially, portrays artist-teachers as those
educators who have developed a sense of presence in their personhood and teaching.
Heck describes an artist-teacher as a "whole, awake, and compassionate person"
concerned with the "development of self, active and meaningful teaching and learning
experiences, [and] authentic engagement with others" (1991, 142). This description is
congruent with the ideas of merging personal and professional lives and developing
presence in teaching. Music teacher identity and socialization have long been topics
of interest within the profession, but have garnered a lot of attention in the past
two decades (Pellegrino 2009; Pellegrino 2010; Woodford 2002). Although discussion
has primarily focused on the identity conflicts of musicians and music teachers, a
more recent trend has explored how the musician and music-maker identity are part of
the music teacher (Bernard 2004; Bernard 2005; Dust 2006; Dolloff &#x2DA; 2006;
Nielsen 2006; Ruud 2006; Stalhammar 2006; Bouij 2007; Dolloff 2007; Regelski 2007;
Roberts 2007; Stephens 2007). In her dissertation, Stanley (2009) describes how the
experiences of a collaborative teacher study group (CTSG) consisting of three
elementary music teachers and herself led to transformative professional development
that impacted their teaching and learning, as well as student learning. She does
question, however, whether her CTSG could have been more musical and suggests
centering a future CTSG on chamber music performance "to see if the added layer of
making music . . . would add further dimension to interactions" (308). She further
suggests "incorporat[ing] some type of musicianship building exercises within a CTSG
to see if the experience of being music learners together changes [the] dialogue"
(308-09). Her reasons for including music-making in her professional development CTSG
mirrors Heck's understanding of an artist-teacher as a compassionate person concerned
with meaningful teaching and learning experiences. Remembering what it is like to be
a music learner has the potential to impact one's teaching and student
learning.<component x="58.31" y="67.35" width="239.12" height="439.52" page="5"

encouraging music teachers to engage in music-making might offer a way to enhance
music teachers' sense of well-being. The concept of finding well-being through
engaging in music-making appears in the literature of a variety of fields. In the
field of music therapy, Ruud has found: 1. Music may increase feelings of vitality
and awareness of feelings. 2. Music provides opportunities for increased sense of
agency. 3. Music-making provides a sense of belonging and communality. 4. Music
experiences create a sense of meaning and coherence in life. (1999, 86) Three music
education scholars have addressed the connections between music-making and well-being
in different ways. Stefanakis has written about music as a "holistic way in which we
come to know ourselves and our relationship with the world" (2005, 14). Dolloff
(2006) believes that musicians often experience powerful emotional affects by
participating in intense, moving musical experiences. She describes feelings of
"utter joy" while music-making, observing that "music and music making [are] ripe
with emotions and emotional potential" that are "an important feature in why we came
to music and music teaching in the first place" (127). Kokotsaki and Hallam (2007)
have found that group music-making can help participants create a strong sense of
social unity and can foster uplifting, exhilarating, and motivating feelings.
Participants in their study commented on "enhanced moods whilst performing,"
"exhilaration while in 'flow'-almost like a drug at its best," "getting lost in a
sense of timelessness in the musical act," and a feeling of "escapism" during
performances (99). Social benefits noted by participants included a sense of
belonging, satisfaction, and flow experiences. Personal benefits included increased
motivation, concentration, stamina, self-confidence, selfefficacy, and a stronger
sense of identity (107). All of these outcomes can be beneficial to music teachers.
Although some may argue that helping teachers feel a sense of well-being is not a
concern for professional development programs, the literature suggests that
connections exist among music-making; well-being; and increased vitality, awareness,
motivation, concentration, stamina, selfconfidence, and self-efficacy. These outcomes
would be worthwhile benefits of a professional development program.<component

It is an excellent practice to teach with an instrument in your hands, showing them,
through demonstration, what you want. Modeling provides for a nonverbal or at least a
limited verbal teaching event, and it is effective and efficient and tends to keep
students on task. (2003, 139)<component x="63.59" y="175.23" width="215.21"

this work, the authors also suggest modeling as a strategy to help students with
different learning styles (e.g., visual, tactile, auditory) and efficiently teach
playing skills. Although they note that "research suggests that students in early
instrumental classes learn the most efficiently by watching teachers model skills and
then attempting to imitate on their instruments," (38) they do not explicitly cite
this research. However, some scholars who have suggested modeling as an efficient
tool for instrumental teaching include Dickey (1991), Goolsby (1996), and Haston
(2007). The concept of modeling has also been addressed in philosophical writings.
Jorgensen (2008) writes that "the musician-teacher" acts as an exemplar who does not
merely tell, but also shows. She situates this approach in the idea of enculturation
and how musicians can learn that music can be a way of life and not just an activity.
In this way, modeling is used for more than teaching skills. Music-Making Linked to
Presence in Teaching Jorgensen (2008) also explores the importance of engagement in
activities that bring happiness to one's life for music teachers. She claims that
"the closer our lived lives are to our own desires and the closer we are to what
makes us happiest, the more joyful our lives can be and the greater blessing we may
be to others" (106) and asserts that music is connected to both teaching and who we
are. She defines a musician as:<component x="51.63" y="67.36" width="239.1"

musicians is merged with the rest of lived life rather than apart from it. A
spiritual sense of the wholeness of our lives arises out of the imperative and
calling we sense to participate in a life of music and enrich the lives of others
through music. Viewed in this way, life is invested with meaning and a sense of
profound importance. Our passion about our art involves mind, soul, and body, and we
live in its service and in service for others. (103)<component x="326.6" y="367.31"

stresses the importance of being "in the moment" and points to earlier philosophers
and the different terms they used to refer to this experience in slightly different
ways: Whitehead's "religious moments," Langer's "virtual time," and Maslow's "peak
experience." Cs&#x131;kszentmihalyi's concept of flow is included in this discussion
as a way of describing the magical moments that evoke "sheer joy, relaxation, and
quietness of mind-a sense that one has come face-to-face with transcendence and
imminence," defined as "a sense of things beyond or above . . . oneself, and a deeply
felt sense of things within oneself (23). Connecting these ideas with music,
Jorgensen avers that musicians "create rehearsals and performances that are
captivating and entrancing, beyond normal and lived experience yet one with it, where
the various elements combine to create pieces of music or performances that are more
than the sum of their parts" (2008, 98). When these performances are successful, she
claims that "the result of this endeavor may be seen to be art-a deeply spiritual and
sensual process and product that is recognized as artful and crafty by musicians and
their publics" (98). Lastly, she submits that all teachers have the responsibility to
find balance and bring a refreshed and enriched self<component x="314.65" y="67.35"

2010), I worked with four string teacher participants who echoed many of the ideas
presented previously, including the benefits of modeling (music-making inside the
classroom), the benefits of conducting music-making activities both alone and in
groups outside of the classroom, and the connections between musicmaking and
well-being. They also added another reason for including music-making in the
professional development curriculum: the benefits of expanding their knowledge of and
experience with repertoire and different genres through music-making. One participant
recommended that "working specifically on repertoire that might lend itself to being
performed" would be a worthwhile reason to include music-making in professional
development (300). All participants worked with music of different genres and
introduced these to their students; however, only those genres of music with which
the participants were familiar were brought into their classrooms. Therefore,
offering professional development programs that focus on listening, understanding,
and playing music from a variety of styles would likely result in teachers
introducing more genres of music to their students. My dissertation was designed to
explore the intersections between music-making and teaching. Datasets included
interviews, classroom observations, and a focus group interview that included a
music-making session. Participants used music-making inside the classroom to model
playing technique and musicality, believing it to be an efficient teaching tool that
benefits student learning. They were also modeling their love and values of
music-making. Reasons for musicmaking outside the classroom included nurturing
themselves, gaining credibility with students, and remembering what it was like to be
a musical learner. One participant said that two advantages of music-making are to
develop "the relationship you have as a doer with the person and understanding both
sides of the podium" (263). Music-Making Aids Presence in Teaching One participant
described how treating her students like members of a chamber music group was able to
elevate her teaching:<component x="58.31" y="171.71" width="239.12" height="427.56"

described "letting go" and "losing [her]self" while music-making. I interpreted these
statements as descriptions of flow. In this state, her worries about classroom
management, pacing, and content delivery receded. When music-making with her
students, she was also able to "let go" and be in the present again. Music-making
brought part of the participants' personal lives into their teaching and provided
them with inspiration. In the classroom, music-making captured students' interest and
attention and served as a tool for proactive classroom management and inspiring
students. Music-making became a way for participants to share what they loved and
influence the next generation of music-makers. My findings point to music-making's
potential as a transformative professional development activity. Music-making can be
inspirational and return excitement to a teacher who has been feeling burned-out; it
can also elevate teaching and help teachers be more present in the classroom.
Therefore, as Day and Gu (2010) suggest, helping music teachers refine, review, and
update their subject matter, and integrating their musician/performer and teacher
identities with the goal of promoting presence in teaching could form the basis of
advocacy for music-making as a professional development activity.<component

presented research and theories developed over two decades that link teacher
engagement in meaningful, challenging activities with well-being. The state of
feeling intellectually challenged and safe and being physically and emotionally
available is connected with continuing learning, questioning assumptions, imagining
solutions, implementing change, and being productive. Finding meaning and value in an
activity and varying its practice are connected to the ability to find sustained
happiness; in turn, happiness acts as a catalyst for better health, better social
relationships, and increased work outcomes, energy, coping skills, and citizen
dispositions. Presence in teaching is linked to self-awareness, teachers' ability to
connect to students and the subject matter, and pedagogical knowledge. Links have
also been found among identity, well-being, and teacher effectiveness. Finally,
music-making is linked to music teachers' identity, well-being, and effectiveness,
and serves as a way for music teachers to find presence in teaching. All of these
connections have been explored in order to present data-informed support for
including music-making in professional development.<component x="321.33" y="67.35"

that music-making could be included as a professional development component, I offer
four suggestions here: including music-making in departmental or districtwide
meetings, granting professional development credit to music teachers who make music
outside of the classroom, creating in-class reflection opportunities or action
research through the integration of music-making into music teaching, and initiating
a collaborative teacher study group that includes chamber music collaboration. The
recent Race to the Top initiative calls for "increased learning time . . .to include
additional time for. . .teachers to collaborate, plan, and engage in professional
development within and across grades and subjects" (U.S. Department of Education
2009). Schools and districts often offer professional development opportunities for
teachers that have little pertinence for music teachers' professional development
needs or interests. Offering music-making professional development opportunities that
allow teachers to share music arrangements that they have used with success would be
both beneficial and inexpensive. Such an approach would also fulfill the goal of
focusing professional development around subject matter or content knowledge (see
Conway 2007; Darling-Hammond et al. 2009; Day and Gu 2010). Another idea for
including music-making in departmental or districtwide meetings would be to share
different teachers' expertise in a variety of styles. For instance, a music teacher
in the district might play jazz, rock, or fiddling music. This teacher could bring in
snippets of music and teach some of the foundational skills and techniques associated
with that genre, as well as offer suggestions for other pieces or artists that might
spark interest. Many general music teachers incorporate music from around the world
into their curricula. Sharing literature and background information about the genre
or style could be helpful. If the music teacher chose to teach rote songs from
different countries, each music teacher could choose to sing or play the song on his
or her instrument of choice. Each could experience the music and then discuss
appropriate additions to the melody to make an arrangement specific to different
ensembles. Music-making in these ways could increase teachers' interest and
confidence in sharing new arrangements and genres with their students. For
professional development, a music-making approach might be adopted through either
formal programs or more individual, informal ways. I suggest that districts and
schools approve and encourage music-making outside of the classroom as an acceptable
professional development activity. Rehearsing and performing in a community
orchestra, band, choir, or chamber music group could be counted toward development if
documentation such as concert programs and videotaped portions of rehearsals and
concerts were submitted. If a music teacher formed a small chamber ensemble,
performing for students in the district's schools could demonstrate the value that
music teachers assign to music-making in their lives. This example might inspire
students by showing the levels of music-making that are achievable, and might help
recruit ensemble music students, enrich the general population of students, and
encourage other music teachers who are interested in engaging in music-making. There
are a multitude of music-making possibilities to consider. Should practicing one's
own instrument or sightreading music alone or with others count toward development if
videotaped evidence is provided? Should written reflection about the value of these
music-making activities be required? How many hours would be acceptable? Each state's
department of education would undoubtedly have its own opinion on these subjects.
Professional development programs could be created to provide opportunities for
teachers to better understand and refine the ways in which they integrate
music-making and teaching. Standerfer (2008) suggests that meaningful professional
development consists of five elements: it is voluntary, it is long-term, it occurs in
the teachers' classroom contexts, it is reflective, and teachers have collegial
support while engaging in it. These five elements should be incorporated into future
professional development programs designed to help teachers better understand and
refine how they integrate music-making into their classrooms. In-classroom reflection
opportunities and action research should be encouraged within the community of music
teachers. For instance, a year-long program could be developed that includes such
activities as asking teachers to videotape themselves in the process of music-making
in the classroom with their students. A reflection protocol might ask teachers to
answer questions about why they chose to play their instruments at that moment, what
they thought their students were learning at that moment, and what they noticed about
student reactions. Both videotaped segments and these reflections could form the
basis for more in-depth discussion within a group of music teachers. Protocols and
discussion could also be designed to help teachers better understand the role of
music-making in their own and their students' lives. Discussions could be based
around questions such as: Describe what made music-making meaningful to you as an
elementary, middle, or high school student. Describe what makes musicmaking
meaningful to you now. Are these reasons different? Describe obstacles to continuing
your music-making. Why do you think your students want to make music? Are these
reasons similar to the reasons you had for making music? In my experience,
participants in such groups are able to come to new realizations about themselves as
they engage in conversations about their music-making and teaching. Teachers might
then ask their students: What do you like about music-making? What is you favorite
piece and why? What is your favorite part of this class? Why do you continue to make
music in this class? Do you make music in other ways? How do you think you will
continue making music in the future? This process of reflective questioning can help
teachers better understand how music-making and teaching intersect. Such discussion
also provides an opportunity for teachers to observe students, reflect on their own
practice, and learn from other music teachers' experiences. This approach could be
adopted through a separate professional development programor incorporated into a
collaborative teacher study group. In-classroom reflection and sharing might
constitute a portion of the sessions, but a significant part of each session should
be devoted to music-making of both music that students are already playing and music
that is chosen for the purpose of enjoyment.<component x="51.63" y="67.35"

Hourigan (2005) have questioned whether it is possible for arts teachers to have a
voice in designing and implementing their own professional development. Professional
development policies vary from state to state, but recent efforts have shown the
possibility of creating professional development requirements that are relevant for
each teacher. In Rhode Island, for instance, teachers have "individual professional
development plans," known as "I-Plans," which are intended to help teachers focus on
"personal and professional goals, student achievement, teaching and learning, and
school improvement initiatives" (Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary
Education 2010). Policymakers in other states may need to be convinced of
music-making's connection to music teaching and student learning. Instead of
portraying an individual teacher's music-making as unrelated to the job of teaching
music, this activity should be framed as a source of inspiration for both the teacher
involved in the music-making and his or her students. Three benefits of this approach
for students might be a cited as: ( ) the ability to see as role models those
teachers who balance engagement with their art forms and teaching; b ( ) the presence
of excellent instrumental models in the classc room, fostering more efficient student
learning; and ( ) the presence of inspired and passionate teaching about playing and
performing. Reasons for using music-making as a professional development activity
might include teachers' ability to a ( ) learn literature and new genres of music to
bring back to b students; ( ) develop strategies for helping students through c
engagement in personal music-making; ( ) maintain their listening and playing skills
at high levels to provide excellent models for students, as well as support their own
identity as d musicians, increasing their sense of efficacy and agency; ( ) relate to
students as learners and become more empathetic f to the challenges these learners
are facing; and ( ) combat burn-out. As Hammel (2007) notes, it is not beneficial to
have a one-size-fits-all approach to professional development. I am not suggesting
that there is one way to be a successful music teacher or that all music teachers
must devote significant time to music-making. However, many music teachers do not
think of music-making and music teaching as two separate aspects of being music
teachers. Instead, in my experience, they describe music-making and teaching as two
essential aspects of their identities that intersect to form and inform the music
teacher and positively influence student learning in a multitude of ways (Pellegrino
2010). Therefore, I argue that musicmaking is a powerful personal and pedagogical
tool in music education for many music teachers, and I urge policymakers to recognize
the benefits explored in this article and provide opportunities for music teachers to
engage in professional development that includes a music-making component.<component

field of psychology, this sec tion describes the theory of "flow"
(Cs&#x131;kszentmihalyi 1991), psychological presence at work (Kahn 1990; 1992),
positive psychology (Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkad 2005; Selig man and
Cs&#x131;kszentmihalyi 2000), and the theory of presence in teaching (Rodgers and
Raider-Roth 2006). Finally, I will present research that connected teachers' personal
lives and teacher effectiveness/student learning. Theory of Flow In numerous studies,
Cs&#x131;kszentmihalyi examined hundreds of "artists, athletes, musicians, chess
masters, and surgeons . . . people who seemed to spend their time in precisely those
activities they preferred" (Cs&#x131;kszentmihalyi 1991, 4). These studies formed the
basis for his theory of "flow" that he developed to describe "optimal experience."
Flow is a psychological state of intense interest, a time when someone becomes fully
engaged in a challenging activity that causes them to lose sense of time and self and
results in feelings of satisfaction and well-being. In this state, "concentration is
so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant,
or to worry about problems. Self-consciousness disappears, and the sense of time
becomes distorted" (71). Cs&#x131;kszentmihalyi claimed that understanding this
theory would help people improve their quality of life. He also suggested the
possibility of turning "all of life into a unified flow experience," explaining
that:<component x="51.63" y="362.13" width="239.1" height="92.82" page="2"

presents a holistic approach to life, in which one's actions and feelings are
aligned. Psychological Presence at Work Within the field of organizational behavior,
Kahn (1990; 1992) explored the concept of psychological presence, a state in which
one draws on one's personal, authentic self (thoughts, feelings, beliefs, identities,
and skills) while at work. The concept of presence is linked to the idea of personal
engagement, which entails the ability to use and express oneself in multiple
ways-physically, cognitively, and emotionally-and connect work with individual
interests and self-image. In the same vein, workers need to feel valued by and
connected to their coworkers. In his 1990 study, Kahn found that people become
engaged in or disengaged from their work as a result of three psychological
conditions: meaningfulness, safety, and availability. Psychological meaningfulness is
higher when a person is engaged in tasks that are challenging and varied and have
clear expectations and creative aspects, as well as when workers are allowed a level
of autonomy. The availability of opportunities to demonstrate competence using
previous skills and to learn and grow by developing new skills can also positively
affect meaningfulness. The condition of psychological availability is dependent on
physical and emotional energy, feelings of security or insecurity, and stability in
the individual's outside life. Kahn's 1992 study builds on his prior work and
describes the elements and benefits of presence. He defines the four dimensions of
presence as attentiveness, connection, integration, and focus. When combined, these
dimensions conab tribute to one's ability to ( ) continue learning; ( ) question
assumptions, imagine solutions, and implement change; and c ( ) be productive. By
understanding oneself, others, and the situation, the present worker can formute
solutions without becoming tangled in emotions of panic. From an organization's
standpoint, the benefits of employing individuals who are present at work include
increased job performance and job satisfaction. Some physical signs of being present
include the maintenance of eye contact; appearing physically grounded: the use of
speech that includes inflection, variety (e.g., laugh, varied dynamics, speech
patterns), and words that fit one's personality; and the ability to stay on track
with the conversation. This ability is demonstrated by the types of questions asked
and the display of appropriate nonverbal reactions such as facial expressions,
nodding, and other body language. The development of the theories of flow and
presence marked a different avenue of inquiry than had been previously followed in
psychology. In the next section, I provide a brief overview of the linked area of
positive psychology. Positive Psychology Positive psychology is dedicated to better
understanding both the ability to be in the moment and the benefits of flow.
According to Seligman and Cs&#x131;kszentmihalyi, this field aims to study:<component

being happy is a catalyst for better health; better social relationships; and
increased work outcomes, energy, coping skills, and citizen dispositions,
Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkad (2005) present a theory of sustained happiness. This
theory takes into account three components: genetic set point range, intentional
activity, and circumstances. For the purposes of this article, I focus on intentional
activity. Intentional activity is defined as "actions or practices in . . . which
people can choose to engage [and which] require some degree of effort to enact"
(Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkad 2005, 118); the researchers suggest that this
concept might contribute to an individual's discovery of sustainable happiness. More
closely examining aspects of intentional activity, one key idea that appears is
"person-activity fit," which refers to choosing an activity that fits an individual's
"strengths, interests, values, and inclinations that undoubtedly predispose them to
benefit more from some strategies than others" (122). Two important features of
maintaining an activity on an ongoing basis are finding meaning and value in the
activity and varying its practice. These interrelated psychological theories form the
foundation for my justification of policymakers including musicmaking in professional
development activity. They also form the basis for the theory of presence found in
education literature. "Presence from the teacher's point of view is the experience of
bringing one's whole self to full attention so as to perceive what is happening in
the moment" (Rodgers and Raider-Roth 2006, 267). Theory of Presence in Teaching
Rodgers and Raider-Roth (2006) present a theory of presence in teaching that combines
the aspects of self-awareness, connection to students, connection to subject matter,
and pedagogical knowledge. The authors view teaching as "engaging in an authentic
relationship with students where teachers know and respond with intelligence and
compassion to students and their learning" (265-66). They define presence
as:<component x="58.31" y="125.38" width="239.12" height="343.88" page="3"

classroom life-"the relationships, the affective and cognitive interactions between
students and teachers, the construction of genuine learning experiences and a
hospitable school climate" with past research suggesting that the teacher/student
relationship is a "keystone in student achievement, motivation and engagement and in
their capacity to trust what they know." They argue that "what allows this
relationship to flourish is complex and calls upon the mental, physical, emotional,
and relational resources of the teacher" (2006, 266). After exploring each of the
four aspects of psychological presence, the authors conclude that being present in
the context of education means "to be awake to one's self, to one's students and to
their learning in such a way that learning is served through skillful and
compassionate analysis and access to both subject matter knowledge and pedagogical
strategies" (Rodgers and Raider-Roth 2006, 284). They suggest that teachers should
pay more attention to how students interact with the subject matter, even if the
teacher must slow the classroom pace and possibly lose the opportunity to cover
everything. From Rodgers and Raider's perspective, a teacher's presence is directly
connected to observing and understanding student learning and letting student
learning drive the teaching. ResearchConnectingTeachers'PersonalLivesand
TeacherEffectiveness/StudentLearning The merging of the personal and professional
lives of teachers has been connected with identity, job satisfaction, and student
learning. Two recent studies (Day et al. 2006; Sammons et al. 2007) have considered
the influence of a teacher's identity on job satisfaction. Both studies drew on an
existing database involving three hundred teachers from one hundred British schools
over a four-year period and worked from the assumption that a teacher's identity
influences factors such as commitment, motivation, self-efficacy, job satisfaction,
and sense of purpose. Datasets were generated from interviews, teacher and pupil
surveys, and national student assessment data (Sammons et al. 2007, 684). Linkages
were found among identity, well-being, and effectiveness. In a literature review,
Smith and Gillespie (2007) also linked professional development, teachers' personal
self-efficacy, teacher knowledge, and teacher effectiveness/student learning. In
addition, they recommended jobembedded professional development: "site-based learning
communities where professional development is woven into the fabric of the school
community, balanced at times with the . . . cross-fertilization of new ideas from
outside the school. The focus is on developing teacher knowledge in the content area,
analyzing student thinking, and identifying how that knowledge can be applied to
changes in instructional practices" (219). Based on research, they suggested that
these job-embedded professional development programs are more effective when they
also include: (a) a focus on helping teachers to study their students' thinking, (b)
collaborative learning activities among teachers, (c) activities in which teachers
make use of student performance data, and (d) help from facilitators to organize
job-embedded professional development. Meijer, Korthagen, and Vasalos's (2009)
mixed-methods case study followed the experiences of a secondary social studies
teacher in The Netherlands. The authors built on the concept that teachers need to
have "total encounters" with their students to influence them educationally. This
study was also based partially on Rodgers and Raider-Roth's (2006) theory of presence
in teaching and the theories of positive psychology. Meijer, Korthagen, and Vasalos
developed an approach to professional development that sought to support teachers as
they developed necessary teaching competencies in a way that would be aligned with
"who they are and what motivated them to become a teacher" (2009, 298). The goals of
this approach include connecting or integrating a teacher's personal and professional
lives and "promoting the teacher's awareness and actualization of personal
strengths," which would optimally lead to "developing more optimism and hope"
(306-07). Data collection for this study occurred over the course of a single school
year and was drawn from two semistructured interviews with the teacher; two
semi-structured interviews with the teacher's supervisor; seven hour-long meetings
with teacher and supervisor; the teacher's journal; and the Questionnaire on Core
Qualities (QCQ), completed by both teacher and supervisor in October and June of the
same year. The questionnaire measured thinking (creativity, structuredness, clarity,
accuracy), feeling (commitment, empathy, compassion, trust, tolerance, care), and
wanting (decisiveness, perseverance, courage). The purpose of the study was to better
understand "core reflection approach" as professional development for teachers. Over
the course of the year, the teacher involved in this professional development program
showed an increase in QCQ scores, especially in the thinking and feeling categories.
The authors believed that a shift in awareness was responsible for the integration of
her personal and professional lives. The teacher's work on reflection helped her
shift her focus from her problems and issues to her strengths, presence, and
conception of how she wanted to teach. Meijer, Korthagen, and Vasalos attributed this
shift to her increased ability to work with more meaningful layers of her teaching,
which they named identity and mission. These layers helped the teacher develop
behaviors that brought her personal self into her job and improved her ability to be
in the moment and both notice and react to students' needs in more meaningful and
effective ways. The teacher described her new focus as "being-while-teaching."
Finally, Day and Gu (2010) wrote a book based on previous research conducted by Day
et al. (2006) and Sammons et al. (2007). This book included unused data from those
studies to develop portraits of eighteen teachers. In-depth exploration of these
teachers' experiences allowed the authors to summarize five qualities of good
teachers and good teaching. They concluded that teaching resulting in successful
learning a requires: ( ) the combination of technical competencies, deep b subject
knowledge, and empathy for learners; ( ) care for and c about learning and learners;
( ) the maintenance of a strong d sense of identity and agency; ( ) an emotional
understande ing of self and others; and ( ) hopefulness and resilience. However,
these five qualities are not widely supported in educational systems or policies. The
authors offer several suggestions to increase support for the development of these
qualities. First, teachers need to review, refine, and update their subject and
pedagogical knowledge "through combinations of formal development programmes and
in-school learning through mentorship, coaching and critical friendship" (Day and Gu
2010, 183). In addition, professional development programs should find a way to
support a teacher's identity because "these findings suggest that a secure sense of
professional identity, commitment and well being are central to teachers' capacity to
be and remain effective" (Day 2010).<component x="321.33" y="265.99" width="239.12"

This literature links art-making to identity issues, teacher effectiveness, job
satisfaction, and student learning. In the following sections, a b I explore the
literature on ( ) holistic sense of identity; ( ) c music-making and well-being; ( )
the connections among music-making and job satisfaction, retention, recruitment, d

Sense of Identity Scheib has argued that "if fine arts teachers hold and value their
identities as artists, then it stands to reason that to keep them holistically
fulfilled with their arts teaching career, professional development should not only
include support of their arts teacher identity, but also their identity as artists"
(2006, 8-9). Thornton defines an artist teacher as "an individual who both makes and
teaches art and is dedicated to both activities as a practitioner" (2005, 167). He
explores an inherent identity issue for the artist-teacher in depth:<component

are tensions and debates regarding the roles and identities of artists and teachers
that present practitioners in these fields with problems to be negotiated. . . .
Teachers of art, particularly in the secondary and tertiary sectors, will usually
have developed an identity as an artist or art specialist of one kind or another
before embarking on . . . a career in teaching. The artist teacher is one in which
three worlds must be straddled or interrelated: the world of art; the world of
education; and the world of art education. (167)<component x="70.26" y="526.99"

articulates the potential problems of an identity split for artist teachers, Ball
(1990) has written about the ways that her artist identity has informed her teaching.
Heck (1991) and Elliott (1995) observe the connections between art-making and knowing
that also inform teaching. Heck, especially, portrays artist-teachers as those
educators who have developed a sense of presence in their personhood and teaching.
Heck describes an artist-teacher as a "whole, awake, and compassionate person"
concerned with the "development of self, active and meaningful teaching and learning
experiences, [and] authentic engagement with others" (1991, 142). This description is
congruent with the ideas of merging personal and professional lives and developing
presence in teaching. Music teacher identity and socialization have long been topics
of interest within the profession, but have garnered a lot of attention in the past
two decades (Pellegrino 2009; Pellegrino 2010; Woodford 2002). Although discussion
has primarily focused on the identity conflicts of musicians and music teachers, a
more recent trend has explored how the musician and music-maker identity are part of
the music teacher (Bernard 2004; Bernard 2005; Dust 2006; Dolloff &#x2DA; 2006;
Nielsen 2006; Ruud 2006; Stalhammar 2006; Bouij 2007; Dolloff 2007; Regelski 2007;
Roberts 2007; Stephens 2007). In her dissertation, Stanley (2009) describes how the
experiences of a collaborative teacher study group (CTSG) consisting of three
elementary music teachers and herself led to transformative professional development
that impacted their teaching and learning, as well as student learning. She does
question, however, whether her CTSG could have been more musical and suggests
centering a future CTSG on chamber music performance "to see if the added layer of
making music . . . would add further dimension to interactions" (308). She further
suggests "incorporat[ing] some type of musicianship building exercises within a CTSG
to see if the experience of being music learners together changes [the] dialogue"
(308-09). Her reasons for including music-making in her professional development CTSG
mirrors Heck's understanding of an artist-teacher as a compassionate person concerned
with meaningful teaching and learning experiences. Remembering what it is like to be
a music learner has the potential to impact one's teaching and student
learning.<component x="58.31" y="67.35" width="239.12" height="439.52" page="5"

importance of music itself in the lives of the (music) teachers. I am coming to the
conclusion that reintroducing teachers to the things about the study of music that
captivated them when they were students might be a better way to reinvigorate those
who are straining under the weight of the educational system. (Fredrickson 2006,

encouraging music teachers to engage in music-making might offer a way to enhance
music teachers' sense of well-being. The concept of finding well-being through
engaging in music-making appears in the literature of a variety of fields. In the
field of music therapy, Ruud has found: 1. Music may increase feelings of vitality
and awareness of feelings. 2. Music provides opportunities for increased sense of
agency. 3. Music-making provides a sense of belonging and communality. 4. Music
experiences create a sense of meaning and coherence in life. (1999, 86) Three music
education scholars have addressed the connections between music-making and well-being
in different ways. Stefanakis has written about music as a "holistic way in which we
come to know ourselves and our relationship with the world" (2005, 14). Dolloff
(2006) believes that musicians often experience powerful emotional affects by
participating in intense, moving musical experiences. She describes feelings of
"utter joy" while music-making, observing that "music and music making [are] ripe
with emotions and emotional potential" that are "an important feature in why we came
to music and music teaching in the first place" (127). Kokotsaki and Hallam (2007)
have found that group music-making can help participants create a strong sense of
social unity and can foster uplifting, exhilarating, and motivating feelings.
Participants in their study commented on "enhanced moods whilst performing,"
"exhilaration while in 'flow'-almost like a drug at its best," "getting lost in a
sense of timelessness in the musical act," and a feeling of "escapism" during
performances (99). Social benefits noted by participants included a sense of
belonging, satisfaction, and flow experiences. Personal benefits included increased
motivation, concentration, stamina, self-confidence, selfefficacy, and a stronger
sense of identity (107). All of these outcomes can be beneficial to music teachers.
Although some may argue that helping teachers feel a sense of well-being is not a
concern for professional development programs, the literature suggests that
connections exist among music-making; well-being; and increased vitality, awareness,
motivation, concentration, stamina, selfconfidence, and self-efficacy. These outcomes
would be worthwhile benefits of a professional development program.<component

It is an excellent practice to teach with an instrument in your hands, showing them,
through demonstration, what you want. Modeling provides for a nonverbal or at least a
limited verbal teaching event, and it is effective and efficient and tends to keep
students on task. (2003, 139)<component x="63.59" y="175.23" width="215.21"

this work, the authors also suggest modeling as a strategy to help students with
different learning styles (e.g., visual, tactile, auditory) and efficiently teach
playing skills. Although they note that "research suggests that students in early
instrumental classes learn the most efficiently by watching teachers model skills and
then attempting to imitate on their instruments," (38) they do not explicitly cite
this research. However, some scholars who have suggested modeling as an efficient
tool for instrumental teaching include Dickey (1991), Goolsby (1996), and Haston
(2007). The concept of modeling has also been addressed in philosophical writings.
Jorgensen (2008) writes that "the musician-teacher" acts as an exemplar who does not
merely tell, but also shows. She situates this approach in the idea of enculturation
and how musicians can learn that music can be a way of life and not just an activity.
In this way, modeling is used for more than teaching skills. Music-Making Linked to
Presence in Teaching Jorgensen (2008) also explores the importance of engagement in
activities that bring happiness to one's life for music teachers. She claims that
"the closer our lived lives are to our own desires and the closer we are to what
makes us happiest, the more joyful our lives can be and the greater blessing we may
be to others" (106) and asserts that music is connected to both teaching and who we
are. She defines a musician as:<component x="51.63" y="67.36" width="239.1"

through music. Viewed in this way, life is invested with meaning and a sense of
profound importance. Our passion about our art involves mind, soul, and body, and we
live in its service and in service for others. (103)<component x="326.6" y="367.31"

stresses the importance of being "in the moment" and points to earlier philosophers
and the different terms they used to refer to this experience in slightly different
ways: Whitehead's "religious moments," Langer's "virtual time," and Maslow's "peak
experience." Cs&#x131;kszentmihalyi's concept of flow is included in this discussion
as a way of describing the magical moments that evoke "sheer joy, relaxation, and
quietness of mind-a sense that one has come face-to-face with transcendence and
imminence," defined as "a sense of things beyond or above . . . oneself, and a deeply
felt sense of things within oneself (23). Connecting these ideas with music,
Jorgensen avers that musicians "create rehearsals and performances that are
captivating and entrancing, beyond normal and lived experience yet one with it, where
the various elements combine to create pieces of music or performances that are more
than the sum of their parts" (2008, 98). When these performances are successful, she
claims that "the result of this endeavor may be seen to be art-a deeply spiritual and
sensual process and product that is recognized as artful and crafty by musicians and
their publics" (98). Lastly, she submits that all teachers have the responsibility to

2010), I worked with four string teacher participants who echoed many of the ideas
presented previously, including the benefits of modeling (music-making inside the
classroom), the benefits of conducting music-making activities both alone and in
groups outside of the classroom, and the connections between musicmaking and
well-being. They also added another reason for including music-making in the
professional development curriculum: the benefits of expanding their knowledge of and
experience with repertoire and different genres through music-making. One participant
recommended that "working specifically on repertoire that might lend itself to being
performed" would be a worthwhile reason to include music-making in professional
development (300). All participants worked with music of different genres and
introduced these to their students; however, only those genres of music with which
the participants were familiar were brought into their classrooms. Therefore,
offering professional development programs that focus on listening, understanding,
and playing music from a variety of styles would likely result in teachers
introducing more genres of music to their students. My dissertation was designed to
explore the intersections between music-making and teaching. Datasets included
interviews, classroom observations, and a focus group interview that included a
music-making session. Participants used music-making inside the classroom to model
playing technique and musicality, believing it to be an efficient teaching tool that
benefits student learning. They were also modeling their love and values of
music-making. Reasons for musicmaking outside the classroom included nurturing
themselves, gaining credibility with students, and remembering what it was like to be
a musical learner. One participant said that two advantages of music-making are to
develop "the relationship you have as a doer with the person and understanding both
sides of the podium" (263). Music-Making Aids Presence in Teaching One participant

described "letting go" and "losing [her]self" while music-making. I interpreted these
statements as descriptions of flow. In this state, her worries about classroom
management, pacing, and content delivery receded. When music-making with her
students, she was also able to "let go" and be in the present again. Music-making
brought part of the participants' personal lives into their teaching and provided
them with inspiration. In the classroom, music-making captured students' interest and
attention and served as a tool for proactive classroom management and inspiring
students. Music-making became a way for participants to share what they loved and
influence the next generation of music-makers. My findings point to music-making's
potential as a transformative professional development activity. Music-making can be
inspirational and return excitement to a teacher who has been feeling burned-out; it
can also elevate teaching and help teachers be more present in the classroom.
Therefore, as Day and Gu (2010) suggest, helping music teachers refine, review, and
update their subject matter, and integrating their musician/performer and teacher
identities with the goal of promoting presence in teaching could form the basis of
advocacy for music-making as a professional development activity.<component

presented research and theories developed over two decades that link teacher
engagement in meaningful, challenging activities with well-being. The state of
feeling intellectually challenged and safe and being physically and emotionally
available is connected with continuing learning, questioning assumptions, imagining
solutions, implementing change, and being productive. Finding meaning and value in an
activity and varying its practice are connected to the ability to find sustained
happiness; in turn, happiness acts as a catalyst for better health, better social
relationships, and increased work outcomes, energy, coping skills, and citizen
dispositions. Presence in teaching is linked to self-awareness, teachers' ability to
connect to students and the subject matter, and pedagogical knowledge. Links have
also been found among identity, well-being, and teacher effectiveness. Finally,
music-making is linked to music teachers' identity, well-being, and effectiveness,
and serves as a way for music teachers to find presence in teaching. All of these
connections have been explored in order to present data-informed support for
including music-making in professional development.<component x="321.33" y="67.35"

that music-making could be included as a professional development component, I offer
four suggestions here: including music-making in departmental or districtwide
meetings, granting professional development credit to music teachers who make music
outside of the classroom, creating in-class reflection opportunities or action
research through the integration of music-making into music teaching, and initiating
a collaborative teacher study group that includes chamber music collaboration. The
recent Race to the Top initiative calls for "increased learning time . . .to include
additional time for. . .teachers to collaborate, plan, and engage in professional
development within and across grades and subjects" (U.S. Department of Education
2009). Schools and districts often offer professional development opportunities for
teachers that have little pertinence for music teachers' professional development
needs or interests. Offering music-making professional development opportunities that
allow teachers to share music arrangements that they have used with success would be
both beneficial and inexpensive. Such an approach would also fulfill the goal of
focusing professional development around subject matter or content knowledge (see
Conway 2007; Darling-Hammond et al. 2009; Day and Gu 2010). Another idea for
including music-making in departmental or districtwide meetings would be to share
different teachers' expertise in a variety of styles. For instance, a music teacher
in the district might play jazz, rock, or fiddling music. This teacher could bring in
snippets of music and teach some of the foundational skills and techniques associated
with that genre, as well as offer suggestions for other pieces or artists that might
spark interest. Many general music teachers incorporate music from around the world
into their curricula. Sharing literature and background information about the genre
or style could be helpful. If the music teacher chose to teach rote songs from
different countries, each music teacher could choose to sing or play the song on his
or her instrument of choice. Each could experience the music and then discuss
appropriate additions to the melody to make an arrangement specific to different
ensembles. Music-making in these ways could increase teachers' interest and
confidence in sharing new arrangements and genres with their students. For
professional development, a music-making approach might be adopted through either
formal programs or more individual, informal ways. I suggest that districts and
schools approve and encourage music-making outside of the classroom as an acceptable
professional development activity. Rehearsing and performing in a community
orchestra, band, choir, or chamber music group could be counted toward development if
documentation such as concert programs and videotaped portions of rehearsals and
concerts were submitted. If a music teacher formed a small chamber ensemble,
performing for students in the district's schools could demonstrate the value that
music teachers assign to music-making in their lives. This example might inspire
students by showing the levels of music-making that are achievable, and might help
recruit ensemble music students, enrich the general population of students, and
encourage other music teachers who are interested in engaging in music-making. There
are a multitude of music-making possibilities to consider. Should practicing one's
own instrument or sightreading music alone or with others count toward development if
videotaped evidence is provided? Should written reflection about the value of these
music-making activities be required? How many hours would be acceptable? Each state's
department of education would undoubtedly have its own opinion on these subjects.
Professional development programs could be created to provide opportunities for
teachers to better understand and refine the ways in which they integrate
music-making and teaching. Standerfer (2008) suggests that meaningful professional
development consists of five elements: it is voluntary, it is long-term, it occurs in
the teachers' classroom contexts, it is reflective, and teachers have collegial
support while engaging in it. These five elements should be incorporated into future
professional development programs designed to help teachers better understand and
refine how they integrate music-making into their classrooms. In-classroom reflection
opportunities and action research should be encouraged within the community of music
teachers. For instance, a year-long program could be developed that includes such
activities as asking teachers to videotape themselves in the process of music-making
in the classroom with their students. A reflection protocol might ask teachers to
answer questions about why they chose to play their instruments at that moment, what
they thought their students were learning at that moment, and what they noticed about
student reactions. Both videotaped segments and these reflections could form the
basis for more in-depth discussion within a group of music teachers. Protocols and
discussion could also be designed to help teachers better understand the role of
music-making in their own and their students' lives. Discussions could be based
around questions such as: Describe what made music-making meaningful to you as an
elementary, middle, or high school student. Describe what makes musicmaking
meaningful to you now. Are these reasons different? Describe obstacles to continuing
your music-making. Why do you think your students want to make music? Are these
reasons similar to the reasons you had for making music? In my experience,
participants in such groups are able to come to new realizations about themselves as
they engage in conversations about their music-making and teaching. Teachers might
then ask their students: What do you like about music-making? What is you favorite
piece and why? What is your favorite part of this class? Why do you continue to make
music in this class? Do you make music in other ways? How do you think you will
continue making music in the future? This process of reflective questioning can help
teachers better understand how music-making and teaching intersect. Such discussion
also provides an opportunity for teachers to observe students, reflect on their own
practice, and learn from other music teachers' experiences. This approach could be
adopted through a separate professional development programor incorporated into a
collaborative teacher study group. In-classroom reflection and sharing might
constitute a portion of the sessions, but a significant part of each session should
be devoted to music-making of both music that students are already playing and music
that is chosen for the purpose of enjoyment.<component x="51.63" y="67.35"

Hourigan (2005) have questioned whether it is possible for arts teachers to have a
voice in designing and implementing their own professional development. Professional
development policies vary from state to state, but recent efforts have shown the
possibility of creating professional development requirements that are relevant for
each teacher. In Rhode Island, for instance, teachers have "individual professional
development plans," known as "I-Plans," which are intended to help teachers focus on
"personal and professional goals, student achievement, teaching and learning, and
school improvement initiatives" (Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary
Education 2010). Policymakers in other states may need to be convinced of
music-making's connection to music teaching and student learning. Instead of
portraying an individual teacher's music-making as unrelated to the job of teaching
music, this activity should be framed as a source of inspiration for both the teacher
involved in the music-making and his or her students. Three benefits of this approach
for students might be a cited as: ( ) the ability to see as role models those
teachers who balance engagement with their art forms and teaching; b ( ) the presence
of excellent instrumental models in the classc room, fostering more efficient student
learning; and ( ) the presence of inspired and passionate teaching about playing and
performing. Reasons for using music-making as a professional development activity
might include teachers' ability to a ( ) learn literature and new genres of music to
bring back to b students; ( ) develop strategies for helping students through c
engagement in personal music-making; ( ) maintain their listening and playing skills
at high levels to provide excellent models for students, as well as support their own
identity as d musicians, increasing their sense of efficacy and agency; ( ) relate to
students as learners and become more empathetic f to the challenges these learners
are facing; and ( ) combat burn-out. As Hammel (2007) notes, it is not beneficial to
have a one-size-fits-all approach to professional development. I am not suggesting
that there is one way to be a successful music teacher or that all music teachers
must devote significant time to music-making. However, many music teachers do not
think of music-making and music teaching as two separate aspects of being music
teachers. Instead, in my experience, they describe music-making and teaching as two
essential aspects of their identities that intersect to form and inform the music
teacher and positively influence student learning in a multitude of ways (Pellegrino
2010). Therefore, I argue that musicmaking is a powerful personal and pedagogical
tool in music education for many music teachers, and I urge policymakers to recognize
the benefits explored in this article and provide opportunities for music teachers to
engage in professional development that includes a music-making component.<component
