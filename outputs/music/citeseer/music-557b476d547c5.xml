			<abstract>
				<p>This work explores the study of interaction through discourse as a means for analysing and understanding the process of teaching and learning music. Over the course of a didactic sequence, we assess classroom conversations dealing with the analysis of a music score constituted as the reference for the process of creating a joint music composition. The group is made up of a teacher and second-year elementary pupils (aged 9–10 years) at a music school. Eight categories of discourse are identified that help to understand the strategies used to construct shared musical meanings. This knowledge is important for practitioners when reflecting on the teaching-learning process. It is also useful for teacher training. Resume Ce travail explore l'étude de l'interaction à travers le discours comme moyen d'analyser et de comprendre le processus d'enseignement-apprentissage de la musique. Nous avons analysé, au cours d'une séquence didactique, des conversations en classe portant sur l'analyse d'une partition qui constitue la référence pour le processus de création</p>

Musical activity as a shared meaning activity A consensus regarding the characterisation of the constructivist approach in education has been identified in recent years, which has led to the development of applications and research. Examples of this are the first formulation in the Spanish context by César Coll (1990) and the recent compilation and analysis of constructivist perspectives in education by Rosario Cubero (2005). The constructivist framework applied to education processes by these and other authors constitutes the integration of principles originating from different psychological traditions. Our option also assumes the postulations of the sociocultural perspective whose origins lie in the work of Vygotsky and his followers. This tradition postulates that cognition begins in social situations in which children, pupils or inexpert people share responsibility for an activity with an adult, teacher or expert during the production of a joint project.

Rising and falling and in neighbouring tones, right?” (fragment corresponding to the third session, Table 4) The composition of the group’s own piece of music is the objective that embodies the result of a process of establishing a context in which it is possible to talk to make sense of what is being done and to negotiate meanings. In this dialogue context, the interlocutors construct and reconstruct their mental representations of the musical content. For Edwards and Mercer (1987), these representations are shared terms of reference, in that they are understood to be the intermental and intersubjective reference that defines, creates and involves the participants in the communication process. Participants therefore share the same definition of the situation and bring different semiotic mechanisms into play that arise in specific uses of the language and appropriate forms of discourse (Wertsch 1985).

Viladot et al. grasps the criteria that music uses by legitimating one particular explanation as opposed to others. The specific terminology of the field is not only used to refer to such new content as ledger line notes or arpeggio but rather it is used as a means for appropriation throughout the entire discourse in general: the names of specific notes are mentioned, graphic symbols are analysed, musical instruments are spoken about and terminology for the characteristics of sound are used. This ties in with the ideas of Lemke (1993), when he says that the use of discourse in accordance with the rules of the particular context characterises progress in the knowledge of a specific area, be it scientific or artistic. We consider that the appropriation of specific discourse, of a form of activity in which words are used to construct the meaning of the experience, facilitates the conceptual learning of music, as in the case studied.

The innovation, research and teacher-training project was initially defined on the basis of some innovative principles of teaching and learning (Malagarriga 2002) aimed at bringing about substantial changes in the way the school operates. The way content is organised and presented in class is the consequence of a major shift in methodology, and poses the teachers unresolved questions concerning evaluation (Viladot et al. 2005; Malagarriga et al. 2008).

The principles that guided the methodological innovations were taken from Malagarriga’s work, where she proposes some goals for organising the music curricula for 5-year-olds at unspecialised schools. They are as follows: to combine creation, interpretation and listening; to integrate sound experimentation and elements of the cultural heritage; and to consider the teaching-learning process as communicative and guided involvement in the common activity (Malagarriga 2002). A way of introducing and adapting those principles to a music school is by working on a project-based approach divided into learning units. Each unit contains songs and pieces of music that students listen to or play, and with some constitutive music elements they can identify. This way of working also presents different proposals about the creation (musicmaking) in which educators and learners are urged to use the musical elements discovered in the aforementioned pieces, which are taken as a reference.

The innovation, research and teacher-training project was initially defined on the basis of some innovative principles of teaching and learning (Malagarriga 2002) aimed at bringing about substantial changes in the way the school operates. The way content is organised and presented in class is the consequence of a major shift in methodology, and poses the teachers unresolved questions concerning evaluation (Viladot et al. 2005; Malagarriga et al. 2008). For this reason, the school staff and the researchers are seeking to progressively establish a shared theoretical framework by which to guide analysis and reflection regarding what is done in practice (Viladot 2005).

It is essential to take into consideration the group as the true subject of the teaching and learning process. Part of the construction and appropriation of musical knowledge is explained on the basis of discourse, produced and negotiated in the context of an activity shared by the group. Thus, learning in the classroom becomes possible thanks to the communication that occurs and is developed among the participants; it could thus be described as a conversation in which teachers and pupils are involved. Along these lines, Potter (1996) defines discourse through speech and classroom texts as actions that are situated, articulated and co-constructed in the ambit of social interaction. Musical activity and discourse in the classroom In musical education, there is a certain tradition of using different modes of representation (kinaesthetic, visual and verbal) as tools for a progressive approximation to the conceptualisation of musical language. Gesture, graphic representations and speech come together to facilitate the processes of perception, experimentation, symbolization and representation of actions during the course of mus</context>

The structure may consist of more intensive practical assistance during the first phase of the process, which is gradually reduced and replaced by the provision of psychological support; that is, by monitoring the progressive increase in the apprentice’s skills from a distance. Bruner (1975, 1978) and Rogoff (1990), among other authors, characterise these processes, and describe the creation of situations that favour the transfer of responsibilities from adults to children, progressively developing their autonomy. These same processes could occur in a classroom situation although the relationship is not purely adult-to-child, as classmates can also be a source of help to each other. The sociocultural approach in education gives relevance to teaching, and it is also a means of facilitating the appropriation of cultural instruments, which leads to the development of higher psychological processes.

Conversation among this class group benefits the social construction of knowledge. Shared interaction and activity generates a process of transferring signs—for example, ledger line notes, the symbol for repeating bars and how many times (×4), ascending and descending scales that do not use neighbouring tones, arpeggio. The teacher’s intervention is the key to these processes of exchange and negotiation, for it is through the processes of guided participation (Rogoff 1990) that she mediates, assists and guides the process of identifying elements, introducing concepts, generalising, relating to one’s own experiences, etc. It is also the teacher who looks for the chance to transfer responsibilities. She appeals to the knowledge of a student who is more advanced in terms of the specific content, in order for that student to participate in the process. An example of this is the moment when a learner anticipates the reading of the next bar after the one the teacher is singing, thus showing that she has taken in what the task involves and, in turn, she is able to ded</context>

We then selected the activities dealing with the observation and analysis of the score titled Cuban Landscape with Rain, we transcribed the conversations (the original discourse was in Catalan) and divided each of the participants’ interventions into corresponding units, and we grouped the interventions into broader, interactive units. Most of these units correspond to the successive series of IRF (Initiation– Response–Follow up/Feedback) sequences in classroom conversations (Sinclair and Coulthard 1975). We added the first comments to the units in order to analyse the meanings constructed by the participants. To do this, we took into account classroom notes and information provided by the teacher. We present one example on continuation (Table 1). Successive redevelopment of the analyses enabled us to construct categories. The different modalities of the discourse identified through the four analysed conversations were reduced into eight discursive categories that correspond to the strategies used by the teacher to conduct the activity towards the proposed objective.

In the classroom, a change between modes represents a change in the learner’s mental possibilities and demands in intellectual and affective terms. In this sense, action, image, gesture and discourse construct meaning and offer the way to modulate the pupils’ vision of the world (Franks and Jewitt 2001). Having recognised the implication and pattern of all these forms of expression in musical education (Malagarriga and Viladot 2004; Viladot 2005), we take a didactic sequence as the object of study and show how verbal language supports a certain type of activity that promotes the appropriation of musical language content. In socioconstructivist terms, verbal language is the language that constitutes the material support of communicational activity and regulates the teaching and learning processes, even though musical language is the main content being taught.

These same processes could occur in a classroom situation although the relationship is not purely adult-to-child, as classmates can also be a source of help to each other. The sociocultural approach in education gives relevance to teaching, and it is also a means of facilitating the appropriation of cultural instruments, which leads to the development of higher psychological processes. In the words of Vygotsky (1978), it is the process of interiorisation that makes it possible to reconstruct inter-psychological operations on an intra-psychological level within the context of social phenomena or activities using signs. So, in short, children’s participation in cultural activities under the guidance of others enables them to internalise their community’s tools for thinking. This vision is particularly useful for understanding the teaching and learning processes produced in musical instruction, both in instrument classes and in the teaching of musical language. Following the Vygotskian approach, musical lang</context>

In this dialogue context, the interlocutors construct and reconstruct their mental representations of the musical content. For Edwards and Mercer (1987), these representations are shared terms of reference, in that they are understood to be the intermental and intersubjective reference that defines, creates and involves the participants in the communication process. Participants therefore share the same definition of the situation and bring different semiotic mechanisms into play that arise in specific uses of the language and appropriate forms of discourse (Wertsch 1985). Thus, the learner 60 L. Viladot et al. grasps the criteria that music uses by legitimating one particular explanation as opposed to others. The specific terminology of the field is not only used to refer to such new content as ledger line notes or arpeggio but rather it is used as a means for appropriation throughout the entire discourse in general: the names of specific notes are mentioned, graphic symbols are analysed, musical instruments are spoken about and terminology for the characteristics of sound are used. This ties in with the ideas of Lemke (1993), when he says that the use of dis</context>

Viladot et al. 1975, 1978). This scaffolding guides interest towards the task; it reduces the degree of difficulty or simplifies the situation in such a way that the learner is able to manipulate the components of the process; it maintains the activity by directing the actions, highlighting aspects, by controlling frustration and risk during resolution, and by providing models (Wood et al. 1976, 1978). The structure may consist of more intensive practical assistance during the first phase of the process, which is gradually reduced and replaced by the provision of psychological support; that is, by monitoring the progressive increase in the apprentice’s skills from a distance. Bruner (1975, 1978) and Rogoff (1990), among other authors, characterise these processes, and describe the creation of situations that favour the transfer of responsibilities from adults to children, progressively developing their autonomy. These same processes could occur in a classroom situation although the </context>

The different modalities of the discourse identified through the four analysed conversations were reduced into eight discursive categories that correspond to the strategies used by the teacher to conduct the activity towards the proposed objective. Van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) defined discursive strategies as linguistic and extra-linguistic resources that the speaker uses intentionally to increase the efficiency of communication. This includes the strictly verbal, but also other forms of representation (gestures, music, pictures, etc). Wood et al. (1976, 1978) identified strategies to solve problems in the joint construction. We also use the term strategy because the forms of discourse that we analysed constitute resources whose objective is to regulate the students’ process of constructing meaning. We decided to qualify the categories as interactive only if we were able to consider that what the teacher and learners said or did was elaborated upon in the conversation and was related to an element of the content being dealt with. The categories all arose on the basis of the analysis of the discourse and were created inductively in considerat</context>

In her proposal concerning a theory of instrumental training where three models of teaching are represented, we identified the analysed practice with the third model, described as follows: the teacher uses the printed score as a tool for communicating with the composer, and at the same time establishes a dialogue with the students constructing musical meaning, taking into account the students’ ideas about the notation. We consider this way of teaching to be constructivist, and this is also the case of our study. In addition, we recalled the scaffolding strategies identified by Wood et al. (1976) and mentioned by Kennell (2002) in his revision: Recruitment; Marking Critical Features; Task Manipulation; Demonstration; Direction Maintenance; Frustration Control. Although the educational context of these authors is very different from ours, and also the tasks and ages of the participants, we are able to identify parallelisms in the strategies that have a regulating role in the activity. The category Structure social participation corresponds to Recruitment, even though the latter refers to the synchronisation of attention and action between teacher and student and in our case we are refe</context>

Different musical education activities need to be analysed and contrasted with different didactic sequences. Looking for common ground and differences in the application of the school curriculum (maths, verbal language, etc.) would be interesting and useful for teacher training practice. Furthermore, the similarities we have found between work done 30 years ago (see Wood et al. 1976) and our own are a source of encouragement with regard to carrying out further research. Although it is not easy, our aim is to continue exploring this methodological approach in order to look in more depth at the inter- and intra-psychological processes that arise in the classroom.
