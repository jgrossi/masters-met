			<abstract>
				<p>Do psychological perspectives constitute the only way through which the role of musical creativity in education can be addressed, researched and theorised? This essay attempts to offer an alternative view of musical creativity as a deeply social and political form of human praxis, by proposing a perspective rooted in the thought of the political philosopher and activist Cornelius Castoriadis (1922–1997). This is done in two steps. First, an attempt is made to place the pursuit of the concept of musical creativity within a larger educational and societal context of conflicting trajectories that run through (a) Modernity and (b) Education. Then, I revisit the issue of educational value of improvising and composing through creating conceptual links between the process of music-making through improvisation and composition and the project of political autonomy as conceived by Castoriadis. By foregrounding instituting imaginary over instituted imaginary, improvising and composing become active processes of positing new legitimacies, and of creating a music-making context that searches for its own foundations. It is in and through creative musical praxis that we can think about issues of hierarchies, musical values, social dimensions of different music-making processes, our relationship to past values and to historical dimensions of music. By arguing that improvisation and composition might be seen as ways of positing the issue of political autonomy in musical terms, this paper emphasises the role of improvisation and composition as a mode of potentially transformative educational practice that may foster the development of critical consciousness , linking music education to a larger project of rediscovering and at the same time redefining democracy.</p>

It must, in its institution, preserve or make room for the emergence of otherness as intrinsically possible’ (Castoriadis 1987a, p. 212). What is more, such ways of creative engagement might be seen as working against the pervasive nihilism that dominates music education. Here I am referring to all three variants of nihilism (negative, reactive and passive) explored by Bowman (2005). Improvisation and composition counter negative nihilism by affirming the here-and-now, resist reactive nihilism by countering technocratic instrumentalism, and subvert passive nihilism by fostering autonomous judgement and personal commitment. Against the normative discourse of music psychology and its pervasive influence on music ‘methods’ (Regelski, 2002), the dogmatism of advocacy, and the sweeping power of positivism and scientism which ‘have become ideological touchstones for a profession anxious to substantiate its dignity and credibility among the behavioral sciences’ (Bowman, p. 2005</context>

Cobussen (2008) has advanced a perspective on listening and interaction in improvisation based on the anti-logocentric philosophy of G. C. Fiumara, arguing that ‘Listening (in improvised music) ... becomes an important locus of resistance to orthodoxies of the imagination (conventional systems of thought), challenging indifference’ (p. 52). In another study, Cobussen (2005) sought to create a view of improvisational creativity through a Deleuzian conception of noise and Alain Badiou’s conception of ethics. Gilbert (2004) 172 Panagiotis A. Kanellopoulos © 2010 The Author Educational Philosophy and Theory © 2010 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia employed Deleuze &amp; Guattari’s (1987) notion of rhizome to conceptualise the non-hierarchical character of certain trends in contemporary improvised scene.Toynbee (2003) suggested that we adopt a distributed view of musical creativity that could be informed by Becker’s (1982) concept of the art world, by Bourdi</context>

Notice also the recent attempts to emphasise the value and usefulness of musical improvisation and creativity as models for development of negotiation and management skills—see Balachandra et al. (2005) as well as other papers in the same issue of Negotiation Journal; Peplowski, (1998); also Sawyer’s (2003) review of other relevant to this topic literature (pp. 180–182). As Peplowski maintains, ‘Managers can learn from jazz music, because a jazz band is kind of like a corporation’ (Peplowski, 1998, p. 560).The Italian philosopher PaoloVirno in his A Grammar of the Multitude (2004) offers a theoretical perspective that points towards a plausible interpretation of this recent managerial interest in improvisational skills.Virno argues that the post-fordist notion of work values virtuosity—Virno</context>

Although Green’s conception of musical autonomy stems from her distinction between inherent and delineated meaning and is quite distinct from the notion of Castoriadian autonomy, her overall argument fits well to Castoriadis’ conception of the creative power of freedom. 29. For a coherent argumentation of how education might be linked to the process of autonomy in Castoriadis’ sense, see Giroux (2006, esp. p. 34); for an extensive treatment of Castoriadis’ thought by the same author, see Giroux (2002). 30. See for example Woodford’s (2005) discussion of the links between music education and democratic practice; from the perspective advanced in this paper, Woodford’s neglect of any discussion of the political significance of composing and improvising prevented him from going beyond ‘the trivial claim that music educators ought to become more politically involved in the public realm’ (Peters, 2008, p. 97).

The advancement of socio-cultural perspectives on children’s and young people’s musical creativity is, however, slowly being regarded as an important research pathway (Barrett, 2003, 2006; Barrett &amp; Gromko, 2007; Davis, 2005). It is argued that such perspectives, by resisting standardisation, and to the extent that they pursue the radical consequences of their foundations, might be helpful in emphasising the emancipatory potential of musical creativity. 21. Here I follow the logic but not the letter of Castoriadis’ argument about creation, drawing the consequences that are relevant to our aims here. Talking about the concept of institution, Castoriadis put the matter differently: he talked about the primal institution of society, ‘the fact that society creates itself as society’ (2007c, p. 100) and t</context>

Another important strand of this trajectory of emancipation relates to the question of the legitimacy of raising the question of the relation between politics and education, and of bringing political considerations within the realm of education.This issue has opened once and for all, with education being a field of public life where important political issues are being debated.Let me only remind you of the highly informative debate between Ralph Ellison and Hannah Arendt concerning the Little Rock case.11 The open questioning of schools alleged neutrality should be seen as par</context>

What is more, such ways of creative engagement might be seen as working against the pervasive nihilism that dominates music education. Here I am referring to all three variants of nihilism (negative, reactive and passive) explored by Bowman (2005). Improvisation and composition counter negative nihilism by affirming the here-and-now, resist reactive nihilism by countering technocratic instrumentalism, and subvert passive nihilism by fostering autonomous judgement and personal commitment. Against the normative discourse of music psychology and its pervasive influence on music ‘methods’ (Regelski, 2002), the dogmatism of advocacy, and the sweeping power of positivism and scientism which ‘have become ideological touchstones for a profession anxious to substantiate its dignity and credibility among the behavioral sciences’ (Bowman, p. 2005</context>

The subsumption of creativity under a rationale that deprives it of political and social dimensions conceals the possibility that creative action might involve (social) critique, that it might be a manifestation of a critical attitude. This in turn rests on an age-old division between theoretical critique—reserved for the realm of philosophy—and action. Within the field of music education, various research approaches and practical applications place great emphasis on the development of children’s creativity (Brophy, 2002; Dolan, 2005; Hickey, 2003a, 2001a, 2001b; Kratus, 1995; Paananen, 2006; Swanwick &amp; Tillman, 1986; Swanwick &amp; Cavalieri-Franca, 1999;Tafuri, 2006;Walduck, 2005). Many of those approaches, however, fall under the continuous and sweeping deluge of psychologising educational encounters. According to Gur &amp; Wiley (2009) ‘psychologization (Apple, 1996) refers to the way in which psychological issues become centralized in theoretical discussions, evacuating critical (including political, philosophic, and societal) issues’19 (p. 308).

In fact, this trajectory might be seen as a source of hope. What I mean here by hope resists the theological ramifications of the term; rather, hope is here regarded as 156 Panagiotis A. Kanellopoulos © 2010 The Author Educational Philosophy and Theory © 2010 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia ‘anticipatory rather than messianic, mobilizing rather than therapeutic’ (Giroux, 2004, p. 38), a necessary ingredient of ‘a temporal orientation to the future’ (Browne, 2005, p. 78) that aims at informing our present action.9 This second trajectory in the contemporary educational world relates to the death of authority (Arendt, 2006/1968a; 2006/1968b) and its consequences for education (Renaut, 2004). Educational control and the exercise of power within the educational process cannot anymore be justified by relying on traditional modes of authority.Treating children-as-equals within a democratic context has irrevocably opened up questions of legitimacy of control, of knowledge and its accepted forms, and of ways of approaching teaching.

Yet, the elucidation of the concept of personal and political autonomy to which he wholeheartedly devoted his intellectual efforts is a major source of hope, and a major source of inspiration for Giroux’s (2002) notion of ‘educated hope’. I cannot, of course, overemphasise that a core motive for the theoretical justification of the educational importance of composing and improvising as germs of personal and political autonomy that is attempted in the present study, has been exactly this sense of hope that springs from the openness and liberatory promise that characterises Castoriadis</context>

Just as political autonomy aims at creating new legitimacies—being ‘a search concerning what law I ought (we ought) to adopt’ (Castoriadis, 1997f, p. 340)—, so musical improvisation and composition can be seen as a process which creates new ways of coming to grip with the question: how should we make music? Discussions and critical questioning that are based on the students’ own work ‘will encourage them to think for themselves about what sounds right and why it might be considered to be so, and to know that they have only themselves to convince’ (Paynter, 2000, p. 20).

It is titled ‘The democracy of the aesthetic’. With excessive as much as unfounded confidence and in a deceptively antirhetoric jargon the article informs us that currently ‘we are experiencing the democracy of the aesthetic’ (Tsimelas, 2008, p. 6); appreciation of style thrives, as everyone demands to be surrounded by beautiful, smart and intelligently designed objects.

Castoriadis was always looking for what he called the germ of autonomy, for signs of social imaginary significations that hold the promise of developing into the pursuit of social and individual autonomy: ‘I am speaking intentionally of germ, for autonomy, social as well as individual, is a project’ (1991d, p. 163). He was always looking for moments and processes of rupture, for processes of ‘liquidating the old significations, and perhaps creating new ones’ (1991e, p. 205). Women’s silent struggle for emancipation is a characteristic example mentioned by Castoriadis, 1991e, pp. 204–205), for political praxis that occurs ‘first, “without foundations” ... and second, without the “authority” or credentials of traditional institutions or theory’ (Naranch, 2002, p. 72).

A Castoriadian Perspective on Education It seems to me that in the field of educational theory as well as in the everyday teaching and learning lives of people, we are currently experiencing the simultaneous deployment of two quite distinctive, even radically opposing trajectories that correspond to the trajectories of modernity outlined above. 3.1 Enforcement of the Trajectory of Corporate Logic The trajectory of unlimited expansion of ‘rational’ mastery has led to a situation whereby ‘what counts is whatever can be counted’ (Castoriadis, 1991e, p. 184). And this has not left the realm of education untouched. A characteristic narrative snapshot offered by James Marshall (2009) could be seen as capturing exactly the core of what is argued in this part: 154 Panagiotis A. Kanellopoulos © 2010 The Author Educational Philosophy and Theory © 2010 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia Some five years ago in a class of final year Bachelor students, one student said that after her recent teaching practice her practice supervisor asked her this question at the outset of their post-lesson meeting. ‘In lesson X, which I observed, how </context>

Despite its Kantian origins Castoriadis’ conception of autonomy breaks away from its conception as the result of rational judgement, and therefore from a conception of autonomy as a state of freedom based on rationality.15 More specifically, Castoriadis moves away from Kant’s notion of autonomy in three important respects (Kalyvas, 1998; Castoriadis, 1991a, p. 30). He cleanses autonomy of its transcendental ramifications ‘by eliminating the rational mastery of inner nature, the unconscious, and the repression of heteronomous desires’ (Kalyvas, 1998, p. 163).

Castoriadis was always looking for what he called the germ of autonomy, for signs of social imaginary significations that hold the promise of developing into the pursuit of social and individual autonomy: ‘I am speaking intentionally of germ, for autonomy, social as well as individual, is a project’ (1991d, p. 163). He was always looking for moments and processes of rupture, for processes of ‘liquidating the old significations, and perhaps creating new ones’ (1991e, p. 205). Women’s silent struggle for emancipation is a characteristic example mentioned by Castoriadis, 1991e, pp. 204–205), for political praxis that occurs ‘first, “without foundations” ... and second, without the “authority” or credentials of traditional institutions or theory’ (Naranch, 2002, p. 72). This germ has been located at various historical moments, from Athenian democracy (Castoriadis, 1991b) to the open discussions held in Sorbonne auditoriums during the events of May 1968 (Castoriadis, 1987b).7 This is what permits us to proceed into examining the possibility of viewing the process of musical creativity as emerges through composing and improvising as a potential locus of the germ of a</context>
<context citStr="Castoriadis, 1991" endWordPosition="1947" position="13222" startWordPosition="1946">ics of modernity manifest themselves in the realm of education. 3. A Castoriadian Perspective on Education It seems to me that in the field of educational theory as well as in the everyday teaching and learning lives of people, we are currently experiencing the simultaneous deployment of two quite distinctive, even radically opposing trajectories that correspond to the trajectories of modernity outlined above. 3.1 Enforcement of the Trajectory of Corporate Logic The trajectory of unlimited expansion of ‘rational’ mastery has led to a situation whereby ‘what counts is whatever can be counted’ (Castoriadis, 1991e, p. 184). And this has not left the realm of education untouched. A characteristic narrative snapshot offered by James Marshall (2009) could be seen as capturing exactly the core of what is argued in this part: 154 Panagiotis A. Kanellopoulos © 2010 The Author Educational Philosophy and Theory © 2010 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia Some five years ago in a class of final year Bachelor students, one student said that after her recent teaching practice her practice supervisor asked her this question at the outset of their post-lesson meeting. ‘In lesson X, which I observed, how </context>

Despite its Kantian origins Castoriadis’ conception of autonomy breaks away from its conception as the result of rational judgement, and therefore from a conception of autonomy as a state of freedom based on rationality.15 More specifically, Castoriadis moves away from Kant’s notion of autonomy in three important respects (Kalyvas, 1998; Castoriadis, 1991a, p. 30). He cleanses autonomy of its transcendental ramifications ‘by eliminating the rational mastery of inner nature, the unconscious, and the repression of heteronomous desires’ (Kalyvas, 1998, p. 163). Also he moves away from conceptions of autonomy as self-determination arguing ‘for a substantive reinterpretation of autonomy as self-realization’ (ibid.). Finally, Castoriadis abolishes the idea of absolute foundations, which can be justified by regression to teleological conceptions of human nature: ‘Castoriadis decenters autonomy by avoiding the postulate that there is a “total man,” an</context>

The possibility of error, and the acknowledgement of the possibility of error may have radical consequences into how we teach. But it seems there is no other way: ‘The attempt to found equality as well as freedom, that is, human autonomy, on an extrasocial basis [fondement], is intrinsically antinomic. It even is a manifestation of heteronomy. If God, Nature, or Reason have decreed freedom (or, moreover, slavery), we always will be, in this case, submissive and enslaved to this pretended decree’ (Castoriadis, 1991c, p. 132). Thus, we have now established the two constituents of autonomy: first, the process of instituting ways of meaning-making, and second, the process of questioning: ‘The moment of democracy’s birth, and that of politics, is not the reign of law or of right, nor that of the “rights of man”, nor even the equality of citizens as such, but rather the emergence of the questioning of the law in and through the actual activity of the community.

This question should be regarded, in this context, as fundamentally open; it does not lead to definitive answers and therefore establishes a new relationship with musical tradition. Involvement in composing and listening might lead to the creation of a different, critical, non-submissive and creative relationship with musics of other people, places, times and cultures. A heteronomous relationship to tradition means that ‘the question of the legitimacy of tradition shall not be raised’ (Castoriadis, 1991d, p. 163).

Hence he did not pursue the consequences of his conception of autonomy on how we understand the process of creating music. 25. ‘Since 1964 ...

Castoriadis was always looking for what he called the germ of autonomy, for signs of social imaginary significations that hold the promise of developing into the pursuit of social and individual autonomy: ‘I am speaking intentionally of germ, for autonomy, social as well as individual, is a project’ (1991d, p. 163). He was always looking for moments and processes of rupture, for processes of ‘liquidating the old significations, and perhaps creating new ones’ (1991e, p. 205). Women’s silent struggle for emancipation is a characteristic example mentioned by Castoriadis, 1991e, pp. 204–205), for political praxis that occurs ‘first, “without foundations” ... and second, without the “authority” or credentials of traditional institutions or theory’ (Naranch, 2002, p. 72). This germ has been located at various historical moments, from Athenian democracy (Castoriadis, 1991b) to the open discussions held in Sorbonne auditoriums during the events of May 1968 (Castoriadis, 1987b).7 This is what permits us to proceed into examining the possibility of viewing the process of musical creativity as emerges through composing and improvising as a potential locus of the germ of a</context>

A Castoriadian Perspective on Education It seems to me that in the field of educational theory as well as in the everyday teaching and learning lives of people, we are currently experiencing the simultaneous deployment of two quite distinctive, even radically opposing trajectories that correspond to the trajectories of modernity outlined above. 3.1 Enforcement of the Trajectory of Corporate Logic The trajectory of unlimited expansion of ‘rational’ mastery has led to a situation whereby ‘what counts is whatever can be counted’ (Castoriadis, 1991e, p. 184). And this has not left the realm of education untouched. A characteristic narrative snapshot offered by James Marshall (2009) could be seen as capturing exactly the core of what is argued in this part: 154 Panagiotis A. Kanellopoulos © 2010 The Author Educational Philosophy and Theory © 2010 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia Some five years ago in a class of final year Bachelor students, one student said that after her recent teaching practice her practice supervisor asked her this question at the outset of their post-lesson meeting. ‘In lesson X, which I observed, how </context>

Despite its Kantian origins Castoriadis’ conception of autonomy breaks away from its conception as the result of rational judgement, and therefore from a conception of autonomy as a state of freedom based on rationality.15 More specifically, Castoriadis moves away from Kant’s notion of autonomy in three important respects (Kalyvas, 1998; Castoriadis, 1991a, p. 30). He cleanses autonomy of its transcendental ramifications ‘by eliminating the rational mastery of inner nature, the unconscious, and the repression of heteronomous desires’ (Kalyvas, 1998, p. 163). Also he moves away from conceptions of autonomy as self-determination arguing ‘for a substantive reinterpretation of autonomy as self-realization’ (ibid.). Finally, Castoriadis abolishes the idea of absolute foundations, which can be justified by regression to teleological conceptions of human nature: ‘Castoriadis decenters autonomy by avoiding the postulate that there is a “total man,” an</context>
<context citStr="Castoriadis, 1991" endWordPosition="8555" position="56687" startWordPosition="8554">ubly subject to error and that simply leads one back to heteronomy’ (Castoriadis, 1997f, p. 340). The possibility of error, and the acknowledgement of the possibility of error may have radical consequences into how we teach. But it seems there is no other way: ‘The attempt to found equality as well as freedom, that is, human autonomy, on an extrasocial basis [fondement], is intrinsically antinomic. It even is a manifestation of heteronomy. If God, Nature, or Reason have decreed freedom (or, moreover, slavery), we always will be, in this case, submissive and enslaved to this pretended decree’ (Castoriadis, 1991c, p. 132). Thus, we have now established the two constituents of autonomy: first, the process of instituting ways of meaning-making, and second, the process of questioning: ‘The moment of democracy’s birth, and that of politics, is not the reign of law or of right, nor that of the “rights of man”, nor even the equality of citizens as such, but rather the emergence of the questioning of the law in and through the actual activity of the community. Which are the laws we ought to make?’ (Castoriadis, 1991d, p. 164). A music education that centres on improvising and composing creates a context in </context>
<context citStr="Castoriadis, 1991" endWordPosition="9025" position="59596" startWordPosition="9024">ight be considered to be so, and to know that they have only themselves to convince’ (Paynter, 2000, p. 20). This question should be regarded, in this context, as fundamentally open; it does not lead to definitive answers and therefore establishes a new relationship with musical tradition. Involvement in composing and listening might lead to the creation of a different, critical, non-submissive and creative relationship with musics of other people, places, times and cultures. A heteronomous relationship to tradition means that ‘the question of the legitimacy of tradition shall not be raised’ (Castoriadis, 1991d, p. 163). Improvisation and composition seen as sites of autonomy can provide the route for an iconoclastic revising of the tradition, in a context of critical questioning which raises the issue of its legitimacy and examines its role in turning education from a site of emancipation to a means of coercion. As Saville Kushner argues, The ‘knowing’ will not always be the neutral, honorific process implicit in our moral vocabulary, knowing has a backwash effect—sometimes we may substitute ‘co-option’ for ‘knowledge’. Blind but purposeful iconoclasm is an alternative curriculum strategy. First k</context>
<context citStr="Castoriadis, 1991" endWordPosition="10437" position="69006" startWordPosition="10436">ions that are not simply dictated by various forms of authority. Creative music-making understood in this way might become a social process which contributes to the, for Castoriadis, true object of politics: the creation of ‘the institutions which, by being internalized by individuals, most facilitate their Envisioning Autonomy through Improvising and Composing 169 © 2010 The Author Educational Philosophy and Theory © 2010 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia accession to their individual autonomy and their effective participation in all forms of explicit power existing in society’ (Castoriadis, 1991d, p. 173).This perspective leads us towards a re-definition of musical creativity, moving us away from an individualistic problemsolving perception towards a conception of creativity as a process of instituting musical practices, as an embodiment of the project of political autonomy. The focus shifts from the instituted society, to the instituting society, to a conception of democracy as an open project that works against domination and inequality. ‘The time of doing must thus be instituted so as to contain singularities that are not determinable in advance, as the possibility of appearing of</context>
<context citStr="Castoriadis, 1991" endWordPosition="10967" position="72581" startWordPosition="10966">ument of bigotry and coercion. This happens most frightfully when women’s sexual freedom or the freedom of expression and association for lesbian and gay people is invoked instrumentally to wage cultural assaults on Islam that reaffirm US sovereign violence’ (Butler, 2008, p. 3). 2. It must be noted that Castoriadis’ views of particular musics are not only fragmented but, at times, constitute nothing more than sweeping, generalised claims (see, for example, 170 Panagiotis A. Kanellopoulos © 2010 The Author Educational Philosophy and Theory © 2010 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia Castoriadis, 1991f, pp. 241–242; 2007f, p. 82; 1997d, p. 182) which, to the extent that I have understood his work, are in direct conflict with central concepts of his political theory which constitute the core on which this essay is based. But a systematic treatment of these issues lies far beyond the aims of this paper. 3. It must be noted that Castoriadis’ thought has not, to my knowledge, entered music education theoretical explorations—the only published reference to Castoriadis within music education literature is a passing one (Aróstegui, 2004, p. 189). To my knowledge, the only exception is Stergios Lo</context>

It should be noted that Castoriadis (who, incidentally, was a passionate music lover and also played the piano) held surprisingly restricted views on music, never dealing with the processes of musical creation.

Despite its Kantian origins Castoriadis’ conception of autonomy breaks away from its conception as the result of rational judgement, and therefore from a conception of autonomy as a state of freedom based on rationality.15 More specifically, Castoriadis moves away from Kant’s notion of autonomy in three important respects (Kalyvas, 1998; Castoriadis, 1991a, p. 30). He cleanses autonomy of its transcendental ramifications ‘by eliminating the rational mastery of inner nature, the unconscious, and the repression of heteronomous desires’ (Kalyvas, 1998, p. 163). Also he moves away from conceptions of autonomy as self-determination arguing ‘for a substantive reinterpretation of autonomy as self-realization’ (ibid.). Finally, Castoriadis abolishes the idea of absolute foundations, which can be justified by regression to teleological conceptions of human nature: ‘Castoriadis decenters autonomy by avoiding the postulate that there is a “total man,” an</context>
<context citStr="Castoriadis, 1991" endWordPosition="8555" position="56687" startWordPosition="8554">ubly subject to error and that simply leads one back to heteronomy’ (Castoriadis, 1997f, p. 340). The possibility of error, and the acknowledgement of the possibility of error may have radical consequences into how we teach. But it seems there is no other way: ‘The attempt to found equality as well as freedom, that is, human autonomy, on an extrasocial basis [fondement], is intrinsically antinomic. It even is a manifestation of heteronomy. If God, Nature, or Reason have decreed freedom (or, moreover, slavery), we always will be, in this case, submissive and enslaved to this pretended decree’ (Castoriadis, 1991c, p. 132). Thus, we have now established the two constituents of autonomy: first, the process of instituting ways of meaning-making, and second, the process of questioning: ‘The moment of democracy’s birth, and that of politics, is not the reign of law or of right, nor that of the “rights of man”, nor even the equality of citizens as such, but rather the emergence of the questioning of the law in and through the actual activity of the community. Which are the laws we ought to make?’ (Castoriadis, 1991d, p. 164). A music education that centres on improvising and composing creates a context in </context>

This question should be regarded, in this context, as fundamentally open; it does not lead to definitive answers and therefore establishes a new relationship with musical tradition. Involvement in composing and listening might lead to the creation of a different, critical, non-submissive and creative relationship with musics of other people, places, times and cultures. A heteronomous relationship to tradition means that ‘the question of the legitimacy of tradition shall not be raised’ (Castoriadis, 1991d, p. 163). Improvisation and composition seen as sites of autonomy can provide the route for an iconoclastic revising of the tradition, in a context of critical questioning which raises the issue of its legitimacy and examines its role in turning education from a site of emancipation to a means of coercion. As Saville Kushner argues, The ‘knowing’ will not always be the neutral, honorific process implicit in our moral vocabulary, knowing has a backwash effect—sometimes we may substitute ‘co-option’ for ‘knowledge’. Blind but purposeful iconoclasm is an alternative curriculum strategy. First k</context>

Creative music-making understood in this way might become a social process which contributes to the, for Castoriadis, true object of politics: the creation of ‘the institutions which, by being internalized by individuals, most facilitate their Envisioning Autonomy through Improvising and Composing 169 © 2010 The Author Educational Philosophy and Theory © 2010 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia accession to their individual autonomy and their effective participation in all forms of explicit power existing in society’ (Castoriadis, 1991d, p. 173).This perspective leads us towards a re-definition of musical creativity, moving us away from an individualistic problemsolving perception towards a conception of creativity as a process of instituting musical practices, as an embodiment of the project of political autonomy. The focus shifts from the instituted society, to the instituting society, to a conception of democracy as an open project that works against domination and inequality. ‘The time of doing must thus be instituted so as to contain singularities that are not determinable in advance, as the possibility of appearing of</context>
<context citStr="Castoriadis, 1991" endWordPosition="10967" position="72581" startWordPosition="10966">ument of bigotry and coercion. This happens most frightfully when women’s sexual freedom or the freedom of expression and association for lesbian and gay people is invoked instrumentally to wage cultural assaults on Islam that reaffirm US sovereign violence’ (Butler, 2008, p. 3). 2. It must be noted that Castoriadis’ views of particular musics are not only fragmented but, at times, constitute nothing more than sweeping, generalised claims (see, for example, 170 Panagiotis A. Kanellopoulos © 2010 The Author Educational Philosophy and Theory © 2010 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia Castoriadis, 1991f, pp. 241–242; 2007f, p. 82; 1997d, p. 182) which, to the extent that I have understood his work, are in direct conflict with central concepts of his political theory which constitute the core on which this essay is based. But a systematic treatment of these issues lies far beyond the aims of this paper. 3. It must be noted that Castoriadis’ thought has not, to my knowledge, entered music education theoretical explorations—the only published reference to Castoriadis within music education literature is a passing one (Aróstegui, 2004, p. 189). To my knowledge, the only exception is Stergios Lo</context>
<context citStr="Castoriadis, 1991" endWordPosition="13789" position="91114" startWordPosition="13788">24. It should be noted that Castoriadis (who, incidentally, was a passionate music lover and also played the piano) held surprisingly restricted views on music, never dealing with the processes of musical creation. Rather, he preferred talking about musical work as the prime example of his notion of creation, emphasising the composer’s magnificent ability to instantly create and sustain large musical forms in his imagination (see Castoriadis, 2007f, p. 52) and therefore to posit new legitimacies (ibid., pp. 87–88)—Castoriadis followed a Kantian apprehension of the work of art (as evidenced in Castoriadis, 1991b, pp. 92–101), seeing it as creating new and closed worlds. This, I think, did not allow him to deal with the political dimensions of music-making. Hence he did not pursue the consequences of his conception of autonomy on how we understand the process of creating music. 25. ‘Since 1964 ... [1987a; Castoriadis refers to his essay, “Marxism and Revolutionary Theory”, which later formed the first part of The Imaginary Institution of Society] I have called the activity that aims at autonomy praxis: this activity aims at others as (potentially) autonomous subjects and tries to contribute to their </context>

For Castoriadis, if art imitates anything at all, then it is Being itself: Being is a vis formandi, and art is a vis formandi.Thus art making is a metaphor for the propensity of creation that lies at the core of the instituting imaginary. Just as in the realm of social life the instituting imaginary creates a world, music and art create forms that constitute worlds (Castoriadis, 2007g, esp. pp. 137–138).

Getting out of this vicious circle is no easy task: institutions functioning on the basis of heteronomy both produce and are produced through heteronomous individuals. And of course ‘[o]nly an autonomous collectivity can shape autonomous individuals—and vice versa’ (Castoriadis, 2007e, p. 176). The role of education is crucial, and what I am trying to do here is to sketch a way out of this vicious circle; suggesting that musical composition and improvisation constitute music educational practices that cultivate autonomy. They entail, in other words, the creation of modes of musical action that constitute instituting practices, and at the same time, they create a context for constant questioning.This is my response to the paradox sketched by Castoriadis in the following manner: ‘autonomy is the ability to call the given institution of society into question— and that instit</context>

It should be noted that Castoriadis (who, incidentally, was a passionate music lover and also played the piano) held surprisingly restricted views on music, never dealing with the processes of musical creation. Rather, he preferred talking about musical work as the prime example of his notion of creation, emphasising the composer’s magnificent ability to instantly create and sustain large musical forms in his imagination (see Castoriadis, 2007f, p. 52) and therefore to posit new legitimacies (ibid., pp. 87–88)—Castoriadis followed a Kantian apprehension of the work of art (as evidenced in Castoriadis, 1991b, pp. 92–101), seeing it as creating new and closed worlds. This, I think, did not allow him to deal with the political dimensions of music-making. Hence he did not pursue the consequences of his conception of autonomy on how we understand the process of creating music. 25. ‘Since 1964 ...

Despite its merits, it seems to me that this account conflates Romantic conceptions of creativity with psychological positivist notions, and moreover, does not do justice to the possible subversive potential of sociocultural approaches to creativity that could emerge out of sociocultural perspectives such as those developed by Matusov, St. Julien, Lacasa &amp; Alburquerque Candela (2007), Matusov &amp; St. Julien (2004), Shotter (2001), and Shotter &amp; Billig (1998).

For general critiques of psychologism and its consequences for educational thinking, see also Egan, 2002 and Williams, 1990. 20. The advancement of socio-cultural perspectives on children’s and young people’s musical creativity is, however, slowly being regarded as an important research pathway (Barrett, 2003, 2006; Barrett &amp; Gromko, 2007; Davis, 2005). It is argued that such perspectives, by resisting standardisation, and to the extent that they pursue the radical consequences of their foundations, might be helpful in emphasising the emancipatory potential of musical creativity. 21. Here I follow the logic but not the letter of Castoriadis’ argument about creation, drawing the consequences that are relevant to our aims here. Talking about the concept of institution, Castoriadis put the matter differently: he talked about the primal institution of society, ‘the fact that society creates itself as society’ (2007c, p. 100) and the second-orde</context>

Talking about the concept of institution, Castoriadis put the matter differently: he talked about the primal institution of society, ‘the fact that society creates itself as society’ (2007c, p. 100) and the second-order institutions through which it ‘articulates and implements itself ’ (ibid.). These second order institutions (my ‘b’ in the main body of the text) are divided into transhistorical (e.g. language) and specific, that is, tied to particular socio-historical contexts—e.g. the Athenian polis (Kagan, 1990; Mossé, 1971), public open concerts (see ch. 2 of DeNora, 1995; also McVeigh, 2004), the musical-work concept as a regulatory organisational principle of musical production and reception (see Goehr, 1992), or experimental performances (whose conceptual trajectory is masterfully sketched by Goehr, 2008). 22. Notice also the recent attempts to emphasise the value and usefulness of musical improvisation and creativity as models for development of negotiation and management skills—see Balachandra et al.

F. Dearden,16 or R. S. Peters (see Olssen, 2006)—or educational theorists (e.g. Levinson, 1999; Reich, 2002). Liberal conceptions of autonomy as an educational goal presuppose that the notion of the individual, of the relationship between individual and society, and of rational mastery, are understood in ways that differ radically from those employed by Castoriadis.17 Employing a Foucaultian perspective, Marshall (1995, 1996b), Fitzsimons (2002), Olssen (2006), and Devine and Irwin (2006) offer a devastating critique of what could be called ‘the autonomous chooser fallacy’: ‘what is presupposed in the notion of the “autonomous chooser”, says Marshall, is that the notion of autonomy needed to make choices, and the notion of needs and interests entailed as a result, have not been manipulated or imposed in some way upon the chooser, but are the subject’s own. A Foucauldian critique rejects such a possibility’ (Olssen, 2006, p. 59).

The initiation of dialogue among these different approaches would, I think, be particularly fruitful. 15. I think, therefore, that Castoriadis would entirely concord to the thesis, put forward by Lankshear (1982), that ‘rationality is heteronomous to the self: that in a sense the person who is rational subjects their “real” self to the government of a rationality which is outside to themselves, and is in fact part of the structure of laws, reasons etc. which are formed in a social context (Devine and Irwin, 2006, p. 15). Castoriadis has forcefully argued that ‘there is no rational foundation for reason, nor is there any rational foundation for freedom. In both cases there is, certainly, a reasonable justification—but that comes downstream; it is based upon what autonomy alone renders possible for human beings.’ (n.d. b, p. 127). 16. Marshall’s (1995, p. 6) concise formulation of Dearden’s (1968) position on autonomy as an educational goal is this: ‘first, an independence from authorities; second, a disposition to test the truth of things for oneself, whether by experience or by a critical estimate of</context>

The subsumption of creativity under a rationale that deprives it of political and social dimensions conceals the possibility that creative action might involve (social) critique, that it might be a manifestation of a critical attitude. This in turn rests on an age-old division between theoretical critique—reserved for the realm of philosophy—and action. Within the field of music education, various research approaches and practical applications place great emphasis on the development of children’s creativity (Brophy, 2002; Dolan, 2005; Hickey, 2003a, 2001a, 2001b; Kratus, 1995; Paananen, 2006; Swanwick &amp; Tillman, 1986; Swanwick &amp; Cavalieri-Franca, 1999;Tafuri, 2006;Walduck, 2005).

The rise and prevalence of an anti-metaphysical concept of creativity after the second World War (Elliott, 1971; for its role in the renewal of New Music’s interest in improvisation see Kutschke, 1999) has been accompanied by the development of a particular model of scientific inquiry, which constitutes an eloquent example of what Castoriadis has referred to as modernity’s ‘unlimited expansion of “rational” mastery’ (1991g, p. 272). The idea that penetrated a large part of research about creativity during the fifties and the sixties is eloquently manifested in the following statement: ‘America must treasure and foster all the creative ability that she has in her’ (Toynbee, 1964, p. 9).

And this leads to the development of an argument for the educational value of improvisational and compositional music-making, for its apprehension as a means for the development of critical consciousness, moving away from notions of individualistic conceptions of skill development and of acquisition of flexible skills relevant to the music market. Essentially, this relates to the larger question of how could immersion in composition and improvisation lead to critical encounters with the role of music in people’s lives (Finney, Hickman, Morrison, Nicholl &amp; Rudduck, 2005; Finney, 2003; Hayward, 2000; Jorgensen, 2003; Prévost, 1995).

And this has not left the realm of education untouched.

They adopt a view of cognition within which creativity emerges as a private mental problem-solving process, even in those cases where the social dimension of creative collaboration is not neglected. Moreover, many studies of children’s composing and improvising view creativity as a mental ability, which unfolds in distinct, uniform, and largely pre-defined developmental stages (Br</context>

It must be noted that Castoriadis’ thought has not, to my knowledge, entered music education theoretical explorations—the only published reference to Castoriadis within music education literature is a passing one (Aróstegui, 2004, p. 189). To my knowledge, the only exception is Stergios Loustas’ MA thesis (2004), which constitutes the first important reference to the possibility of researching musical improvisation through Castoriadis’ notion of autonomy. 4. Castoriadis’ strict separation between the two has not gone unchallenged. For example, Karl E. Smith (2009) argues that Castoriadis’ understanding of the social historical as entailing ontological plurality is negated by his strictly polarised view of modernity as constituted by the simultaneous presence of these two mutually incompatible projects—autonomy and rational mastery—and attempts to offer a pluralistic, rather than a polarised view of modernity. Although the starting point of this approach is theoretically interesting, in my view Smith excessively smoothes out Castoriadis’ conception ‘[t]he unlimited expansion of “rational” mastery’ so as to be able to work in favour of autonomy. 5.

Ralph Ellison argued that what Arendt had fatally failed to see was that ‘the black parents in Little Rock were instilling in their children an “ideal of sacrifice” necessary to move the nation forward on its quest for true democracy’ (Warren, 2003, p. 159). This old debate is not at all outdated (for a recent attempt to answer to Arendt’s 50-year-old paper see Nakata, 2008), as the issues raised then are still with us in a variety of contexts, sometimes in even more dramatic ways. 12. In a recent paper, Michael A. Peters (2009) proposes a conceptual map for understanding the process of educational appropriation of conceptions of creativity and their correspondence with particular facets of contemporary capitalism that is different from the one suggested here. Peters argues that the educational appropriation of Romantic conceptions of creativity corresponds to the need for cultivating qualities relevant to the ‘risk-taking entrepreneur’ (p. 40), whereas more recent, relational, distributed, socio-cultural conceptions correspond ‘to the “network” that now animates all forms and emerging genres of electronic textual en</context>

And this concealment is not something that can be just blown away. It is deeply embodied in how music teachers feel, move and act, becoming agents of the dominant instituted musical imaginary that perpetuates musical heteronomy.This instituted imaginary ‘carries with it the normative social meanings, customs, expectations, assumptions, values, prohibitions, and permissions—the habitus and ethos—into which human beings are nurtured from childhood and which they internaliz</context>

This radical re-conceptualisation of democracy means that ‘democracy recognizes no external limits to its instituting power; the sole limits result from its self-limitation’ (Castoriadis, n.d. b, p. 151).The criteria of this self-limitation are not pre-formed but worked out as we keep on discussing our musical thinking.The teacher is not applying pre-established criteria but works with the students on the basis of what they are making. Listen to John Paynter (2000): We are not imparting received techniques because what is presented to us did not exist until the pupil(s) invented it. Of course, there are bound to have been influences—all the music the pupils have ever heard, and their musical preferences: what they think of as ‘music’—but even if it is derivative, what they produce is what they have made, and to do that they had to take decisions. By focusing on those decisions, and by pressing students to discover as much as possible about why they have made the music as it is (‘I just like it like that’ is not good enough!), we start them on the path o</context>

The subsumption of creativity under a rationale that deprives it of political and social dimensions conceals the possibility that creative action might involve (social) critique, that it might be a manifestation of a critical attitude. This in turn rests on an age-old division between theoretical critique—reserved for the realm of philosophy—and action. Within the field of music education, various research approaches and practical applications place great emphasis on the development of children’s creativity (Brophy, 2002; Dolan, 2005; Hickey, 2003a, 2001a, 2001b; Kratus, 1995; Paananen, 2006; Swanwick &amp; Tillman, 1986; Swanwick &amp; Cavalieri-Franca, 1999;Tafuri, 2006;Walduck, 2005). Many of those approaches, however, fall under the continuous and sweeping deluge of psychologising educational encounters. According to Gur &amp; Wiley (2009) ‘psychologization (Apple, 1996) refers to the way in which psychological issues become centralized in theoretical discussions, evacuating critical (including political, philosophic, and societal) issues’19 (p. 308).

In accordance with this rationale,Thurstone (1964) sought to establish criteria for ‘the Selection of Scientific Talent’ (p. 10). Hyman (1964) dealt with the question of ‘under which conditions does information help you to be creative?’ (p. 69).Torrance (1964) developed verbal and nonverbal tests for identifying and evaluating children’s creativity. Drevdahl (1964) attempted to identify environmental factors which contribute to the development of creative individuals.

Talking about the concept of institution, Castoriadis put the matter differently: he talked about the primal institution of society, ‘the fact that society creates itself as society’ (2007c, p. 100) and the second-order institutions through which it ‘articulates and implements itself ’ (ibid.). These second order institutions (my ‘b’ in the main body of the text) are divided into transhistorical (e.g. language) and specific, that is, tied to particular socio-historical contexts—e.g. the Athenian polis (Kagan, 1990; Mossé, 1971), public open concerts (see ch. 2 of DeNora, 1995; also McVeigh, 2004), the musical-work concept as a regulatory organisational principle of musical production and reception (see Goehr, 1992), or experimental performances (whose conceptual trajectory is masterfully sketched by Goehr, 2008). 22.

Castoriadis revisited Athenian democracy, the Freudian unconscious, Marxian praxis, and Kantian autonomy, producing a novel theory of autonomy which sought to overcome the weaknesses of the traditional concepts of (liberal) democracy, subjectivity, political praxis and liberal conceptions of (rational) autonomy. As Andreas Kalyvas (1998, p. 163) notes, From Marx, Castoriadis preserved the emancipatory project of the revolutionary transformation of society and the radical intuition that history is open and indeterminate, susceptible to the struggle and creative action of self-organized collective actors. From Freud, he appropriated the extraordinary discovery of the unconscious, which he developed into a theory of the radical imagination as the source of genuine historical creation, thereby cleansing it of the reductionist and positivistic tendencies found in traditional psychoanalysis.

Autonomy is itself a creation, one that seeks to move beyond essentialism while permitting the possibility of limitless critique of one’s own foundations, resisting postmodern inclinations towards the collapse of the possibility of critique altogether. Castoriadis aimed at an ‘explicit and emphatic understanding of the concept of autonomy as a normative criterion with which one judges, criticizes, and chooses between different institutional structures and practices. ... His concept of autonomy emerges precisely as a viable response to the aporias of critical thought’ (Kalyvas, 1998, p. 165). At this point an important clarification parenthesis is necessary. From the arguments presented so far and from what will follow in the remainder on the paper, it is clear that Castoriadis’ conception of autonomy cannot be further away from neoliberal notions of ‘autonomous chooser’ (Marshall, 1996a), as well as from the way autonomy is understood by liberal philosophers of education—i.e. as an advancement towards independent rationality, e.g. R. F. Dearden,16 or R. S. Peters (see Olssen, 2006)—or educational theorists (e.g. Levinson, 1999; Reich, 2002). Liberal conceptions of auton</context>

Elaborating on this definition Castoriadis explains that ‘I call these significations imaginary because they do not correspond to, or are not exhausted by, references to “rational” or “real” elements and because it is through a creation that they are posited. And I call them social because they are and they exist only if they are instituted and shared by an impersonal, anonymous collective’ (1997a, p. 8). Commenting on Habermas’ (1987) critique of Castoriadis’ concept of social imaginary signification, Kalyvas (1998, p. 177) notes that ‘Habermas purposefully bypasses Castoriadis’s advice to read the social imaginary as “not a substance, not a quality, not an action or a passion”, [Castoriadis, 1987a, p. 369] but “as the invisible cement holding together this endless collection of real, rational, and symbolic odds and ends that constitute every society, and as the principle that selects and shapes the bits and pieces that will be accepted there” [Castoriadis, 1987a, p. 143]’. 6.

On this matter see also chapter 7 of Lucy Green’s Music on Deaf Ears (1988), and Peter Martin’s latest book (2006) especially pp. 33–36. 27. Kalyvas (1998, p. 177) has noted that ‘The originality of Castoriadis’s version of political autonomy ... consists in its attempt to transcend both liberal theories of individual, moral self-determination and postmodern discourses of the “death of autonomy.” ... Castoriadis has sought to retrieve the emancipatory content of modernity, renewing interest in a postmetaphysical, decentered notion of collective self-institution as the core of radical democratic politics’. 28.

Here I am primarily referring to studies of students’ musical creative endeavours which aim at creating hierarchies between children of high and low creativity (Hickey, 2001b), assessing improvisational skills and their development as measurable competencies, ‘clean’ of all social influences (Kiehn, 2007), using tests to measure children’s creative ‘aptitude’ (e.g. Webster’s Measure of Creative Thinking in Music (MCTM-II), see Hickey, 2001b; Webster, 162 Panagiotis A.

The subsumption of creativity under a rationale that deprives it of political and social dimensions conceals the possibility that creative action might involve (social) critique, that it might be a manifestation of a critical attitude. This in turn rests on an age-old division between theoretical critique—reserved for the realm of philosophy—and action. Within the field of music education, various research approaches and practical applications place great emphasis on the development of children’s creativity (Brophy, 2002; Dolan, 2005; Hickey, 2003a, 2001a, 2001b; Kratus, 1995; Paananen, 2006; Swanwick &amp; Tillman, 1986; Swanwick &amp; Cavalieri-Franca, 1999;Tafuri, 2006;Walduck, 2005). Many of those approaches, however, fall under the continuous and sweeping deluge of psychologising educational encounters. According to Gur &amp; Wiley (2009) ‘psychologization (Apple, 1996) refers to the way in which psychological issues become centralized in theoretical discussions, evacuating critical (including political, philosophic, and societal) issues’19 (p. 308).

Blind but purposeful iconoclasm is an alternative curriculum strategy. First know yourself, then confront the canon—that way, at least, you might have developed some armour of your own. (Kushner, 2004, p. 217) I argue that a conceptualisation of musical creativity through this perspective holds the promise of inspiring socially responsible musical action: it is in and through creative musical praxis25 that we can think about issues of hierarchies, musical values, social dimensions of different music-making processes, our relationship to past values and to historical dimensions of music.

Conclusion It has been argued that Castoriadis’ notion of autonomy might be a fertile theoretical perspective that helps us to propose a conception of artistic autonomy that goes beyond both Adornian conceptions of autonomy—with their insistence ‘that society is ... “inscribed” within art works’ (Paddison, 1993, p. 262)—and ‘the nineteenth century aestheticism as institutionalized autonomy’ (Martin, 2000, p. 201)—both conceptions lead to ahistorical and fetishised views of music-making.26 Moreover, Castoriadis’ conception of autonomy breaks away from the dominant conception of western philosophical tradition that sees autonomy as the result of rationality; it also breaks away from the connection of creativity with divine inspiration, and of psychological conceptions of creativity as a ‘technology’ of problem solving.27 An educational culture that connects its work to the project of autonomy encourages self-constitution of practices, as well as the creation of values and meanings without refer</context>

Talking about the concept of institution, Castoriadis put the matter differently: he talked about the primal institution of society, ‘the fact that society creates itself as society’ (2007c, p. 100) and the second-order institutions through which it ‘articulates and implements itself ’ (ibid.). These second order institutions (my ‘b’ in the main body of the text) are divided into transhistorical (e.g. language) and specific, that is, tied to particular socio-historical contexts—e.g. the Athenian polis (Kagan, 1990; Mossé, 1971), public open concerts (see ch. 2 of DeNora, 1995; also McVeigh, 2004), the musical-work concept as a regulatory organisational principle of musical production and reception (see Goehr, 1992), or experimental performances (whose conceptual trajectory is masterfully sketched by Goehr, 2008). 22.

(Butler, 2005, p. 5, emphasis added) An explicit link could be drawn between the violence of imposing obsolete codes of morality with the aim of supposedly restoring what is thought of as the lost moral bonds of (largely mythical) collectives, and the enforcement of disciplinary/authoritarian logics in educational practice, as well as the imposition of unifying narratives pertaining to music history, the universality of the aesthetic and music education’s scope, goals and values (Bergeron, 1992; Bowman, 2003; Morton, 2005). Another important strand of this trajectory of emancipation relates to the question of the legitimacy of raising the question of the relation between politics and education, and of bringing political considerations within the realm of education.This issue has opened once and for all, with education being a field of public life where important political issues are being debated.Let me only remind you of the highly informative debate between Ralph Ellison and Hannah Arendt concerning the Little Rock case.11 The open questioning of schools alleged neutrality should be seen as part of a larger c</context>

This old debate is not at all outdated (for a recent attempt to answer to Arendt’s 50-year-old paper see Nakata, 2008), as the issues raised then are still with us in a variety of contexts, sometimes in even more dramatic ways. 12.

Peters (2009) proposes a conceptual map for understanding the process of educational appropriation of conceptions of creativity and their correspondence with particular facets of contemporary capitalism that is different from the one suggested here.

He was always looking for moments and processes of rupture, for processes of ‘liquidating the old significations, and perhaps creating new ones’ (1991e, p. 205). Women’s silent struggle for emancipation is a characteristic example mentioned by Castoriadis, 1991e, pp. 204–205), for political praxis that occurs ‘first, “without foundations” ... and second, without the “authority” or credentials of traditional institutions or theory’ (Naranch, 2002, p. 72). This germ has been located at various historical moments, from Athenian democracy (Castoriadis, 1991b) to the open discussions held in Sorbonne auditoriums during the events of May 1968 (Castoriadis, 1987b).7 This is what permits us to proceed into examining the possibility of viewing the process of musical creativity as emerges through composing and improvising as a potential locus of the germ of autonomy.

Within the field of music education, various research approaches and practical applications place great emphasis on the development of children’s creativity (Brophy, 2002; Dolan, 2005; Hickey, 2003a, 2001a, 2001b; Kratus, 1995; Paananen, 2006; Swanwick &amp; Tillman, 1986; Swanwick &amp; Cavalieri-Franca, 1999;Tafuri, 2006;Walduck, 2005). Many of those approaches, however, fall under the continuous and sweeping deluge of psychologising educational encounters. According to Gur &amp; Wiley (2009) ‘psychologization (Apple, 1996) refers to the way in which psychological issues become centralized in theoretical discussions, evacuating critical (including political, philosophic, and societal) issues’19 (p. 308).

Envisioning Autonomy through Improvising and Composing 167 © 2010 The Author Educational Philosophy and Theory © 2010 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia 5. Conclusion It has been argued that Castoriadis’ notion of autonomy might be a fertile theoretical perspective that helps us to propose a conception of artistic autonomy that goes beyond both Adornian conceptions of autonomy—with their insistence ‘that society is ... “inscribed” within art works’ (Paddison, 1993, p. 262)—and ‘the nineteenth century aestheticism as institutionalized autonomy’ (Martin, 2000, p. 201)—both conceptions lead to ahistorical and fetishised views of music-making.26 Moreover, Castoriadis’ conception of autonomy breaks away from the dominant conception of western philosophical tradition that sees autonomy as the result of rationality; it also breaks away from the connection of creativity with divine inspiration, and of psychological conceptions of creativity as a ‘technology’ of problem solving.27 An educational culture that connects its work to the project of autonomy encourag</context>

It is generalized conformism’ (2007d, p. 126; see also 1997b, p. 43). It is exactly because of current trivialization of ‘openness’ that we need to resist the deluge of neutralisation. In the field of music education we need to resist to the neutralisation of the subversive potential of radical music education movements that sought to liberate music education from anachronistic practices and to transform education into a way of enabling children to experience ‘[m]usic as a model of possibility’ (Paynter, 2000, p. 24). As a means of resistance to conformism and neutralisation, this paper suggests a reconceptualisation of musical creativity as a deeply social and political form of human praxis. After presenting a general scheme for contextualising the pursuit of the concept of musical creativity within a larger educational and societal context of conflicting trajectories, we revisit the notions of improvising and composing through creating conceptual links between the process of music-making through improvisation and composition and the project of political autonomy as conceived by Castoriadis.2 Thi</context>

This radical re-conceptualisation of democracy means that ‘democracy recognizes no external limits to its instituting power; the sole limits result from its self-limitation’ (Castoriadis, n.d. b, p. 151).The criteria of this self-limitation are not pre-formed but worked out as we keep on discussing our musical thinking.The teacher is not applying pre-established criteria but works with the students on the basis of what they are making. Listen to John Paynter (2000): We are not imparting received techniques because what is presented to us did not exist until the pupil(s) invented it. Of course, there are bound to have been influences—all the music the pupils have ever heard, and their musical preferences: what they think of as ‘music’—but even if it is derivative, what they produce is what they have made, and to do that they had to take decisions. By focusing on those decisions, and by pressing students to discover as much as possible about why they have made the music as it is (‘I just like it like that’ is not good enough!), we start them on the path o</context>

Just as political autonomy aims at creating new legitimacies—being ‘a search concerning what law I ought (we ought) to adopt’ (Castoriadis, 1997f, p. 340)—, so musical improvisation and composition can be seen as a process which creates new ways of coming to grip with the question: how should we make music? Discussions and critical questioning that are based on the students’ own work ‘will encourage them to think for themselves about what sounds right and why it might be considered to be so, and to know that they have only themselves to convince’ (Paynter, 2000, p. 20). This question should be regarded, in this context, as fundamentally open; it does not lead to definitive answers and therefore establishes a new relationship with musical tradition. Involvement in composing and listening might lead to the creation of a different, critical, non-submissive and creative relationship with musics of other people, places, times and cultures. A heteronomous relationship to tradition means that ‘the question of the legitimacy of tradition shall not be raised’ (Castoriadis, 1991d, p. 163).

Ralph Ellison argued that what Arendt had fatally failed to see was that ‘the black parents in Little Rock were instilling in their children an “ideal of sacrifice” necessary to move the nation forward on its quest for true democracy’ (Warren, 2003, p. 159). This old debate is not at all outdated (for a recent attempt to answer to Arendt’s 50-year-old paper see Nakata, 2008), as the issues raised then are still with us in a variety of contexts, sometimes in even more dramatic ways. 12. In a recent paper, Michael A. Peters (2009) proposes a conceptual map for understanding the process of educational appropriation of conceptions of creativity and their correspondence with particular facets of contemporary capitalism that is different from the one suggested here. Peters argues that the educational appropriation of Romantic conceptions of creativity corresponds to the need for cultivating qualities relevant to the ‘risk-taking entrepreneur’ (p. 40), whereas more recent, relational, distributed, socio-cultural conceptions correspond ‘to the “network” that now animates all forms and emerging genres of electronic textual en</context>

It is one thing to seek to learn how children think rhythmically in various contexts and quite another to aim at producing universalist claims about of rhythmic development cut off from any meaningful way of making music. Claiming that a ‘major development at the dimensional stage (about 5–11 years) happens in the hierarchical relations of musical event structure’ (ibid. p. 366) rests on the belief that ‘music can be studied adequately by reducing it to sequences of pitch and rhythm, devoid of the other conditions that make music “music” ’ (Regelski, 1996, p. 6). Similar problems can be identified in efforts to standardise assessment criteria and procedures and apply them for different purposes. Here I am primarily referring to studies of students’ musical creative endeavours which aim at creating hierarchies between children of high and low creativity (Hickey, 2001b), assessing improvisational skills and their development as measurable competencies, ‘clean’ of all social influences (Kiehn, 2007), using tests to measure children’s creative ‘aptitude’ (e.g. Webster’s Measure of Creative Thinking in Music (MCTM-II), see Hickey, 2001b; Webster, 1</context>

What is more, such ways of creative engagement might be seen as working against the pervasive nihilism that dominates music education. Here I am referring to all three variants of nihilism (negative, reactive and passive) explored by Bowman (2005). Improvisation and composition counter negative nihilism by affirming the here-and-now, resist reactive nihilism by countering technocratic instrumentalism, and subvert passive nihilism by fostering autonomous judgement and personal commitment. Against the normative discourse of music psychology and its pervasive influence on music ‘methods’ (Regelski, 2002), the dogmatism of advocacy, and the sweeping power of positivism and scientism which ‘have become ideological touchstones for a profession anxious to substantiate its dignity and credibility among the behavioral sciences’ (Bowman, p. 2005, p. 31), this paper tried to propose a critical perspective on improvisation and composition and their relevance to education, which seeks to establish conceptual relations between music-making and personal and social autonomy in ways that unsettle traditional conceptions of music-making, of creativity, and of how music education might initiate students’ thi</context>

At this point an important clarification parenthesis is necessary. From the arguments presented so far and from what will follow in the remainder on the paper, it is clear that Castoriadis’ conception of autonomy cannot be further away from neoliberal notions of ‘autonomous chooser’ (Marshall, 1996a), as well as from the way autonomy is understood by liberal philosophers of education—i.e. as an advancement towards independent rationality, e.g. R. F. Dearden,16 or R. S. Peters (see Olssen, 2006)—or educational theorists (e.g. Levinson, 1999; Reich, 2002). Liberal conceptions of autonomy as an educational goal presuppose that the notion of the individual, of the relationship between individual and society, and of rational mastery, are understood in ways that differ radically from those employed by Castoriadis.17 Employing a Foucaultian perspective, Marshall (1995, 1996b), Fitzsimons (2002), Olssen (2006), and Devine and Irwin (2006) offer a devastating critique of what could be called ‘the autonomous chooser fallacy’: ‘what is presupposed in the notion of the “autonomous chooser”, says Marshall, is that the notion of autonomy needed to make ch</context>

Despite its merits, it seems to me that this account conflates Romantic conceptions of creativity with psychological positivist notions, and moreover, does not do justice to the possible subversive potential of sociocultural approaches to creativity that could emerge out of sociocultural perspectives such as those developed by Matusov, St. Julien, Lacasa &amp; Alburquerque Candela (2007), Matusov &amp; St. Julien (2004), Shotter (2001), and Shotter &amp; Billig (1998). Further dialogue is needed, but this lies beyond the scope of the present paper. 13. See, for example Charlotte Gardner’s (2008) article in the BBC Music Magazine, which laments the declining of standards in music exams in the UK, as well as Richard Morrison’s (2008) follow-up commentary in the same journal. In a masterfully populist manner Morrison argues against the ‘disaster in the making’ that has been caused by ‘the tide of “relativism” (the notion that studying Radiohead, for instance, is as good as studying Beethoven) and of child-centred learning (the the</context>

It must be noted that Castoriadis’ thought has not, to my knowledge, entered music education theoretical explorations—the only published reference to Castoriadis within music education literature is a passing one (Aróstegui, 2004, p. 189). To my knowledge, the only exception is Stergios Loustas’ MA thesis (2004), which constitutes the first important reference to the possibility of researching musical improvisation through Castoriadis’ notion of autonomy. 4. Castoriadis’ strict separation between the two has not gone unchallenged. For example, Karl E. Smith (2009) argues that Castoriadis’ understanding of the social historical as entailing ontological plurality is negated by his strictly polarised view of modernity as constituted by the simultaneous presence of these two mutually incompatible projects—autonomy and rational mastery—and attempts to offer a pluralistic, rather than a polarised view of modernity. Although the starting point of this approach is theoretically interesting, in my view Smith excessively smoothes out Castoriadis’ conception ‘[t]he unlimited expansion of “rational” mastery’ so as to be able to work in favour of autonomy. 5.

The idea that penetrated a large part of research about creativity during the fifties and the sixties is eloquently manifested in the following statement: ‘America must treasure and foster all the creative ability that she has in her’ (Toynbee, 1964, p. 9). This, as well as the title of the text from which it has been taken—‘Is America Neglecting Her Creative Minority?’—, are indicative of the core beliefs of a whole generation of researchers: creativity is a trait of certain individuals, which results in the production of valuable ideas, solutions or inventions; it may manifest itself in every domain of practical life; it is desirable for it assists societal progress; it is identifiable, provided that one defines certain criteria and employs experimental methodologies; it can be fostered by a stimulating environment, and therefore it ca</context>

In an earlier study, I have tried to draw certain analogies between the experience of free improvisation and the notion of political and communicative action as developed by Hannah Arendt in The Human Condition (1998[1958]) (Kanellopoulos, 2007).

It is titled ‘The democracy of the aesthetic’. With excessive as much as unfounded confidence and in a deceptively antirhetoric jargon the article informs us that currently ‘we are experiencing the democracy of the aesthetic’ (Tsimelas, 2008, p. 6); appreciation of style thrives, as everyone demands to be surrounded by beautiful, smart and intelligently designed objects. The message is simple and abundantly clear, leaving me wondering where I had been when all this happened. From now on, whoever wants to sell should work hard producing masterpieces of creative advertising which satisfy the high aesthetic standards of the consumersparticipants of this democratically-spread aesthetic, and (I would add), comply to the imaginary significations which permeate the regime on which this democratic dissemination of ‘the aesthetic’ is root</context>

Political philosopher and activist Cornelius Castoriadis (1922–1997) has aptly described this state of affairs as ‘an immense social-historical current that is heading in this direction and that is making everything become insignificant’ (n.d. b, p. 131). Castoriadis noted that ‘the word revolutionary—like the words creation and imagination—has become an advertising slogan; this is what a few years ago was called cooptation’ (Castoriadis, ibid., p. 131). This phenomenon goes hand in hand with the gradual retreat of the public sphere; as PaoloVirno (2004) has noted, the modern world experiences a gradual disappearance of the public sphere, with political action being dissolved into an ineffective form of labour: ‘political action now seems, in a disastrous way, like some superfluous duplication of the experience of labor’ (p. 51) and has been subsumed under what Castoriadis called ‘the capitalist-bureaucratic structure of society’ (2007d, pp. 133–134).

Ralph Ellison argued that what Arendt had fatally failed to see was that ‘the black parents in Little Rock were instilling in their children an “ideal of sacrifice” necessary to move the nation forward on its quest for true democracy’ (Warren, 2003, p. 159). This old debate is not at all outdated (for a recent attempt to answer to Arendt’s 50-year-old paper see Nakata, 2008), as the issues raised then are still with us in a variety of contexts, sometimes in even more dramatic ways. 12.
