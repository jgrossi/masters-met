In addition, the Housewright Declaration (Madsen, 2000) supported the inclusion of all types of music, stating, “All music has a place in the curriculum. Not only does the Western art tradition need to be preserved and disseminated” (p. 219). However, it is difficult for music teachers to actively introduce those unfamiliar musical styles into the music curriculum without understanding the musical tradition through research, such as reading, performing, or listening (Campbell, 2004). In addition, music teachers also need access to high-quality multicultural materials that provide an appropriate strategy of how to teach those distinctive characteristics (McCarthy, 1997). This would be an important issue because in teaching music from unfamiliar cultures to students in the classroom, instructors should incorporate not only the musical style itself but also the way the music is taught within that culture (Senders &amp; Davidson, 2000).

For example, when the four triple beats comprise one jangdan of 12 beats, this jangdan becomes a symmetrical pattern in 12/8 meter. Figure 3 presents musical excerpts of the symmetrical 12-beat jangdan from the Sam-chae percussion ensemble piece (Howard, 1992). However, the different allocation of duple and triple beats can often comprise one jangdan. Although the jangdan generally remains as a 12-beat cycle, as different sets of duple or triple beats combine up to 12 beats, it sounds asymmetrical. The musical excerpt in Figure 4 is from the same percussion ensemble piece, Sam-chae (Choi, 2000, p. 140). It sounds irregular because of the different allocation of 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3. The different allocations can happen across more than one jangdan cycle. Figure 5, drawn from a Korean folk instrumental piece (Moon, 1989), presents an example of the asymmetric allocation of rhythm sets occurring within the two cycles of 12-beat jangdans across 24 beats; this process exaggerates its rhythmic asymmetry to listeners.

Most Korean musical pieces, including both art and folk music, have rhythmic cycles that underpin the entirety of the music. This rhythmic cycle is called jangdan, literally meaning “long and short.” Jangdan consists of small rhythm sets of duple or triple beats that comprise either symmetrical or asymmetrical patterns (Lee, 1997).

Figure 6, excerpted from another Korean percussion piece titled Chil-chae, is the longest rhythmic pattern that consists of 36 beats. As shown in Figure 6, this 36-beat jangdan could also be divided into sets in this manner: 5 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5. Moreover, it could be further subdivided into 5 (3 + 2) + 5 (3 + 2) + 6 (3 + 3) + 5 (3 + 2) + 5 (3 + 2) + 5 (3 + 2). Therefore, the long asymmetrical jangdan creates smaller jangdans within a larger one. Traditionally, in Korea, aural and oral transmission has been a major means of teaching and learning music.

The more a cycle is repeated, the more elaboration and spontaneity take place by subdividing beats and adding the micro beats of ornamentation; variation on the basic pattern is unlimited (Choi, 2000). Moreover, along with this procedure, the tempo is gradually accelerated until performers and audiences reach their musical and emotional peak (Choi, 2000). In this Figure 5.

Not only does the Western art tradition need to be preserved and disseminated” (p. 219). However, it is difficult for music teachers to actively introduce those unfamiliar musical styles into the music curriculum without understanding the musical tradition through research, such as reading, performing, or listening (Campbell, 2004). In addition, music teachers also need access to high-quality multicultural materials that provide an appropriate strategy of how to teach those distinctive characteristics (McCarthy, 1997). This would be an important issue because in teaching music from unfamiliar cultures to students in the classroom, instructors should incorporate not only the musical style itself but also the way the music is taught within that culture (Senders &amp; Davidson, 2000). The purpose of this article is to introduce the characteristics of Korean rhythmic patterns and provide effective ways to teach Korean rhythms in the general music classroom setting. Since Korea has 5,000 years of history, Koreans have developed their own musical tradition. Most musical characteristics are well preserved and have be</context>

Traditionally, in Korea, aural and oral transmission has been a major means of teaching and learning music. Korea has developed its unique notational systems; but because of the already broad scope of this article, they will not be explained in detail. Korean notational systems have not been considered as reliable a source of critical musical information as Western music. Instead, a notational system has been devised to help musicians remember or recall a lesson, or to preserve and conserve the music (Campbell, 1991a; Paek, 2007). Following the example of Korean folk music tradition, in this article, the structure of the rhythmic patterns is described in terms of Western rhythm and Western rhythmic notation in order to help readers who are educators remember or recall a lesson or to preserve and conserve the rhythmic patterns they want to teach. However, it is advisable not to use notation when teaching students.

Most Korean musical pieces, including both art and folk music, have rhythmic cycles that underpin the entirety of the music. This rhythmic cycle is called jangdan, literally meaning “long and short.” Jangdan consists of small rhythm sets of duple or triple beats that comprise either symmetrical or asymmetrical patterns (Lee, 1997). There are two ways in which jangdan has been used in the Korean music tradition. In the first case, jangdan serves as a major means of accompanying music. Regardless of vocal or instrumental music, a cycle is repeated for a whole section, similar to the Western co</context>

Adopting an oral and aural teaching process is a recommendable way to help students grasp and perform musical structures when teaching Korean rhythms. Students can practice oral and aural transmission with the use of gu-em presented under Western notation in the example of chil-chae in Figure 7. Gu-em are Korean verbal syllables of music, and it literally means “mouth tone.” Gu-em is an effective tool to aid learners in memorizing music, since in this manner, some folk music is transmitted from generation to generation in Korea (So, 2002). With the nuance and strength of each phoneme, gu-em provides a sense of rhythmic length and dynamics to practitioners; in this way, it resembles Kodaly rhythm syllables. For example, as shown in Figure 7, kkwdanggwari gu-em indicates the long and strong beat as “gan” and the short and weak beat as “ji.” Therefore, if learners verbalize this gu-em, they could acquire rhythmic structure and could be able to play the music accordingly. Gu-em primarily imitates the sounds of each instrument (So, 2002); each syllable in the words “gan ji,” “dung de,” gung gu,” and “jing” represents the instrument</context>
