This is possible in a general music class when the curriculum content is connected to the creative work and the creative work is an outgrowth of and support to the curriculum content. Sequentially organized curriculum—building on children’s former knowledge and understandings and guiding them in their understanding from uncomplicated concepts to the complex—is another key to effective, organized teaching and learning. Boardman (2001) and Bruner (1960/2006) have advised educators on the importance of keeping this in mind when planning instruction: emphasis in building on students’ former knowledge to advance it. Vygotsky (1934/1986) believed that schemas of understanding are formed in the mind and influenced by sociocultural settings. The schemas of understanding that are created under informal learning settings such as in the home combine with understandings learned in formal learning settings like the school resulting in new schemas of understanding. Social interactions with teachers, adults and peers play a significant </context>

Sternberg found that teaching students for successful intelligence, that is, according to his triarchic theory of teaching and learning, involved analytical, creative and applied practical aspects of thinking that raised students’ levels of achievement. Composing involves analytical, creative, and practical kinds of thinking as well as an interactive synthesis of these. It is possible for students to develop domain knowledge in music and creative thinking in music for the most part simultaneously when students are given opportunities to apply what they are learning in creative ways (Guderian, 2008). For those who are used to designing curriculum and daily planning according to “Bloom’s Taxonomy of Learning Domains” (1999), improvising and composing engage students in the cognitive processes of remembering; understanding; exploration; experimentation; application of learned knowledge, analyzing, evaluating, synthesizing, and creating. Students develop in the affective domain of learning in many ways while composing: through the making of choices required regarding personal expression through sound manipulation; at times through social interactions and group choices, and through social in</context>

In total, 66 students who received instruction with emphasis on improvisation were able to outperform students who did not receive the instruction in improvisation. In a study with fifth-grade children who had no previous instruction in reading music and recorder playing, Guderian (2008) taught the same sequentially organized curriculum to two sections of students. The amount of time spent on instruction and in follow up to the instruction was equal for the two groups and the curriculum was the same. To develop playing ability, instruction began with rote learning in the areas of recorder playing that supported the development of psychomotor skills for playing; such as, learning new fingerings, blowing techniques, and so on, in relation to cognitive understandings of pitch, pattern, and particular tones. These were learned via an interactive, echo-pattern-playing activity mod</context>

However, as follow up to instruction, one group—the experimental group—was given applied creative assignments in improvisation and composition. An assignment consisted of an open-ended framework of criteria for composing a piece that required application of the concepts, notation, and skills learned during the whole group instruction. The children were given the option of working alone or in pairs on the assignment, and they could move about the room to share their compositions with other students (play their piece for a friend or have a friend play the piece). Guderian (2008) circulated throughout the experimental group of children showing interest in the students’ work and providing help when asked or needed. The other group of children—the control group—was given an assignment to practice the new pieces three to four times and to review and reinforce the new terms and concepts they had learned that day. The control group also sight-read additional pre-created pieces at the same level of difficulty as the pieces that were presented during the whole group instruction to both groups. These were teacher-directed activities blended with child-centered instructional s</context>

Would you like to find the music for the baby on this instrument?” Further inquiry regarding different associations (a thunder storm, a giant walking, etc.) and explorations on additional instruments would lead children to understanding loud in music and other dynamic levels. “Can you make some music that would sound like a parade that is far, far away coming closer and closer to us? How do you think it would sound?” Depending on the age of the children, the small cursive p as a musical symbol for playing or singing softly would eventually be incorporated into the learning activities (Guderian, 2008, 2009a, 2010). For older children in fourth or fifth grade who would likely already have learned many of the dynamic markings, an assignment in dynamics might engage children in the interplay of problem solving tasks that require convergent thinking (based on what they have already learned) and divergent thinking (examining many possibilities for decision making) by first having the students listen for dynamic levels in musical examples followed by having the students add dynamics to a piece they had previously written or learned. Additional group activities could include the learning or comp</context>

As part of the assignment, they would be asked to determine dynamics for the new piece(s). “Write in the dynamics where you think they should go and then practice the music the way you have marked it.” Reflection questions could be, “Did you like your music better with or without the dynamics? What happens to the music when we add dynamics? How does the music make you feel with dynamics added: without the dynamics?” (Guderian, 2008, 2009a, 2010) In the above scenarios, the teacher is helping students to both discover and add to conceptual knowledge and understandings and to develop creative thinking. The processes as described above reinforce both by having the children apply what they have learned in creative ways. Small cursive f means to play or sing loudly is a fact: a cultural tool necessary for effective music reading, performing, creating, and sharing in Western music practices. Loud, very loud, very soft, are also factual, conceptual understandings learned from cultural others. The application of the cultural to</context>

Students at this age appreciate the connection of their studies and skill building to real-life music making (Hoffer, 2001; Regelski, 2004).

Guderian’s (2008) and Miller’s (2004) studies support the idea that even in school settings where time is limited for general music, the development of musical skills, understanding and creative thinking in music can be part of an interwoven teaching and learning process and potentially a way to address all areas of a comprehensive, standardsbased curriculum. In working with older students, Loane (1984) wrote that each composition was a learning experience for his students. The process of composing resulted not only in a product (composition) but also in a new level of understanding and knowledge. Just as the problem solving process of creative story writing helped one realize, clarify, organize, and discover thoughts and ideas, so did the problem solving process of composing—experimentation, exploration, manipulation, and organization of sounds— help his students to advance in their musicianship and to realize, clarify, organize, and discover thoughts, ideas, and feelings of human conscious</context>

Opportunities for creative work—in this case, assignments in music composition and improvisation, directly related to conceptual learning in the classroom— embedded into the curriculum can make this possible and effect students’ learning (Guderian, 2003, 2008). Including improvising and composing activities as a natural outgrowth of an interrelated and interactive curriculum aligns with many theories of learning. As early as the 19th century, Swiss educator Johann Pestalozzi (Mark &amp; Gary, 1999) recognized that education should involve the learning, applying, and practicing of concepts in support of each other, not as components of learning to be addressed separately. There should be a bringing together of things that were related to each other. John Dewey’s (1900/1990) vision included a teaching and learning environment in which the individual was allowed to explore and pursue his or her interests and capabilities. He believed that the child has four interests: (a) that of conversation or communication, (b) that of inquiry, Articles at UNIV FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS on June 12, 2015gm</context>

Support From Research Several researcher-teachers have found that providing students with opportunities to apply their understandings and skills in music through composition has an effect on students’ learning and development in music. Upitis (1992) found that allowing children to construct their own knowledge through the process of sound exploration, manipulation of musical elements, and creations of figural notations as important to meaningful learning in music; essential to development in musical understanding and necessary when working with young children. Miller (2004) found that giving her students in elementary general music classes composition assignments allowed her to observe what each of her students understood from class learnings in curriculum content. In a very natural way, composing engaged each child in personal accountability for showing what he or she had learned from class instruction and activities. Miller had a maximum of 40 minutes per week with her students. She found that composition assignments allowed her students to work at their own level of understanding more than any other music learning activity that was part of class studies. Thro</context>

Inclusion of improvising and composing in an interconnected curriculum can enable teachers in providing a comprehensive standards-based music education for their students even under limited amounts of time that are often given for music classes in the school schedule. Reimer (2003) recommended a comprehensive music curriculum to develop all of the multiple intelligences of music students 415404 GMT25310.1177/10483713 11415404GuderianGeneral Music Today 1University of Wisconsin–Superior, Superior, WI, USA Corresponding Author: Lois Veenhoven Guderian, University of Wisconsin–Superior, 1117 HFAC Belknap and Catlin, Box 2000, Superior, WI 54880, USA Email: lguderia@uwsuper.edu Music Improvisation and Composition in the General Music Curriculum Lois Veenhoven Guderian1 Abstract This article describes an approach to general music where assignments in music improvisation and </context>

Torrance realized the importance of developing creative potential and thinking rather than simply the diligent acquisition of knowledge. It was learning how to use knowledge in applied, creative ways that would ultimately have an effect on the quality of human life. “Children can be taught to use creative thinking abilities in acquiring even traditional learnings” (Torrance, 1963, p. 7). As applied to music education, Reimer (2003) supported this idea in suggesting the cultivation of the interdependence of technique and creativity right from the start with students. From the very first moments of sound-expressing in performance, and sound-imaging in composition, and imagining-expressing in improvisation, the need for technique as the servant of creativity becomes obvious: you can’t do what you want to do—make music—unless you have the wherewithal to do so. The goal, the point, the purpose, is to make music— that is, to create sounds that satisfy as only music can. That is what needs to drive our instruction: the search </context>

Social interactions with teachers, adults and peers play a significant role in the child’s learning. Research in brain function as applied to teaching and learning supports the importance of learning information in context and drawing from and building on students’ current levels of understanding when trying to engage children in learning (Bransford, Brown, &amp; Cocking, 2000). According to Torrance (1963), “The creative challenge to education of the future is not only to provide environments where children can learn, but can learn how to think” (p. 4).

The results from specific classroom assessments support the benefits of including these activities in general music. Support From Research Several researcher-teachers have found that providing students with opportunities to apply their understandings and skills in music through composition has an effect on students’ learning and development in music. Upitis (1992) found that allowing children to construct their own knowledge through the process of sound exploration, manipulation of musical elements, and creations of figural notations as important to meaningful learning in music; essential to development in musical understanding and necessary when working with young children. Miller (2004) found that giving her students in elementary general music classes composition assignments allowed her to observe what each of her students understood from class learnings in curriculum content. In a very natural way, composing engaged each child in personal accountab</context>
