			<abstract>
				<p>This study is concerned with the question whether, and to what extent, listeners' previous exposure to music in everyday life, and expertise as a result of formal musical training, play a role in making expressive timing judgments in music. This was investigated by using a Web-based listening experiment in which listeners with a wide range of musical backgrounds were asked to compare 2 recordings of the same composition (15 pairs, grouped in 3 musical genres), 1 of which was tempo-transformed (manipulating the expressive timing). The results show that expressive timing judgments are not so much influenced by expertise levels, as is suggested by the expertise hypothesis, but by exposure to a certain musical idiom, as is suggested by the exposure hypothesis. As such, the current study provides evidence for the idea that some musical capabilities are acquired through mere exposure to music, and that these abilities are more likely enhanced by active listening (exposure) than by formal musical training (expertise).</p>

Although some older studies argue that musical competence is a special, innate talent (“musicians are born, not made”; cf. Sloboda, 1994), the most common view is that musical abilities are shaped mostly by intense musical training (Dienes &amp; Longuet-Higgins, 2004; Sloboda, 1994; Smith, 1997; Wolpert, 2000) and that they remain rather rough in untrained listeners (Jackendoff &amp; Lerdahl, 2006). Some authors even suggest that after the age of 10, musical abilities no longer evolve without explicit musical training (Frances, Zenatti, &amp; Imberty, 1979). These studies give support to the common idea that musicians, due to their specific musical talent and training, are more aware of musical detail (such as nuances in expressive timing,1 discussed in the present study) than are average listeners (Sloboda, 1994).

We refer to this view as the expertise hypothesis, in which explicit knowledge and extensive musical training are considered the main contributors to musical competence. Another, more recent view is that listeners without formal musical training, when given sufficient exposure (e.g., listening to music in everyday life, moving and dancing to music, attending concerts) to a certain musical idiom, might actually perform similarly in a task when compared with musically trained listeners (Levitin, 2006; Schellenberg, 2006), especially when they are asked to do a musical task that uses realistic and ecologically valid stimuli. With regard to the latter, it could be argued that the differences in musical competence between musicians and non1 Expressive timing is the term used to refer to the minute deviations from regularity that contribute to the quality of a music performance (Clarke, 1999; Palmer, 1997).
