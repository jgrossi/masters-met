			<abstract>
				<p>Although much has been written about professional development in general education and music education literature, little has addressed the benefits of music-making as meaningful professional development for music teachers. For music teachers, music-making and meanings of music-making have been connected with teachers' identity, well-being, beliefs, and effectiveness, as well as being a powerful pedagogical tool and a way to develop presence in teaching. Presence in teaching is linked with self-awareness, attentiveness, and pedagogical knowledge. The purpose of this article is to explore the benefits of music-making for music teachers in order to convince policymakers of the value of music-making as a professional development activity for music teachers. This article explores theories from psychology and education that link engagement, well-being, and identity to lay the foundation for a justification of broadening professional development policies. Then, literature is presented that connects teachers' art-making experiences (past and present), identity, teaching, and student learning. The third section draws on my previous work to illustrate the intersections between teachers' music-making and teaching. Then, suggestions for implementing professional development programs with music-making components are made. Although there are many ways music-making could be included as professional development, I offer four suggestions: including music-making in departmental or district-wide meetings, granting professional development credit to music teachers who make music outside of the classroom, setting up in-classroom reflection opportunities/action research based on integrating music-making and music teaching, and initiating a collaborative teacher study group that includes chamber music collaboration.</p>

Heck, especially, portrays artist-teachers as those educators who have developed a sense of presence in their personhood and teaching.

This description is congruent with the ideas of merging personal and professional lives and developing presence in teaching. Music teacher identity and socialization have long been topics of interest within the profession, but have garnered a lot of attention in the past two decades (Pellegrino 2009; Pellegrino 2010; Woodford 2002). Although discussion has primarily focused on the identity conflicts of musicians and music teachers, a more recent trend has explored how the musician and music-maker identity are part of the music teacher (Bernard 2004; Bernard 2005; Dust 2006; Dolloff 2006; Nielsen 2006; Ruud 2006; Stalhammar 2006; Bouij 2007; Dolloff 2007; Regelski 2007; Roberts 2007; Stephens 2007).

At the group level, it is about civic virtues and the institutions that move individuals toward better citizenship: responsibility, nurturance, altruism, civility, moderation, tolerance, and work ethic. (2000, 5) Working off the premise that being happy is a catalyst for better health; better social relationships; and increased work outcomes, energy, coping skills, and citizen dispositions, Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkad (2005) present a theory of sustained happiness. This theory takes into account three components: genetic set point range, intentional activity, and circumstances. For the purposes of this article, I focus on intentional activity. Intentional activity is defined as “actions or practices in which people can choose to engage . . . [and which] require some degree of effort to enact” (Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkad 2005, 118); the researchers suggest that this concept might contribute to an individual’s discovery of sustainable happiness.

Holistic Sense of Identity Scheib has argued that “if fine arts teachers hold and value their identities as artists, then it stands to reason that to keep them holistically fulfilled with their arts teaching career, MUSIC-MAKING AS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 83 professional development should not only include support of their arts teacher identity, but also their identity as artists” (2006, 8–9). Thornton defines an artist teacher as “an individual who both makes and teaches art and is dedicated to both activities as a practitioner” (2005, 167). He explores an inherent identity issue for the artist-teacher in depth: In art and art education there are tensions and debates regarding the roles and identities of artists and teachers that present practitioners in these fields with problems to be negotiated. . . . Teachers of art, particularly in the secondary and tertiary sectors, will usually have developed an identity as an artist or art specialist of one kind or another before embarking on a career in teaching. . . .

Music may increase feelings of vitality and awareness of feelings. 2. Music provides opportunities for increased sense of agency. 3. Music-making provides a sense of belonging and communality. 4. Music experiences create a sense of meaning and coherence in life. (1999, 86) Three music education scholars have addressed the connections between music-making and well-being in different ways. Stefanakis has written about music as a “holistic way in which we come to know ourselves and our relationship with the world” (2005, 14). Dolloff (2006) believes that musicians often experience powerful emotional affects by participating in intense, moving musical experiences. She describes feelings of “utter joy” while music-making, observing that “music and music making [are] ripe with emotions and emotional potential” that are “an important feature in why we came to music and music teaching in the first place” (127). Kokotsaki and Hallam (2007) have found that group music-making can help participants create a strong sense of social unity and can foster uplifting, exhilarating, and motivating feelings. Participants in their </context>

This approach could be adopted through a separate professional development program or incorporated into a collaborative teacher study group. In-classroom reflection and sharing might constitute a portion of the sessions, but a significant part of each session should be devoted to music-making of both music that students are already playing and music that is chosen for the purpose of enjoyment. CONCLUSION: MUSIC-MAKING AS A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY FOR MUSIC TEACHERS Conway, Albert, Hibbard, and Hourigan (2005) have questioned whether it is possible for arts teachers to have a voice in designing and implementing their own professional development. Professional development policies vary from state to state, but recent efforts have shown the possibility of creating professional development requirements that are relevant for each teacher. In Rhode Island, for instance, teachers have “individual professional development plans,” known as “I-Plans,” which are intended to help teachers focus on “personal and professional goals, student achievement, teaching and learning, and school improvement initiatives”</context>

First, teachers need to review, refine, and update their subject and pedagogical knowledge “through combinations of formal development programmes and in-school learning through mentorship, coaching and critical friendship” (Day and Gu 2010, 183). In addition, professional development programs should find a way to support a teacher’s identity because “these findings suggest that a secure sense of professional identity, commitment and well being are central to teachers’ capacity to be and remain effective” (Day 2010).

Meijer, Korthagen, and Vasalos attributed this shift to her increased ability to work with more meaningful layers of her teaching, which they named identity and mission. These layers helped the teacher develop behaviors that brought her personal self into her job and improved her ability to be in the moment and both notice and react to students’ needs in more meaningful and effective ways. The teacher described her new focus as “being-while-teaching.” Finally, Day and Gu (2010) wrote a book based on previous research conducted by Day et al. (2006) and Sammons et al. (2007). This book included unused data from those studies to develop portraits of eighteen teachers. In-depth exploration of these teachers’ experiences allowed the authors to summarize five qualities of good teachers and good teaching. They concluded that teaching resulting in successful learning requires: (a) the combination of technical competencies, deep subject knowledge, and empathy for learners; (b) care for and about learning and learners; (c) the maintenance of a strong sense of identity and age</context>

In the classroom, music-making captured students’ interest and attention and served as a tool for proactive classroom management and inspiring students. Music-making became a way for participants to share what they loved and influence the next generation of music-makers. My findings point to music-making’s potential as a transformative professional development activity. Music-making can be inspirational and return excitement to a teacher who has been feeling burned-out; it can also elevate teaching and help teachers be more present in the classroom. Therefore, as Day and Gu (2010) suggest, helping music teachers refine, review, and update their subject matter, and integrating their musician/performer and teacher identities with the goal of promoting presence in teaching could form the basis of advocacy for music-making as a professional development activity. SUMMARY In this article, I have presented research and theories developed over two decades that link teacher engagement in meaningful, challenging activities with well-being.

From Rodgers and Raider’s perspective, a teacher’s presence is directly connected to observing and understanding student learning and letting student learning drive the teaching. Research Connecting Teachers’ Personal Lives and Teacher Effectiveness/Student Learning The merging of the personal and professional lives of teachers has been connected with identity, job satisfaction, and student learning. Two recent studies (Day et al. 2006; Sammons et al. 2007) have considered the influence of a teacher’s identity on job satisfaction. Both studies drew on an existing database involving three hundred teachers from one hundred British schools over a four-year period and worked from the assumption that a teacher’s identity influences factors such as commitment, motivation, self-efficacy, job satisfaction, and sense of purpose. Datasets were generated from interviews, teacher and pupil surveys, and national student assessment data (Sammons et al. 2007, 684).

These layers helped the teacher develop behaviors that brought her personal self into her job and improved her ability to be in the moment and both notice and react to students’ needs in more meaningful and effective ways. The teacher described her new focus as “being-while-teaching.” Finally, Day and Gu (2010) wrote a book based on previous research conducted by Day et al. (2006) and Sammons et al. (2007).

In-depth exploration of these teachers’ experiences allowed the authors to summarize five qualities of good teachers and good teaching. They concluded that teaching resulting in successful learning requires: (a) the combination of technical competencies, deep subject knowledge, and empathy for learners; (b) care for and about learning and learners; (c) the maintenance of a strong sense of identity and agency; (d) an emotional understanding of self and others; and (e) hopeful</context>

As Hammel (2007) notes, it is not beneficial to have a one-size-fits-all approach to professional development. I am not suggesting that there is one way to be a successful music teacher or that all music teachers must devote significant time to music-making. However, many music teachers do not think of music-making and music teaching as two separate aspects of being music teachers. Instead, in my experience, they describe music-making and teaching as two essential aspects of their identities that intersect to form and inform the music teacher and positively influence student learning in a multitude of ways (P</context>

The artist teacher is one in which three worlds must be straddled or interrelated: the world of art; the world of education; and the world of art education.

Heck, especially, portrays artist-teachers as those educators who have developed a sense of presence in their personhood and teaching.

Remembering what it is like to be a music learner has the potential to impact one’s teaching and student learning. Music-Making and Well-Being We should always remember the importance of music itself in the lives of the (music) teachers. I am coming to the conclusion that reintroducing teachers to the things about the study of music that captivated them when they were students might be a better way to reinvigorate those who are straining under the weight of the educational system. (Fredrickson 2006, 7) Fredrickson suggests that encouraging music teachers to engage in music-making might offer a way to enhance music teachers’ sense of well-being. The concept of finding well-being through engaging in music-making appears in the literature of a variety of fields. In the field of music therapy, Ruud has found: 1. Music may increase feelings of vitality and awareness of feelings. 2. Music provides opportunities for increased sense of agency. 3. Music-making provides a sense of belonging and communality. 4.

Russell found that “string teachers who saw themselves as equal teacher and musician were more satisfied with their job than teachers who saw themselves as more teacher than musician” and suggested that “teachers who remain active as a musician are more likely to be more satisfied than string teachers who have not remained as active as a musician outside of their K–12 position” (2009, 54). All of these studies link music-making to recruitment of future music teachers, the socialization of preservice music teachers, and job satisfaction for in-service string teachers. Combining music-making with teaching seems a common practice in string teacher culture, as many teachers are encouraged to teach with “instrument in hand.” In Strategies for Teaching Strings: Building a Successful String and Orchestra Program, Hamann and Gillespie suggest twenty-one “keys to the development of playing technique in the string class,” with the second being: Use modeling in your teaching.

As Hammel (2007) notes, it is not beneficial to have a one-size-fits-all approach to professional development. I am not suggesting that there is one way to be a successful music teacher or that all music teachers must devote significant time to music-making. However, many music teachers do not think of music-making and music teaching as two separate aspects of being music teachers. Instead, in my experience, they describe music-making and teaching as two essential aspects of their identities that intersect to form and inform the music teacher and positively influence student learning in a multitude of ways (P</context>

Teachers of art, particularly in the secondary and tertiary sectors, will usually have developed an identity as an artist or art specialist of one kind or another before embarking on a career in teaching. . . . The artist teacher is one in which three worlds must be straddled or interrelated: the world of art; the world of education; and the world of art education. (167) However, although Thornton articulates the potential problems of an identity split for artist teachers, Ball (1990) has written about the ways that her artist identity has informed her teaching. Heck (1991) and Elliott (1995) observe the connections between art-making and knowing that also inform teaching. Heck, especially, portrays artist-teachers as those educators who have developed a sense of presence in their personhood and teaching. Heck describes an artist-teacher as a “whole, awake, and compassionate person” concerned with the “development of self, active and meaningful teaching and learning experiences, [and] authentic engagement with others” (1991, 142).

Connecting these ideas with music, Jorgensen avers that musicians “create rehearsals and performances that are captivating and entrancing, beyond normal and lived experience yet one with it, where the various elements combine to create pieces of music or performances that are more than the sum of their parts” (2008, 98). When these performances are successful, she claims that “the result of this endeavor may be seen to be art—a deeply spiritual and sensual process and product that is recognized as artful and crafty by musicians and their publics” (98). Lastly, she submits that all teachers have the responsibility to find balance and bring a refreshed and enriched self MUSIC-MAKING AS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 85 to their students both to sustain their teaching careers and to possess “things of significance to pass on to [their] students” (Jorgensen 2008, 187).

Should practicing one’s own instrument or sightreading music alone or with others count toward development if videotaped evidence is provided? Should written reflection about the value of these music-making activities be required? How many hours would be acceptable? Each state’s department of education would undoubtedly have its own opinion on these subjects. Professional development programs could be created to provide opportunities for teachers to better understand and refine the ways in which they integrate music-making and teaching. Standerfer (2008) suggests that meaningful professional development consists of five elements: it is voluntary, it is long-term, it occurs in the teachers’ classroom contexts, it is reflective, and teachers have collegial support while engaging in it. These five elements should be incorporated into future professional development programs designed to help teachers better understand and refine how they integrate music-making into their classrooms. In-classroom reflection opportunities and action research should be encouraged within the community of music teachers. For instance, a year-long program could be deve</context>

The next section addresses the intersections among teachers’ art-making experiences (past and present), identity, teaching, and student learning. The third section draws on my previous work to illustrate these intersections between teachers’ music-making and teaching. The fourth section provides suggestions for implementing professional development programs with musicmaking components. COMPLETE ENGAGEMENT, WELL-BEING, AND PRESENCE IN TEACHING Drawing on research in the field of psychology, this section describes the theory of “flow” (Csıkszentmihalyi 1991), psychological presence at work (Kahn 1990; 1992), positive psychology (Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkad 2005; Seligman and Csıkszentmihalyi 2000), and the theory of presence in teaching (Rodgers and Raider-Roth 2006). Finally, I will present research that connected teachers’ personal lives and teacher effectiveness/student learning. Theory of Flow In numerous studies, Csıkszentmihalyi examined hundreds of “artists, athletes, musicians, chess masters, and surgeons . . . people who seemed to spend their time in precisely those activities they preferred” (Csıkszentmihalyi 1991, 4). These studies formed the basis for his theory of </context>

In such a way, it is possible to give meaning to one’s entire life. (Csıkszentmihalyi 1991, 214–15) In brief, the theory of flow presents a holistic approach to life, in which one’s actions and feelings are aligned. Psychological Presence at Work Within the field of organizational behavior, Kahn (1990; 1992) explored the concept of psychological presence, a state in which one draws on one’s personal, authentic self (thoughts, feelings, beliefs, identities, and skills) while at work. The concept of presence is linked to the idea of personal engagement, which entails the ability to use and express oneself in multiple ways—physically, cognitively, and emotionally—and connect work with individual interests and self-image. In the same vein, workers need to feel valued by and connected to their coworkers. In his 1990 study, Kahn found that people become engaged in or disengaged from their work a</context>

Although discussion has primarily focused on the identity conflicts of musicians and music teachers, a more recent trend has explored how the musician and music-maker identity are part of the music teacher (Bernard 2004; Bernard 2005; Dust 2006; Dolloff 2006; Nielsen 2006; Ruud 2006; Stalhammar 2006; Bouij 2007; Dolloff 2007; Regelski 2007; Roberts 2007; Stephens 2007).

Meijer, Korthagen, and Vasalos attributed this shift to her increased ability to work with more meaningful layers of her teaching, which they named identity and mission. These layers helped the teacher develop behaviors that brought her personal self into her job and improved her ability to be in the moment and both notice and react to students’ needs in more meaningful and effective ways. The teacher described her new focus as “being-while-teaching.” Finally, Day and Gu (2010) wrote a book based on previous research conducted by Day et al. (2006) and Sammons et al. (2007). This book included unused data from those studies to develop portraits of eighteen teachers. In-depth exploration of these teachers’ experiences allowed the authors to summarize five qualities of good teachers and good teaching. They concluded that teaching resulting in successful learning requires: (a) the combination of technical competencies, deep subject knowledge, and empathy for learners; (b) care for and about learning and learners; (c) the maintenance of a strong sense of identity and age</context>

In the classroom, music-making captured students’ interest and attention and served as a tool for proactive classroom management and inspiring students. Music-making became a way for participants to share what they loved and influence the next generation of music-makers. My findings point to music-making’s potential as a transformative professional development activity. Music-making can be inspirational and return excitement to a teacher who has been feeling burned-out; it can also elevate teaching and help teachers be more present in the classroom. Therefore, as Day and Gu (2010) suggest, helping music teachers refine, review, and update their subject matter, and integrating their musician/performer and teacher identities with the goal of promoting presence in teaching could form the basis of advocacy for music-making as a professional development activity. SUMMARY In this article, I have presented research and theories developed over two decades that link teacher engagement in meaningful, challenging activities with well-being.

The fourth section provides suggestions for implementing professional development programs with musicmaking components. COMPLETE ENGAGEMENT, WELL-BEING, AND PRESENCE IN TEACHING Drawing on research in the field of psychology, this section describes the theory of “flow” (Csıkszentmihalyi 1991), psychological presence at work (Kahn 1990; 1992), positive psychology (Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, and Schkad 2005; Seligman and Csıkszentmihalyi 2000), and the theory of presence in teaching (Rodgers and Raider-Roth 2006). Finally, I will present research that connected teachers’ personal lives and teacher effectiveness/student learning. Theory of Flow In numerous studies, Csıkszentmihalyi examined hundreds of “artists, athletes, musicians, chess masters, and surgeons . . . people who seemed to spend their time in precisely those activities they preferred” (Csıkszentmihalyi 1991, 4). These studies formed the basis for his theory of “flow” that he developed to describe “optimal experience.” Flow is a psychological state of intense interest, a time when someone becomes fully engaged in a challenging activity</context>

Two important features of maintaining an activity on an ongoing basis are finding meaning and value in the activity and varying its practice. These interrelated psychological theories form the foundation for my justification of policymakers including musicmaking in professional development activity. They also form the basis for the theory of presence found in education literature. “Presence from the teacher’s point of view is the experience of bringing one’s whole self to full attention so as to perceive what is happening in the moment” (Rodgers and Raider-Roth 2006, 267). Theory of Presence in Teaching Rodgers and Raider-Roth (2006) present a theory of presence in teaching that combines the aspects of self-awareness, connection to students, connection to subject matter, and pedagogical knowledge. The authors view teaching as “engaging in an authentic relationship with students where teachers know and respond with intelligence and compassion to students and their learning” (265–66). They define presence as: [A] state of alert awareness, receptivity and connectedness to the mental, emotional and physical workings of both the individual and the group in co</context>
<context citStr="Rodgers and Raider-Roth 2006" endWordPosition="2104" position="14347" startWordPosition="2101">and engagement and in their capacity to trust what they know.” They argue that “what allows this relationship to flourish is complex and calls upon the mental, physical, emotional, and relational resources of the teacher” (2006, 266). After exploring each of the four aspects of psychological presence, the authors conclude that being present in the context of education means “to be awake to one’s self, to one’s students and to their learning in such a way that learning is served through skillful and compassionate analysis and access to both subject matter knowledge and pedagogical strategies” (Rodgers and Raider-Roth 2006, 284). They suggest that teachers should pay more attention to how students interact with the subject matter, even if the teacher must slow the classroom pace and possibly lose the opportunity to cover everything. From Rodgers and Raider’s perspective, a teacher’s presence is directly connected to observing and understanding student learning and letting student learning drive the teaching.

(266) Rodgers and Raider-Roth connect classroom life—”the relationships, the affective and cognitive interactions between students and teachers, the construction of genuine learning experiences and a hospitable school climate” with past research suggesting that the teacher/student relationship is a “keystone in student achievement, motivation and engagement and in their capacity to trust what they know.” They argue that “what allows this relationship to flourish is complex and calls upon the mental, physical, emotional, and relational resources of the teacher” (2006, 266).

Meijer, Korthagen, and Vasalos’s (2009) mixed-methods case study followed the experiences of a secondary social studies teacher in The Netherlands. The authors built on the concept that teachers need to have “total encounters” with their students to influence them educationally. This study was also based partially on Rodgers and Raider-Roth’s (2006) theory of presence in teaching and the theories of positive psychology. Meijer, Korthagen, and Vasalos developed an approach to professional development that sought to support teachers as they developed necessary teaching competencies in a way that would be aligned with “who they are and what motivated them to become a teacher” (2009, 298). The goals of this approach include connecting or integrating a teacher’s personal and professional lives and “promoting the teacher’s awareness and actualization of personal strengths,” which would optimally lead to “developing more optimism and hope” (306</context>

Music may increase feelings of vitality and awareness of feelings. 2. Music provides opportunities for increased sense of agency. 3. Music-making provides a sense of belonging and communality. 4. Music experiences create a sense of meaning and coherence in life. (1999, 86) Three music education scholars have addressed the connections between music-making and well-being in different ways. Stefanakis has written about music as a “holistic way in which we come to know ourselves and our relationship with the world” (2005, 14). Dolloff (2006) believes that musicians often experience powerful emotional affects by participating in intense, moving musical experiences. She describes feelings of “utter joy” while music-making, observing that “music and music making [are] ripe with emotions and emotional potential” that are “an important feature in why we came to music and music teaching in the first place” (127). Kokotsaki and Hallam (2007) have found that group music-making can help participants create a strong sense of social unity and can foster uplifting, exhilarating, and motivating feelings. Participants in their study commented </context>
<context citStr="(2006)" endWordPosition="4106" position="27738" startWordPosition="4106">fficacy, and a stronger sense of identity (107). All of these outcomes can be beneficial to music teachers. Although some may argue that helping teachers feel a sense of well-being is not a concern for professional development programs, the literature suggests that connections exist among music-making; well-being; and increased vitality, awareness, motivation, concentration, stamina, selfconfidence, and self-efficacy. These outcomes would be worthwhile benefits of a professional development program. Music-Making Linked to Recruitment, Retention, Job Satisfaction, and Student Learning Isbell’s (2006) study investigated the socialization and occupational identity of undergraduate music education majors and offered suggestions for attracting future music teachers to the profession similar to those of of Gillespie and Hamann (1999): “Performance- and teaching- related experiences may have a mutually reinforcing effect on the socialization of young music students, particularly in situations where the student perceives the school music teacher as being both a strong musician and excellent educator” (Isbell 2006, 151).

From Rodgers and Raider’s perspective, a teacher’s presence is directly connected to observing and understanding student learning and letting student learning drive the teaching. Research Connecting Teachers’ Personal Lives and Teacher Effectiveness/Student Learning The merging of the personal and professional lives of teachers has been connected with identity, job satisfaction, and student learning. Two recent studies (Day et al. 2006; Sammons et al. 2007) have considered the influence of a teacher’s identity on job satisfaction. Both studies drew on an existing database involving three hundred teachers from one hundred British schools over a four-year period and worked from the assumption that a teacher’s identity influences factors such as commitment, motivation, self-efficacy, job satisfaction, and sense of purpose. Datasets were generated from interviews, teacher and pupil surveys, and national student assessment data (Sammons et al. 2007, 684). Linkages were found among identity, well-being, and effectiveness. 82 PELLEGRINO In a literature</context>

Both studies drew on an existing database involving three hundred teachers from one hundred British schools over a four-year period and worked from the assumption that a teacher’s identity influences factors such as commitment, motivation, self-efficacy, job satisfaction, and sense of purpose. Datasets were generated from interviews, teacher and pupil surveys, and national student assessment data (Sammons et al. 2007, 684). Linkages were found among identity, well-being, and effectiveness. 82 PELLEGRINO In a literature review, Smith and Gillespie (2007) also linked professional development, teachers’ personal self-efficacy, teacher knowledge, and teacher effectiveness/student learning. In addition, they recommended jobembedded professional development: “site-based learning communities where professional development is woven into the fabric of the school community, balanced at times with the cross-fertilization of new ideas from outside the school. . . . The focus is on developing teacher knowledge in the content area, analyzing student thinking, and identifying how that knowledge can be applied to changes in instructional practices” (219).

Should practicing one’s own instrument or sightreading music alone or with others count toward development if videotaped evidence is provided? Should written reflection about the value of these music-making activities be required? How many hours would be acceptable? Each state’s department of education would undoubtedly have its own opinion on these subjects. Professional development programs could be created to provide opportunities for teachers to better understand and refine the ways in which they integrate music-making and teaching. Standerfer (2008) suggests that meaningful professional development consists of five elements: it is voluntary, it is long-term, it occurs in the teachers’ classroom contexts, it is reflective, and teachers have collegial support while engaging in it. These five elements should be incorporated into future professional development programs designed to help teachers better understand and refine how they integrate music-making into their classrooms. In-classroom reflection opportunities and action research should be encouraged within the community of music teachers. For instance, a year-long program could be deve</context>
