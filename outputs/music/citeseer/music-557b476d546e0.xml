This is, in part, due to the overlap between music skills and math skills. For example, Rauscher and Hinton (2006) assert the part-whole concept that is necessary for understanding fractions, decimals, and percentages is highly relevant in understanding rhythm. Although most classroom teachers believe in the importance of teaching with and about the arts, few feel qualified or comfortable in doing so (Bohannon &amp; McDowell, 2010). Argabright (2005) acknowledges that the current trend in education has focused on accountability based on student achievement. As such, general music teachers are being asked to “facilitate the integration of state language-arts and math standards with their general music curriculum” (p. 5). The purpose of this article is to illustrate how music educators and elementary school classroom teachers can collaborate to teach music with math. In an effort to exploit this overlap in skills, the authors of this article have created a set of lessons with explicit instruction on connecting music and math. The lessons de</context>
<context citStr="Argabright (2005)" endWordPosition="2851" position="16691" startWordPosition="2850">This student is clearly advanced in music in terms of grasping rhythm and language concepts! Final Thoughts Much of the literature connecting music and mathematics has focused on either students listening to music or students having music instruction in school as well as private instruction. On the other hand, little research has been done on the effects of learning music and math when the two are taught in an integrated way. The scope of this article falls short of researching this phenomenon; however, the authors acknowledge that this is a necessary next step. The authors further agree with Argabright (2005) when she said, “since children naturally love music, we [music educators] become natural funnels for integrating other areas of learning” (p. 5). The integration of music and math in classroom instruction becomes more accessible for both music and classroom teachers with materials specifically created for that purpose (Colwell, 2008). The lessons presented in this article are the first steps in the creation of such materials. It is the authors’ hope that the materials help to facilitate future research to add to the literature on the effects of teaching music and math in an integrated fashion</context>

Another example of how students found the missing note values is in the second bar of the song. The students were given the lyrics, “Lit-tle-Star” and two quarter notes under “Little.” They might then show that 14 1 4 1 2 + = and therefore a half note was needed to complete the bar. Many students did not show that 1 4 1 4 1 2 + = because when asked, Figure 1. The math value of musical notes. Source.

If they completed the missing notes because they knew how to count the number of beats, they were asked to also show the fraction sentences at the bottom of the page to prove their number of beats. If students finished early, they were given another song, “Mary Had a Little Lamb” to complete. (The “Little Lamb” worksheet could also be used for homework.)

The information discussed in this introduction included basic terminology. When putting a piece of music on paper, the notes are divided into measures (or bars) each representing the same unit of time. Within each measure, the number of beats is organized by the time signature. As we know, the time signature resembles a fraction with the “numerator” telling us how many beats are in each measure and the “denominator” telling us what type of note gets the beat (Garland &amp; Kahn, 1995). Students learned how to identify the notes and the fractional value of each note (see Figure 1). This chart will be a valuable resource for the classroom teacher who may not be familiar with what is taught in music class. The bottom row of the chart can be used by the music teacher to make a connection between the number of beats and the powers of two. Once students have learned the note values, we further examine the time signature. For example, a time signature of 44 tells us that we need four quarter notes per measure (or combinations of other notes that equal four quarter notes). At this</context>
