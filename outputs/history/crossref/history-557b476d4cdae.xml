renowned for his ability to pose among the most interesting questions and challenges
for sociology. His invitation to postsocialist theory is no exception, but his
opposition between Marxist and neoclassical sociology may get in the way of
recognizing a critical, historical, and cultural sociology beyond Marx. In this
discussion, I like Burawoy's description of the difference between neoclassical and
classical sociology. Neoclassical sociologists Eyal, Szelenyi, and Townsley (1998)
and Stark and Bruszt (1998) are more interested in exploring capitalism's
possibilities through its plurality than in elaborating the classical concern for
capitalism's systemic distinction. The neoclassical sociologists' interest in
capitalist variety also attends insufficiently to the global articulation of national
capitalisms. Burawoy especially uses the common concern of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim
for the individual's estrangement from capitalism to cast postsocialist theory's
critical difference with neoclassical sociology. Burawoy's postsocialist theory
shares a cultural disposition with the classics and the authors he reviews that
limits sociology's critical capacities, however. Classical sociology does not just
agonize over anomie, alienation, and meaninglessness. Wuthnow (1987, p. 27) also
explains how this sociology treats culture as a "reflection" of something more real,
which, through the "strategic application of skeptical scholarly knowledge," can
conquer "self-estrangement primarily by extending its knowledge of the world." While
Eyal et al. (1998) and Stark and Bruszt (1998) may not share Burawoy's normative
concerns, they are closer to his cultural disposition, and to that of the classical
tradition, than what some significant currents in critical social theory would
recommend. Calhoun (1995, p. 11) suggests that critical sociology might be organized
around "theory that is self-conscious about its historicity, its place in dialogue
and among cultures, its irreducibility to facts, and its engagement in the practical
world." The starting point for any sociology, Pierre Bourdieu (1990, p. 177) argues,
should be its own sociology: "All the propo<component x="149.75" y="233.46"

enunciates can and must be applied to the subject who practices the science." For
these authors and others, sociology's critical cultural capacity depends on an
extended engagement not only with the consciousness of history's subjects or the
symbols of their world, but with the constitution of the problem that motivates
theory and practice. Burawoy's review suggests one approach to this sociology of
knowledge production, but his commitment to a Lakatosian scientific project in the 2
Marxist tradition (1990, 2000) leads him to miss significant challenges to, and
accomplishments in, the study of postcommunist capitalism. KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION IN
THE STREAM OF HISTORY Burawoy opens his essay with reflections on the "end of
ideology" in American sociology after both World War II and after communism's
collapse in Europe and Northern and Central Asia. He identifies the intellectual
transformation of two individuals with this transformation of American scholarship he
finds troubling. Szelenyi and Stark are no doubt leaders in the study of class and
economy after communism, but Burawoy's introductory frame anticipates a recurrent
problem in Burawoy's sociology. His theory focuses on the link between the
ethnographic moment and a systemic tendency, in this case the scholar's biography and
the ideological trend in American sociology. That theoretical strategy focuses one's
gaze on the problem of the broader trend, and the actor's adaptation, or resistance,
to it. Postsocialist theorists resist that ideological trend, while the neoclassical
sociologists are trapped in capitalist hegemony. Burawoy's critique does not speak of
any false consciousness, but he is not far away when he suggests that their optimism
is "rooted more in faith than in reality" (p. 5). Here, however, I am afraid that
Burawoy misses the reality of knowledge production by focusing on two individuals and
their implication in his critique of ideology without attending to those mediations
that structure their theory and practice. Burawoy misses the coauthors,
collaborators, informants, institutions, and alternative publics shaping the work
under review. These conditions of knowledge production are at best backstage,
disappearing behind the tale of American sociology's retreat from class. East Central
Europe is posed as "fertile soil" for growing an American sociology he dislikes,
rather than as a site where history, and scholarship, has been made. It would be
quite unfortunate to read these two books through the prism of American sociology at
work. They are far more than that. The two volumes represent international
collaboration in articulation with the practical en<component x="149.75" y="586.03"

Stark and Bruszt (1998) and Burawoy and Verdery (1999) refer to those societies
formerly ruled by communists as postsocialist, while Eyal et al. (1998) and others
prefer postcommunist capitalism. The semantic difference is consequential, but
deserves more discussion than I can provide here. For elaboration of this and other

European and especially Hungarian intellectuals in social change. I am sure Burawoy
does not intend to reinforce the American ethnocentrism Hughes (1961) highlighted
decades ago, but by missing the global articulation of knowledge production in making
communism's collapse and postcommunist capitalism's alternatives, he misses an
extraordinary opportunity for extending critical sociology. In other contexts,
Burawoy recognizes the importance of practical engagement in scholarship, most
notably when he found one reason for Trotsky's superior theory of revolution to rest
in his explanation from within the stream of history (Burawoy 1989). The authors
whose work he examines here are also writing from within the stream of history, but
apparently they are standing in the wrong part of the stream. Burawoy is distressed
by Stark's and Szelenyi's apparent abandonment of class, or at least their loss of
grounding in or acknowledgement of the working class or subaltern. He does not like
their apparent ignorance of social justice and their acceptance of capitalism. But in
order to magnify the tragedy of their implicit optimism, he winds up writing a tale
of individual transformation whose narrative is shaped more by the ideology he
critiques than it is by the intellectual biographies he laments. Although Szelenyi et
al. (1988) focused on peasant innovation, Szelenyi's world reputation-making book
with Gyo&#xA8;rgy Konrad (Konrad and Szelenyi 1979) was not grounded in the deeply
subaltern. It theorized an intelligentsia on the route to class power. Its ancestry
owed more to Hungarian populism than to Marxism (Kennedy 1994), but Szelenyi fit with
the then-blooming interest in the critical sociology of intellectuals and knowledge
(Gouldner 1979). Szelenyi could thus be recognized as a part of Marxist inquiries
(Burawoy and Skocpol 1982), even while both he and Gouldner were better characterized
as "ridge riders" between Marxism and sociology. Stark's (1982) dissertation focused
on new class configurations in capitalist and state socialist societies, but his
later work on labor markets (1986) already anticipated his subsequent manifest
institutionalism. I recognize far more continuity than does Burawoy in the work of
these individuals, but I think Burawoy is quite right on another score. Class is not
where it used to be, and socialism is not the counterculture to capitalism it once
was (Bauman 1976). The intellectual field around social change has shifted
dramatically, in part because Eastern Europe is far more important to American
sociology than it ever was. But one misses the significance of that shift by focusing
on what has happened to class analysis and socialism. One of the most dramatic
changes in sociology has occurred in the explosion of opportunity to conduct
ethnographies in Eastern Europe. Communist rule severely restricted this kind of
scholarship (Verdery 1996). In fact, one reason Burawoy wound up working in Hungary
under communist rule was because he could not gain access to factories in Poland.
Today, however, ethnographies are among the most important methodologies available
for addressing the character of postcommunist capital<component x="149.75" y="170.6"

limited to manufacturing sites or subaltern communities. The ethnographies in Burawoy
and Verdery (1999) also address courtrooms, fiscal policies, and libraries. Verdery
(1996) has argued elsewhere that one of the greatest challenges for understanding
socialism and its sequel is the ethnography of the state. While some critical
sociologists might be content to transport sensibilities of social justice directly
to the postcommunist world, ethnographers have cautioned us that politics, from
elections to gender, should not be read through a Western lens (Stukuls 1997, 1998;
Gal and Kligman 2000). Given the hegemony of nationalism as a discursive formation
(Calhoun 1997), especially in Eastern Europe, critical sociology also risks a great
deal when it fails to address its articulation with the nation (Suny 1993; Suny and
Kennedy 1999). WHOSE POSTCOMMUNIST CAPITALISM? Both sets of authors under review and
Burawoy minimize the challenge of this national articulation. Of course the authors
and Burawoy are writing about different national spaces, but they treat them
primarily as sites for comparison rather than as different grounds for knowledge
production, much less subject formation. Consider, simply, Hungary's centrality. This
was Michael Burawoy's first country for learning about communist rule. David Stark
began in Yugoslavia, but he has worked mostly in Hungary since the late 1980s. Ivan
Szelenyi is one of the leading figures of Hungarian social science. Laszlo Bruszt is
not only the former acting rector of Central European University in Budapest, but was
himself a participant in the Hungarian Round Table negotiations of 1989. If one
considers a broader sociology of postcommunist change, one is struck by the degree to
which Hungarian research, Hungarian data, and Hungarian intellectuals in diaspora or
at home, shape the debate in the United States. Janos Kornai's (1992) political
economy provides the point of departure for many assessments of socialism. Jozsef
Boro&#xA8;cz, Martha Lampland, Akos Rona-Tas, and Szonya Szelenyi, all leading
figures in the American sociology of postsocialism, are grounded in Hungary. Burawoy
challenges the centrality of Hungary in discussion by introducing Russia. But why
Russia? Its size, military power, and position as the home of the October Revolution
certainly elevate its significance, but it is also a place that encourages deep
pessimism about capitalist futures. As Burawoy and Krotov (1992) argued after the
Soviet Union's collapse, this was mercantile capitalism at best. Perhaps Burawoy is
drawn to a more "critical approach to capitalism in order to rescue the positive
potential of socialism" when capitalism is so badly done (p. 30). At the same time,
however, Russia hardly produces much optimism about socialist possibilities either.
While its communist party may call for a return to the rights of state socialism,
they have little sense of how this could be achieved in the new economic and
political environment (Cook, Orenstein,<component x="149.75" y="542.19"

perhaps we should not be looking at socialism in terms of feasibility. Perhaps we
should look at it in terms of resistance and look to the country best known for
mobilizing opposition. Poland is the nation in the world once ruled by communists
with the greatest tradition of labor movements. Solidarity, its independent
selfgoverning trade union of 1980-81, was an emancipatory movement embodying all
sorts of alternatives that were themselves "rapidly closed off" when martial law was
imposed (Kennedy 1991). When we seek to exhume socialism, we cannot forget that it
was communist state violence that destroyed alternatives-some of them socialist-many
times, most notably in Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and in Poland in
1981. This history matters, especially in Poland. It forms part of a tradition that
is recalled to shape the politics of protest, the politics of parties, and the
politics of the labor movement itself (Kennedy and Stukuls 1998; Ekiert and Kubik
1999). And these different histories affect the plausibility of theories that
overlook the articulation of the nation in their argument. Konrad and Szelenyi's
(1979) anticipation of intellectuals on the road to class power was grounded in
Hungarian social conditions and history, even though its reference was to state
socialism (Kennedy 1992). When Eyal et al. (1998) write that this class project has
been realized, made manifest in the coalition government between the parties
descended from the dissident cultural intelligentsia and communist party reformers,
they elevate Hungarian experience in generalization. Poland has not (yet?) managed
such a coalition at the national level, and only very occasionally at the local
level. Indeed, the controversy attending the individual decision by the prominent
Solidarity activist Barbara Labuda to work in the cabinet of the very popular
president Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former communist, suggests that Polish cultural
politics remain very different from those in Hungary. While we might find evidence
for the success of this fourth new class project in Poland, it is not a question that
Polish scholarship would emphasize. The enduring significance of "us and them" in the
popular, and sociological, imagination suggests that the communist past remains very
much a part of the present, at least in Poland. Burawoy may counter that I commit the
same mistake as the authors he reviews. I focus too much on the various origins of
communism's collapse and too little on the relations that are defining capitalism.
After all, as Burawoy notes above, capitalism's "systemic logic effectively wipes out
origins," which then calls for study that subordinates "the study of historical paths
and trajectories to careful in situ analyses of actual social relations. . .
ethnographic data that will reveal the day to day world of strategic action bound by
changing constraints" (p. 23). In this framework, national articulations appear
hardly relevant given the globalism of capitalism and its emergent class dynamic.
Marx thus can be reborn in socialism's wake. That optimism, however, requires another
kind of faith, and a compatible set of historical interpretations. Burawoy writes,
"Capitalism's early history was no less horrific than communism's but it
man<component x="149.75" y="170.6" width="311.07" height="514.11" page="5"

potentialities and handle its contradictions by reconstituting itself. Socialism did
not have such a chance-for world historic reasons rather than internal limits-to
refashion itself before it was overrun" (p. 30). In order for Burawoy to retain that
optimism, he has to work within "Marxism as Tradition" (Burawoy 2000). For the living
tree of Marxism to survive, its proponents must cut off the malignant limbs in hope
that the disease has not spread (Burawoy 2000, p. 156). That, however, is the
cultural point: he constitutes his science within a tradition of inquiry that relies
on interpretations of history that preserve its core. Those who view Marxism as
rotten to the roots, or who find it but one element of a critical intellectual
tradition, could entertain the idea that "socialism did not have a chance" because of
its own internal limits. Who, after all, overran socialism? Certainly in 1956, 1968,
and 1981, communist rule overran socialism's promise. Confronting this history
invites us to consider Marxism's "nightmare questions" (Gouldner 1980). Marxism can
avoid the "nightmare questions" that challenge its core presumptions by focusing on
those scientific problems, like capitalism's trajectory and class relations, that it
does best. And this is quite appropriate for a Lakatosian approach to science
(Burawoy 1990, 2000). But if Marxism's core rests in the struggle for socialism
itself, as Burawoy seems to imply, Marxism's most critical challenge does not lie in
exhuming socialism. If Eastern Europe matters to socialism's viability, Marxism's
most critical challenge lies in addressing socialism's cultural effect. For those who
have not lived in a society ruled by communists, socialism can function as "an
ontologically absent but epistemologically structuring desire" rather than a lived
experience with great emotional effect and very different national meanings (Kennedy
and Galtz 1996). Even after this generation passes, the connotations of communist
rule will not disappear from memory. That memory will affect the ways in which
socialism, even if based on resistance to capitalism, can be articulated. If
socialism is an unnamed form of resistance to capitalism using the organizational
forms left by communist rule, then, perhaps, ethnography unbound can suffice. If,
however, socialism is a counterculture that requires a postsocialist theory
elaborated by East Europeans, the meaning of communist rule cannot be overlooked.
Engaging the history of communist rule matters more than Marxism as Tradition appears
to emphasize. Understanding its implication in cultural politics is critical "to
rescue the positive potential of socialism." But what of another nightmare question?
What if the focus on socialism stands in the way of critical sociology? To the extent
that Marxism's theoretical and scientific core remains identified with the struggle
for socialism, it may face unnecessary barriers to developing a critical sociology
for, and out of, Eastern Europe. To the extent that Marxism, or critical sociology,
is about the relationship between knowledge and practice, about the empowerment and
disempowerment of various social actors, and about the relationship between

fertile soil or a laboratory. Some have argued that it is genesis itself (Jowitt
1992), although that is a bit more hyperbole than I can manage. But I do find the
invitation to think with my colleagues from Eastern Europe about social and
intellectual change both compelling and liberating. Calhoun's (1995) emphasis on
theory's place in dialogue among cultures is therefore central to the mission of
critical sociology, and critical for theory's relevance to practice. In this sense,
our authors may represent the critical tradition of sociology more accurately than
does Burawoy. Socialism is no longer a vision of the future, nor much of a guide to
action in Eastern Europe. Transition from plan to market, from dictatorship to
democracy, is hegemonic as it never was before. Of course there are alternatives.
China's economic growth has been relatively spectacular, and Burawoy (1996) suggests
that Russia should be viewed through its lens. China's record on democracy and human
rights hardly inspires the emancipatory hope that socialism did at one time for very
many people, however. Our Hungarian authors and their colleagues have been at the
heart of social change itself, and social change in these times is based on
variations in capitalism's configuration, democracy's institutionalization, and civil
society's mobilization. Bauman (1992) argued that critical intellectuals have for the
most part become the "interpreters" for dispossessed groups, but over the last decade
in the postcommunist world, they have played an invaluable role in legislating
alternatives for better or worse. Eyal et al. (1998) and Stark and Bruszt (1998) were
looking in the right place to develop critical sociology. Eyal et al. even define
their sociology of social change by it. THE CULTURE AND PRACTICE OF POSTCOMMUNIST
ELITES Eyal et al. (1998) proclaim a new sociology based on a theory of the fourth
new class project of the East Central European intelligentsia, on the one hand, and
social mobility surveys of elites, on the other. Their sense of social change is
based explicitly on patterned attributes of economic, political, and cultural elites
at different points of time, primarily in Hungary but to some extent in Poland and
the Czech Republic, and to a much lesser extent but for stark contrast, in Russia.
Their sense of capitalism is based on the qualities of these agents and their
theorized relationships to others, primarily within their class. The authors argue
against a quite complex theory of political capitalism that they have refined to
allow evaluation through elite surveys. Action primarily takes place through
individual adaptation of elites with different forms of capital-when, for example,
socialist technocrats and anticommunist opposition from the days of communist rule
ally to find a new place as the hegemonic managerial bloc presiding over
postcommunist capitalism. This is much less a theory of social change than it is an
account of changes in elite capital and habitus at different times in recent East
European history. Postcommunist capitalism's alternative futures are un<component

dominance of different fractions of the elite-the technocratic-managers, foreign
investors, and their "comprador intellectual allies" and new entrepreneurs. These are
not collective actors in the sense of the term most theorists of class struggle or
social movements know. These are collective actors whose collective action can be
found in the cumulation of individual strategies. True to Weberian sociology, the
analyst is the one best situated to recognize classes in the identification of common
patterns. You apparently cannot rely on their organization or coordinated effort to
show their class formation, although others have offered an alternative account doing
just that (e.g., Gianoplus 1999). Culture is quite important to Eyal et al.'s (1998)
argument. The civilizing project of the East Central European intelligentsia serves
as the spirit that travels through history to provide different versions of the
intellectuals' mission. Bourdieu's invocation tempers the Hegelian impulse, as the
authors (p. 17) emphasize the "dialectical interaction between agents (their
dispositions, habits, biographies, collective memories) and their positions (in
institutions, class relations, and networks)." The cultural bourgeoisie is also
building the postcommunist capitalist order. The "spirit of postcommunism" (see also
Kennedy and Gianoplus 1994) drew on the idea of civil society and monetarism to
become the power bloc's ideology. That power bloc uses three rituals-purification,
sacrifice, and confession-initially to purge postcommunists from power and later
society from socialist pollution to build the rational economy. Culture is, however,
also marginal to the argument. Following Bourdieu, Eyal et al. (1998) treat culture
as a form of capital and use the dominance of different types of capital to
distinguish social structures. But this Bourdieuian notion of capital fails to
recognize its mediating function in the constitution of actors or in the coordination
of action (Calhoun 1995, p. 155). Consider, for instance, how the complicated
biographies one might find in life histories are understood through categories of
actors. Eyal et al. (1998) distinguish dissidents, whose degrees of opposition go
unmarked, from socialist technocrats and managers, all with different allocations of
cultural capital. Their kinship ties, friendship networks, early career trajectories,
and personal memories during communist rule and its end go unmarked before their
classification, whose class base in turn shapes the action that gets theorized. We
learn about ideologies that reflect those class positions and about rituals that help
make capitalism without capitalists, but the individual strategies themselves
disappear beneath class. Instead, things happen, based on global imitation and path
dependence, that alter the value of certain types of capital. In their words, "Those
who are able to adjust their trajectories to meet social change most successfully are
those who possess the most diverse portfolio of different kinds of capital" (39). The
authors do not really explain under what conditions the imitation or the path is
chosen, but that, apparently, is a matter for their individual agents to decide, in a
way befitting Bour<component x="149.75" y="170.6" width="311.12" height="514.11"

recall the words of Janos Kenedi (1982) in this: "Do it yourself." Indeed, the whole
argument, apart from Bourdieu's invocation, resonates with the work emerging from
Hungary more than elsewhere. The data, while initially from Hungary, Poland, the
Czech Republic, and Russia, are mainly from Hungary in the latter years of the
decade. When narratives, even with comparison, are elaborated, Hungary tends to
provide the illustration (e.g. pp. 183-84). There is even a certain style to the
argument. It reminds me of the argument that Akos Rona-Tas (1997) made about the
second great transformation, which was made in small incremental steps. I also recall
Jozsef Boro&#xA8;cz's (1995) description of the dynamics of postcommunist capitalism
with "fusion," the "creative reinterpretation of old and new elements, creating
substantively distinguishable qualities of social experience," in which he uses the
musical repertoire of Bela Bartok to produce the image. Citing the Hungarian pianist
Zoltan Kocsis, "Bartok's oeuvre is a perfect synthesis between central east European
folklore and composed music in the hands of a superbly creative individual." It even
reminds me of Burawoy and Lukacs's (1992) argument about painting socialism, rather
than building an organization like Solidarity. While certainly Polish culture also
had a sense of za&#x142;atwiac, or to arrange for things, Polish sociology under
communist rule, and even today, still struggles with a sense of social structure
connected to that past in which Solidarity made "us and them." Hungarians hardly have
that sense in their scholarship, or in their politics (Kennedy 1992). Indeed, Stark
and Bruszt (1998) argue that this lack of a mobilized civil society enabled the
Hungarians to leap ahead of Poland in negotiating a more democratic transition at the
Round Table. Perhaps because they rely as much on rather detailed stories of networks
that produce unfamiliar actors taking the helm of a capitalism whose type we hardly
know, Stark and Bruszt (1998) develop a sociology of social change that depends more
on action than on classification. Even their categories-recombinant property or
deliberative associations-are based much more on a model of communication than one
based on categories of attributes. In this sense, they are much closer to the third
generation of cultural theory that Wuthnow (1987) describes than are Eyal et al.
(1998). Despite the latter's invocation of habitus, culture seems to reflect class in
the argument's narrative much more than it creates possibilities for action. Stark
and Bruszt (1998), by contrast, seek the possibilities and identities emergent in new
accounts of action (Kennedy 1999). Underlying both volumes, however, is a sense of
social change that is very different from what it was when class struggle and social
movements were our guide. Rather than making history, narratives are organized around
adjustment to social change, with social change as the result of adjustment. "Making
do" was certainly appropriate for describing the character of socialist entrepreneurs
in the interstices of first and second economy, but is this really what elites do?

the times, and a reflection of the culture that is structuring social action. In
this, Burawoy is quite right. These two volumes reflect the times, not so much of
American sociology but of East Central European praxis in a global transition
culture. A CRITICAL SOCIOLOGY OF POSTCOMMUNISM Reframed this way, one can appreciate
anew Burawoy's lament. It is not just that our authors focus on elites, but that
these elites are not inspiring. They are only trying to create a normal society,
based on some fusion of the past and Western examples. They are trying to make a
better society than what they had. It is only a variation on what exists, however,
and not an alternative modernity. But then again, they already had such an
alternative that fell to great, if nationally and socially variable, applause within
Eastern Europe. And of course another modernity, so far unmentioned, is not far away.
I am struck that theories of postcommunist social change can overlook the wars that
have accompanied it. Neither of the books under review, nor Burawoy himself,
addresses the wars in Central Asia, the Caucasus, or the Balkans. Is it because they
are apart from transition? Is it because war is a result of nationalism and not of
communism's end? All of the authors tend to structure their arguments within national
societies engaging in relatively peaceful transition, but that is a part of the
problem. Postcommunist capitalism is not only a national system. It is not just a
global economic system. Transition is also a global cultural formation. Elite East
Central European collective action is directed toward membership in transnational
organizations, most prominently NATO and the European Union, not only because of
Western hegemony but also because of a reasonable fear of political instability. Wars
on postcommunism's southern tier are a good inspiration for seeking the security
afforded by membership in the West. Thus, regardless of war's place in Durkheimian,
Weberian, or Marxist traditions of sociology, it is absolutely central for thinking
about the constitution of a culture that guides postcommunist capitalism's making. Of
course this alternative if barbaric modernity is hardly one that elites embrace.
However, its existence shapes the culture in which decisions about alternative
futures and visions of normality are cast. Within transition culture, the West is
constructed as an alternative to ethnic cleansing, mass rape, terrorism, and bombing
civilians, and that alternative in turn is linked to the unresolved end to socialism
and its search for a new legitimating principle in nationalism. NATO's bombing of
Serbia has of course complicated the normative calculus facing East European leaders,
but Russia's second war on Chechnya has not assured them either. I agree with Burawoy
that we need to look beyond variations on capitalism in imagining East European
alternative futures. But we also need to look beyond the mode of production, and
toward fundamental elements of<component x="149.75" y="640.82" width="311.02"

Eastern Europe. Indeed, against this background we might gain a better handle on the
remarkable cultural hegemony of global capitalism. It is not just a question of the
number of foreign investors and intellectual comprador bourgeoisie. Regardless of
numbers, the culture of transition has itself become hegemonic and so obvious that we
hardly discuss why elites adjust to fit their societies into a global capitalist
future. Although Stark and Bruszt (1998) note that Hungarian socialists lurched from
their path as the public's caretaker in the mid-1990s to the imposer of financial
discipline, they managed this observation without explaining why certain
postsocialist pathways seem obvious, and others appear impossible. In this sense, we
must attend not only to elites adapting to change, but also to how elites sort
through the larger set of rules and resources that structure the adaptation. The
authors all acknowledge it, sometimes referring to this sorting as a choice between
the national path and the Western example. But they treat these phenomena far more
obviously than they should. As postcommunist capitalism's elites recombine property
or reconstruct national path and Western examples in new ways of making do, they are
not just creating novel combinations out of otherwise coherent cultural structures.
Instead, these cultural formations are themselves emergent and filled with
contradictions and possibilities that imaginative elites, and entrepreneurial
activists, exploit. Agency, Sewell (1992) reminds us, derives not only from the
confrontation of habitus and structure, or innovation through networks, but through
the contradictions of structures themselves. And that, it seems to me, is the big
challenge facing critical sociology. Burawoy, in his plea for postsocialist theory,
focuses on the search for alternatives. I, for one, would prefer to understand how
postcommunist capitalism came to be so dominant. However, all of our authors,
including Burawoy, assume that hegemony without explaining how it happened. Part of
the answer lies in a refined cultural sociology that focuses on the constitution of
the objects of inquiry and subjects of history in making transition across national
articulations. It also depends on explaining why some cultural formations acquire the
power that they do. Alternative modernities in the socialist past and in
postcommunism's wars have made transition culture seem like a pretty good bet, at
least to those who assume institutional responsibility. But I suspect that the
Western alternative would not be so compelling if the world's commodification were
not so overwhelming. I would find it extremely helpful if Burawoy and others in the
Marxist tradition would go to their deep roots in critical realism to explain
capitalism's power. Exhuming socialism may be necessary for identifying injustice
within a Marxist problematic, but one might pursue injustice in other terms that can
be more consequential. Marxism is, however, a necessary point of departure for
understanding capitalism's deep structure.<component x="149.75" y="170.6"

useful for those interested in understanding, rather than assuming, capitalism's
power if critical sociology might work a bit to explain the commodity and its fetish
within postcommunist capitalism. Hungary's most renowned Marxist, Gyo&#xA8;rgy Lukacs
(1971, p. 84), put the question succinctly when he asked, "How far is commodity
exchange together with its structural consequences able to influence the total outer
and inner life of society?" Martha Lampland (1995) provides a critical, historical
ethnographic foundation for this inquiry in her exploration of the commodification of
peasant labor within socialist Hungary. Hungary is once again at the center, with
Marxist inquiry at its heart. But that may be where I finish my selection from the
Marxist legacy. Instead of exhuming socialism, one might follow those critical
traditions of sociology-feminism and pragmatism among others-that develop their
scholarship in articulation with the language of actually existing struggles. One
might even turn to a sense of critical theory that identifies its intervention with
immanent critique. Here, freedom offers incredible potential. Transition culture is
not just about new forms of property. Its normative power rests on its association
with freedom. Fortunately for that immanent critique of global capitalism, Sen (1999)
and others are developing a discourse around freedom that puts economic oppression,
physical violence, and political repression, among others, at the fount of freedom's
limitation. Rather than ask how social conflicts reflect socialism's positive
potentials, we might instead organize our inquiry around how freedom's meaning might
be extended to assure human security, broader democratic deliberation, and deeper
social justice. Instead of having to argue against transition we might argue that
freedom is what transition should be about. By constituting the problem of freedom's
extension in transition culture, a critical, historical, and cultural sociology could
help to make a different space for inquiry and practice around emancipation. And that
space will not reproduce the opposition between socialism and capitalism that helps
to limit freedom to its bourgeois sense in transition culture.<component x="149.75"

renowned for his ability to pose among the most interesting questions and challenges
for sociology. His invitation to postsocialist theory is no exception, but his
opposition between Marxist and neoclassical sociology may get in the way of
recognizing a critical, historical, and cultural sociology beyond Marx. In this
discussion, I like Burawoy's description of the difference between neoclassical and
classical sociology. Neoclassical sociologists Eyal, Szelenyi, and Townsley (1998)
and Stark and Bruszt (1998) are more interested in exploring capitalism's
possibilities through its plurality than in elaborating the classical concern for
capitalism's systemic distinction. The neoclassical sociologists' interest in
capitalist variety also attends insufficiently to the global articulation of national
capitalisms. Burawoy especially uses the common concern of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim
for the individual's estrangement from capitalism to cast postsocialist theory's
critical difference with neoclassical sociology. Burawoy's postsocialist theory
shares a cultural disposition with the classics and the authors he reviews that
limits sociology's critical capacities, however. Classical sociology does not just
agonize over anomie, alienation, and meaninglessness. Wuthnow (1987, p. 27) also
explains how this sociology treats culture as a "reflection" of something more real,
which, through the "strategic application of skeptical scholarly knowledge," can
conquer "self-estrangement primarily by extending its knowledge of the world." While
Eyal et al. (1998) and Stark and Bruszt (1998) may not share Burawoy's normative
concerns, they are closer to his cultural disposition, and to that of the classical
tradition, than what some significant currents in critical social theory would
recommend. Calhoun (1995, p. 11) suggests that critical sociology might be organized
around "theory that is self-conscious about its historicity, its place in dialogue
and among cultures, its irreducibility to facts, and its engagement in the practical
world." The starting point for any sociology, Pierre Bourdieu (1990, p. 177) argues,
should be its own sociology: "All the propo<component x="149.75" y="233.46"

enunciates can and must be applied to the subject who practices the science." For
these authors and others, sociology's critical cultural capacity depends on an
extended engagement not only with the consciousness of history's subjects or the
symbols of their world, but with the constitution of the problem that motivates
theory and practice. Burawoy's review suggests one approach to this sociology of
knowledge production, but his commitment to a Lakatosian scientific project in the 2
Marxist tradition (1990, 2000) leads him to miss significant challenges to, and
accomplishments in, the study of postcommunist capitalism. KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION IN
THE STREAM OF HISTORY Burawoy opens his essay with reflections on the "end of
ideology" in American sociology after both World War II and after communism's
collapse in Europe and Northern and Central Asia. He identifies the intellectual
transformation of two individuals with this transformation of American scholarship he
finds troubling. Szelenyi and Stark are no doubt leaders in the study of class and
economy after communism, but Burawoy's introductory frame anticipates a recurrent
problem in Burawoy's sociology. His theory focuses on the link between the
ethnographic moment and a systemic tendency, in this case the scholar's biography and
the ideological trend in American sociology. That theoretical strategy focuses one's
gaze on the problem of the broader trend, and the actor's adaptation, or resistance,
to it. Postsocialist theorists resist that ideological trend, while the neoclassical
sociologists are trapped in capitalist hegemony. Burawoy's critique does not speak of
any false consciousness, but he is not far away when he suggests that their optimism
is "rooted more in faith than in reality" (p. 5). Here, however, I am afraid that
Burawoy misses the reality of knowledge production by focusing on two individuals and
their implication in his critique of ideology without attending to those mediations
that structure their theory and practice. Burawoy misses the coauthors,
collaborators, informants, institutions, and alternative publics shaping the work
under review. These conditions of knowledge production are at best backstage,
disappearing behind the tale of American sociology's retreat from class. East Central
Europe is posed as "fertile soil" for growing an American sociology he dislikes,
rather than as a site where history, and scholarship, has been made. It would be
quite unfortunate to read these two books through the prism of American sociology at
work. They are far more than that. The two volumes represent international

European and especially Hungarian intellectuals in social change. I am sure Burawoy
does not intend to reinforce the American ethnocentrism Hughes (1961) highlighted
decades ago, but by missing the global articulation of knowledge production in making
communism's collapse and postcommunist capitalism's alternatives, he misses an
extraordinary opportunity for extending critical sociology. In other contexts,
Burawoy recognizes the importance of practical engagement in scholarship, most
notably when he found one reason for Trotsky's superior theory of revolution to rest
in his explanation from within the stream of history (Burawoy 1989). The authors
whose work he examines here are also writing from within the stream of history, but
apparently they are standing in the wrong part of the stream. Burawoy is distressed
by Stark's and Szelenyi's apparent abandonment of class, or at least their loss of
grounding in or acknowledgement of the working class or subaltern. He does not like
their apparent ignorance of social justice and their acceptance of capitalism. But in
order to magnify the tragedy of their implicit optimism, he winds up writing a tale
of individual transformation whose narrative is shaped more by the ideology he
critiques than it is by the intellectual biographies he laments. Although Szelenyi et
al. (1988) focused on peasant innovation, Szelenyi's world reputation-making book
with Gyo&#xA8;rgy Konrad (Konrad and Szelenyi 1979) was not grounded in the deeply
subaltern. It theorized an intelligentsia on the route to class power. Its ancestry
owed more to Hungarian populism than to Marxism (Kennedy 1994), but Szelenyi fit with
the then-blooming interest in the critical sociology of intellectuals and knowledge
(Gouldner 1979). Szelenyi could thus be recognized as a part of Marxist inquiries
(Burawoy and Skocpol 1982), even while both he and Gouldner were better characterized
as "ridge riders" between Marxism and sociology. Stark's (1982) dissertation focused
on new class configurations in capitalist and state socialist societies, but his
later work on labor markets (1986) already anticipated his subsequent manifest
institutionalism. I recognize far more continuity than does Burawoy in the work of
these individuals, but I think Burawoy is quite right on another score. Class is not
where it used to be, and socialism is not the counterculture to capitalism it once
was (Bauman 1976). The intellectual field around social change has shifted
dramatically, in part because Eastern Europe is far more important to American
sociology than it ever was. But one misses the significance of that shift by focusing
on what has happened to class analysis and socialism. One of the most dramatic
changes in sociology has occurred in the explosion of opportunity to conduct
ethnographies in Eastern Europe. Communist rule severely restricted this kind of
scholarship (Verdery 1996). In fact, one reason Burawoy wound up working in Hungary
under communist rule was because he could not gain access to factories in Poland.
Today, however, ethnographies are among the most important methodologies available
for addressing the character of postcommunist capital<component x="149.75" y="170.6"

limited to manufacturing sites or subaltern communities. The ethnographies in Burawoy
and Verdery (1999) also address courtrooms, fiscal policies, and libraries. Verdery
(1996) has argued elsewhere that one of the greatest challenges for understanding
socialism and its sequel is the ethnography of the state. While some critical
sociologists might be content to transport sensibilities of social justice directly
to the postcommunist world, ethnographers have cautioned us that politics, from
elections to gender, should not be read through a Western lens (Stukuls 1997, 1998;
Gal and Kligman 2000). Given the hegemony of nationalism as a discursive formation
(Calhoun 1997), especially in Eastern Europe, critical sociology also risks a great
deal when it fails to address its articulation with the nation (Suny 1993; Suny and
Kennedy 1999). WHOSE POSTCOMMUNIST CAPITALISM? Both sets of authors under review and
Burawoy minimize the challenge of this national articulation. Of course the authors
and Burawoy are writing about different national spaces, but they treat them
primarily as sites for comparison rather than as different grounds for knowledge
production, much less subject formation. Consider, simply, Hungary's centrality. This
was Michael Burawoy's first country for learning about communist rule. David Stark
began in Yugoslavia, but he has worked mostly in Hungary since the late 1980s. Ivan
Szelenyi is one of the leading figures of Hungarian social science. Laszlo Bruszt is
not only the former acting rector of Central European University in Budapest, but was
himself a participant in the Hungarian Round Table negotiations of 1989. If one
considers a broader sociology of postcommunist change, one is struck by the degree to
which Hungarian research, Hungarian data, and Hungarian intellectuals in diaspora or
at home, shape the debate in the United States. Janos Kornai's (1992) political
economy provides the point of departure for many assessments of socialism. Jozsef
Boro&#xA8;cz, Martha Lampland, Akos Rona-Tas, and Szonya Szelenyi, all leading
figures in the American sociology of postsocialism, are grounded in Hungary. Burawoy
challenges the centrality of Hungary in discussion by introducing Russia. But why
Russia? Its size, military power, and position as the home of the October Revolution
certainly elevate its significance, but it is also a place that encourages deep
pessimism about capitalist futures. As Burawoy and Krotov (1992) argued after the
Soviet Union's collapse, this was mercantile capitalism at best. Perhaps Burawoy is
drawn to a more "critical approach to capitalism in order to rescue the positive
potential of socialism" when capitalism is so badly done (p. 30). At the same time,
however, Russia hardly produces much optimism about socialist possibilities either.
While its communist party may call for a return to the rights of state socialism,
they have little sense of how this could be achieved in the new economic and
political environment (Cook, Orenstein,<component x="149.75" y="542.19"

perhaps we should not be looking at socialism in terms of feasibility. Perhaps we
should look at it in terms of resistance and look to the country best known for
mobilizing opposition. Poland is the nation in the world once ruled by communists
with the greatest tradition of labor movements. Solidarity, its independent
selfgoverning trade union of 1980-81, was an emancipatory movement embodying all
sorts of alternatives that were themselves "rapidly closed off" when martial law was
imposed (Kennedy 1991). When we seek to exhume socialism, we cannot forget that it
was communist state violence that destroyed alternatives-some of them socialist-many
times, most notably in Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and in Poland in
1981. This history matters, especially in Poland. It forms part of a tradition that
is recalled to shape the politics of protest, the politics of parties, and the
politics of the labor movement itself (Kennedy and Stukuls 1998; Ekiert and Kubik
1999). And these different histories affect the plausibility of theories that
overlook the articulation of the nation in their argument. Konrad and Szelenyi's
(1979) anticipation of intellectuals on the road to class power was grounded in
Hungarian social conditions and history, even though its reference was to state
socialism (Kennedy 1992). When Eyal et al. (1998) write that this class project has
been realized, made manifest in the coalition government between the parties
descended from the dissident cultural intelligentsia and communist party reformers,
they elevate Hungarian experience in generalization. Poland has not (yet?) managed
such a coalition at the national level, and only very occasionally at the local
level. Indeed, the controversy attending the individual decision by the prominent
Solidarity activist Barbara Labuda to work in the cabinet of the very popular
president Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former communist, suggests that Polish cultural
politics remain very different from those in Hungary. While we might find evidence
for the success of this fourth new class project in Poland, it is not a question that
Polish scholarship would emphasize. The enduring significance of "us and them" in the
popular, and sociological, imagination suggests that the communist past remains very
much a part of the present, at least in Poland. Burawoy may counter that I commit the
same mistake as the authors he reviews. I focus too much on the various origins of
communism's collapse and too little on the relations that are defining capitalism.
After all, as Burawoy notes above, capitalism's "systemic logic effectively wipes out
origins," which then calls for study that subordinates "the study of historical paths
and trajectories to careful in situ analyses of actual social relations. . .
ethnographic data that will reveal the day to day world of strategic action bound by
changing constraints" (p. 23). In this framework, national articulations appear
hardly relevant given the globalism of capitalism and its emergent class dynamic.
Marx thus can be reborn in socialism's wake. That optimism, however, requires another
kind of faith, and a compatible set of historical interpretations. Burawoy writes,
"Capitalism's early history was no less horrific than communism's but it
man<component x="149.75" y="170.6" width="311.07" height="514.11" page="5"

potentialities and handle its contradictions by reconstituting itself. Socialism did
not have such a chance-for world historic reasons rather than internal limits-to
refashion itself before it was overrun" (p. 30). In order for Burawoy to retain that
optimism, he has to work within "Marxism as Tradition" (Burawoy 2000). For the living
tree of Marxism to survive, its proponents must cut off the malignant limbs in hope
that the disease has not spread (Burawoy 2000, p. 156). That, however, is the
cultural point: he constitutes his science within a tradition of inquiry that relies
on interpretations of history that preserve its core. Those who view Marxism as
rotten to the roots, or who find it but one element of a critical intellectual
tradition, could entertain the idea that "socialism did not have a chance" because of
its own internal limits. Who, after all, overran socialism? Certainly in 1956, 1968,
and 1981, communist rule overran socialism's promise. Confronting this history
invites us to consider Marxism's "nightmare questions" (Gouldner 1980). Marxism can
avoid the "nightmare questions" that challenge its core presumptions by focusing on
those scientific problems, like capitalism's trajectory and class relations, that it
does best. And this is quite appropriate for a Lakatosian approach to science
(Burawoy 1990, 2000). But if Marxism's core rests in the struggle for socialism
itself, as Burawoy seems to imply, Marxism's most critical challenge does not lie in
exhuming socialism. If Eastern Europe matters to socialism's viability, Marxism's
most critical challenge lies in addressing socialism's cultural effect. For those who
have not lived in a society ruled by communists, socialism can function as "an
ontologically absent but epistemologically structuring desire" rather than a lived
experience with great emotional effect and very different national meanings (Kennedy
and Galtz 1996). Even after this generation passes, the connotations of communist
rule will not disappear from memory. That memory will affect the ways in which
socialism, even if based on resistance to capitalism, can be articulated. If
socialism is an unnamed form of resistance to capitalism using the organizational
forms left by communist rule, then, perhaps, ethnography unbound can suffice. If,
however, socialism is a counterculture that requires a postsocialist theory
elaborated by East Europeans, the meaning of communist rule cannot be overlooked.
Engaging the history of communist rule matters more than Marxism as Tradition appears
to emphasize. Understanding its implication in cultural politics is critical "to
rescue the positive potential of socialism." But what of another nightmare question?
What if the focus on socialism stands in the way of critical sociology? To the extent
that Marxism's theoretical and scientific core remains identified with the struggle
for socialism, it may face unnecessary barriers to developing a critical sociology
for, and out of, Eastern Europe. To the extent that Marxism, or critical sociology,
is about the relationship between knowledge and practice, about the empowerment and
disempowerment of various social actors, and about the relationship between

fertile soil or a laboratory. Some have argued that it is genesis itself (Jowitt
1992), although that is a bit more hyperbole than I can manage. But I do find the
invitation to think with my colleagues from Eastern Europe about social and
intellectual change both compelling and liberating. Calhoun's (1995) emphasis on
theory's place in dialogue among cultures is therefore central to the mission of
critical sociology, and critical for theory's relevance to practice. In this sense,
our authors may represent the critical tradition of sociology more accurately than
does Burawoy. Socialism is no longer a vision of the future, nor much of a guide to
action in Eastern Europe. Transition from plan to market, from dictatorship to
democracy, is hegemonic as it never was before. Of course there are alternatives.
China's economic growth has been relatively spectacular, and Burawoy (1996) suggests
that Russia should be viewed through its lens. China's record on democracy and human
rights hardly inspires the emancipatory hope that socialism did at one time for very
many people, however. Our Hungarian authors and their colleagues have been at the
heart of social change itself, and social change in these times is based on
variations in capitalism's configuration, democracy's institutionalization, and civil
society's mobilization. Bauman (1992) argued that critical intellectuals have for the
most part become the "interpreters" for dispossessed groups, but over the last decade
in the postcommunist world, they have played an invaluable role in legislating
alternatives for better or worse. Eyal et al. (1998) and Stark and Bruszt (1998) were
looking in the right place to develop critical sociology. Eyal et al. even define
their sociology of social change by it. THE CULTURE AND PRACTICE OF POSTCOMMUNIST
ELITES Eyal et al. (1998) proclaim a new sociology based on a theory of the fourth
new class project of the East Central European intelligentsia, on the one hand, and
social mobility surveys of elites, on the other. Their sense of social change is
based explicitly on patterned attributes of economic, political, and cultural elites
at different points of time, primarily in Hungary but to some extent in Poland and
the Czech Republic, and to a much lesser extent but for stark contrast, in Russia.
Their sense of capitalism is based on the qualities of these agents and their
theorized relationships to others, primarily within their class. The authors argue
against a quite complex theory of political capitalism that they have refined to
allow evaluation through elite surveys. Action primarily takes place through
individual adaptation of elites with different forms of capital-when, for example,
socialist technocrats and anticommunist opposition from the days of communist rule
ally to find a new place as the hegemonic managerial bloc presiding over
postcommunist capitalism. This is much less a theory of social change than it is an
account of changes in elite capital and habitus at different times in recent East
European history. Postcommunist capitalism's alternative futures are un<component

dominance of different fractions of the elite-the technocratic-managers, foreign
investors, and their "comprador intellectual allies" and new entrepreneurs. These are
not collective actors in the sense of the term most theorists of class struggle or
social movements know. These are collective actors whose collective action can be
found in the cumulation of individual strategies. True to Weberian sociology, the
analyst is the one best situated to recognize classes in the identification of common
patterns. You apparently cannot rely on their organization or coordinated effort to
show their class formation, although others have offered an alternative account doing
just that (e.g., Gianoplus 1999). Culture is quite important to Eyal et al.'s (1998)
argument. The civilizing project of the East Central European intelligentsia serves
as the spirit that travels through history to provide different versions of the
intellectuals' mission. Bourdieu's invocation tempers the Hegelian impulse, as the
authors (p. 17) emphasize the "dialectical interaction between agents (their
dispositions, habits, biographies, collective memories) and their positions (in
institutions, class relations, and networks)." The cultural bourgeoisie is also
building the postcommunist capitalist order. The "spirit of postcommunism" (see also
Kennedy and Gianoplus 1994) drew on the idea of civil society and monetarism to
become the power bloc's ideology. That power bloc uses three rituals-purification,
sacrifice, and confession-initially to purge postcommunists from power and later
society from socialist pollution to build the rational economy. Culture is, however,
also marginal to the argument. Following Bourdieu, Eyal et al. (1998) treat culture
as a form of capital and use the dominance of different types of capital to
distinguish social structures. But this Bourdieuian notion of capital fails to
recognize its mediating function in the constitution of actors or in the coordination
of action (Calhoun 1995, p. 155). Consider, for instance, how the complicated
biographies one might find in life histories are understood through categories of
actors. Eyal et al. (1998) distinguish dissidents, whose degrees of opposition go
unmarked, from socialist technocrats and managers, all with different allocations of
cultural capital. Their kinship ties, friendship networks, early career trajectories,
and personal memories during communist rule and its end go unmarked before their
classification, whose class base in turn shapes the action that gets theorized. We
learn about ideologies that reflect those class positions and about rituals that help
make capitalism without capitalists, but the individual strategies themselves
disappear beneath class. Instead, things happen, based on global imitation and path
dependence, that alter the value of certain types of capital. In their words, "Those
who are able to adjust their trajectories to meet social change most successfully are
those who possess the most diverse portfolio of different kinds of capital" (39). The
authors do not really explain under what conditions the imitation or the path is
chosen, but that, apparently, is a matter for their individual agents to decide, in a
way befitting Bour<component x="149.75" y="170.6" width="311.12" height="514.11"

recall the words of Janos Kenedi (1982) in this: "Do it yourself." Indeed, the whole
argument, apart from Bourdieu's invocation, resonates with the work emerging from
Hungary more than elsewhere. The data, while initially from Hungary, Poland, the
Czech Republic, and Russia, are mainly from Hungary in the latter years of the
decade. When narratives, even with comparison, are elaborated, Hungary tends to
provide the illustration (e.g. pp. 183-84). There is even a certain style to the
argument. It reminds me of the argument that Akos Rona-Tas (1997) made about the
second great transformation, which was made in small incremental steps. I also recall
Jozsef Boro&#xA8;cz's (1995) description of the dynamics of postcommunist capitalism
with "fusion," the "creative reinterpretation of old and new elements, creating
substantively distinguishable qualities of social experience," in which he uses the
musical repertoire of Bela Bartok to produce the image. Citing the Hungarian pianist
Zoltan Kocsis, "Bartok's oeuvre is a perfect synthesis between central east European
folklore and composed music in the hands of a superbly creative individual." It even
reminds me of Burawoy and Lukacs's (1992) argument about painting socialism, rather
than building an organization like Solidarity. While certainly Polish culture also
had a sense of za&#x142;atwiac, or to arrange for things, Polish sociology under
communist rule, and even today, still struggles with a sense of social structure
connected to that past in which Solidarity made "us and them." Hungarians hardly have
that sense in their scholarship, or in their politics (Kennedy 1992). Indeed, Stark
and Bruszt (1998) argue that this lack of a mobilized civil society enabled the
Hungarians to leap ahead of Poland in negotiating a more democratic transition at the
Round Table. Perhaps because they rely as much on rather detailed stories of networks
that produce unfamiliar actors taking the helm of a capitalism whose type we hardly
know, Stark and Bruszt (1998) develop a sociology of social change that depends more
on action than on classification. Even their categories-recombinant property or
deliberative associations-are based much more on a model of communication than one
based on categories of attributes. In this sense, they are much closer to the third
generation of cultural theory that Wuthnow (1987) describes than are Eyal et al.
(1998). Despite the latter's invocation of habitus, culture seems to reflect class in
the argument's narrative much more than it creates possibilities for action. Stark
and Bruszt (1998), by contrast, seek the possibilities and identities emergent in new
accounts of action (Kennedy 1999). Underlying both volumes, however, is a sense of
social change that is very different from what it was when class struggle and social
movements were our guide. Rather than making history, narratives are organized around
adjustment to social change, with social change as the result of adjustment. "Making
do" was certainly appropriate for describing the character of socialist entrepreneurs
in the interstices of first and second economy, but is this really what elites do?

the times, and a reflection of the culture that is structuring social action. In
this, Burawoy is quite right. These two volumes reflect the times, not so much of
American sociology but of East Central European praxis in a global transition
culture. A CRITICAL SOCIOLOGY OF POSTCOMMUNISM Reframed this way, one can appreciate
anew Burawoy's lament. It is not just that our authors focus on elites, but that
these elites are not inspiring. They are only trying to create a normal society,
based on some fusion of the past and Western examples. They are trying to make a
better society than what they had. It is only a variation on what exists, however,
and not an alternative modernity. But then again, they already had such an
alternative that fell to great, if nationally and socially variable, applause within
Eastern Europe. And of course another modernity, so far unmentioned, is not far away.
I am struck that theories of postcommunist social change can overlook the wars that
have accompanied it. Neither of the books under review, nor Burawoy himself,
addresses the wars in Central Asia, the Caucasus, or the Balkans. Is it because they
are apart from transition? Is it because war is a result of nationalism and not of
communism's end? All of the authors tend to structure their arguments within national
societies engaging in relatively peaceful transition, but that is a part of the
problem. Postcommunist capitalism is not only a national system. It is not just a
global economic system. Transition is also a global cultural formation. Elite East
Central European collective action is directed toward membership in transnational
organizations, most prominently NATO and the European Union, not only because of
Western hegemony but also because of a reasonable fear of political instability. Wars
on postcommunism's southern tier are a good inspiration for seeking the security
afforded by membership in the West. Thus, regardless of war's place in Durkheimian,
Weberian, or Marxist traditions of sociology, it is absolutely central for thinking
about the constitution of a culture that guides postcommunist capitalism's making. Of
course this alternative if barbaric modernity is hardly one that elites embrace.
However, its existence shapes the culture in which decisions about alternative
futures and visions of normality are cast. Within transition culture, the West is
constructed as an alternative to ethnic cleansing, mass rape, terrorism, and bombing
civilians, and that alternative in turn is linked to the unresolved end to socialism
and its search for a new legitimating principle in nationalism. NATO's bombing of
Serbia has of course complicated the normative calculus facing East European leaders,
but Russia's second war on Chechnya has not assured them either. I agree with Burawoy
that we need to look beyond variations on capitalism in imagining East European
alternative futures. But we also need to look beyond the mode of production, and
toward fundamental elements of<component x="149.75" y="640.82" width="311.02"

Eastern Europe. Indeed, against this background we might gain a better handle on the
remarkable cultural hegemony of global capitalism. It is not just a question of the
number of foreign investors and intellectual comprador bourgeoisie. Regardless of
numbers, the culture of transition has itself become hegemonic and so obvious that we
hardly discuss why elites adjust to fit their societies into a global capitalist
future. Although Stark and Bruszt (1998) note that Hungarian socialists lurched from
their path as the public's caretaker in the mid-1990s to the imposer of financial
discipline, they managed this observation without explaining why certain
postsocialist pathways seem obvious, and others appear impossible. In this sense, we
must attend not only to elites adapting to change, but also to how elites sort
through the larger set of rules and resources that structure the adaptation. The
authors all acknowledge it, sometimes referring to this sorting as a choice between
the national path and the Western example. But they treat these phenomena far more
obviously than they should. As postcommunist capitalism's elites recombine property
or reconstruct national path and Western examples in new ways of making do, they are
not just creating novel combinations out of otherwise coherent cultural structures.
Instead, these cultural formations are themselves emergent and filled with
contradictions and possibilities that imaginative elites, and entrepreneurial
activists, exploit. Agency, Sewell (1992) reminds us, derives not only from the
confrontation of habitus and structure, or innovation through networks, but through
the contradictions of structures themselves. And that, it seems to me, is the big
challenge facing critical sociology. Burawoy, in his plea for postsocialist theory,
focuses on the search for alternatives. I, for one, would prefer to understand how
postcommunist capitalism came to be so dominant. However, all of our authors,
including Burawoy, assume that hegemony without explaining how it happened. Part of
the answer lies in a refined cultural sociology that focuses on the constitution of
the objects of inquiry and subjects of history in making transition across national
articulations. It also depends on explaining why some cultural formations acquire the
power that they do. Alternative modernities in the socialist past and in
postcommunism's wars have made transition culture seem like a pretty good bet, at
least to those who assume institutional responsibility. But I suspect that the
Western alternative would not be so compelling if the world's commodification were
not so overwhelming. I would find it extremely helpful if Burawoy and others in the
Marxist tradition would go to their deep roots in critical realism to explain
capitalism's power. Exhuming socialism may be necessary for identifying injustice
within a Marxist problematic, but one might pursue injustice in other terms that can
be more consequential. Marxism is, however, a necessary point of departure for
understanding capitalism's deep structure.<component x="149.75" y="170.6"

useful for those interested in understanding, rather than assuming, capitalism's
power if critical sociology might work a bit to explain the commodity and its fetish
within postcommunist capitalism. Hungary's most renowned Marxist, Gyo&#xA8;rgy Lukacs
(1971, p. 84), put the question succinctly when he asked, "How far is commodity
exchange together with its structural consequences able to influence the total outer
and inner life of society?" Martha Lampland (1995) provides a critical, historical
ethnographic foundation for this inquiry in her exploration of the commodification of
peasant labor within socialist Hungary. Hungary is once again at the center, with
Marxist inquiry at its heart. But that may be where I finish my selection from the
Marxist legacy. Instead of exhuming socialism, one might follow those critical
traditions of sociology-feminism and pragmatism among others-that develop their
scholarship in articulation with the language of actually existing struggles. One
might even turn to a sense of critical theory that identifies its intervention with
immanent critique. Here, freedom offers incredible potential. Transition culture is
not just about new forms of property. Its normative power rests on its association
with freedom. Fortunately for that immanent critique of global capitalism, Sen (1999)
and others are developing a discourse around freedom that puts economic oppression,
physical violence, and political repression, among others, at the fount of freedom's
limitation. Rather than ask how social conflicts reflect socialism's positive
potentials, we might instead organize our inquiry around how freedom's meaning might
be extended to assure human security, broader democratic deliberation, and deeper
social justice. Instead of having to argue against transition we might argue that
freedom is what transition should be about. By constituting the problem of freedom's
extension in transition culture, a critical, historical, and cultural sociology could
help to make a different space for inquiry and practice around emancipation. And that
space will not reproduce the opposition between socialism and capitalism that helps
to limit freedom to its bourgeois sense in transition culture.<component x="149.75"
