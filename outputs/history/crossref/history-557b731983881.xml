study investigated and compared the infl uence of hardiness in burnout among
Portuguese and Brazilian nurses, as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory- Human
Service Survey (MBI-HSS) and the Personal Views Survey (PVS). The sample consisted of
630 nurses working in hospitals (394 Portuguese, 236 Brazilians). The statistical
analysis using multiple linear regression showed that hardiness is a personality
trait that explains burnout, presenting different predictive models for each sample.
Results suggested that overall work characteristics and work settings of Portuguese
and Brazilian nurses explained the differences found between the samples. Findings
suggested that future applied interventions aiming to reduce burnout among Portuguese
and Brazilian nurses, should contemplate Keywords different hardiness dimensions. :

received increased attention over the last years across nations. This fact is
associated with a global change in socio economic factors, particularly moving from
an economy based on industry to an economy based on services. Consequently, this
change caused increased demands for professionals, experiencing more and more
psychological pressure over time (Schaufeli, Leiter, &amp; Maslach, 2009). Maslach
and Jackson (1981) defi ned burnout symptoms as: (a) emotional exhaustion, in which
professionals feel that they are no longer able to cope at a psychological level; (b)
depersonalization (or cynicism), characterized as negative and cynical attitudes and
feelings towards clients. The last dimension represents the interpersonal context
dimension of burnout (c) reduced effi cacy or personal accomplishment, understood as
the professionals' tendency to evaluate oneself negatively, particularly their work
with clients. It is related with feelings of incompetence and a lack of achievement
at work. Nursing has been considered the most stressful profession among health care
workers (Pisanti, Van der Doef, Maes, Lazzari, &amp; Bertini, 2011). This is likely
to be related with the different demands nurses face in the work context. Several
work stressors experienced by nurses have been described in the literature. As an
example, Gray-Toft and Anderson (1981) have identifi ed stressors related with:
physical environment (eg. workload); social environment stressors (eg. confl ict with
staff) and psychological environmental stressors (eg. death and dying, lack of staff
support, uncertainty associated with treatment, and lack of preparation to deal with
the emotional needs of patients and their families). Furthermore, as suggested by a
report developed by Pricewaterhouse Coopers (2002) nurses enter the health care fi
eld with the believe that they will have the time, the resources, and continued
support to meet the needs of their patients and give them a high level of quality
care. However, as suggested by the same report. Hence, due to all these factors,
nurses are likely to be more prone to burnout, which may negatively affect the
quality of nursing care, increase turnover, absenteeism and reduced productivity
(Raiger, 2005). Added to this fact, individual characteristics have shown to also
infl uence nurses' experience of stress in the work context (Saksvik-Lehouilliera et
al., 2012). Additionally, culture appears to be an important concept infl uencing
burnout levels among nurses (Turnipseed &amp; Turnipseed, 1997). However, little is
known about the infl uence of personality factors predicting burnout among nurses
across different cultures, especially between Portugal and Brazil. Since as suggested
by Triandis and Suh (2002) there are both universal and culture-specifi c aspects of
variation in personality. It would be interesting to further understand the
differences in personality factors predicting burnout among nurses across cultures.
Furthermore, as nursing is a profession that involves cultural care diversity
(Leininger, 1978) it seems critical to further understand how personality factors
across cultures predict nurses' burnout in order to design cultural sensitive
interventions. The model of Burnout proposed by Maslach, Schaufeli, and Leiter (2001)
emphasizes the importance of work characteristics and context as predictors of
burnout. However, it is lkely that personality traits also play an important role in
the development of burnout. Although some evidence has emerged supporting this view,
little is known about this particular relationship (Azeem, 2010; Ghorpade, Lackritz,
&amp; Singh, 2007). In a meta-analysis conducted by Alarcon, Eschleman and Bowling
(2009) examining the relationship between personality and burnout, it was found that
self-esteem, self-effi cacy, locus of control, emotional stability, extraversion,
conscientiousness, agreeableness, positive affectivity, negative affectivity,
optimism, proactive personality, and hardiness were associated with the three
dimensions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Particularly, hardiness showed the
stronger relationship with all the three dimensions of burnout compared with the
other personality factors under study. As recommended by the authors, these fi ndings
highlight the need to further examine the relationship between hardiness and burnout.
Hardiness has been defi ned as a personality construct that refl ects the extent to
which a person is able to face stressors without experiencing ill effects, such as
psychological or physical strains (Kobasa, 1979). Kobasa suggested that the concept
is a resilience resource that can be applied in stressful situations and which is
assumed to protect the person from stress. Hence, the construct has emerged as an
important buffer in the relationship between stressors and illness (Maddi, 1999).
Hardiness comprises a high sense of life and work commitment, perceptions of control,
and high openness to change and challenge, as well as a more positive appraisal of
stress. Thus, the dimensions of commitment, control and challenge defi ne the
construct of hardiness (Kobasa, Maddi, &amp; Puccetti, 1982). Commitment refl ects a
dedication to oneself and to one's work. Control is the extent to which an individual
infl uences life events to ensure a particular outcome. Challenge refers to the
extent to which individuals perceive challenges as opportunities. Risquez,
Fern&#xE1;ndez and S&#xE1;nchez-Meca (2011) suggested that hardiness infl uences the
person's health through the type and intensity of the stressors experienced, and by
restricting or assisting the use of specifi c coping strategies. This idea is also
supported by research conducted by Beehr and Bowling (2005) examining hardiness as a
moderator of stressor-strain relationships. More specifi cally, hardiness is expected
to yield a negative relationship with burnout via effects on both the perceived and
objective nature of the work environment (Alarcon et al., 2009). In what concerns to
the relationship between personality and burnout among nurses, some evidence has been
found in the literature (e.g., Boyle Grap, Younger, &amp; Thornby, 1991; Ghorpade,
Lackritz, &amp; Gangaram, 2011; Phillips, 2011; Risquez et al., 2011;
SaksvikLehouilliera et al., 2012; Simoni &amp; Paterson, 1997). In particular,
hardiness has shown to be a protector in the process of burnout among nurses
(Garrosa, Rainho, Moreno-Jim&#xE9;nez, &amp; Monteiro, 2010). Additionally, how
individual differences infl uence the stress-strain outcomes seems to be an important
topic of research in today's increasingly culturally mixed work environments
(Gy&#xF6;rk&#xF6;s, Becker, Massoudi, Bruin, &amp; Rossier, 2012). In agreement with
this idea, Smith, Fisher, and Sale (2001) suggested that recently the need for
cross-cultural studies in Occupational Psychology (OP) research has become more and
more evident. Despite this necessity, cross-cultural studies in OP are not very
common, mostly due to methodological diffi culties of cross-cultural research (Smith
et al., 2001). Thus, the current study aimed to compare whether there was a different
predictive model of hardiness in burnout for Portuguese and Brazilian nurses. Since
this study is exploratory in nature, therefore no detailed hypothesis can be
presented. However, contemplating nursing job characteristics variations across both
countries, it is hypothesized that different dimensions of hardiness would predict
burnout for Brazilian and Portuguese nurses. Findings from this original research
study, will develop the theoretical knowledge in the area of cross-cultural research
in OP, and will highly contribute to the applied fi eld of nursing.<component

cross-sectional in nature (Grimes &amp; Shulz, 2002) and was conducted in Portuguese
and Brazilian' hospitals. Data was collected across four large public general
hospitals (1500 to 5000 employees) located in a major metropolitan city of both
countries (PortoPortugal and Porto Alegre-Brazil). Participants included 630 nurses
(394 Portuguese, 236 Brazilians). Portuguese sample' mean age was 34.3 (SD = 8.3)
years old. Most were women (77.2%), married (56.0%), had children (61.0%), and were
in permanent positions (68.4%). Participants worked in that hospital an average
length of 10.2 years (SD = 7.9). Brazilian sample mean age was 34 (SD = 8.2) years
old. Participants were women (81.4%), married (61.9%), had children (66.9%), and
worked with the remainder in temporary positions of varying contract length (58.2%).
Participants had worked in a hospital an average length of 2.5 years (SD = 3.9). vity
(worked in other institution), time working in that institution. Maslach Burnout
Inventory - Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS; Maslach &amp; Jackson, 1981). The
instrument was validated to Portuguese language by Carlotto and C&#xE2;mara (2007).
The MBI is a 22-item scale designed to measure three dimensions of BS: Emotional
exhaustion (9 items), Depersonalization (5 items), and Personal accomplishment (8
items). Each item is answered on a fi ve-point response scale ranging from 1 (never)
to 5 (everyday). A separate score was calculated for each of the three subscales.
Personal Views Survey (PVS). Developed by Kobasa (1982), was used to assess
hardiness, with a version adapted and translated to Portuguese language by Mallar and
Capit&#xE3;o (2004). This instrument consists of 50 items measuring hardiness trait,
composed by three dimensions: Commitment (16 items), Control (17 items) and Challenge
(17 items). The frequency with which the subject experiences feelings relating to
each scale is rated on a four point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all true) to
3 (completely true). A separate score was calculated for each of the three subscales.
Procedure Hospitals management teams were contacted, to explain and present the aims
of the study. Following research ethics approval from university and hospitals,
permission was given to contact nurse's team leaders and schedule data collection
procedures using anonymous questionnaires. The instruments used were part of a larger
study on occupational health psychology in the workplaces. In the Brazilian sample,
questionnaire pack was fulfi lled in the presence of a researcher. In the Portuguese
sample, questionnaires were handed in to participants and returned by post to the
researcher. Fulfi llment of the questionnaire took approximately 20 minutes to
complete. Data collection for both countries was collected over the year of 2010. All
participants were informed that their answers would be treated anonymously and confi

analyses are showed in Table 3 for Portuguese nurses and in Table 4 for Brazilian
nurses. For the Portuguese nurses, results obtained for the dimension of Emotional
Exhaustion suggested that the predictor model is characterized by the dimensions of
Commitment and Challenge. This regression model explained 27% of the variance of
Emotional Exhaustion, revealing the highest explanatory power compared with other
dimensions of burnout. In what concerns to Depersonalization for the Portuguese
nurses, the fi nal model was explained by the dimensions of Commitment, Challenge and
Control by almost 22.3% of the variance. Commitment and Control together accounted
for almost 13.8% of the variance in Personal Accomplishment. In what relates to the
results for the Portuguese nurses, it was found that Commitment ( = -.372 ) and
Challenge ( = -.193) had a negative relation with Emotional Exhaustion, suggesting
that high levels of Commitment and Challenge predicted lower levels of Emotional
Exhaustion at work. Depersonalization seemed to decrease, as Commitment ( = -.189),
Challenge ( = -.127), and Control ( = -.156) increased. Personal Accomplishment was
positively related with Commitment ( = .219) and Control ( = .146). Among Portuguese
nurses, Commitment seemed to be the dimension of hardiness that best predicted

The results revealed a negative relation between Emotional Exhaustion, Commitment ( =

tend to decrease Emotional Exhaustion at work. Depersonalization was negatively
predicted by Control ( = -.256). Personal Accomplishment was predicted by Commitment
and Control. These results revealed a positive relation between the burnout dimension
Personal Accomplishment, and the hardiness dimensions Commitment ( = .298), and

to explore whether there was a different predictive model of hardiness in burnout for
Portuguese and Brazilian nurses. Results partially support our hypothesis that the
predictive model of hardiness in burnout among nurses in these two countries is
mainly different, except for personal accomplishment. Additionally, although the
values were relatively low, our fi ndings showed that all the dimensions of hardiness
were related with burnout for both the Portuguese and Brazilian nurses. Hence, in
agreement with previous research (e.g., Azeem, 2010; Ebling &amp; Carlotto, 2012;
Garrosa et al., 2010), our results suggest that hardiness, as personality trait, is
likely to explain only part of the experience of burnout for Portuguese and Brazilian
nurses. Results suggest that there are differences between nurses in Brazil and
Portugal in what concerns to variables explaining Emotional Exhaustion and
Depersonalization. Particularly, for Portuguese nurses, it seems that Commitment was
the personality trait that best explained variability in burnout. On the other hand,
for Brazilian nurses, Control seemed to be the most important variable explaining
burnout. We believe that these fi ndings can be partially explained by the
differences in the type and context of work nurses face in each one of the countries.
Furthermore, these results are likely to be related with the overall work culture of
each country. In Portugal, nurses job, involves spending most of their time involved
in direct patient care, independently of their health status. Thus, the relationship
developed between the nurse and the patient has almost a therapeutic effect. Until
recently, nurses in Portugal were expected to establish a strong nurse-patient
relationship, besides the technical skills required in caring. Nurses were also
required to show empathy and kindness for the patient health status and support
patient empowerment (Amendoeira, 2006). When analyzing the Portuguese nurses in our
study, the best predictors of Emotional Exhaustion for these participants were
Commitment and Challenge. It is believed that these fi ndings may be explained by the
professional emphasis of nurses' job in Portugal, since it is more based on
nurse-patient assistance and care (Antunes, 2007). Additionally, these fi ndings also
support previous theory in the area of assistance care jobs (Edelwich &amp; Brodsky,
1980), suggesting that people who work in health care professions are strongly
motivated by the will to help others. Furthermore, when analysing the Brazilian and
Portuguese nurse's demographic characteristics, it is clear that Portuguese nurses
spend more time working in the same institution, compared with Brazilian nurses.
Thus, they suffer less changes in their work environment. This fact is extremely
important in assistant care jobs, since professionals have an opportunity to develop
their experience of learning and personal growth in that institution (Leipold,
Schacke, &amp; Zank, 2008). On the other hand, Brazilian nurses job implies different
tasks on a daily basis, compared with the Portuguese ones. These include providing
care and support to patients, and conduct administrative work. In this way, in order
to perform these tasks Brazilian nurses are required not only to have stronger
technical knowledge in the area, but also strong management skills (e.g., decision
making, leadership, good communication skills), and administrative skills (e.g.,
organize paperwork related with equipment and reports to supervisors; Peres &amp;
Ciampone, 2006). Additionally, nurses in Brazil face innumerous changes in their work
environment. Some of these include organization shifting their mission from service
to enterprise due to serious fi nancial problems. In agreement with this point,
Guevara and Mendias (2002) suggested that Latin American countries have experienced
increased acuity in hospitalized patients and increased service demand due to
coverage expansion (because of universal coverage in Latin American countries), along
with greater emphasis on cost control. Additionally, the authors added that payment
systems for patients and providers have changed, with emphasis on reimbursement,
stricter reimbursement requirements, and strategies such as managed care. Finally,
administrative changes for Brazilian nurses include the use of organizational
matrices in which nurses appear to report to more than one supervisor, they have
responsibilities for more than one area, there is a redistribution of nursing
resources, and a focus on interdisciplinary teams. Thus, it is clear that the
profession of nurse in Brazil is related with different tasks, and more challenges
compared with the profession of nurse in Portugal. Hence, our fi ndings tend to
somehow highlight these differences, since that Brazilian nurses seem to use more
Control, possibly for facing the different tasks and changes at work. This result may
be explained by Brazilian nurses possibly believing that their actions will infl
uence work events, anticipating future threats, and decreasing in this way Emotional
Exhaustion. Additionally, the second strongest predictor of burnout among Brazilian
nurses was Commitment, suggesting that although this individual characteristic is
present in the sample, it is likely to come after the management and administrative
tasks. Finally, for the Portuguese nurses the three dimensions of hardiness are
likely to be protective factors against Depersonalization, whereas for the Brazilian
nurses only two dimensions of hardiness (commitment and control) predicted burnout.
It is believed that these fi ndings suggest that Portuguese nurses may be better
prepared to face the process of distancing from patients, when compared with
Brazilian nurses. It is important to highlight that fi ndings were similar for the
burnout dimension Personal Accomplishment across both samples. In other words,
Commitment and Control predicted Personal Accomplishment among Portuguese and
Brazilian nurses. This result can be explained by a historical and universal meaning,
related with nursing job. In support of this idea, White (2002) suggested that
nursing vocation is to be dedicated and committed to assisting another one who is
disadvantaged, seeking public recognition of their work. The variance explained by
this model was larger among Brazilian nurses (25.6%) compared with Portuguese nurses
(13%). Functional, cultural, economic and contextual factors of organizations do also
play an important role in infl uencing professional's behavior (Hofstede, 1991;
Raiger, 2005; Silva &amp; Gomes, 2009; Vanheule, Rosseel, &amp; Vlerick, 2007).
Hence, it is believed that these factors may also contribute to the explanation of
similarities and differences found in the predictive models of burnout among
Portuguese and Brazilian nurses in the current study. In agreement with this idea,
Vanheule et al. (2007) suggested that burnout differences across samples can be
influenced by differences in job content, work circumstances, and professional goals
in the respective sectors. Our results, support the idea that personality traits are
important predictors of burnout (Azeem, 2010; Ghorpade et al., 2011; Schaufeli &amp;
Enzmann, 1998; Sheard &amp; Golby, 2007). Additionally, the percentage of explanation
of the variation found in burnout in our study (between 12% and 27%) was superior to
that found previously in a study by Ghorpade et al. (2011) in the occupational
setting. Particularly, the authors found that personality provides an additional 6.9%
of explanation of the variation of emotional exhaustion; an additional 11.7%
explanation of the variation in depersonalization; and an additional 13.8% of the
variation in personal accomplishments. As suggested by Azeem (2010), the minimum
variance of 10% was considered signifi cant and meaningful. These fi ndings support
previous literature in the area, suggesting that burnout is an interaction between
variables in the work context and personality factors (Cano-Garc&#xED;a,
Padilla-Mu&#xF1;oz, &amp; Carrasco-Ortiz, 2005). In sum, some individual
characteristics such as hardiness, may work as protectors against occupational stress
and burnout among Portuguese and Brazilian nurses. A major strength of this study was
the use of a strong theoretical basis, as well as reliable and accurate instruments
for data collection purposes. Additionally, the effect size found, fi t the values
recommended by Cohen (1988). The encouraging results of this study should be
considered in light of several limitations. Firstly, as a cross-sectional study, it
precludes evaluation of temporality and causality of the observed relationships.
Further research is required using longitudinal or experimental designs. Secondly,
although sample size of the samples support the statistical analyses, results cannot
be generalized, due to samples being collected in public hospitals in a specifi c
geographic region of Brazil and Portugal. To our knowledge, this study is the fi rst
to compare the relationship between hardiness and burnout among Brazilian and
Portuguese nurses. When aiming to achieve a competent system of care, research should
conduct cross-culturally studies, aiming to understand similarities and differences
between the cultures, and valuing diversity (Cross Bazron, Dennis, &amp; Isaacs,
1989). Careful should be drawn when designing immediate defi nitive practical
interventions based on the results of this study. However, it is important to
highlight that applied practitioners in the area, should aim to increase hardiness
training among Brazilian and Portuguese nurses when aiming to prevent burnout. As
suggested by Maddi (2008) this personality construct is actively developed through a
dynamic process. In other words, although life is stressful because it is always
changing, people can turn stressful life events into opportunities for growth.
Despite limitations, our results are consistent with previous trends in studies
conducted in different clinical, cultural and social contexts around the world,
adding considerable credibility to the fi ndings. It is believed that this sort of
cross-cultural research among nurses develops the theoretical knowledge in the area
of cultural diversity among this profession, and provides an important basis for the
design of applied interventions.<component x="70.87" y="68.14" width="215.39"

study investigated and compared the infl uence of hardiness in burnout among
Portuguese and Brazilian nurses, as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory- Human
Service Survey (MBI-HSS) and the Personal Views Survey (PVS). The sample consisted of
630 nurses working in hospitals (394 Portuguese, 236 Brazilians). The statistical
analysis using multiple linear regression showed that hardiness is a personality
trait that explains burnout, presenting different predictive models for each sample.
Results suggested that overall work characteristics and work settings of Portuguese
and Brazilian nurses explained the differences found between the samples. Findings
suggested that future applied interventions aiming to reduce burnout among Portuguese
and Brazilian nurses, should contemplate Keywords different hardiness dimensions. :

received increased attention over the last years across nations. This fact is
associated with a global change in socio economic factors, particularly moving from
an economy based on industry to an economy based on services. Consequently, this
change caused increased demands for professionals, experiencing more and more
psychological pressure over time (Schaufeli, Leiter, &amp; Maslach, 2009). Maslach
and Jackson (1981) defi ned burnout symptoms as: (a) emotional exhaustion, in which
professionals feel that they are no longer able to cope at a psychological level; (b)
depersonalization (or cynicism), characterized as negative and cynical attitudes and
feelings towards clients. The last dimension represents the interpersonal context
dimension of burnout (c) reduced effi cacy or personal accomplishment, understood as
the professionals' tendency to evaluate oneself negatively, particularly their work
with clients. It is related with feelings of incompetence and a lack of achievement
at work. Nursing has been considered the most stressful profession among health care
workers (Pisanti, Van der Doef, Maes, Lazzari, &amp; Bertini, 2011). This is likely
to be related with the different demands nurses face in the work context. Several
work stressors experienced by nurses have been described in the literature. As an
example, Gray-Toft and Anderson (1981) have identifi ed stressors related with:
physical environment (eg. workload); social environment stressors (eg. confl ict with
staff) and psychological environmental stressors (eg. death and dying, lack of staff
support, uncertainty associated with treatment, and lack of preparation to deal with
the emotional needs of patients and their families). Furthermore, as suggested by a
report developed by Pricewaterhouse Coopers (2002) nurses enter the health care fi
eld with the believe that they will have the time, the resources, and continued
support to meet the needs of their patients and give them a high level of quality
care. However, as suggested by the same report. Hence, due to all these factors,
nurses are likely to be more prone to burnout, which may negatively affect the
quality of nursing care, increase turnover, absenteeism and reduced productivity
(Raiger, 2005). Added to this fact, individual characteristics have shown to also
infl uence nurses' experience of stress in the work context (Saksvik-Lehouilliera et
al., 2012). Additionally, culture appears to be an important concept infl uencing
burnout levels among nurses (Turnipseed &amp; Turnipseed, 1997). However, little is
known about the infl uence of personality factors predicting burnout among nurses
across different cultures, especially between Portugal and Brazil. Since as suggested
by Triandis and Suh (2002) there are both universal and culture-specifi c aspects of
variation in personality. It would be interesting to further understand the
differences in personality factors predicting burnout among nurses across cultures.
Furthermore, as nursing is a profession that involves cultural care diversity
(Leininger, 1978) it seems critical to further understand how personality factors
across cultures predict nurses' burnout in order to design cultural sensitive
interventions. The model of Burnout proposed by Maslach, Schaufeli, and Leiter (2001)
emphasizes the importance of work characteristics and context as predictors of
burnout. However, it is lkely that personality traits also play an important role in
the development of burnout. Although some evidence has emerged supporting this view,
little is known about this particular relationship (Azeem, 2010; Ghorpade, Lackritz,
&amp; Singh, 2007). In a meta-analysis conducted by Alarcon, Eschleman and Bowling
(2009) examining the relationship between personality and burnout, it was found that
self-esteem, self-effi cacy, locus of control, emotional stability, extraversion,
conscientiousness, agreeableness, positive affectivity, negative affectivity,
optimism, proactive personality, and hardiness were associated with the three
dimensions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Particularly, hardiness showed the
stronger relationship with all the three dimensions of burnout compared with the
other personality factors under study. As recommended by the authors, these fi ndings
highlight the need to further examine the relationship between hardiness and burnout.
Hardiness has been defi ned as a personality construct that refl ects the extent to
which a person is able to face stressors without experiencing ill effects, such as
psychological or physical strains (Kobasa, 1979). Kobasa suggested that the concept
is a resilience resource that can be applied in stressful situations and which is
assumed to protect the person from stress. Hence, the construct has emerged as an
important buffer in the relationship between stressors and illness (Maddi, 1999).
Hardiness comprises a high sense of life and work commitment, perceptions of control,
and high openness to change and challenge, as well as a more positive appraisal of
stress. Thus, the dimensions of commitment, control and challenge defi ne the
construct of hardiness (Kobasa, Maddi, &amp; Puccetti, 1982). Commitment refl ects a
dedication to oneself and to one's work. Control is the extent to which an individual
infl uences life events to ensure a particular outcome. Challenge refers to the
extent to which individuals perceive challenges as opportunities. Risquez,
Fern&#xE1;ndez and S&#xE1;nchez-Meca (2011) suggested that hardiness infl uences the
person's health through the type and intensity of the stressors experienced, and by
restricting or assisting the use of specifi c coping strategies. This idea is also
supported by research conducted by Beehr and Bowling (2005) examining hardiness as a
moderator of stressor-strain relationships. More specifi cally, hardiness is expected
to yield a negative relationship with burnout via effects on both the perceived and
objective nature of the work environment (Alarcon et al., 2009). In what concerns to
the relationship between personality and burnout among nurses, some evidence has been
found in the literature (e.g., Boyle Grap, Younger, &amp; Thornby, 1991; Ghorpade,
Lackritz, &amp; Gangaram, 2011; Phillips, 2011; Risquez et al., 2011;
SaksvikLehouilliera et al., 2012; Simoni &amp; Paterson, 1997). In particular,
hardiness has shown to be a protector in the process of burnout among nurses
(Garrosa, Rainho, Moreno-Jim&#xE9;nez, &amp; Monteiro, 2010). Additionally, how
individual differences infl uence the stress-strain outcomes seems to be an important
topic of research in today's increasingly culturally mixed work environments
(Gy&#xF6;rk&#xF6;s, Becker, Massoudi, Bruin, &amp; Rossier, 2012). In agreement with
this idea, Smith, Fisher, and Sale (2001) suggested that recently the need for
cross-cultural studies in Occupational Psychology (OP) research has become more and
more evident. Despite this necessity, cross-cultural studies in OP are not very
common, mostly due to methodological diffi culties of cross-cultural research (Smith
et al., 2001). Thus, the current study aimed to compare whether there was a different
predictive model of hardiness in burnout for Portuguese and Brazilian nurses. Since
this study is exploratory in nature, therefore no detailed hypothesis can be
presented. However, contemplating nursing job characteristics variations across both
countries, it is hypothesized that different dimensions of hardiness would predict
burnout for Brazilian and Portuguese nurses. Findings from this original research
study, will develop the theoretical knowledge in the area of cross-cultural research
in OP, and will highly contribute to the applied fi eld of nursing.<component

cross-sectional in nature (Grimes &amp; Shulz, 2002) and was conducted in Portuguese
and Brazilian' hospitals. Data was collected across four large public general
hospitals (1500 to 5000 employees) located in a major metropolitan city of both
countries (PortoPortugal and Porto Alegre-Brazil). Participants included 630 nurses
(394 Portuguese, 236 Brazilians). Portuguese sample' mean age was 34.3 (SD = 8.3)
years old. Most were women (77.2%), married (56.0%), had children (61.0%), and were
in permanent positions (68.4%). Participants worked in that hospital an average
length of 10.2 years (SD = 7.9). Brazilian sample mean age was 34 (SD = 8.2) years
old. Participants were women (81.4%), married (61.9%), had children (66.9%), and
worked with the remainder in temporary positions of varying contract length (58.2%).
Participants had worked in a hospital an average length of 2.5 years (SD = 3.9). vity
(worked in other institution), time working in that institution. Maslach Burnout
Inventory - Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS; Maslach &amp; Jackson, 1981). The
instrument was validated to Portuguese language by Carlotto and C&#xE2;mara (2007).
The MBI is a 22-item scale designed to measure three dimensions of BS: Emotional
exhaustion (9 items), Depersonalization (5 items), and Personal accomplishment (8
items). Each item is answered on a fi ve-point response scale ranging from 1 (never)
to 5 (everyday). A separate score was calculated for each of the three subscales.
Personal Views Survey (PVS). Developed by Kobasa (1982), was used to assess
hardiness, with a version adapted and translated to Portuguese language by Mallar and
Capit&#xE3;o (2004). This instrument consists of 50 items measuring hardiness trait,
composed by three dimensions: Commitment (16 items), Control (17 items) and Challenge
(17 items). The frequency with which the subject experiences feelings relating to
each scale is rated on a four point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all true) to
3 (completely true). A separate score was calculated for each of the three subscales.
Procedure Hospitals management teams were contacted, to explain and present the aims
of the study. Following research ethics approval from university and hospitals,
permission was given to contact nurse's team leaders and schedule data collection
procedures using anonymous questionnaires. The instruments used were part of a larger
study on occupational health psychology in the workplaces. In the Brazilian sample,
questionnaire pack was fulfi lled in the presence of a researcher. In the Portuguese
sample, questionnaires were handed in to participants and returned by post to the
researcher. Fulfi llment of the questionnaire took approximately 20 minutes to
complete. Data collection for both countries was collected over the year of 2010. All
participants were informed that their answers would be treated anonymously and confi

analyses are showed in Table 3 for Portuguese nurses and in Table 4 for Brazilian
nurses. For the Portuguese nurses, results obtained for the dimension of Emotional
Exhaustion suggested that the predictor model is characterized by the dimensions of
Commitment and Challenge. This regression model explained 27% of the variance of
Emotional Exhaustion, revealing the highest explanatory power compared with other
dimensions of burnout. In what concerns to Depersonalization for the Portuguese
nurses, the fi nal model was explained by the dimensions of Commitment, Challenge and
Control by almost 22.3% of the variance. Commitment and Control together accounted
for almost 13.8% of the variance in Personal Accomplishment. In what relates to the
results for the Portuguese nurses, it was found that Commitment ( = -.372 ) and
Challenge ( = -.193) had a negative relation with Emotional Exhaustion, suggesting
that high levels of Commitment and Challenge predicted lower levels of Emotional
Exhaustion at work. Depersonalization seemed to decrease, as Commitment ( = -.189),
Challenge ( = -.127), and Control ( = -.156) increased. Personal Accomplishment was
positively related with Commitment ( = .219) and Control ( = .146). Among Portuguese

The results revealed a negative relation between Emotional Exhaustion, Commitment ( =

tend to decrease Emotional Exhaustion at work. Depersonalization was negatively
predicted by Control ( = -.256). Personal Accomplishment was predicted by Commitment
and Control. These results revealed a positive relation between the burnout dimension
Personal Accomplishment, and the hardiness dimensions Commitment ( = .298), and

to explore whether there was a different predictive model of hardiness in burnout for
Portuguese and Brazilian nurses. Results partially support our hypothesis that the
predictive model of hardiness in burnout among nurses in these two countries is
mainly different, except for personal accomplishment. Additionally, although the
values were relatively low, our fi ndings showed that all the dimensions of hardiness
were related with burnout for both the Portuguese and Brazilian nurses. Hence, in
agreement with previous research (e.g., Azeem, 2010; Ebling &amp; Carlotto, 2012;
Garrosa et al., 2010), our results suggest that hardiness, as personality trait, is
likely to explain only part of the experience of burnout for Portuguese and Brazilian
nurses. Results suggest that there are differences between nurses in Brazil and
Portugal in what concerns to variables explaining Emotional Exhaustion and
Depersonalization. Particularly, for Portuguese nurses, it seems that Commitment was
the personality trait that best explained variability in burnout. On the other hand,
for Brazilian nurses, Control seemed to be the most important variable explaining
burnout. We believe that these fi ndings can be partially explained by the
differences in the type and context of work nurses face in each one of the countries.
Furthermore, these results are likely to be related with the overall work culture of
each country. In Portugal, nurses job, involves spending most of their time involved
in direct patient care, independently of their health status. Thus, the relationship
developed between the nurse and the patient has almost a therapeutic effect. Until
recently, nurses in Portugal were expected to establish a strong nurse-patient
relationship, besides the technical skills required in caring. Nurses were also
required to show empathy and kindness for the patient health status and support
patient empowerment (Amendoeira, 2006). When analyzing the Portuguese nurses in our
study, the best predictors of Emotional Exhaustion for these participants were
Commitment and Challenge. It is believed that these fi ndings may be explained by the
professional emphasis of nurses' job in Portugal, since it is more based on
nurse-patient assistance and care (Antunes, 2007). Additionally, these fi ndings also
support previous theory in the area of assistance care jobs (Edelwich &amp; Brodsky,
1980), suggesting that people who work in health care professions are strongly
motivated by the will to help others. Furthermore, when analysing the Brazilian and
Portuguese nurse's demographic characteristics, it is clear that Portuguese nurses
spend more time working in the same institution, compared with Brazilian nurses.
Thus, they suffer less changes in their work environment. This fact is extremely
important in assistant care jobs, since professionals have an opportunity to develop
their experience of learning and personal growth in that institution (Leipold,
Schacke, &amp; Zank, 2008). On the other hand, Brazilian nurses job implies different
tasks on a daily basis, compared with the Portuguese ones. These include providing
care and support to patients, and conduct administrative work. In this way, in order
to perform these tasks Brazilian nurses are required not only to have stronger
technical knowledge in the area, but also strong management skills (e.g., decision
making, leadership, good communication skills), and administrative skills (e.g.,
organize paperwork related with equipment and reports to supervisors; Peres &amp;
Ciampone, 2006). Additionally, nurses in Brazil face innumerous changes in their work
environment. Some of these include organization shifting their mission from service
to enterprise due to serious fi nancial problems. In agreement with this point,
Guevara and Mendias (2002) suggested that Latin American countries have experienced
increased acuity in hospitalized patients and increased service demand due to
coverage expansion (because of universal coverage in Latin American countries), along
with greater emphasis on cost control. Additionally, the authors added that payment
systems for patients and providers have changed, with emphasis on reimbursement,
stricter reimbursement requirements, and strategies such as managed care. Finally,
administrative changes for Brazilian nurses include the use of organizational
matrices in which nurses appear to report to more than one supervisor, they have
responsibilities for more than one area, there is a redistribution of nursing
resources, and a focus on interdisciplinary teams. Thus, it is clear that the
profession of nurse in Brazil is related with different tasks, and more challenges
compared with the profession of nurse in Portugal. Hence, our fi ndings tend to
somehow highlight these differences, since that Brazilian nurses seem to use more
Control, possibly for facing the different tasks and changes at work. This result may
be explained by Brazilian nurses possibly believing that their actions will infl
uence work events, anticipating future threats, and decreasing in this way Emotional
Exhaustion. Additionally, the second strongest predictor of burnout among Brazilian
nurses was Commitment, suggesting that although this individual characteristic is
present in the sample, it is likely to come after the management and administrative
tasks. Finally, for the Portuguese nurses the three dimensions of hardiness are
likely to be protective factors against Depersonalization, whereas for the Brazilian
nurses only two dimensions of hardiness (commitment and control) predicted burnout.
It is believed that these fi ndings suggest that Portuguese nurses may be better
prepared to face the process of distancing from patients, when compared with
Brazilian nurses. It is important to highlight that fi ndings were similar for the
burnout dimension Personal Accomplishment across both samples. In other words,
Commitment and Control predicted Personal Accomplishment among Portuguese and
Brazilian nurses. This result can be explained by a historical and universal meaning,
related with nursing job. In support of this idea, White (2002) suggested that
nursing vocation is to be dedicated and committed to assisting another one who is
disadvantaged, seeking public recognition of their work. The variance explained by
this model was larger among Brazilian nurses (25.6%) compared with Portuguese nurses
(13%). Functional, cultural, economic and contextual factors of organizations do also
play an important role in infl uencing professional's behavior (Hofstede, 1991;
Raiger, 2005; Silva &amp; Gomes, 2009; Vanheule, Rosseel, &amp; Vlerick, 2007).
Hence, it is believed that these factors may also contribute to the explanation of
similarities and differences found in the predictive models of burnout among
Portuguese and Brazilian nurses in the current study. In agreement with this idea,
Vanheule et al. (2007) suggested that burnout differences across samples can be
influenced by differences in job content, work circumstances, and professional goals
in the respective sectors. Our results, support the idea that personality traits are
important predictors of burnout (Azeem, 2010; Ghorpade et al., 2011; Schaufeli &amp;
Enzmann, 1998; Sheard &amp; Golby, 2007). Additionally, the percentage of explanation
of the variation found in burnout in our study (between 12% and 27%) was superior to
that found previously in a study by Ghorpade et al. (2011) in the occupational
setting. Particularly, the authors found that personality provides an additional 6.9%
of explanation of the variation of emotional exhaustion; an additional 11.7%
explanation of the variation in depersonalization; and an additional 13.8% of the
variation in personal accomplishments. As suggested by Azeem (2010), the minimum
variance of 10% was considered signifi cant and meaningful. These fi ndings support
previous literature in the area, suggesting that burnout is an interaction between
variables in the work context and personality factors (Cano-Garc&#xED;a,
Padilla-Mu&#xF1;oz, &amp; Carrasco-Ortiz, 2005). In sum, some individual
characteristics such as hardiness, may work as protectors against occupational stress
and burnout among Portuguese and Brazilian nurses. A major strength of this study was
the use of a strong theoretical basis, as well as reliable and accurate instruments
for data collection purposes. Additionally, the effect size found, fi t the values
recommended by Cohen (1988). The encouraging results of this study should be
considered in light of several limitations. Firstly, as a cross-sectional study, it
precludes evaluation of temporality and causality of the observed relationships.
Further research is required using longitudinal or experimental designs. Secondly,
although sample size of the samples support the statistical analyses, results cannot
be generalized, due to samples being collected in public hospitals in a specifi c
geographic region of Brazil and Portugal. To our knowledge, this study is the fi rst
to compare the relationship between hardiness and burnout among Brazilian and
Portuguese nurses. When aiming to achieve a competent system of care, research should
conduct cross-culturally studies, aiming to understand similarities and differences
between the cultures, and valuing diversity (Cross Bazron, Dennis, &amp; Isaacs,
1989). Careful should be drawn when designing immediate defi nitive practical
interventions based on the results of this study. However, it is important to
highlight that applied practitioners in the area, should aim to increase hardiness
training among Brazilian and Portuguese nurses when aiming to prevent burnout. As
suggested by Maddi (2008) this personality construct is actively developed through a
dynamic process. In other words, although life is stressful because it is always
changing, people can turn stressful life events into opportunities for growth.
Despite limitations, our results are consistent with previous trends in studies
conducted in different clinical, cultural and social contexts around the world,
adding considerable credibility to the fi ndings. It is believed that this sort of
