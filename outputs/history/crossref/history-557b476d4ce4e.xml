(2005b) and other recent work ((2005a, 2006, 2008), Robin Hahnel proposes and defends
a monolithic metric of economic desert: to e(ach according to effort or sacrifice. In
what follows, I criticize from an egalitarian stan(dpoint this meritocratic
distributive principle on theoretical, normative, and practical grounds.( I conclude
my critique by questioning his argument that in market socialism the allocation of
labor cannot accommodate an egalitarian distribution of labor income. Hahnel and
Milton Friedman are one in identifying socialist and capitalist markets with respect
to the distributive functi(on of prices and both are wrong. My treatment of Hahnel's
work proceeds in the context of larger debates about concepts of justice and the
distributive institutions that might suit them. Before confronting Hahnel's case, let
me establish a framework that treats the concept of desert. Joel Feinberg, in his
seminal work Doing and Deserving (1970) provides a largely noncontroversial analysis:
to deserve something one must possess some charac(teristic or have done something
that constitutes the desert bases for which she is (to some ex(tent) responsible,
which is to say "under her control." Further, Feinberg and almost all desert
theorists distinguish between pre-institutional desert and institutional entitlement,
with the former s(erving as a principle that assesses the justice of the latter. To
paraphrase Serena Olsaretti (2004: 16-17): institutional entitlement rewards
individuals by the rules and purposes within which desert( claims are
registered;<component x="62.37" y="127.97" width="385.57" height="203.07" page="1"

intuitive or "natural" understandings not reducible to the rules and purposes of
institutions. She uses as a pr(e-institutional example that of hard-working people
who deserve rewards for their efforts. But we know that some distributive
institutions, e.g. the market, do not systematically reward people i(n proportion to
their effortful work. In such cases, they are entitled to their rewards even though
they do not deserve them. Entitlements, or "legitimate expectations," as John Rawls
dub(s them (1999: 273-77), proceed from institutional conventions, leaving open the
question of whether these expectations are deserved, which is not to deny that
sometimes pre-institutional desert an(d institutional entitle2 ment overlap. Indeed,
some theories of justice, e.g. Hahnel's, seek to jibe desert with entitlements.
Whether this is practically feasible-Rawls thinks not-is a topic I (address later on.
We find in the literature two preeminent contenders for desert bases in mo(dern
economies: contribution and effort. Should individuals working in an economy along
with others, engaged( in joint production, be rewarded differentially according to
effort or contribution, or both? Hahnel argues persuasively that contribution
theories fall short of the ethical re(quirements of pre-institutional desert and
matching institutional entitlements. He addr(esses "conservative" and "liberal"
maxims. According to the first, payment to individuals proceeds "according to (the
value of one's personal contribution and the contribution of the productive property
o(ne owns"; on the latter view, payment proceeds "according to the value of one's
personal contribution only." The conservative maxim runs up against the liberal
complaint that payment acc(ruing from inherited wealth is not deserved. But what
underlies that complaint, namely that in(dividuals deserve only what they are
personally responsible for, can be turned against the liberal maxim itself. This is
because, says Hahnel (2006: 184-85), many "differences in people's productivities are
due to intrinsic qualities of people themselves, which are beyond their control (. .
. . The bottom line is that the 'genetic lottery' [e.g., involving talent] greatly
influences how valuable a person's con3 tribution will be. Yet the genetic lottery is
no more fair than the inheritance lottery." So far we have Hahnel's rejection of
contribution as a pre-institutional basis of economic desert. He also argues well
that even if one honors pre-institutionally the contribution t(heory, markets fail
systematically to deliver entitlements in line with it. One( thorny issue consists in
how, theoretically and practically, markets sort out the value of individual
contributions from the value of jointly produced products. The marginal theory of
productivity is usually summoned here, but it lacks both explanatory and
justificatory power. As Hahnel says (2005b: 136), according to that theory, "the
marginal [contribution] of an input depends as much on the number of other units of
that input available, and on the quality and quantity of other, complimentary inputs,
as on any intrinsic quality of the additional input itself." Hahnel( might have also
mentioned the damage inflicted on marginal productivity theory during the 1960s

"understandings" deliberately. Intuitions, as considered here, reflect not mere
feelings but also reasons that "unearth the justificatory arguments that underlie
them" (Sher 1987: 19). 2 To get the sense of the distinction: we say that the best
football team deserved to win, but because of a freak thunder storm at the last
minute of play that turned the tables it was entitled to lose according to the rules
of the game. This is not to deny that "well-designed arrangements may help to avoid(
large discrepancies between deservingness and success, [but] this is not always
possible" ((Rawls 2001: 74). 3 "To reward and punish people for things they cannot
control violates a basi(c tenet of social justice" (Hahnel 2005b: 137). Hahnel
advocates what contemporary philosophers call "l(uck egalitarianism." "The intuitive
idea [luck egalitarians] all share is that persons should not be disadvantaged simply
on account of bad or good luck . . . . After all, if we accept the premise that
individuals are equal moral agen(ts, then it seems to follow that individuals can
only be held responsible for outcomes that are due to their own choices but not due
to circumstances over which they exercise no agential control" (T(an 2008: 665,

capital in which Joan Robinson (1966) e(laborated the theoretical shortcomings of
attempts to separate the marginal contributions labor and capital, complete with
ethically profound and negative consequences for the marginal productivity theory of
distribution among owners of different factors of production (see DiQuattro 1978:
871-2). Daniel Attas (2003: 100-01) sums up much of this in his critique of David
Mil(ler's (1990) influential defense of the market as an institution that can reward
individuals acco(rding to contribution. Given the distribution of talents, the level
of technology, and the distribution of tastes, there is normally more than one
possible [market] equilibrium. The distribution of income enters at both ends of the
explanation of value: first, as a factor in th(e determination of prices; second, as
the outcome of market prices. This suggests that the distribution of income and the
price vector at equilibrium are mutually sustaining. A disequilibrating shock to the
system would not necessarily result in a fluctuating reversi(on to a unique stable
point. There is, therefore, no unique value that the producer deserves. So, the
(value defined as (an) equilibrium price turns out to be completely morally
ar(bitrary from a moral point of view. But wait, there is more. In addition to the
weakness of neoclassical models of the marginal productivity theory of distribution,
there is the brute fact that, even i(f they withstand criticism, their bearing on the
real world of capitalist markets lacks credible application. When we step outside of
neoclassical textbooks, we find that labor incomes in capitali(st market economies
are not set by "pure" market forces. There are factors within the "constraints" of
the real world of market economies that play routinely a role in determining wages
and salaries; in addition to oligopolies and other imperfections, there are taxation
and regulative la(w, collective bargaining, historical precedent, cultural factors,
various government policies, and (so on. We know, e.g., that there is strong rigidity
in the ordinal wage ranking of most occupations. Even in recessionary times, wages do
not fall as predicted by the conventional equilibrium pri(ce-auction model of 4
neoclassical economics (see Bewley 2000). The foregoing supports the conclusion that
market entitlements do not fi(t pre-institutional desert based on individual
contribution. This is, of course, not a peculiarly "leftist" or egalitarian view.
Milton Friedman understands that markets, especially in their "perfectively
competitive" form, are no respecters of economic desert, whether its basis is
contrib(ution or effort. "Most differences in status or position or wealth can be
regarded as the product (of chance at a far enough remove . . . ." According to
Friedman, chance determines our genetic makeup and, to some extent, our mental and
physical capacities as well as differential opportunities that derive<component

marginal productivity theory of distribution within the neoclassical price-auction
model in which "the labor market is treated as if it were like an(y other market in
which price (wage) is the short-term market-clearing mechanism" (Thurow 1983: 181).
The problem with the model, unless it builds in tautology, is its failure to account
for the "exogenous" determination of wa(ges in actual market systems. Thurow traces
the model's deficiency to the micro-foundations of neoclassical economics. Hahnel (
displays an ambivalent stance towards the marginal productivity theory of
distribution. As we have seen (above), he is wary about its ability to separate
individual from colle(ctive contribution. Still, he relies on it to score ethical
points against market entitlements. "When young people flock to join the profession I
have labored in for twenty years, my marginal revenue product declines [and I thus
'earn' less salary]" (2005b: 137). If professor Hahnel is referring to university
teaching, academic (tenure obviously gets in the way of the theory, but "the
protection of tenure or its equivalent (seniority hiring a(nd firing, offers to work
for less are rejected) seems to exist almost everywhere in the labor market" ((Thurow
1983: 192).<component x="62.36" y="68.15" width="385.31" height="142.45" page="3"

environments into which we are born, not to men(tion the choices that other people
are always making in markets set against these morally-indi(fferent natural and
institutional backgrounds (Friedman 1962: 165-6). Friedman may have ta(ken his cue on
this from his mentor at the University of Chicago's school of economics, Frank Knight
(1935: 64-5, 68), who went further by reflecting on the intimate connection between
(those twins of moral arbitrariness: luck and power. Consider this gem. Everyone is
compelled to play the economic game and be judged by his succ(ess in playing it. The
luck element is so large-far larger than fairly successful players in the game will
admit-that capacity and effort may count for nothing. And this luck element works
cumulatively, as in gambling games generally . . . . Differences in the capacity to
play the game are inordinately great from one person to another. But as the game is
organized, the weak contestants are thrown in with the strong in one grand melee;
there is no( classification of the participants or distribution of handicaps such as
always recognized t(o be necessary to sportsmanship when unevenly matched contestants
are to meet. In fact the situation is worse still; there are handicaps, but as we
have seen, they are distribut(ed to the advantage of the strong rather than the weak
. . . . It is terms of power, then, if at all, that competitive economies and the
competitive view of life for which it must be largely accountable are to be
justified. Whether we are to regard them as justified at all depends on whether we
are 5 willing to accept an ethics of power as the basis of our world view. As I
interpret these passages, Friedman discounts pre-institutional deser(t, Knight
credits it, but both agree that market entitlements do not systematically match
deser(t bases, whether contribution or effort. In contrast to "conservative" and
"liberal" distributive maxi(ms, based on contribution, Hahnel endorses the "radical"
maxim: "to each according to personal sac(rifice, or effort" (2005a: 137). Now this
needs some unpacking since the conjunction "or" can be put( to different uses.
Consider: an unmarried man or a bachelor; a table or a chair. In the first case, "or"
expresses an identity and in the second a difference. Hahnel apparently identifies
effort with sacrifice. "By effort, I simply mean personal sacrifice or inconveniences
incurred in performing one's economic duties . . . . According [to this] maxim, no
other consideration (other than differential sacrifice) can justify one person
[getting more income] than another" ( (2005a: 137, emphasis added). This is
problematical, though, because Hahnel uses "or" in an equiv(ocal way. He says that
"effort takes many forms. It may be longer hours, less pleasant hours, [and (so on]"
(2005a: 137). But duration of labor is not necessarily a proxy for sacrifice because
some people enjoy working long and hard at certain tasks, so Hahnel must mean that
only tho(se longer hours that are sacrificial count in his metric of desert. Yet his
assertion that "I can decide to work longer hours or work more intensely than others
and qualify for greater rewards"( (2005a: 138) implies that his measure consists in
duration and intensity. I am not just splitting definitional hairs; important
practical consequences follow from Hahnel's equivocation. I take Hahnel to mean by
effort sacrifice. If so, intractable problems of measurement arise since, u(nlike
duration and intensity, sacrifice is less open to inter-personal comparison,
standardization, and publicity. I will expand on this concern later on, but it is one
that moves practically-min(ded theorists to define<component x="49.61" y="583.91"

of duration, "the most common criterion su(ggested in the past" (Lamont 1995: 223).
Against contribution-based theories of desert, Hahnel commits to a pre-i(nstitutional
theory whose sole basis is differential sacrifice; he then argues that market
entitlements fail to square with desert, so understood. I think he is largely right
about market entitlements, but he assumes rashly that a sacrificial basis satisfies
the requirement of what he inc(ludes as an essential ingredient of distributional
justice, namely that individuals fully control, (and thus are responsible for, what
it is that warrants their differential desert, namely their effort. As opposed "to
differences [due to] circumstance, talent, training, luck . . . people control only
(their effort" (Hahnel 2005a: 137). John Rawls famously objects. We do not deserve
our place in the distribution of natural endowments, any more than we deserve our
initial starting place in society. That we deserve the superior character that
enables us to make the effort to cultivate our capacities is also problematic; for
such character depends in good part upon fortunate family and social circumstances(
in early life for which we can claim no credit. The notion of desert does not apply
here (1999, 89). [It] seems clear that the effort a person is willing to make is
influenced by his natural abilities ( and skills and the alternatives open to him.
The better endowed are more likely, other things equal, to strive conscientiously,
and there seems to be no way to discount for their greater good fortune. The idea of
rewarding desert is impracticable. (1999: 274) Robert Nozick (1974: 213-16) initiated
a serious misreading of these pa(ssages, playing on the expression "can claim no
credit" for family and social circumstances and moving illicitly to the 6 conclusion
that a person's effortful capacity is fully determined. But as the passages show,
Rawls is saying instead it is only those influences which play a "good part" that are
not creditable, not that individuals can claim no credit for effort, namely the
effortful capacities they have 7 cultivated in addition to those influences. "In good
part" does no(t mean in "whole part." As G. A. Cohen (1989: 914) says of Nozick's
mischievous reading, "influenced" does not mean "wholly determined," and so it does
not follow that, for Rawls, eff(ort deserves no reward at all as in the determinist
doctrines with which Nozick, complicit in a long tr(adition of anti-egalitarian
rhetoric, seeks to saddle Rawls. Rawls does not rule out altogether effort as a
desert basis, and he certainly rules in personal responsibility for choosing
preferences and g(oals. Cohen cites pertinent passages in which Rawls holds citizens
responsible if they cultivate expe(nsive tastes that unjustly pressure scarce public
resources; they could have chosen otherwise, "a(nd if and when they press for
compensation, others are entitled to insist that they themselves bear( the cost 'of
their lack of foresight or self-discipline'" (Cohen 1989: 913-15). Rawls is no

"[Rawls's] line of argument can [my italics] succeed in blocking the introduction of
a person's autonomous choices and actions . . . only by attributing everything
noteworthy about the person to certain sorts of 'external' factors." Other
commentators slip from the subjunctive to the indicat(ive and predictive, e.g. "there
will be no room for pre-institutional desert" (Sher 1987: 22); "virtu(ally all of the
characteristics that distinguish us from one another are rooted in natural or social
factors over which we have no control" (Steinberger 1989: 56); "the notion of natural
or pre-institutional desert evaporates" and "since we are simply products of the
Natural Lottery," so does the notion of self-respect since that is not deserved
either (Pojman 1999: 284, 295). 7 In the first edition of Theory of Justice (1971:
104), Rawls uses the expression "in large part." But what does that entail? 51
percent? 75 percent? Rawls clearly leaves some room for pre-institutional personal
desert.<component x="62.36" y="68.13" width="385.33" height="130.48" page="5"

qualms about according desert largesse in his (or any) egalitarian theory of
distributive justice? It is impracticable, he says, to sort out in any systematic way
desert from morally arbitrary factors, especially on the institutional level. With
respect to effortful capacities, they are distributed unequally among individuals
due, in part, to fortunate circum(stances for which they are not responsible. And
some by virtue of natural abilities are better able to accomplish tasks and therefore
more likely to become motivated to stri(ve, whereas those with lesser abilities are
likely to become frustrated and slack off in their efforts to excel, with the result
that more naturally talented people score better on an effort metric. Rawls's first
point rests on biological and sociological evidence and the second on psychological
insi(ght, both of which find support in our informed common sense or reflective
intuitions (Rawls 199(9: 89). In addition to Rawls's two points, consider the tight
connection between effort and contribution and how the latter influences the rewards
attached to the former. Effort and contribution mesh in ways that effort theorists,
such as Hahnel, cannot reasonably isolate from one anothe(r. Even among those who
exercise effort equally (assuming its discrete measurement), Hahnel discounts the
(efforts of those who fall short of their "economic duty" or "social endeavo(r," by
which he must mean contributing to social welfare as measured by the demand of others
for which the contributors are not fully responsible. So not all equally effortful
work is to be equally rewarded. As Lamont (1995: 215) argues, theorists who play up
effort as the sole desert basis "are also committed, despite appearances, to
increasing the social product . . . which undermines any (sharp distinction between
effort- and productivity-based distributive proposals." The bottom line is that it is
difficult to separate systematically desert from morally arbitrary factors. That is
why Rawls and those of us who suspect appeals to effort as a desert basis are wary
about according it a (or the, as in Hahnel's case) decisive place in a theory of
justice. This is not to deny that we can be roughly successful in parochial
circumstances whic(h epistemically enable reliable assessments. For example, parents
say of Billy that he is putting in more effort than Suzie in their household chores;
or a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse, who ge(ts to know her students, is positioned
to give Billy a "C" in performance and an "A" i(n effort, whereas Suzie gets a "B" in
performance and a "C" for effort. In settings such as these, we usually try to give
desert based on effort some of its due. But is this feasible in an economy involving
tens o(f millions of individuals impersonally related? And which institutions can
accomplish such a daunting task? It is difficult enough at the pre-institutional
level. How do we go about ranking (occupations and the individuals who occupy them
according to the metric of differential cost or sacrifice? Hahnel's (2006: 185)
featured illustration compares the surgeon and the garbage collector, portraying the
highly-paid surgeon as putting in less effortful hours than the poorly-paid garbage
man. According to Hahnel, this is unjust. Feinberg (1973: 117), to the contrary,
thinks that according to the effort principle, hard-working doctors and corporate
executives should rece(ive exactly the same remuneration as hard-working laborers.
The laborer's work may be dirty and dangerous, but the professional's involves more
responsibility and mental pressure. And we can go on and on: from accountants through
zoologists; imagine the difficulty judging relative effort levels required by
different types of inter and intra occupations, or branches of the economy. Further,
not only occupations need be ranked, but also, and especially, the individuals who
fit these jobs, and this gets us into the hoary issue of the interpersonal
co(mparisons of disutility. Lamont (1995: 222-23), reflecting on failures of
utilitarian theory, wonders whether "it may be impossible to reduce everything down
to effort units and to use these in any meaningful way." Carens drives home the
point: "Some people are lucky enough to find th(eir work a great pleasure and source
of self-realization. They are likely [to] work long, intense hours. Should this lead
us to reconsider whether they deserve compensation for the 'burdens' of their work,
especially as compared with those who work shorter hours at boring, alienating
tasks?" (Consider, too, that for some people the danger of a job may be part of its
attraction. And what about the varied factors that affect the costs and benefits of
work: colleagues, bosses, job security, location, etc.? "There is no principled way
to distinguish factors that deserve compensation fro(m those that do not, and no
objective way to measure burdens for most factors" (Carens 2003: 1(59-60). Maybe
institutions, whether administrative or market, can accomplish the (calculation feat
by informing our pre-institutional intuitions. Hahnel, an "avowed market (
abolitionist" (2008: 16) and advocate of participatory administration, assigns to
compensation boa(rds at local workplaces the task of determining pay schedules that
reflect differential effort among individual workers. He leaves it to "the abilities
of workmates to reasonably judge one an(other's sacrifices and motivate one another
to work diligently and intelligently" (2005b: 138). But, as Jonathan Wolff says, this
"knowledge will be too dispersed, and its sources too unreliable,( to serve the
purpose required by the [effort] theory" (Wolff 2003: 225). Too disbursed because the
theory requires a determination of the relative efforts of individuals across an
entire economy, and, he goes on, this unreliability generates "too great a
possibility of corruption," th(at can accompany the application of criteria not
adequately publicly accessible. This criticism weighs heavily if justice must satisfy
a publicity requirement, which says that it should be possible to confirm( whether or
not a principle of justice is being followed. If in a cooperative enterprise, say a(n
economy at the national level, "cooperators in which each must know that others are
cooperatin(g-they are bound by justice to cooperate only when they know that others,
too, are cooperatin(g: it would be unfair to expect them to take up the burden of
justice unless (they can know that)( others are doing so" (Cohen 2008: 347,
summarizing Williams 1998). Remember that Hahnel's desert basis is effort defined as
personal cost or disutility. Think about the epistemic hurdles that get in the way of
publicly auditing the distribution of relative effort among occupations and,
ultimately, individuals. "A feasible theory should not require access to information
we cannot acqui(re," which is not to deny the fairness of effort theory but rather to
say it is not viable, which counts importantly ( 8 against it (Wolff: 224, 227).
Further, if individuals lack assurance that others are doing their part because (they
lack access to information they cannot acquire, might they not be justified, as a
matter of personal preroga9 tive, in overriding their prima facie obligation to live
up to a distributive principle based on effort? In such a case, the corruption of the
effort principle can be caused not so much by moral laxity as by epistemic
limitation. Is it not unfair for cooperative membe(rs to bear the burdens of just
principles when they lack assurance that others are doing so? In the( face of an

problematical enough at the occupational leve(l. The epistemic problem looms even
larger at the individual level, the one that really counts: "People, not ( jobs,
deserve wages. And the wage a person deserves depends (I have argued) not only about
facts about the person's job, but also upon the facts of the person. Unfortunately,
there is no way to know, for example, each person's moral character, need, or the
amount of good and evil she has already received. Therefore there is no way to
include these factors in job evaluation schemes" (McLeod 1999: 280). But suppose
t(hat we try to overcome this epistemic challenge. At what cost? Not only is there
time and effort involved in calculation (think about how many meetings must be
devoted to determining individual effort, especially with a mobile work force).
Consider, too, the intrusion into workers' personal lives. "Why is Joe not performing
up to snuff at his job?" ask his fellow workers. "Fess up Joe, problems with drinking
too much at the p(ub, not getting along with your wife and kids, as a child you were
encouraged to be a slouch?" and so on an(d on. Hahnel's scheme involves "effort
rating committees" of workmates, whose responsibilities include o(bserving others,
collecting testimony from others, as well as self-testimony, hearing grievances, and
deciding on controversial procedures to use in calculating effort (see Hahnel 2005a:
228-34). 9 Cohen writes (2008: 10, 61): "This prerogative grants each person th(e

markets, of course, for all the reasons (nicely summed up by ( Knight in my citation
above) given by disparate thinkers ranging from Friedman to Rawls. What about
socialist markets? There are at least three different models of market socialism, all
of which share the common features of social ownership of the means of production
(excluding labor) and considerable use of markets to allocate resources, including
labor. Social ownership can take the form of worker-owned cooperatives, state-owned
enterprises controlled by workers, or p(rivatelyowned enterprises so widely held by
individuals as to count as social ownership(, as in the case 10 of John Roemer's
"voucher socialism" or John Rawls's "private property-owning democracy." The idea is
that in market socialism, whatever its form, labor markets operate against the
background of an egalitarian distribution of wealth, equality of practical
op(portunity, and full employment. Lamont (1997) argues that when these conditions
are in place, markets tend to automatically reward workers according to effort, which
is to say, as I would put it, that the procedure of the market yields a substantive
calculation of the distribution of relative effort among individuals. Suppose all
jobs were paid the same base wage rate. Then consider what would prompt a person to
choose a job different than the one she has at that rate. Lamont (1997: 35) argues
that her choice depends on the weight she accords the base wage rate( when compared
to the non-monetary costs attached to jobs with the result that she gets com(pensated
for those costs. If a job requires an incentive payment to induce people to work in
it, t(hen that means it has burdens (or disutility) over and above some (arbitrary)
base lev(el. Under the desert theory being used here, the payment will be justified
because it compens(ates for this burden (or disutility)-not because it would increase
the social pro(duct (although it will normally do that). Lamont says that these
incentive payments constitute compensatory desert as distinct from economic rents
which are greater than what is required to keep workers at their present(
occupations. Rent collection results from the relative scarcity of the worker's
factor input, something determined by natural and institutional barriers for which
the worker is not respons(ible. Economic rents, unlike incentive payments, are not
compensatory, since they exceed what is necessary to induce a worker to transfer
jobs. Socialist markets, which have the requisite egalitarian( background
institutions, tend to automatically pay labor unequally according to differential
effort so that market entitlements mesh with economic desert. This is fine, as far as
it goes, but its simplicity misleads. What is attractive is its apparent egalitarian
thrust. As Miller (1976: 111) notes, "the principle that unpleasant, onerous,

which there is no good reason should be compensated to (the point where the deprived
one is again brought back to a position of equality with his fe(llows." The idea is
that differences in pay compensate for non-monetary differences in work. Oskar Lange
(1935: 101-02), in his classic exposition of market socialism, put it this way: By
putting leisure, safety, agreeableness of work, etc., into the utility scales of
individuals, the disutility of any occupation can be represented as an opportunity
cos(t. The choice of an occupation offering a lower money income, but also a lower
disutility, may be interpreted as the purchase of leisure, safety, agreeableness of
work, etc., at a price equal to the difference between the money income earned in
that particular occupation and ot(hers. Thus the difference of incomes required by
condition 2 are only apparent. They represent prices paid by individuals for
different conditions of work. Instead of attaching different money incomes to the
various occupations the administration of a socialist econ(omy might pay all citizens
the same money income and charge a price for the pursuit of each occupation. It
becomes obvious not only that there is no contradiction between both cond(itions, but
that condition 2 is necessary to satisfy condition 1. Notice that what renders this
scheme egalitarian is its reliance on the m(etric of welfare, by which is meant
utility or preference satisfaction. The disutility involved in some work is offset or
balanced by an unequal payment of resources, by which is meant monetary income whose
expenditure yields utility that presumedly matches the disutility undergone in
disagreeable work. But just how egalitarian is this? Not only is there the usual
probl(em of commensurability that complicates the feasibility of implementation, but
even if that were( resolved, consider that monetary income, unlike the utility
experienced in certain jobs, can be s(aved and transferred to other people. As long
as the family exists, would not parents with greater incomes pass( on, inter 11
vivos, to their children benefits that are not deserved in the way required by
e(ffort theory? I do not think that effort theorists such as Hahnel successfully come
to terms with this conund(rum, made all the more difficult for them because they
believe that unequal incomes (of parents) (are deserved and therefore prima facie
inoculated against taxation and redistribution. Hahnel never tells us how much income
inequality his meritocratic scheme permits. How deep does it go? And does effort
theory justify unequal (monetary income) outcomes if, as Rawls and others hold,
effortful capacities themselves are tangled up with morally arbitrary influ(ences? As
part of an analysis of Rawls's difference principle, I once argued for a version of
effort theory that incorporated markets. I wrote that a perfectly competitive m(arket
set against the background of just institutions "tends to satisfy the compensatory
re(quirement of the difference principle." A justly ordered society, in which there
is freedom of employment, would no doubt have to award greater benefits to
individuals who undertake activities involving ( "uncertain or unstable employment,
or which are performed under hazardous and unpleasan(tly strenuous conditions . . . .
Otherwise men cannot be found to fill them. From this (circumstance arise 12 such
precepts as to each according to effort or the risks he bears" (Rawls 1999: 269).

class inequali(ties and consequent structured lack of equality of opportunity) that
would pay less because (of the greater supply of labor. (DiQuattro 1983: 63). I no
longer subscribe to what I said then. Carens (1986: 40-1) scored effective criticism
of my "false assumption about how a market system would work if Rawls's( background
conditions were satisfied." Although effort counts, market prices would still reflect
the relative scarcity of ( 13 factors such as natural abilities and talents for which
individuals are not responsible. Or as Wolff (2003: 230) puts it: "The labour market
rewards not just extra effort but scarce talents and luck." And to top it off, as I
pointed out earlier, (1) individuals are not fully responsible for their effortful
capacities, and (2) effort and contribution mesh in ways that market demand, which
eludes individual responsibility, impinges on the reward of effort. So where does
this leave us with respect to effort and desert? Rawls is right about the non-
feasibility of implementing the principle of to each according to effort. I have
argued that measurement is on its shakiest ground when determined by administrative
agencies, wit(h respect to both efficiency (calculation) and ethics (intrusion of
privacy), and that socialist markets do a better job on both counts, which is to say
less worse than planners. Remember that, for Rawl(s, there is a place in socialist
markets for distributional "precepts," one of which honor(s effort. But socialist
markets, for reasons I have given, come up short of the desideratum and so must be(
supplemented by state policies that reduce the element of moral arbitrariness in the
distributi(on of income and/or welfare. These policies assume the form of
redistributive taxation and spending on public goods, more of which about shortly.
But Hahnel says that market socialism is incompatible with a properly e(galitarian
distribution of income. He says that "market socialist economie(s cannot avoid being
inequitable" (Hahnel 2005a: 131, emphasis added). Hahnel is wrong on( this and I show

the "precept" of "to each according t(o effort," by which he means a "common sense
norm" that "cannot be plausibly raised to a first principle" ((1971: 307). Rawls does
not include compensation for effort in the difference principle because as a resource
egalitarian he cannot give that much room to welfare considerations. This is why
Hahnel (2005b: 144) is mistaken in saying "there is noth(ing in his theory that
should lead him to distinguish between a dangerous job and a smaller ration of food
rations as negative aspects of someone's 'outcome.'" Cohen objects forcefully to
Rawls's principled disparagement of a welfare metric, saying that "ignoring welfare
in matters of socia(l justice is ludicrous . . . Rawls's reasons for thinking
otherwise are misplaced." Rawls's "prescinding from the quality of people's work
experience is [not] defensible at the bar of egalitarian justice," with Cohen
favoring unequal monetary compensation for differential labor burdens, "whatever
obstacles there may be to taking fu(ll account of it in practice" (Cohen 2008:
200-02). What softens Cohen's blow against Rawls, however, is that Cohen overlooks
(inexcusably?) altogether Rawls's inclusion of effort as a precept when that is set
against the background of a "basic structure" governed by the principles of justice.

encompasses compensat(ory considerations, but not to the exclusion of other

allocating and distributing economic resources. He thinks that i(n any market
economy, whether socialist or capitalist, "those with more human capital will
(receive more, even if they make no greater sacrifice, and those with less human
capital will receiv(e less, even if they sacrifice just as much" (2008: 14). He goes
on to say that any attempt to fix the problem-the unfairness of the distribution-will
"create a great deal of inefficiency." If wages are determined by the laws of supply

only will different kinds of labor be allocated inefficiently, the entire price
structure will fail to reflect the opportunity costs of producing different goods and
services leading to further inefficiencies. There is no getting around the dilemma:
in a market economy we must either allow the market system to reward people unfairly,
or, if we try to 14 correct for inequalities we must tolerate even greater
inefficiencies. (Hahnel 2008: 14-15)<component x="62.36" y="559.9" width="384.97"

prices on abundant goods, then the users o(f these goods will be 16 informed
automatically on how to achieve a Pareto-optimal allocation of economic resources.
But prices used for this efficiency purpose may result in an extremely undesirable
spread of wealth ( and income. This is the distributional aspect of the price
mechanism. This potential conflict between efficiency and distribution should come as
no surprise since the theorem of( optimal competition takes no account of
distribution so that resource allocation would be considered to satisfy this optimum
property even though half of the population were sta(rving while the other half were
enjoying great luxury. The upshot: in market socialism, market prices are used as
accounting dev(ices or efficiency indicators but not to distribute income as this is
done in market capitalism. Most obviously, because of the egalitarian distribution of
non-human capital, interest and profit incomes are distributed differently. For
example, banks charge interest on loans scheduled for investment by enterprises, but
the price assessed on loans does not take the form of income paid to a small group of
capitalists; profit is distributed widely to shareholders who so(cially own the means
of production, and so on. Interest and profit incomes coexist with egalitari(an aims.
But what about labor income, which is the focus of interest here? Branko Horvat
(1964: 130) casts some light on this in his ethical defense of market socialism. He
distinguishes between( gross and net wages of 17 labor, the gross wage reflecting the
marginal productivity of labor and the net wage determined by a political decision
consistent with social expectations as to what labor income distribution constitutes
fairness. "The difference between the gross wages and the net wages represents rent
which is taxed away by the Planning Authority. One may say that the net wage-rates
represent the supply price of labor, while the gross wage-rates are its demand
price." Horvat thinks the (net wage-rates "include not only 'efficiency'
differentials, but also positive differentials for dirty, strenuous, dangerous, more
responsible, etc., work, and, conversely differentials for agreeable and leisurely
work, i.e., they include 'cost' differentials as well." Gross wages signal an
efficient allocation of labor; net wages are what workers receive as income after
t(he state accomplishes a redistribution of gross wages through egalitarian taxation
and spending policies. Which is to say that in the interest of efficiency, it is
important that workers seek to maximize the gross wage even though they receive only
the politically-determined net or fair wage(, i.e., income. In this way, justice
holds sway in the sphere of distribution while efficiency reigns in the sphere of
production. What should be apparent by now is Friedman's and Hahnel's theoretical
error in asserting that in market socialism gross wages are legislated. They are not;
instead, labor income is, so legislation does not get in the way of an efficient
allocation of labor resources. Unless, of course, an egalitarian distribution of
labor income interferes with allocative ef(ficiency by reducing "incentives," which
is what Hahnel also claims. "Income policies and limits on wage differentials create
inefficiencies by forcing some wages to differ from a worker's actual

paper with justice than efficiency, whether Pareto-optimality or broader (and more
satisfactory) conceptions that maximize net social benefits, including those that
focus on furthering "opportunity capabilities" and well-being understood as more than
m(ere preference satisfaction (see, e.g., the work of Amartya Sen 2009: part 3).
Hahnel rehearses all the usual objections to (market efficiency, some of which are
telling indeed. The question, however, is whether these objections carry the same
force when applied to socialist markets rather than capitalist ones. For example,
ne(gative externalities such as pollution loom large in capitalist markets, but might
not the egalitarian distribution of w(ealth in socialist ones mitigate that? Roemer
and Bardhan (1994: 180) give us good reason to be(lieve that "the level of certain
profit-inducing public 'bads' are likely to be lower when profits are more equally
distributed, as in ( our market socialist regime, than under capitalism where profits
are concentr(ated." 17 Though Horvat relies here on the theory of the marginal
product of labor, he thinks that the "possibility of applying marginal product
calculus is rather questionable." Elsewhere (1982: 272)(, he questions its
theoretical coherence.<component x="49.61" y="44.13" width="385.32" height="154.48"

above. Welfare payments and progressive taxes [in market socialism] create
motivational inefficiencies . . . [there are] political and psychological obstacles
that would work against achieving equity correctives in any real-world market
socialist economy . . ." 18 (Hahnel 2005b: 151). I have already shown how Hahnel's
saying this rests on a mistaken conflation of gross wages with income, the latter
consisting of what workers get after redistributi(ve taxation and spending on public
goods. Already, in social democracies such as Sweden, workers' income, both monetary
and in-kind, differs importantly from their gross wages, thus demonstrating that,
theoret(ically and empirically, fairness and efficiency can go together in market
socialism, as they do in social democracies, to a degree that Hahnel, on the basis of
a theoretical mista(ke, denies. Still, Hahnel raises the important issue of
incentives in market socialism, thinking th(at "the logic of the labor market"
encourages people to defend their gross wages on the basis of (contribution and thus
to resist redistribution in line with egalitarian aims. Roemer (1994: 119) worries
similarly, "Perhaps [the liberal maxim] is psychologically mandated in people who
compete on (labor markets. If so, this places a political limit on the degree of
redistribution that can be( accomplished by socialdemocratic methods." But what does
Roemer mean by "competition"?( If labor incomes are politically determined, then on
what level are workers competing? If there is competition for income, then this takes
place at the political level, where it belongs, not in the market. Of course, minus a
prevalent egalitarian ethos in a market socialist society, politics will not take an
egalitarian course. I do not see why labor markets, when set against the background
of socialist institutions, must prompt inegalitarian attitudes among their
participants. If it is obviou(s to some of us, including me and Hahnel, that the
gross wages in labor markets are unjust, then (why cannot this view find expression
among many other people, so that the state pursues polici(es, in a democratic
setting, that accomplish an egalitarian distribution? Why cannot citizens see through
the illusion that market allocation and distribution are necessarily wedded and opt
for a politically-determined distribution while relying on markets for efficient
allocation? And remember that we are talking about market socialism here, not market
capitalism, so that labor markets are operating against( the background of an
egalitarian ethos which accompanies an egalitarian distribution of wealth and
political authority. What is ultimately important is the ethos, one transcending the
issue of ( market vs. planned economies. After all, even in planned economic systems
people can decide to rely on (inegalitarian bases of desert, including those that
play up contribution. We know that in contemporary market capitalist societies most
people subscribe to a plurality of deser(t bases, with contribution heading the list,
although interpretation of the empirical studies gets c(omplicated because often 19
"effort" is subsumed under "contribution" (see Miller 1992). We also know that public
opinion in Eastern Europe, very soon after things changed in 1989, was not too
dissimilar from that in Western Europe with respect to the ethical importance of
contribution as a( desert basis for labor income (see Marshall, Swift, Routh,
Burgoyne 1999). People who lived in planned economies<component x="62.36" y="199.9"

as a desert base of labor income that was( similar to those living in market
economies. So market allocation is not a necessary condition fo(r people subscribing
to the kind of justice that Hahnel deems ethically suspect. Some concluding comments:
radical egalitarians want, ideally, equality of outcomes, whether income or welfare
(I side with welfare; DiQuattro 1998). I have argued here that the use of markets as
an allocative device is consistent with that, which is not to deny tha(t market
socialism is but a transitional stage to communism, as some Marxists project.
Realization of( the ideal awaits communism. The aim is to replace economic desert,
whether based on contribution or e(ffort, both of which reflect morally arbitrary
factors, with the radical egalitarian ide(al of "to each according to 20 need."
During the interval period, because of scarcity and left-over bourgeois beliefs
("muck," in Marx's word) about desert, the ideal requires compromise, but always in
the direction of the egalitarian default, which seeks distributive equality. The
default is both practical and principled. If it is the case that we lack reliable
information about differential desert-whether based on contribution or effort-among
individuals on the level of a national economy, then, as Miller (1992: 560) suggests,
practical reason "opts for equality as the fairest dis(tribution in the
circumstances" and this passes the test of rationality because in the face of
ignorance ( of individuals' particular contributions to a joint output, minimizing
the expected unfairness of the distribution requires an equal distribution of
payment; "by dividing the reward equally [between the workers] you minimize the
greatest possible underpayment and by extension minimize the exp(ected underpayment."
In addition, there is a tendency to equality on principled grounds. The basic premise
of egalitarians is that people are equally free and moral persons, so that "the
obviou(s starting point is for them to suppose that all social primary goods,
including income and wealth, should be equal; everyone should have an equal share"
(Rawls 2005: 281). Departures from equal( distribution require justification and have
a place in less than ideal circumstances, so that sacri(ficial effort as a desert
basis has a role to play in market socialism on the level of precepts, as discussed
above. The precepts might even be raised to a political level if epistemic probl(ems
can find a practical solution. Roemer (1993) tries this by having the state
supplement and implement the effort precept. He constructs a model that seeks to
separate morally arbitrary fact(ors, in particular talent, from the measurement of
effort which remains as the only variable determining distributive outcomes. Put very
simply, using educational attainment as a proxy for talent, Roemer divides the
workforce into highly- and less-educated groups and, prompted by an egali(tarian
impulse, proposes that the average wage of both groups should be the same. But
within( each group workers should be rewarded in proportion to differential effort.
This gets implemented by the state instituting a progressive tax based on educational
attainment, i.e. a talent tax,( with the result that while gross-wages reflect both
talent and effort, net-wages reflect effort alone. In Roemer's model, socialist
markets and progressive taxation go some distance in resolving ( practical problems
of effort measurement, and they do so automatically at the state level as oppo(sed to
leaving it to complicated and idiosyncratic determinations by "effort commissions" at
local workplaces. Just how practical Roemer's scheme is I leave to readers. It may
not provide a method that success-( fully separates the morally arbitrary from that
for which individuals are "fully responsible." Following Rawls, I have already
questioned whether effort and responsibility always go together. And as Wolff says
(2003: 231) of Roemer's attempt, it does not address native talent within

liberal what Hahnel calls the "radical" maxim. According to Levine, the radical maxim
is "to each the same," in contrast to liberal egalitarian th(eories of justice that
permit inequality with their emphasis on the tie between individual respo(nsibility
and economic desert. "Thus liberal egalitarians, unlike egalitarians sans phrase do
not want everyone to have equal shares [of the favored distribuand-welfare or
resources] . . . .Their view of ind(ividual responsibility contravenes this
desideratum." Also, see Levine 1999. different educational groups, "so although
theoretically this approach pr(ovides insight of high order, it does not solve the
problem. It is no more possible [in our current s(tate of knowledge] to measure
talent levels with confidence than it is for effort levels." Is the practice of
economic desert compatible with radical egalitarian id(eals? One way of reconciling
the two may be to eliminate that part of its definition which includes differential
personal responsibility, thus questioning what Hahnel and other liberal egalitarians
deem so important (see footnote 20). Why must desert have a basis in some attribute
or action for which individuals are personally responsible? Do we not sometimes
assert that individuals, qua persons, deserve equal baseline respect and concern,
even though as Fred Fel(dman says (1995: 69) they are not responsible for being
persons, and does this not "provide( evidence for the [some21 times] independence of
responsibility and desert?" William Galston writes (1991: 131-2): "There is nothing
self-contradictory about basing a [desert claim] on (some undeserved feature of
yourself . . . [e.g., if] moral personality is the basis of your claim to( be taken
into consideration." He goes on to say that Rawls "establishes as the sole, relevant
desert basis a feature of our lives (moral personality) that equally characterizes
nearly all of us." I (think Galston is right on Rawls and I have argued that a
similar idea inspires Marx's model of a perfectly just society in which everyone, by
virtue of personhood, is deserving of equal welfare accorded by the communist
principle of distribution: to each according to need (DiQuattro 1998). (According to
the communist ideal, those economies which deny this by permitting morally arbitra(ry
factors (e.g. those allowed by meritocratic principles such as "to each according to
effort") to systematically influence distributive outcomes count as exploitative and
unjust. Author's Note Some of the ideas in this paper were presented at the Seattle

(2005b) and other recent work ((2005a, 2006, 2008), Robin Hahnel proposes and defends
a monolithic metric of economic desert: to e(ach according to effort or sacrifice. In
what follows, I criticize from an egalitarian stan(dpoint this meritocratic
distributive principle on theoretical, normative, and practical grounds.( I conclude
my critique by questioning his argument that in market socialism the allocation of
labor cannot accommodate an egalitarian distribution of labor income. Hahnel and
Milton Friedman are one in identifying socialist and capitalist markets with respect
to the distributive functi(on of prices and both are wrong. My treatment of Hahnel's
work proceeds in the context of larger debates about concepts of justice and the
distributive institutions that might suit them. Before confronting Hahnel's case, let
me establish a framework that treats the concept of desert. Joel Feinberg, in his
seminal work Doing and Deserving (1970) provides a largely noncontroversial analysis:
to deserve something one must possess some charac(teristic or have done something
that constitutes the desert bases for which she is (to some ex(tent) responsible,
which is to say "under her control." Further, Feinberg and almost all desert
theorists distinguish between pre-institutional desert and institutional entitlement,
with the former s(erving as a principle that assesses the justice of the latter. To
paraphrase Serena Olsaretti (2004: 16-17): institutional entitlement rewards
individuals by the rules and purposes within which desert( claims are
registered;<component x="62.37" y="127.97" width="385.57" height="203.07" page="1"

intuitive or "natural" understandings not reducible to the rules and purposes of
institutions. She uses as a pr(e-institutional example that of hard-working people
who deserve rewards for their efforts. But we know that some distributive
institutions, e.g. the market, do not systematically reward people i(n proportion to
their effortful work. In such cases, they are entitled to their rewards even though
they do not deserve them. Entitlements, or "legitimate expectations," as John Rawls
dub(s them (1999: 273-77), proceed from institutional conventions, leaving open the
question of whether these expectations are deserved, which is not to deny that
sometimes pre-institutional desert an(d institutional entitle2 ment overlap. Indeed,
some theories of justice, e.g. Hahnel's, seek to jibe desert with entitlements.
Whether this is practically feasible-Rawls thinks not-is a topic I (address later on.
We find in the literature two preeminent contenders for desert bases in mo(dern
economies: contribution and effort. Should individuals working in an economy along
with others, engaged( in joint production, be rewarded differentially according to
effort or contribution, or both? Hahnel argues persuasively that contribution
theories fall short of the ethical re(quirements of pre-institutional desert and
matching institutional entitlements. He addr(esses "conservative" and "liberal"
maxims. According to the first, payment to individuals proceeds "according to (the
value of one's personal contribution and the contribution of the productive property
o(ne owns"; on the latter view, payment proceeds "according to the value of one's
personal contribution only." The conservative maxim runs up against the liberal
complaint that payment acc(ruing from inherited wealth is not deserved. But what
underlies that complaint, namely that in(dividuals deserve only what they are
personally responsible for, can be turned against the liberal maxim itself. This is
because, says Hahnel (2006: 184-85), many "differences in people's productivities are
due to intrinsic qualities of people themselves, which are beyond their control (. .
. . The bottom line is that the 'genetic lottery' [e.g., involving talent] greatly
influences how valuable a person's con3 tribution will be. Yet the genetic lottery is
no more fair than the inheritance lottery." So far we have Hahnel's rejection of
contribution as a pre-institutional basis of economic desert. He also argues well
that even if one honors pre-institutionally the contribution t(heory, markets fail
systematically to deliver entitlements in line with it. One( thorny issue consists in
how, theoretically and practically, markets sort out the value of individual
contributions from the value of jointly produced products. The marginal theory of
productivity is usually summoned here, but it lacks both explanatory and
justificatory power. As Hahnel says (2005b: 136), according to that theory, "the
marginal [contribution] of an input depends as much on the number of other units of
that input available, and on the quality and quantity of other, complimentary inputs,
as on any intrinsic quality of the additional input itself." Hahnel( might have also
mentioned the damage inflicted on marginal productivity theory during the 1960s

capital in which Joan Robinson (1966) e(laborated the theoretical shortcomings of
attempts to separate the marginal contributions labor and capital, complete with
ethically profound and negative consequences for the marginal productivity theory of
distribution among owners of different factors of production (see DiQuattro 1978:
871-2). Daniel Attas (2003: 100-01) sums up much of this in his critique of David
Mil(ler's (1990) influential defense of the market as an institution that can reward
individuals acco(rding to contribution. Given the distribution of talents, the level
of technology, and the distribution of tastes, there is normally more than one
possible [market] equilibrium. The distribution of income enters at both ends of the
explanation of value: first, as a factor in th(e determination of prices; second, as
the outcome of market prices. This suggests that the distribution of income and the
price vector at equilibrium are mutually sustaining. A disequilibrating shock to the
system would not necessarily result in a fluctuating reversi(on to a unique stable
point. There is, therefore, no unique value that the producer deserves. So, the
(value defined as (an) equilibrium price turns out to be completely morally
ar(bitrary from a moral point of view. But wait, there is more. In addition to the
weakness of neoclassical models of the marginal productivity theory of distribution,
there is the brute fact that, even i(f they withstand criticism, their bearing on the
real world of capitalist markets lacks credible application. When we step outside of
neoclassical textbooks, we find that labor incomes in capitali(st market economies
are not set by "pure" market forces. There are factors within the "constraints" of
the real world of market economies that play routinely a role in determining wages
and salaries; in addition to oligopolies and other imperfections, there are taxation
and regulative la(w, collective bargaining, historical precedent, cultural factors,
various government policies, and (so on. We know, e.g., that there is strong rigidity
in the ordinal wage ranking of most occupations. Even in recessionary times, wages do
not fall as predicted by the conventional equilibrium pri(ce-auction model of 4
neoclassical economics (see Bewley 2000). The foregoing supports the conclusion that
market entitlements do not fi(t pre-institutional desert based on individual
contribution. This is, of course, not a peculiarly "leftist" or egalitarian view.
Milton Friedman understands that markets, especially in their "perfectively
competitive" form, are no respecters of economic desert, whether its basis is
contrib(ution or effort. "Most differences in status or position or wealth can be
regarded as the product (of chance at a far enough remove . . . ." According to
Friedman, chance determines our genetic makeup and, to some extent, our mental and

marginal productivity theory of distribution within the neoclassical price-auction
model in which "the labor market is treated as if it were like an(y other market in
which price (wage) is the short-term market-clearing mechanism" (Thurow 1983: 181).
The problem with the model, unless it builds in tautology, is its failure to account
for the "exogenous" determination of wa(ges in actual market systems. Thurow traces
the model's deficiency to the micro-foundations of neoclassical economics. Hahnel (
displays an ambivalent stance towards the marginal productivity theory of
distribution. As we have seen (above), he is wary about its ability to separate
individual from colle(ctive contribution. Still, he relies on it to score ethical
points against market entitlements. "When young people flock to join the profession I
have labored in for twenty years, my marginal revenue product declines [and I thus
'earn' less salary]" (2005b: 137). If professor Hahnel is referring to university
teaching, academic (tenure obviously gets in the way of the theory, but "the
protection of tenure or its equivalent (seniority hiring a(nd firing, offers to work
for less are rejected) seems to exist almost everywhere in the labor market" ((Thurow

environments into which we are born, not to men(tion the choices that other people
are always making in markets set against these morally-indi(fferent natural and
institutional backgrounds (Friedman 1962: 165-6). Friedman may have ta(ken his cue on
this from his mentor at the University of Chicago's school of economics, Frank Knight
(1935: 64-5, 68), who went further by reflecting on the intimate connection between
(those twins of moral arbitrariness: luck and power. Consider this gem. Everyone is
compelled to play the economic game and be judged by his succ(ess in playing it. The
luck element is so large-far larger than fairly successful players in the game will
admit-that capacity and effort may count for nothing. And this luck element works
cumulatively, as in gambling games generally . . . . Differences in the capacity to
play the game are inordinately great from one person to another. But as the game is
organized, the weak contestants are thrown in with the strong in one grand melee;
there is no( classification of the participants or distribution of handicaps such as
always recognized t(o be necessary to sportsmanship when unevenly matched contestants
are to meet. In fact the situation is worse still; there are handicaps, but as we
have seen, they are distribut(ed to the advantage of the strong rather than the weak
. . . . It is terms of power, then, if at all, that competitive economies and the
competitive view of life for which it must be largely accountable are to be
justified. Whether we are to regard them as justified at all depends on whether we
are 5 willing to accept an ethics of power as the basis of our world view. As I
interpret these passages, Friedman discounts pre-institutional deser(t, Knight
credits it, but both agree that market entitlements do not systematically match
deser(t bases, whether contribution or effort. In contrast to "conservative" and
"liberal" distributive maxi(ms, based on contribution, Hahnel endorses the "radical"
maxim: "to each according to personal sac(rifice, or effort" (2005a: 137). Now this
needs some unpacking since the conjunction "or" can be put( to different uses.
Consider: an unmarried man or a bachelor; a table or a chair. In the first case, "or"
expresses an identity and in the second a difference. Hahnel apparently identifies
effort with sacrifice. "By effort, I simply mean personal sacrifice or inconveniences
incurred in performing one's economic duties . . . . According [to this] maxim, no
other consideration (other than differential sacrifice) can justify one person
[getting more income] than another" ( (2005a: 137, emphasis added). This is
problematical, though, because Hahnel uses "or" in an equiv(ocal way. He says that
"effort takes many forms. It may be longer hours, less pleasant hours, [and (so on]"
(2005a: 137). But duration of labor is not necessarily a proxy for sacrifice because
some people enjoy working long and hard at certain tasks, so Hahnel must mean that
only tho(se longer hours that are sacrificial count in his metric of desert. Yet his
assertion that "I can decide to work longer hours or work more intensely than others
and qualify for greater rewards"( (2005a: 138) implies that his measure consists in
duration and intensity. I am not just splitting definitional hairs; important
practical consequences follow from Hahnel's equivocation. I take Hahnel to mean by
effort sacrifice. If so, intractable problems of measurement arise since, u(nlike
duration and intensity, sacrifice is less open to inter-personal comparison,
standardization, and publicity. I will expand on this concern later on, but it is one

of duration, "the most common criterion su(ggested in the past" (Lamont 1995: 223).
Against contribution-based theories of desert, Hahnel commits to a pre-i(nstitutional
theory whose sole basis is differential sacrifice; he then argues that market
entitlements fail to square with desert, so understood. I think he is largely right
about market entitlements, but he assumes rashly that a sacrificial basis satisfies
the requirement of what he inc(ludes as an essential ingredient of distributional
justice, namely that individuals fully control, (and thus are responsible for, what
it is that warrants their differential desert, namely their effort. As opposed "to
differences [due to] circumstance, talent, training, luck . . . people control only
(their effort" (Hahnel 2005a: 137). John Rawls famously objects. We do not deserve
our place in the distribution of natural endowments, any more than we deserve our
initial starting place in society. That we deserve the superior character that
enables us to make the effort to cultivate our capacities is also problematic; for
such character depends in good part upon fortunate family and social circumstances(
in early life for which we can claim no credit. The notion of desert does not apply
here (1999, 89). [It] seems clear that the effort a person is willing to make is
influenced by his natural abilities ( and skills and the alternatives open to him.
The better endowed are more likely, other things equal, to strive conscientiously,
and there seems to be no way to discount for their greater good fortune. The idea of
rewarding desert is impracticable. (1999: 274) Robert Nozick (1974: 213-16) initiated
a serious misreading of these pa(ssages, playing on the expression "can claim no
credit" for family and social circumstances and moving illicitly to the 6 conclusion
that a person's effortful capacity is fully determined. But as the passages show,
Rawls is saying instead it is only those influences which play a "good part" that are
not creditable, not that individuals can claim no credit for effort, namely the
effortful capacities they have 7 cultivated in addition to those influences. "In good
part" does no(t mean in "whole part." As G. A. Cohen (1989: 914) says of Nozick's
mischievous reading, "influenced" does not mean "wholly determined," and so it does
not follow that, for Rawls, eff(ort deserves no reward at all as in the determinist
doctrines with which Nozick, complicit in a long tr(adition of anti-egalitarian
rhetoric, seeks to saddle Rawls. Rawls does not rule out altogether effort as a
desert basis, and he certainly rules in personal responsibility for choosing
preferences and g(oals. Cohen cites pertinent passages in which Rawls holds citizens
responsible if they cultivate expe(nsive tastes that unjustly pressure scarce public
resources; they could have chosen otherwise, "a(nd if and when they press for
compensation, others are entitled to insist that they themselves bear( the cost 'of
their lack of foresight or self-discipline'" (Cohen 1989: 913-15). Rawls is no

"[Rawls's] line of argument can [my italics] succeed in blocking the introduction of

percent? 75 percent? Rawls clearly leaves some room for pre-institutional personal

qualms about according desert largesse in his (or any) egalitarian theory of
distributive justice? It is impracticable, he says, to sort out in any systematic way
desert from morally arbitrary factors, especially on the institutional level. With
respect to effortful capacities, they are distributed unequally among individuals
due, in part, to fortunate circum(stances for which they are not responsible. And
some by virtue of natural abilities are better able to accomplish tasks and therefore
more likely to become motivated to stri(ve, whereas those with lesser abilities are
likely to become frustrated and slack off in their efforts to excel, with the result
that more naturally talented people score better on an effort metric. Rawls's first
point rests on biological and sociological evidence and the second on psychological
insi(ght, both of which find support in our informed common sense or reflective
intuitions (Rawls 199(9: 89). In addition to Rawls's two points, consider the tight
connection between effort and contribution and how the latter influences the rewards
attached to the former. Effort and contribution mesh in ways that effort theorists,
such as Hahnel, cannot reasonably isolate from one anothe(r. Even among those who
exercise effort equally (assuming its discrete measurement), Hahnel discounts the
(efforts of those who fall short of their "economic duty" or "social endeavo(r," by
which he must mean contributing to social welfare as measured by the demand of others
for which the contributors are not fully responsible. So not all equally effortful
work is to be equally rewarded. As Lamont (1995: 215) argues, theorists who play up
effort as the sole desert basis "are also committed, despite appearances, to
increasing the social product . . . which undermines any (sharp distinction between
effort- and productivity-based distributive proposals." The bottom line is that it is
difficult to separate systematically desert from morally arbitrary factors. That is
why Rawls and those of us who suspect appeals to effort as a desert basis are wary
about according it a (or the, as in Hahnel's case) decisive place in a theory of
justice. This is not to deny that we can be roughly successful in parochial
circumstances whic(h epistemically enable reliable assessments. For example, parents
say of Billy that he is putting in more effort than Suzie in their household chores;
or a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse, who ge(ts to know her students, is positioned
to give Billy a "C" in performance and an "A" i(n effort, whereas Suzie gets a "B" in
performance and a "C" for effort. In settings such as these, we usually try to give
desert based on effort some of its due. But is this feasible in an economy involving
tens o(f millions of individuals impersonally related? And which institutions can
accomplish such a daunting task? It is difficult enough at the pre-institutional
level. How do we go about ranking (occupations and the individuals who occupy them
according to the metric of differential cost or sacrifice? Hahnel's (2006: 185)
featured illustration compares the surgeon and the garbage collector, portraying the
highly-paid surgeon as putting in less effortful hours than the poorly-paid garbage
man. According to Hahnel, this is unjust. Feinberg (1973: 117), to the contrary,
thinks that according to the effort principle, hard-working doctors and corporate
executives should rece(ive exactly the same remuneration as hard-working laborers.
The laborer's work may be dirty and dangerous, but the professional's involves more
responsibility and mental pressure. And we can go on and on: from accountants through
zoologists; imagine the difficulty judging relative effort levels required by
different types of inter and intra occupations, or branches of the economy. Further,
not only occupations need be ranked, but also, and especially, the individuals who
fit these jobs, and this gets us into the hoary issue of the interpersonal
co(mparisons of disutility. Lamont (1995: 222-23), reflecting on failures of
utilitarian theory, wonders whether "it may be impossible to reduce everything down
to effort units and to use these in any meaningful way." Carens drives home the
point: "Some people are lucky enough to find th(eir work a great pleasure and source
of self-realization. They are likely [to] work long, intense hours. Should this lead
us to reconsider whether they deserve compensation for the 'burdens' of their work,
especially as compared with those who work shorter hours at boring, alienating
tasks?" (Consider, too, that for some people the danger of a job may be part of its
attraction. And what about the varied factors that affect the costs and benefits of
work: colleagues, bosses, job security, location, etc.? "There is no principled way
to distinguish factors that deserve compensation fro(m those that do not, and no
objective way to measure burdens for most factors" (Carens 2003: 1(59-60). Maybe
institutions, whether administrative or market, can accomplish the (calculation feat
by informing our pre-institutional intuitions. Hahnel, an "avowed market (
abolitionist" (2008: 16) and advocate of participatory administration, assigns to
compensation boa(rds at local workplaces the task of determining pay schedules that
reflect differential effort among individual workers. He leaves it to "the abilities
of workmates to reasonably judge one an(other's sacrifices and motivate one another
to work diligently and intelligently" (2005b: 138). But, as Jonathan Wolff says, this
"knowledge will be too dispersed, and its sources too unreliable,( to serve the
purpose required by the [effort] theory" (Wolff 2003: 225). Too disbursed because the
theory requires a determination of the relative efforts of individuals across an
entire economy, and, he goes on, this unreliability generates "too great a
possibility of corruption," th(at can accompany the application of criteria not
adequately publicly accessible. This criticism weighs heavily if justice must satisfy
a publicity requirement, which says that it should be possible to confirm( whether or
not a principle of justice is being followed. If in a cooperative enterprise, say a(n
economy at the national level, "cooperators in which each must know that others are
cooperatin(g-they are bound by justice to cooperate only when they know that others,
too, are cooperatin(g: it would be unfair to expect them to take up the burden of
justice unless (they can know that)( others are doing so" (Cohen 2008: 347,
summarizing Williams 1998). Remember that Hahnel's desert basis is effort defined as
personal cost or disutility. Think about the epistemic hurdles that get in the way of
publicly auditing the distribution of relative effort among occupations and,
ultimately, individuals. "A feasible theory should not require access to information
we cannot acqui(re," which is not to deny the fairness of effort theory but rather to
say it is not viable, which counts importantly ( 8 against it (Wolff: 224, 227).
Further, if individuals lack assurance that others are doing their part because (they
lack access to information they cannot acquire, might they not be justified, as a
matter of personal preroga9 tive, in overriding their prima facie obligation to live
up to a distributive principle based on effort? In such a case, the corruption of the
effort principle can be caused not so much by moral laxity as by epistemic
limitation. Is it not unfair for cooperative membe(rs to bear the burdens of just
principles when they lack assurance that others are doing so? In the( face of an

problematical enough at the occupational leve(l. The epistemic problem looms even
larger at the individual level, the one that really counts: "People, not ( jobs,
deserve wages. And the wage a person deserves depends (I have argued) not only about
facts about the person's job, but also upon the facts of the person. Unfortunately,
there is no way to know, for example, each person's moral character, need, or the
amount of good and evil she has already received. Therefore there is no way to
include these factors in job evaluation schemes" (McLeod 1999: 280). But suppose
t(hat we try to overcome this epistemic challenge. At what cost? Not only is there
time and effort involved in calculation (think about how many meetings must be
devoted to determining individual effort, especially with a mobile work force).
Consider, too, the intrusion into workers' personal lives. "Why is Joe not performing
up to snuff at his job?" ask his fellow workers. "Fess up Joe, problems with drinking
too much at the p(ub, not getting along with your wife and kids, as a child you were
encouraged to be a slouch?" and so on an(d on. Hahnel's scheme involves "effort
rating committees" of workmates, whose responsibilities include o(bserving others,
collecting testimony from others, as well as self-testimony, hearing grievances, and

intrusively the relative efforts of workers across an entire economy? Not capitalist
markets, of course, for all the reasons (nicely summed up by ( Knight in my citation
above) given by disparate thinkers ranging from Friedman to Rawls. What about
socialist markets? There are at least three different models of market socialism, all
of which share the common features of social ownership of the means of production
(excluding labor) and considerable use of markets to allocate resources, including
labor. Social ownership can take the form of worker-owned cooperatives, state-owned
enterprises controlled by workers, or p(rivatelyowned enterprises so widely held by
individuals as to count as social ownership(, as in the case 10 of John Roemer's
"voucher socialism" or John Rawls's "private property-owning democracy." The idea is
that in market socialism, whatever its form, labor markets operate against the
background of an egalitarian distribution of wealth, equality of practical
op(portunity, and full employment. Lamont (1997) argues that when these conditions
are in place, markets tend to automatically reward workers according to effort, which
is to say, as I would put it, that the procedure of the market yields a substantive
calculation of the distribution of relative effort among individuals. Suppose all
jobs were paid the same base wage rate. Then consider what would prompt a person to
choose a job different than the one she has at that rate. Lamont (1997: 35) argues
that her choice depends on the weight she accords the base wage rate( when compared
to the non-monetary costs attached to jobs with the result that she gets com(pensated
for those costs. If a job requires an incentive payment to induce people to work in
it, t(hen that means it has burdens (or disutility) over and above some (arbitrary)
base lev(el. Under the desert theory being used here, the payment will be justified
because it compens(ates for this burden (or disutility)-not because it would increase
the social pro(duct (although it will normally do that). Lamont says that these
incentive payments constitute compensatory desert as distinct from economic rents
which are greater than what is required to keep workers at their present(
occupations. Rent collection results from the relative scarcity of the worker's
factor input, something determined by natural and institutional barriers for which
the worker is not respons(ible. Economic rents, unlike incentive payments, are not
compensatory, since they exceed what is necessary to induce a worker to transfer
jobs. Socialist markets, which have the requisite egalitarian( background
institutions, tend to automatically pay labor unequally according to differential
effort so that market entitlements mesh with economic desert. This is fine, as far as
it goes, but its simplicity misleads. What is attractive is its apparent egalitarian
thrust. As Miller (1976: 111) notes, "the principle that unpleasant, onerous,

which there is no good reason should be compensated to (the point where the deprived
one is again brought back to a position of equality with his fe(llows." The idea is
that differences in pay compensate for non-monetary differences in work. Oskar Lange
(1935: 101-02), in his classic exposition of market socialism, put it this way: By
putting leisure, safety, agreeableness of work, etc., into the utility scales of
individuals, the disutility of any occupation can be represented as an opportunity
cos(t. The choice of an occupation offering a lower money income, but also a lower
disutility, may be interpreted as the purchase of leisure, safety, agreeableness of
work, etc., at a price equal to the difference between the money income earned in
that particular occupation and ot(hers. Thus the difference of incomes required by
condition 2 are only apparent. They represent prices paid by individuals for
different conditions of work. Instead of attaching different money incomes to the
various occupations the administration of a socialist econ(omy might pay all citizens
the same money income and charge a price for the pursuit of each occupation. It
becomes obvious not only that there is no contradiction between both cond(itions, but
that condition 2 is necessary to satisfy condition 1. Notice that what renders this
scheme egalitarian is its reliance on the m(etric of welfare, by which is meant
utility or preference satisfaction. The disutility involved in some work is offset or
balanced by an unequal payment of resources, by which is meant monetary income whose
expenditure yields utility that presumedly matches the disutility undergone in
disagreeable work. But just how egalitarian is this? Not only is there the usual
probl(em of commensurability that complicates the feasibility of implementation, but
even if that were( resolved, consider that monetary income, unlike the utility
experienced in certain jobs, can be s(aved and transferred to other people. As long
as the family exists, would not parents with greater incomes pass( on, inter 11
vivos, to their children benefits that are not deserved in the way required by
e(ffort theory? I do not think that effort theorists such as Hahnel successfully come
to terms with this conund(rum, made all the more difficult for them because they
believe that unequal incomes (of parents) (are deserved and therefore prima facie
inoculated against taxation and redistribution. Hahnel never tells us how much income
inequality his meritocratic scheme permits. How deep does it go? And does effort
theory justify unequal (monetary income) outcomes if, as Rawls and others hold,
effortful capacities themselves are tangled up with morally arbitrary influ(ences? As
part of an analysis of Rawls's difference principle, I once argued for a version of
effort theory that incorporated markets. I wrote that a perfectly competitive m(arket
set against the background of just institutions "tends to satisfy the compensatory
re(quirement of the difference principle." A justly ordered society, in which there
is freedom of employment, would no doubt have to award greater benefits to
individuals who undertake activities involving ( "uncertain or unstable employment,
or which are performed under hazardous and unpleasan(tly strenuous conditions . . . .
Otherwise men cannot be found to fill them. From this (circumstance arise 12 such
precepts as to each according to effort or the risks he bears" (Rawls 1999: 269).

class inequali(ties and consequent structured lack of equality of opportunity) that
would pay less because (of the greater supply of labor. (DiQuattro 1983: 63). I no
longer subscribe to what I said then. Carens (1986: 40-1) scored effective criticism
of my "false assumption about how a market system would work if Rawls's( background
conditions were satisfied." Although effort counts, market prices would still reflect
the relative scarcity of ( 13 factors such as natural abilities and talents for which
individuals are not responsible. Or as Wolff (2003: 230) puts it: "The labour market
rewards not just extra effort but scarce talents and luck." And to top it off, as I
pointed out earlier, (1) individuals are not fully responsible for their effortful
capacities, and (2) effort and contribution mesh in ways that market demand, which
eludes individual responsibility, impinges on the reward of effort. So where does
this leave us with respect to effort and desert? Rawls is right about the non-
feasibility of implementing the principle of to each according to effort. I have
argued that measurement is on its shakiest ground when determined by administrative
agencies, wit(h respect to both efficiency (calculation) and ethics (intrusion of
privacy), and that socialist markets do a better job on both counts, which is to say
less worse than planners. Remember that, for Rawl(s, there is a place in socialist
markets for distributional "precepts," one of which honor(s effort. But socialist
markets, for reasons I have given, come up short of the desideratum and so must be(
supplemented by state policies that reduce the element of moral arbitrariness in the
distributi(on of income and/or welfare. These policies assume the form of
redistributive taxation and spending on public goods, more of which about shortly.
But Hahnel says that market socialism is incompatible with a properly e(galitarian
distribution of income. He says that "market socialist economie(s cannot avoid being
inequitable" (Hahnel 2005a: 131, emphasis added). Hahnel is wrong on( this and I show

the "precept" of "to each according t(o effort," by which he means a "common sense
norm" that "cannot be plausibly raised to a first principle" ((1971: 307). Rawls does
not include compensation for effort in the difference principle because as a resource
egalitarian he cannot give that much room to welfare considerations. This is why
Hahnel (2005b: 144) is mistaken in saying "there is noth(ing in his theory that
should lead him to distinguish between a dangerous job and a smaller ration of food
rations as negative aspects of someone's 'outcome.'" Cohen objects forcefully to
Rawls's principled disparagement of a welfare metric, saying that "ignoring welfare
in matters of socia(l justice is ludicrous . . . Rawls's reasons for thinking
otherwise are misplaced." Rawls's "prescinding from the quality of people's work
experience is [not] defensible at the bar of egalitarian justice," with Cohen
favoring unequal monetary compensation for differential labor burdens, "whatever
obstacles there may be to taking fu(ll account of it in practice" (Cohen 2008:
200-02). What softens Cohen's blow against Rawls, however, is that Cohen overlooks
(inexcusably?) altogether Rawls's inclusion of effort as a precept when that is set
against the background of a "basic structure" governed by the principles of justice.

allocating and distributing economic resources. He thinks that i(n any market
economy, whether socialist or capitalist, "those with more human capital will
(receive more, even if they make no greater sacrifice, and those with less human
capital will receiv(e less, even if they sacrifice just as much" (2008: 14). He goes
on to say that any attempt to fix the problem-the unfairness of the distribution-will
"create a great deal of inefficiency." If wages are determined by the laws of supply

only will different kinds of labor be allocated inefficiently, the entire price
structure will fail to reflect the opportunity costs of producing different goods and
services leading to further inefficiencies. There is no getting around the dilemma:

or, if we try to 14 correct for inequalities we must tolerate even greater
inefficiencies. (Hahnel 2008: 14-15)<component x="62.36" y="559.9" width="384.97"

prices on abundant goods, then the users o(f these goods will be 16 informed
automatically on how to achieve a Pareto-optimal allocation of economic resources.
But prices used for this efficiency purpose may result in an extremely undesirable
spread of wealth ( and income. This is the distributional aspect of the price
mechanism. This potential conflict between efficiency and distribution should come as
no surprise since the theorem of( optimal competition takes no account of
distribution so that resource allocation would be considered to satisfy this optimum
property even though half of the population were sta(rving while the other half were
enjoying great luxury. The upshot: in market socialism, market prices are used as
accounting dev(ices or efficiency indicators but not to distribute income as this is
done in market capitalism. Most obviously, because of the egalitarian distribution of
non-human capital, interest and profit incomes are distributed differently. For
example, banks charge interest on loans scheduled for investment by enterprises, but
the price assessed on loans does not take the form of income paid to a small group of
capitalists; profit is distributed widely to shareholders who so(cially own the means
of production, and so on. Interest and profit incomes coexist with egalitari(an aims.
But what about labor income, which is the focus of interest here? Branko Horvat
(1964: 130) casts some light on this in his ethical defense of market socialism. He
distinguishes between( gross and net wages of 17 labor, the gross wage reflecting the
marginal productivity of labor and the net wage determined by a political decision
consistent with social expectations as to what labor income distribution constitutes
fairness. "The difference between the gross wages and the net wages represents rent
which is taxed away by the Planning Authority. One may say that the net wage-rates
represent the supply price of labor, while the gross wage-rates are its demand
price." Horvat thinks the (net wage-rates "include not only 'efficiency'
differentials, but also positive differentials for dirty, strenuous, dangerous, more
responsible, etc., work, and, conversely differentials for agreeable and leisurely
work, i.e., they include 'cost' differentials as well." Gross wages signal an
efficient allocation of labor; net wages are what workers receive as income after
t(he state accomplishes a redistribution of gross wages through egalitarian taxation
and spending policies. Which is to say that in the interest of efficiency, it is
important that workers seek to maximize the gross wage even though they receive only
the politically-determined net or fair wage(, i.e., income. In this way, justice
holds sway in the sphere of distribution while efficiency reigns in the sphere of
production. What should be apparent by now is Friedman's and Hahnel's theoretical
error in asserting that in market socialism gross wages are legislated. They are not;
instead, labor income is, so legislation does not get in the way of an efficient
allocation of labor resources. Unless, of course, an egalitarian distribution of
labor income interferes with allocative ef(ficiency by reducing "incentives," which
is what Hahnel also claims. "Income policies and limits on wage differentials create
inefficiencies by forcing some wages to differ from a worker's actual

Hahnel rehearses all the usual objections to (market efficiency, some of which are
telling indeed. The question, however, is whether these objections carry the same
force when applied to socialist markets rather than capitalist ones. For example,
ne(gative externalities such as pollution loom large in capitalist markets, but might
not the egalitarian distribution of w(ealth in socialist ones mitigate that? Roemer

are concentr(ated." 17 Though Horvat relies here on the theory of the marginal

saying this rests on a mistaken conflation of gross wages with income, the latter
consisting of what workers get after redistributi(ve taxation and spending on public
goods. Already, in social democracies such as Sweden, workers' income, both monetary
and in-kind, differs importantly from their gross wages, thus demonstrating that,
theoret(ically and empirically, fairness and efficiency can go together in market
socialism, as they do in social democracies, to a degree that Hahnel, on the basis of
a theoretical mista(ke, denies. Still, Hahnel raises the important issue of
incentives in market socialism, thinking th(at "the logic of the labor market"
encourages people to defend their gross wages on the basis of (contribution and thus
to resist redistribution in line with egalitarian aims. Roemer (1994: 119) worries
similarly, "Perhaps [the liberal maxim] is psychologically mandated in people who
compete on (labor markets. If so, this places a political limit on the degree of
redistribution that can be( accomplished by socialdemocratic methods." But what does
Roemer mean by "competition"?( If labor incomes are politically determined, then on
what level are workers competing? If there is competition for income, then this takes
place at the political level, where it belongs, not in the market. Of course, minus a
prevalent egalitarian ethos in a market socialist society, politics will not take an
egalitarian course. I do not see why labor markets, when set against the background
of socialist institutions, must prompt inegalitarian attitudes among their
participants. If it is obviou(s to some of us, including me and Hahnel, that the
gross wages in labor markets are unjust, then (why cannot this view find expression
among many other people, so that the state pursues polici(es, in a democratic
setting, that accomplish an egalitarian distribution? Why cannot citizens see through
the illusion that market allocation and distribution are necessarily wedded and opt
for a politically-determined distribution while relying on markets for efficient
allocation? And remember that we are talking about market socialism here, not market
capitalism, so that labor markets are operating against( the background of an
egalitarian ethos which accompanies an egalitarian distribution of wealth and
political authority. What is ultimately important is the ethos, one transcending the
issue of ( market vs. planned economies. After all, even in planned economic systems
people can decide to rely on (inegalitarian bases of desert, including those that
play up contribution. We know that in contemporary market capitalist societies most
people subscribe to a plurality of deser(t bases, with contribution heading the list,
although interpretation of the empirical studies gets c(omplicated because often 19
"effort" is subsumed under "contribution" (see Miller 1992). We also know that public
opinion in Eastern Europe, very soon after things changed in 1989, was not too
dissimilar from that in Western Europe with respect to the ethical importance of
contribution as a( desert basis for labor income (see Marshall, Swift, Routh,
Burgoyne 1999). People who lived in planned economies<component x="62.36" y="199.9"

as a desert base of labor income that was( similar to those living in market
economies. So market allocation is not a necessary condition fo(r people subscribing
to the kind of justice that Hahnel deems ethically suspect. Some concluding comments:
radical egalitarians want, ideally, equality of outcomes, whether income or welfare
(I side with welfare; DiQuattro 1998). I have argued here that the use of markets as
an allocative device is consistent with that, which is not to deny tha(t market
socialism is but a transitional stage to communism, as some Marxists project.
Realization of( the ideal awaits communism. The aim is to replace economic desert,
whether based on contribution or e(ffort, both of which reflect morally arbitrary
factors, with the radical egalitarian ide(al of "to each according to 20 need."
During the interval period, because of scarcity and left-over bourgeois beliefs
("muck," in Marx's word) about desert, the ideal requires compromise, but always in
the direction of the egalitarian default, which seeks distributive equality. The
default is both practical and principled. If it is the case that we lack reliable
information about differential desert-whether based on contribution or effort-among
individuals on the level of a national economy, then, as Miller (1992: 560) suggests,
practical reason "opts for equality as the fairest dis(tribution in the
circumstances" and this passes the test of rationality because in the face of
ignorance ( of individuals' particular contributions to a joint output, minimizing
the expected unfairness of the distribution requires an equal distribution of
payment; "by dividing the reward equally [between the workers] you minimize the
greatest possible underpayment and by extension minimize the exp(ected underpayment."
In addition, there is a tendency to equality on principled grounds. The basic premise
of egalitarians is that people are equally free and moral persons, so that "the
obviou(s starting point is for them to suppose that all social primary goods,
including income and wealth, should be equal; everyone should have an equal share"
(Rawls 2005: 281). Departures from equal( distribution require justification and have
a place in less than ideal circumstances, so that sacri(ficial effort as a desert
basis has a role to play in market socialism on the level of precepts, as discussed
above. The precepts might even be raised to a political level if epistemic probl(ems
can find a practical solution. Roemer (1993) tries this by having the state
supplement and implement the effort precept. He constructs a model that seeks to
separate morally arbitrary fact(ors, in particular talent, from the measurement of
effort which remains as the only variable determining distributive outcomes. Put very
simply, using educational attainment as a proxy for talent, Roemer divides the
workforce into highly- and less-educated groups and, prompted by an egali(tarian
impulse, proposes that the average wage of both groups should be the same. But
within( each group workers should be rewarded in proportion to differential effort.
This gets implemented by the state instituting a progressive tax based on educational
attainment, i.e. a talent tax,( with the result that while gross-wages reflect both
talent and effort, net-wages reflect effort alone. In Roemer's model, socialist
markets and progressive taxation go some distance in resolving ( practical problems
of effort measurement, and they do so automatically at the state level as oppo(sed to
leaving it to complicated and idiosyncratic determinations by "effort commissions" at
local workplaces. Just how practical Roemer's scheme is I leave to readers. It may
not provide a method that success-( fully separates the morally arbitrary from that
for which individuals are "fully responsible." Following Rawls, I have already
questioned whether effort and responsibility always go together. And as Wolff says
(2003: 231) of Roemer's attempt, it does not address native talent within

liberal what Hahnel calls the "radical" maxim. According to Levine, the radical maxim
is "to each the same," in contrast to liberal egalitarian th(eories of justice that
permit inequality with their emphasis on the tie between individual respo(nsibility
and economic desert. "Thus liberal egalitarians, unlike egalitarians sans phrase do
not want everyone to have equal shares [of the favored distribuand-welfare or
resources] . . . .Their view of ind(ividual responsibility contravenes this
desideratum." Also, see Levine 1999. different educational groups, "so although
theoretically this approach pr(ovides insight of high order, it does not solve the
problem. It is no more possible [in our current s(tate of knowledge] to measure
talent levels with confidence than it is for effort levels." Is the practice of
economic desert compatible with radical egalitarian id(eals? One way of reconciling
the two may be to eliminate that part of its definition which includes differential
personal responsibility, thus questioning what Hahnel and other liberal egalitarians
deem so important (see footnote 20). Why must desert have a basis in some attribute
or action for which individuals are personally responsible? Do we not sometimes
assert that individuals, qua persons, deserve equal baseline respect and concern,
even though as Fred Fel(dman says (1995: 69) they are not responsible for being
persons, and does this not "provide( evidence for the [some21 times] independence of
responsibility and desert?" William Galston writes (1991: 131-2): "There is nothing
self-contradictory about basing a [desert claim] on (some undeserved feature of
yourself . . . [e.g., if] moral personality is the basis of your claim to( be taken
into consideration." He goes on to say that Rawls "establishes as the sole, relevant
desert basis a feature of our lives (moral personality) that equally characterizes
nearly all of us." I (think Galston is right on Rawls and I have argued that a
similar idea inspires Marx's model of a perfectly just society in which everyone, by
virtue of personhood, is deserving of equal welfare accorded by the communist
principle of distribution: to each according to need (DiQuattro 1998). (According to
the communist ideal, those economies which deny this by permitting morally arbitra(ry
factors (e.g. those allowed by meritocratic principles such as "to each according to
effort") to systematically influence distributive outcomes count as exploitative and
unjust. Author's Note Some of the ideas in this paper were presented at the Seattle
