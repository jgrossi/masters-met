the latter part of the 20th century and the first part of this new millennium has
been the triumph of short-term over long-term thinking. We are increasingly a culture
that looks neither to the past nor to the future, but only to the next ''quarter,''
or to the next Delphic pronouncement by Alan Greenspan. The proliferation of online
stock trading and 24-hour news and financial services has compressed our experience
of time to the frenetic pursuit of shortterm gains. This cultural construction of
time has given rise to social, political and personal problems of unprecedented
magnitude. Sociologist Richard Sennett argues, for example, in The Corrosion of
Character: The Personal Consequences of Work in the New Capitalism, that this
preoccupation with the short term corrodes character because ''character focuses on
the long-term aspect of our emotional experience'' (1998, p. 10). ''How are we,'' he

Renaissance, and the technology to which it gave rise, paved the way for the
industrial revolution. This revolution created enormous wealth. Much of it was
initially concentrated in the hands of a few industrialists, but the rise of labor
unions and the institution of labor laws such as governmentally mandated minimum
wages spread the wealth more equitably across populations. These newly affluent
populations represented huge markets for consumer goods. These markets gave rise to a
proliferation of large corporations, and large corporations required large number of
employees who they, in turn, offered the possibility of employment for life. The
latter part of the 20th century saw an explosion in the rate of the development of
technology. This explosion dramatically increased the variety of products available
to consumers. This increased the volatility of consumer demand and thus of the market
in general. Sennett, using IBM as his point of departure, provides an excellent
account of what happened to many large corporations during this period. I will thus
rely heavily upon Sennett's account in the first part of this paper. IBM had
practiced a kind of ''paternalistic capitalism'' up until the 1980s. That is, it
provided a host of lavish benefits including excellent health care, child care,
education and pensions, and ''provided a lifetime ladder of employment [with] all the
stages of a career laid out for people who were expected to stay and to climb''
(Sennett, 1998, p. 123). Unfortunately, IBM miscalculated the growth of the personal
computer industry and as a result suffered massive financial losses in the early
'90s. An elaborate internal bureaucracy<component x="58.51" y="91.05" width="227.2"

hierarchical structure of work with more flexible forms of organization, and with
flexible production aimed at getting more products more quickly to market (Sennett,
1998, p. 123).<component x="321.56" y="246.46" width="215.19" height="116.61"

Sennett, is the problem: our focus has shifted to the short term. ''[T]he average
length of time stocks have been held on British and American exchanges has dropped
60% in the last 15 years. The market believes rapid market return is best generated
by rapid institutional change'' (1998, p. 23). The difficulty is that in today's
market, conditions can change overnight, and a company that is not able to respond to
these changes to survive in the short term will not be around to worry about how best
to survive in the long run. Flexibility is perceived as positive. Stock prices,
Sennett observes, ''of institutions in the course of reorganization thereby often
rise, as though any change is better than continuing on as before. In the operation

simply because predicting the long-term consequences of an action has always been a
complicated and thus often onerous task, but because the speed at which technology is

made flexibility crucial to the survival of corporations. Flexibility, argues
Sennett, means, among other things, a willingness to ''reinvent'' institutions. This
turns out to be what is more commonly known as ''reengineering,'' or more
specifically, ''downsizing.'' This practice, by now so well established that it
requires no explanation, is carried out in the name of increasing efficiency.
Evidence suggests, however, that ''many, even most, reengineering efforts fail''
(Sennett, 1998, p. 49). Studies conducted by the American Management Association and
the Wyatt Companies reveal that ''repeated downsizing produces 'lower profits and
declining worker productivity'''(Sennett, 1998, p. 50). Downsizing reduces
productivity, at least in part, because it hurts morale. Anthony Sampson, an English
journalist who visited IBM's home offices in the mid-1990s, found, according to

where losing one's job can involve the very real threat of economic destitution. Yet

what appears to be the moral bankruptcy of contemporary 9 Greed may well be partially
responsible capitalism. for the inhumane face of the contemporary American
marketplace. It is an oversimplification, however, to suggest that greed is entirely
responsible. ''Greed for money - for the sake of money alone,'' writes Michael Lewis
in The Money Culture, ''requires years of practice to learn'' (xiii-xiv). Greed is
thus clearly not the only driving force in contemporary American capitalism. Fear is
also an important force. The evidence, again, is that downsizing is not ultimately
good for the bottom line. It would therefore be irrational to turn to downsizing as a
way of increasing profits in the long term. Many companies must thus do it out of a
fear that it is necessary to survive in the short term. That is, companies must fear
that if they do not do everything conceivable to increase the bottom line in the
short term, they will not be around for the long term. This is true not merely of
corporations as a whole, but of individuals within corporations. James William
Coleman observes, in The Criminal Elite, that many white-collar criminals are driven
by ''the fear that they will lose what they already have. Several studies show,'' he
continues, ''that illegal activities are more common in firms that are doing poorly
than in firms that are making big profits'' (1989, p. 204). What are people afraid of
? They are afraid of losing the economic struggle in this culture of competition.
They are afraid of being out competed in a Darwinian sense. That is, they are afraid
that if they do not win the struggle in the short term, they will not survive for the
long term. The difficulty is that this focus on the short term has numerous negative
consequences both for individuals and for society as a whole.<component x="58.51"

uprooting oneself from one community and one set of coworkers to be transplanted to
another community and another set of coworkers. It means that our connections to our
neighbors and colleagues are becoming increasingly tenuous. We have little incentive
to form lasting relationships with people with whom we may be in contact for only a
short time and the increasing length of the work day means we have little time to
devote to sustaining the few friendships, or commitments, we may succeed in
establishing. Character, argues Sennett, ''focuses on the longterm aspects of our
emotional experience'' (1998, p. 10). That is, character focuses on who we are beyond
the shifting chaos of our immediate experiences. But who we are is more than the sum
of our choices. It is a product, in part, of our self-conceptions, of the stories we
tell ourselves about the kinds of people we are, who and what we care about, how
successful we have been in expressing that concern and what we need to do to bring
our lives into conformity with our conceptions of the shape they ought to have. These
are our life narratives. It is becoming increasingly difficult, however, for people
to construct coherent narratives of their lives, to define themselves as individuals
in a world characterized by constant change. Who are my neighbors? Who are my
friends? Where do I call home? What do I value? These questions are difficult for
people who move frequently and have little leisure during which to develop interests
outside of work. Our conceptions of our roles within our immediate families are
diminished as the time we have to be with our families is increasingly compromised.
We cannot even take refuge in our conceptions of ourselves as professionals: Am I in
banking or insurance? Well, I was in banking, but now I'm in insurance. Our
self-conceptions are dwindling to the bare minimum we need to make sense of our
experience: ''I am a person doing what I have to do to survive in the new economic
market.'' But even this explanation is unsatisfactory, because there is nothing
distinctively human about doing what one has to do to survive. ''I am a creature
doing what it has to do to survive.'' That is how many of us conceive of ourselves
these days - i.e., as creatures doing what they have to do to survive. It is thus no
surprise that the Darwinian metaphor for the business world has become so popular. It
is 11 We each struggle to be fitter ''survival of the fittest.'' than our neighbors
and coworkers, whom we have come to view not as a source of companionship and
support, but as competition. As if this picture were not bleak enough, the rapidly
changing market means we have no enduring picture of what would constitute
''fitness.'' An education used to provide a certain assurance of economic success,
but this is not true anymore. No one can say with any certainty today what kind of
knowledge or skills will be in demand tomorrow. This uncertainty begets fear, and
fear can erode positive moral qualities such as trust and loyalty and personal
integrity to the extent that we become no better than the beasts in the Darwinian
metaphor.<component x="309.6" y="100.97" width="227.17" height="411.42" page="4"

more accurate, however, to say that it concerns the personal traits for which we are,
in fact, valued by others, not merely those for which we seek to be valued by others.
Character concerns traits such as honesty, loyalty, sympathy, self-discipline and
judgment. A person who is dishonest, disloyal, unsympathetic, and unable to forgo
immediate gratification makes a very poor companion and, one could argue, a very poor
partner in a business transaction. Character, in the moral sense, has traditionally
been thought to be something good in itself. It has been argued, however, that our
aversion to ''immoral'' people is pragmatic in origin, that ''immoral'' people are
not well suited to cooperative endeavors. But business is based on cooperative
endeavors. No cooperation, no commerce and eventually, ''no arts, no letters, no
society.'' Contemporary American capitalism is corroding character. The struggle
merely to survive is making 26 people less honest, less loyal and less sympathetic
and it is destroying their judgment in that it is depriving them of opportunities to
reflect on the long-term consequences of their actions and on what is really valuable

organizations to withstand rapid change. Change is associated with risk. If, however,
risk is to be imposed not merely on those who by nature deal well with it, but also
upon the mass of humanity that does not, the answer to the evils associated with such
an imposition would appear to involve making risk less risky. Much of what makes
risk, in this context, so frightening is its specific interpretation as economic
insecurity. But if flexible capitalism begets wealth, as its proponents argue, then
economic insecurity would appear to be an unnecessary evil of flexibility. The answer
to eliminating this evil would appear to be socking some of this wealth away to form
a safety net for those whose roles in the new system do not provide them this luxury.
Government, observes Sennett, ''can give people something like the tensile strength
of a tree, so that individuals do not break under the force of change'' (1998, p.
53). This is exactly what the governments of many countries are doing. The
Scandinavian countries, as well as countries as diverse as France, Germany, Italy and
Japan have adopted what the French banker Michel Albert calls the ''Rhine'' model of
political economy. This model, observes Sennett, ''has existed for nearly a century
in the Netherlands, Germany and France: in it labor unions and management share
power, and the welfare apparatus of the government provides a comparatively tightly
woven safety net of pensions, education, and health benefits'' (1998, p. 53). Laws in
Europe often make it difficult to fire employees. This inclines many companies to
view employees as a kind of investment an asset that can be improved but not
discarded. Employees in many European countries have a voice in the management 29

least as flexible, if not more so, than the American form, yet it protects ordinary
workers from the harsher economic consequences that are associated in the U.S. with
flexibility. Generous unemployment compensation and state pensions help to take much
of the sting out of the loss of a job or the change of a career. Laws also restrict
overtime, mandate ex30 paid maternity, paternity and tended vacations, family leaves,
as well as a host of services including affordable, if not free, health care,

needs will always be met, and there 31 is time for friends and family. Not
surprisingly, business in these countries tends to be less cutthroat and more

sources of support rather than competition. Subordinate employees are more likely to

comes at a price, and that price, in addition to high taxes, appears to be high
unemployment. Contemporary American laissez-faire capitalism ''has few political
restraints on wealth inequality but full employment, while the welfare networks of
the Rhinish states, which are more sensitive to ordinary workers, are a drag on its
creation. Which evil you tolerate,'' according to Sennett (i.e., the evil of
inequitable wealth distribution or the evil of high unemployment), ''depends on which
goal you pursue'' (1998, p. 55). It is misleading, however, to suggest that the goods
and evils of these two forms of political economy are roughly equal. Let us look for
a minute at these purported goods and evils. The kind of wealth inequality that
characterizes the U.S. today is an evil. Even its defenders seldom try to justify it
as good in itself. It is good, they argue, because it is a means to the end of the
creation of wealth in general, because it encourages entrepreneurship, which provides
jobs, which, in turn, spreads greater wealth throughout the population. That is, the
huge discrepancies in wealth in the U.S. are defended as a means to eventually making
those lower down on the economic ladder better off than they would have been in an
initially more egalitarian system such as those in the Rhinish states. The difficulty
with this account is that most Americans, as we saw, have not benefitted from these
inequalities; they have suffered from them. That is, the inequality is due not merely
to the rich getting richer. Most of the participants in the American form of flexible
capitalism have become poorer, both in money and in spirit, in the last 25 years even
as the rich have become richer. They have jobs, it is true (at least many have jobs),
but those jobs pay less, in real terms, than they used to, offer less security and
leave less time for a life outside of work - for friends, for family, for taking an
active role in one's community. 34 so the burden is not so onerous as it might Taxes
are higher in the Rhinish states, but so are wages, 35 and people get a great deal
for the money appear they pay in taxes. They get cheap, if not free, health care,
childcare and education. They get time for a life outside work, and the incalculable
luxury of taking a more active role in the lives of their children than most
Americans are able to. They get cleaner, safer, speedier systems of public
transportation and 36 cleaner, safer cities.<component x="58.51" y="91.04"

Europe have higher unemployment than does the U.S. What is seldom explained when this
''evil'' is cited against the defenders of the welfare state is that it is not nearly
so bad to be unemployed in a country with extensive social welfare programs as it is
to be unemployed in a country without them. No one need worry about going hungry or
going without adequate health care, and there are plenty of educational and cultural
opportunities for those who are not working. I don't mean to suggest here that the
Rhinish states have magically transformed unemployment into a delightfully extended
holiday. People like working. Even in the Scandinavian countries, which have the most
extensive social welfare programs in the world, unemployment is seen by most who
experience it as a challenge, something that has to be faced and dealt with, not 37
something to be savored. Americans have heard now for years that the fewer controls
we have on business, the better. An objective assessment, however, of the pros and
cons of the American, or laissez-faire, model of capitalism and 38 which inthe Rhine,

winner. A comparison of crime statistics alone would indicate that these societies

appreciate this is very likely because they have been persuaded by ''free market''
rhetoric. Some might argue that part of the foundation of contemporary American
capitalism is how we define the common good, that we think it is good for most people
to have to make huge personal sacrifices to succeed economically. It seems more
likely, however, that most Americans, with their limited experience of the variety of

The Soul of Economics, ''rules the marketplace'' (1991, p. 13). Many people believe
this is a good thing because competition, they argue, will ensure that the businesses
that survive will be ideally adapted to supply the needs of consumers. Everybody
wins! It is becoming clear to an increasing number of Americans that an unregulated
market does not automatically work out to the advantage of those most deserving (let
alone to the advantage of everyone). Competition has become so intense that some
people feel compelled to do things that are unethical, illegal or both, simply to
survive. They are afraid of being out competed in a Darwinian sense. They are afraid
that if they do not win the struggle in the short term, they will not survive for the
long term. People seem confusedly to believe that only the winner in an economic
competition gets to survive. This is undoubtedly based on a misunderstanding of
natural selection whereby it is interpreted to ensure optimal adaptation to the
environment. That is, creatures, or corporations, that are not optimally adapted will
be out competed by those that are and thus become extinct. Natural selection does
not, however, ensure optimal adaptation to the environment. All natural selection
says is that organisms that survive in an environment must be minimally adapted to
that environment. They may well exist along side organisms that are better adapted to
that same environment. One does not have to be the winner to survive an economic
competition. ''Placing,'' in the racing sense, is quite sufficient. ''Showing,'' in
fact, is often sufficient. The market actually tolerates a fairly broad spectrum of
economic success. That one is the least profitable company of a particular sort does
not necessarily mean one cannot continue to survive. It does not even necessarily
mean one's position is more precarious than that of more profitable companies. Highly
profitable companies sometimes go belly up with little warning. Recent experience
ought to make that point clear. We have come to think of competition as a kind of
panacea for a variety of social and economic ills. But competition in the
marketplace, like competition in nature, is neither bad nor good. It can be good if,
for example, it encourages innovation, but it can be bad if it drives either
creatures or corporations to behavior that will be destructive in the long term.
Natural selection does not actually guarantee that anything will survive in a highly
competitive environment. Whole populations can be driven, or indeed can drive
themselves, to extinction. If we are going to use natural selection as a metaphor for
understanding the contemporary American marketplace, we would do well to appreciate
what it actually implies. The myth of historical progress. Hobbes thought that life
in a state of nature was ''solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.'' It is indeed
commonly believed that the historical development has been progressive not merely in
a technological sense, but in a moral sense as well. Evidence suggests, however, that
human beings have always been social creatures and that the earliest human societies
were even more egalitarian than the 48 welfare states of contemporary northern
Europe. We tend to think of history as progressive, yet people in earlier periods
understood it as cyclical or 49 The truth appears to be that hiseven regressive.
torical development, like evolutionary change, is neither necessarily progressive nor
necessarily regressive. It is just one thing happening after another. ''Evolution

Different cultures, at different times, answer them differently. The answers depend
on the values a society professes, the weight it places on solidarity, prosperity,
tradition, piety. As a culture accumulates its answers to these questions, it creates
its version of the market. To the extent that political rhetoric frames the issue as
one grand choice - between government and the market - it befogs our view of the

role in regulating business and more generally in facilitating a better quality of
life for all citizens, then it is the citizens themselves who must provide the values
that will change the face of government and thus of America. A radical example is the
''Social Responsibility Amendment'' sponsored by the Tikkun Community, a nonsectarian
religious 53 The group working for positive social change. proposed amendment would
require ''[e]very corporation doing business in the United States with an &#x2026;
income above $20 million [to] receive a new corporate charter once every 20 years,
which will only be granted to corporations that prove (to a jury of citizens) that
they have a powerful record of social responsibility'' (Tikkun, May/June 2002).
Americans have been encouraged to think that the official separation of church and
state means their religious convictions should affect only their activities in the
private sphere, not in the public or political sphere. We give readily to charities
that help the poor, but we fail to push for welfare reforms that would be far more
effective than any private charity ever could be in meeting the needs of the
economically disadvantaged. We are appalled at the apparent moral bankruptcy of
people in business, but rather that pushing for tighter governmental regulation of
business, we persist in what is, at this point, the clearly irrational belief that
these problems will take care of themselves. Every spiritual tradition has values.
Those values that resonate with the greatest number of people in a society ought
properly to influence the policies of that state. The great fact/value distinction
that came to characterize modernism appears to have frightened many Americans away
from the public advocation of any values but crass materialism. Materialism is indeed
a value, however, just as the failure to make a decision is a decision. It is just
that it is a very impoverished value. We have seen something of the havoc it can
wreak when it is not accompanied by other values such as respect for the inherent
dignity and quality of life of all human beings.<component x="309.6" y="94.28"

for example, by Goethe is that Americans are not weighed 54 as are down by ''useless
memories'' (1825, p. 739) so many Europeans. Indeed, the United States has been
referred to as ''the country of the perpetual present tense'' (Sante, 1996, p. 67).
To prefer present goods, however, to long-term goods is irrational. Such preferences,
as Hobbes observed, can give rise to many ''unforeseen evils'' (Hobbes, 1642, p. 48)
This is something, one could argue, that people in older parts of the world, where
memories are longer, have a better grasp of than do Americans. The weight of memory
can drag one down and it is undoubtedly part of American exceptionalism in the
positive sense that Americans tend not to be dragged down by the ''blight of useless
memories and 55 Some senseless fights'' (Goethe, 1825, p. 739). memories are useful
though. If we have no memory, we cannot learn from our experience. Memory can weigh
one down in the positive sense that it can provide an anchor in the turbulent seas of
the contemporary market. We need to remember how increasing controls on business
throughout the first part of the 20th century improved the quality of life in this
country. We need to expand our focus from surviving until the next paycheck or the
next quarter to thriving into the next decade and beyond.<component x="58.51"

14 Hobbes' claim that adherence to basic principles of morality is in the interest of

lawyers talking in a popular restaurant in Philadelphia. The first was explaining to
the second that he had recently offered to take over all the duties of an associate

Brian J. Foley, Legal Methods Professor at Widener University School of Law for
bringing this problem to my attention. 22 This is part of the definition of
''character'' in The American Heritage Dictionary, 3rd Edition (Houghton Mifflin
Company, New York, NY, 1992). 23 This qualification of ''eventually'' is, in the
words of S&#xF8;ren Kierkegaard, ''something both to laugh at and to weep over.''
That is, even if it were true (and I will argue that it is not), it would be little
comfort to those whom the market mercilessly crushes on its purportedly inexorable
path to ''eventual'' benevolence. 24 As cited in Coleman (1989, p. 207). 25 See, for
example, Willis (2000), Coleman (1989) and Mokhiber and Weisman (1999) also contain a
wealth of examples of corporate crime. 26 ''A poll of 3,123 excellent high school
students listed in Who's Who Among American High School Students found that 80% of
the students said they do not think cheating is a big deal (Chicago Tribune, December
5, 1999, Sec. 13, p. 5). A national survey of 3,600 college students at 23 colleges
revealed that one in six college students had lied on a resume, job application, or
during a job interview; that two out of five had lied to a boss and a third had lied
to a customer during the past year; and that one out of five admitted to cheating on
an exam (Washington Post National Weekly Edition, December 7-13, 1992, p. 36). A
national public opinion poll of citizens found that three of four believed the
country's values and morals are in serious decline and nearly two-thirds said they
are dissatisfied with the 'honesty standards of behavior of people in this country'
(Washington Post National Weekly Edition, September 21, 1998, p. 10)'' (Johannesen,
2002, p. 5). 27 See, for example, Robert Solomon's reference to American management
style as dysfunctional (1993, p. 135). 28 See Pryor (2002, p. 11). 29 In Germany,
employee governance, or ''codetermination,'' of this sort, is actually mandated by
law (see Marshall and Tucker, 1992, pp. 47-48). 30 See, for example, the Danish
general strike of 1998 initiated primarily by the demand by one of the largest labor
unions in the country, LO (Landsorganisationen i Danmark), for a mandatory sixth week
of vacation. Danish law already requires 5 weeks of paid vacation a year. 31
Europeans work, on average, 350 hours less per year than Americans (see, Reich, 2000,
p. 6 and 112 and ''Key Indicators of the Labor Market'' and Report on the American
Workforce). 32 See, for example, Marshall and Tucker (1992, pp. 10- 11) and Chapter
4, ''Our Competitors take the Lead'' (1992, pp. 43-59). 33 See Sennett (1998, p. 50
and 151). It might be objected that part of the reason these countries outpaced the
U.S. from 1950 until approximately 1970 was that they were recovering from the
devastation of WWII. This fails to explain, however, why they continued to outpace us
in productivity growth after 1970. 34 Denmark, for example, has the highest taxes in
Europe, but it also pays the highest wages, with a minimum wage at DK 82, or about 10
an hour (see Pay in Europe 2001: Remuneration Policy and Practice) (The Federation of
European Employers, 2001). 35 Sennett's failure to appreciate this may be part of the
reason he provides no answer to the question of how we might avoid the evils of
contemporary Anglo-American capitalism. He acknowledges that it fails to meet the
inner needs of the people it purportedly serves. ''What political programs follow
from those inner needs,'' he concludes however, ''I simply don't know'' (1998, p.
148). This resignation is strange when a careful reader, I will argue, can find the
answer within the pages of Sennett's own book. 36 See note 3 above. It is sometimes
argued that the most successful and talented citizens of these social welfare states
will eventually be lured away by countries such as the U.S. that have lower taxes
(see, for example, Reich, 2000, p. 80) and that these states will thus have to lower
their taxes to prevent brain drain. This argument seems irrefutable to most
Americans, whose lack of economic security and eroded connection to place has taught
them to ''go where the money is.'' Most Europeans, however, have much stronger
connections to their communities than do Americans and are thus reluctant to relocate
simply for money. Danes, for example, have effectively been raising taxes since 1994
by gradually disallowing certain tax exemptions (see, for example, Hansen, 2001).
This appears to have had little effect, however, on the purported Danish ''brain
drain.'' Part of the pull of community felt by most Europeans is historical. They
have a stronger connection to place, one could argue, because most of them have been
in one place longer (i.e., for more generations) than have most Americans. This is
undoubtedly true. What is also true, however, is that the social-economic systems of
many European countries have allowed their citizens to maintain this connection to
place, while ours has eroded what connection was beginning to develop. 37 See, for
example, B&#xF8;rsting (2001). 38 Pryor (2002, p. 9). 39 See, Budtz (1996, passim).
40 Many Americans seem unaware, in fact, that even in this country capitalism has not
always had such an inhuman face. Pryor explains ignorance of the changing faces of
economic systems are a result partly of the complexity of these systems and partly
''due to the passage of time and the isolation of one generation from the experience
of another - grandchildren,'' he explains, ''usually have little knowledge of the
concrete circumstances of how their grand parents lived'' (Pryor, 2002, p. 41 42 43
16). See, for example, Pryor (2002, p. 13). See Schur (1969, p. 187). See, for
example, Weber (1920-21, passim). 44 See note 43 above. 45 See, for example, Feagin
(1975, passim). 46 See Willis (2000). 47 It may seem contentious to claim that
someone who may be forced to pay millions of dollars in fines and perhaps even serve
time in prison is unscathed. To those, however, who are facing the very real threat
of economic destitution upon retirement, someone who can pay millions of dollars in
fines and still have millions of dollars left over and who if he serves time in
prison it will very likely be short and in a relatively luxurious minimum security
institution, would appear to be getting off very lightly indeed. 48 See Coleman's
remarks on the anthropological evidence concerning hunter-gatherer societies (1989,
pp. 207-208). 49 See Charles A Beard's introduction to Bury (1955, p. xi). 50
Defenders of contemporary American capitalism argue that crime has actually gone down
in the last few years. Pryor notes, however, that part of the reason for the reduced
crime rate is that the rate of incarceration has gone up. ''If the incarceration rate
had remained at its 1980 level, so that many more potential criminals were at large
and committing one crime a month, then both the FBI and the victimization rates would
have risen steadily from 1980 onward'' (Pryor, 2002, p. 220). The U.S., reports The
Economist, ''now has 700 people out of every 100,000 under lock and key, five times
the proportion in Britain, the toughest sentencer in Western Europe'' (2002). Putting
people in prison is a short-sighted solution to reducing crime. It may create the
appearance of a harmonious society, but like painting over rust, it will only
exacerbate the problem in the long run. The majority of those currently incarcerated
will, after all, one day return to the streets. 51 Kierkegaard (1846, p. 102). The
''disease,'' one could argue, of the grossly inequitable distribution of wealth in
the U.S. has done just that. 52 Kierkegaard (1846, p. 267). 53 The Tikkun Community
grew out of the activities of Rabbi Michael Lerner, the editor of the magazine

stock trading and 24-hour news and financial services has compressed our experience
of time to the frenetic pursuit of shortterm gains. This cultural construction of
time has given rise to social, political and personal problems of unprecedented
magnitude. Sociologist Richard Sennett argues, for example, in The Corrosion of
Character: The Personal Consequences of Work in the New Capitalism, that this
preoccupation with the short term corrodes character because ''character focuses on
the long-term aspect of our emotional experience'' (1998, p. 10). ''How are we,'' he

Renaissance, and the technology to which it gave rise, paved the way for the
industrial revolution. This revolution created enormous wealth. Much of it was
initially concentrated in the hands of a few industrialists, but the rise of labor
unions and the institution of labor laws such as governmentally mandated minimum
wages spread the wealth more equitably across populations. These newly affluent
populations represented huge markets for consumer goods. These markets gave rise to a
proliferation of large corporations, and large corporations required large number of
employees who they, in turn, offered the possibility of employment for life. The
latter part of the 20th century saw an explosion in the rate of the development of
technology. This explosion dramatically increased the variety of products available
to consumers. This increased the volatility of consumer demand and thus of the market
in general. Sennett, using IBM as his point of departure, provides an excellent
account of what happened to many large corporations during this period. I will thus
rely heavily upon Sennett's account in the first part of this paper. IBM had
practiced a kind of ''paternalistic capitalism'' up until the 1980s. That is, it
provided a host of lavish benefits including excellent health care, child care,
education and pensions, and ''provided a lifetime ladder of employment [with] all the
stages of a career laid out for people who were expected to stay and to climb''
(Sennett, 1998, p. 123). Unfortunately, IBM miscalculated the growth of the personal
computer industry and as a result suffered massive financial losses in the early
'90s. An elaborate internal bureaucracy<component x="58.51" y="91.05" width="227.2"

Sennett, is the problem: our focus has shifted to the short term. ''[T]he average

60% in the last 15 years. The market believes rapid market return is best generated

market, conditions can change overnight, and a company that is not able to respond to
these changes to survive in the short term will not be around to worry about how best
to survive in the long run. Flexibility is perceived as positive. Stock prices,
Sennett observes, ''of institutions in the course of reorganization thereby often

made flexibility crucial to the survival of corporations. Flexibility, argues
Sennett, means, among other things, a willingness to ''reinvent'' institutions. This
turns out to be what is more commonly known as ''reengineering,'' or more
specifically, ''downsizing.'' This practice, by now so well established that it
requires no explanation, is carried out in the name of increasing efficiency.
Evidence suggests, however, that ''many, even most, reengineering efforts fail''
(Sennett, 1998, p. 49). Studies conducted by the American Management Association and
the Wyatt Companies reveal that ''repeated downsizing produces 'lower profits and
declining worker productivity'''(Sennett, 1998, p. 50). Downsizing reduces
productivity, at least in part, because it hurts morale. Anthony Sampson, an English
journalist who visited IBM's home offices in the mid-1990s, found, according to

where losing one's job can involve the very real threat of economic destitution. Yet

responsible capitalism. for the inhumane face of the contemporary American
marketplace. It is an oversimplification, however, to suggest that greed is entirely
responsible. ''Greed for money - for the sake of money alone,'' writes Michael Lewis
in The Money Culture, ''requires years of practice to learn'' (xiii-xiv). Greed is
thus clearly not the only driving force in contemporary American capitalism. Fear is
also an important force. The evidence, again, is that downsizing is not ultimately
good for the bottom line. It would therefore be irrational to turn to downsizing as a
way of increasing profits in the long term. Many companies must thus do it out of a
fear that it is necessary to survive in the short term. That is, companies must fear
that if they do not do everything conceivable to increase the bottom line in the
short term, they will not be around for the long term. This is true not merely of
corporations as a whole, but of individuals within corporations. James William
Coleman observes, in The Criminal Elite, that many white-collar criminals are driven
by ''the fear that they will lose what they already have. Several studies show,'' he
continues, ''that illegal activities are more common in firms that are doing poorly
than in firms that are making big profits'' (1989, p. 204). What are people afraid of
? They are afraid of losing the economic struggle in this culture of competition.
They are afraid of being out competed in a Darwinian sense. That is, they are afraid
that if they do not win the struggle in the short term, they will not survive for the
long term. The difficulty is that this focus on the short term has numerous negative
consequences both for individuals and for society as a whole.<component x="58.51"

uprooting oneself from one community and one set of coworkers to be transplanted to
another community and another set of coworkers. It means that our connections to our
neighbors and colleagues are becoming increasingly tenuous. We have little incentive
to form lasting relationships with people with whom we may be in contact for only a
short time and the increasing length of the work day means we have little time to
devote to sustaining the few friendships, or commitments, we may succeed in
establishing. Character, argues Sennett, ''focuses on the longterm aspects of our
emotional experience'' (1998, p. 10). That is, character focuses on who we are beyond
the shifting chaos of our immediate experiences. But who we are is more than the sum
of our choices. It is a product, in part, of our self-conceptions, of the stories we
tell ourselves about the kinds of people we are, who and what we care about, how
successful we have been in expressing that concern and what we need to do to bring
our lives into conformity with our conceptions of the shape they ought to have. These
are our life narratives. It is becoming increasingly difficult, however, for people
to construct coherent narratives of their lives, to define themselves as individuals
in a world characterized by constant change. Who are my neighbors? Who are my
friends? Where do I call home? What do I value? These questions are difficult for
people who move frequently and have little leisure during which to develop interests
outside of work. Our conceptions of our roles within our immediate families are
diminished as the time we have to be with our families is increasingly compromised.
We cannot even take refuge in our conceptions of ourselves as professionals: Am I in
banking or insurance? Well, I was in banking, but now I'm in insurance. Our
self-conceptions are dwindling to the bare minimum we need to make sense of our
experience: ''I am a person doing what I have to do to survive in the new economic
market.'' But even this explanation is unsatisfactory, because there is nothing
distinctively human about doing what one has to do to survive. ''I am a creature
doing what it has to do to survive.'' That is how many of us conceive of ourselves
these days - i.e., as creatures doing what they have to do to survive. It is thus no
surprise that the Darwinian metaphor for the business world has become so popular. It
is 11 We each struggle to be fitter ''survival of the fittest.'' than our neighbors
and coworkers, whom we have come to view not as a source of companionship and
support, but as competition. As if this picture were not bleak enough, the rapidly
changing market means we have no enduring picture of what would constitute
''fitness.'' An education used to provide a certain assurance of economic success,
but this is not true anymore. No one can say with any certainty today what kind of
knowledge or skills will be in demand tomorrow. This uncertainty begets fear, and
fear can erode positive moral qualities such as trust and loyalty and personal
integrity to the extent that we become no better than the beasts in the Darwinian
metaphor.<component x="309.6" y="100.97" width="227.17" height="411.42" page="4"

truth telling, promise keeping and respecting property. The point is not whether
Hobbes's account of the origin of civilization is correct. The point is that even
Hobbes, a figure often invoked to justify 13 saw that morally reprehensible business
practices, cohesive social units were impossible without some kind of moral

more accurate, however, to say that it concerns the personal traits for which we are,
in fact, valued by others, not merely those for which we seek to be valued by others.
Character concerns traits such as honesty, loyalty, sympathy, self-discipline and
judgment. A person who is dishonest, disloyal, unsympathetic, and unable to forgo
immediate gratification makes a very poor companion and, one could argue, a very poor
partner in a business transaction. Character, in the moral sense, has traditionally
been thought to be something good in itself. It has been argued, however, that our
aversion to ''immoral'' people is pragmatic in origin, that ''immoral'' people are
not well suited to cooperative endeavors. But business is based on cooperative
endeavors. No cooperation, no commerce and eventually, ''no arts, no letters, no
society.'' Contemporary American capitalism is corroding character. The struggle
merely to survive is making 26 people less honest, less loyal and less sympathetic
and it is destroying their judgment in that it is depriving them of opportunities to

organizations to withstand rapid change. Change is associated with risk. If, however,
risk is to be imposed not merely on those who by nature deal well with it, but also
upon the mass of humanity that does not, the answer to the evils associated with such
an imposition would appear to involve making risk less risky. Much of what makes
risk, in this context, so frightening is its specific interpretation as economic
insecurity. But if flexible capitalism begets wealth, as its proponents argue, then
economic insecurity would appear to be an unnecessary evil of flexibility. The answer
to eliminating this evil would appear to be socking some of this wealth away to form
a safety net for those whose roles in the new system do not provide them this luxury.
Government, observes Sennett, ''can give people something like the tensile strength
of a tree, so that individuals do not break under the force of change'' (1998, p.
53). This is exactly what the governments of many countries are doing. The
Scandinavian countries, as well as countries as diverse as France, Germany, Italy and
Japan have adopted what the French banker Michel Albert calls the ''Rhine'' model of
political economy. This model, observes Sennett, ''has existed for nearly a century
in the Netherlands, Germany and France: in it labor unions and management share
power, and the welfare apparatus of the government provides a comparatively tightly
woven safety net of pensions, education, and health benefits'' (1998, p. 53). Laws in
Europe often make it difficult to fire employees. This inclines many companies to
view employees as a kind of investment an asset that can be improved but not
discarded. Employees in many European countries have a voice in the management 29

least as flexible, if not more so, than the American form, yet it protects ordinary
workers from the harsher economic consequences that are associated in the U.S. with
flexibility. Generous unemployment compensation and state pensions help to take much

overtime, mandate ex30 paid maternity, paternity and tended vacations, family leaves,
as well as a host of services including affordable, if not free, health care,

needs will always be met, and there 31 is time for friends and family. Not
surprisingly, business in these countries tends to be less cutthroat and more
cooperative than it is in the U.S. Coworkers are inclined to see each other as
sources of support rather than competition. Subordinate employees are more likely to

comes at a price, and that price, in addition to high taxes, appears to be high
unemployment. Contemporary American laissez-faire capitalism ''has few political
restraints on wealth inequality but full employment, while the welfare networks of
the Rhinish states, which are more sensitive to ordinary workers, are a drag on its
creation. Which evil you tolerate,'' according to Sennett (i.e., the evil of
inequitable wealth distribution or the evil of high unemployment), ''depends on which
goal you pursue'' (1998, p. 55). It is misleading, however, to suggest that the goods
and evils of these two forms of political economy are roughly equal. Let us look for
a minute at these purported goods and evils. The kind of wealth inequality that
characterizes the U.S. today is an evil. Even its defenders seldom try to justify it
as good in itself. It is good, they argue, because it is a means to the end of the
creation of wealth in general, because it encourages entrepreneurship, which provides
jobs, which, in turn, spreads greater wealth throughout the population. That is, the
huge discrepancies in wealth in the U.S. are defended as a means to eventually making
those lower down on the economic ladder better off than they would have been in an
initially more egalitarian system such as those in the Rhinish states. The difficulty
with this account is that most Americans, as we saw, have not benefitted from these
inequalities; they have suffered from them. That is, the inequality is due not merely
to the rich getting richer. Most of the participants in the American form of flexible
capitalism have become poorer, both in money and in spirit, in the last 25 years even
as the rich have become richer. They have jobs, it is true (at least many have jobs),
but those jobs pay less, in real terms, than they used to, offer less security and
leave less time for a life outside of work - for friends, for family, for taking an
active role in one's community. 34 so the burden is not so onerous as it might Taxes
are higher in the Rhinish states, but so are wages, 35 and people get a great deal
for the money appear they pay in taxes. They get cheap, if not free, health care,
childcare and education. They get time for a life outside work, and the incalculable
luxury of taking a more active role in the lives of their children than most
Americans are able to. They get cleaner, safer, speedier systems of public
transportation and 36 cleaner, safer cities.<component x="58.51" y="91.04"

Europe have higher unemployment than does the U.S. What is seldom explained when this
''evil'' is cited against the defenders of the welfare state is that it is not nearly
so bad to be unemployed in a country with extensive social welfare programs as it is
to be unemployed in a country without them. No one need worry about going hungry or
going without adequate health care, and there are plenty of educational and cultural
opportunities for those who are not working. I don't mean to suggest here that the
Rhinish states have magically transformed unemployment into a delightfully extended
holiday. People like working. Even in the Scandinavian countries, which have the most
extensive social welfare programs in the world, unemployment is seen by most who
experience it as a challenge, something that has to be faced and dealt with, not 37
something to be savored. Americans have heard now for years that the fewer controls
we have on business, the better. An objective assessment, however, of the pros and
cons of the American, or laissez-faire, model of capitalism and 38 which inthe Rhine,
or ''social market'' model, volves more controls, make the latter appear a clear
winner. A comparison of crime statistics alone would indicate that these societies

appreciate this is very likely because they have been persuaded by ''free market''
rhetoric. Some might argue that part of the foundation of contemporary American
capitalism is how we define the common good, that we think it is good for most people
to have to make huge personal sacrifices to succeed economically. It seems more
likely, however, that most Americans, with their limited experience of the variety of
forms capitalism can take, are simply unaware that such sacrifices should 40 not be

because they are 45 lazy or incompetent'' (Coleman, 1989, p. 205). Recent events,
however, are beginning to change American attitudes toward the economically
disadvantaged as well as toward the market in general. There are many newly poor, and
there will be many more as the result of the Enron and WorldCom disasters as well as
other similar disasters such as that 46 Popular contempt at Procter and Gamble in

The Soul of Economics, ''rules the marketplace'' (1991, p. 13). Many people believe
this is a good thing because competition, they argue, will ensure that the businesses
that survive will be ideally adapted to supply the needs of consumers. Everybody
wins! It is becoming clear to an increasing number of Americans that an unregulated
market does not automatically work out to the advantage of those most deserving (let
alone to the advantage of everyone). Competition has become so intense that some
people feel compelled to do things that are unethical, illegal or both, simply to
survive. They are afraid of being out competed in a Darwinian sense. They are afraid
that if they do not win the struggle in the short term, they will not survive for the
long term. People seem confusedly to believe that only the winner in an economic
competition gets to survive. This is undoubtedly based on a misunderstanding of
natural selection whereby it is interpreted to ensure optimal adaptation to the
environment. That is, creatures, or corporations, that are not optimally adapted will
be out competed by those that are and thus become extinct. Natural selection does
not, however, ensure optimal adaptation to the environment. All natural selection
says is that organisms that survive in an environment must be minimally adapted to
that environment. They may well exist along side organisms that are better adapted to
that same environment. One does not have to be the winner to survive an economic
competition. ''Placing,'' in the racing sense, is quite sufficient. ''Showing,'' in
fact, is often sufficient. The market actually tolerates a fairly broad spectrum of
economic success. That one is the least profitable company of a particular sort does
not necessarily mean one cannot continue to survive. It does not even necessarily
mean one's position is more precarious than that of more profitable companies. Highly
profitable companies sometimes go belly up with little warning. Recent experience
ought to make that point clear. We have come to think of competition as a kind of
panacea for a variety of social and economic ills. But competition in the
marketplace, like competition in nature, is neither bad nor good. It can be good if,
for example, it encourages innovation, but it can be bad if it drives either
creatures or corporations to behavior that will be destructive in the long term.
Natural selection does not actually guarantee that anything will survive in a highly
competitive environment. Whole populations can be driven, or indeed can drive
themselves, to extinction. If we are going to use natural selection as a metaphor for
understanding the contemporary American marketplace, we would do well to appreciate
what it actually implies. The myth of historical progress. Hobbes thought that life
in a state of nature was ''solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.'' It is indeed
commonly believed that the historical development has been progressive not merely in
a technological sense, but in a moral sense as well. Evidence suggests, however, that
human beings have always been social creatures and that the earliest human societies
were even more egalitarian than the 48 welfare states of contemporary northern
Europe. We tend to think of history as progressive, yet people in earlier periods
understood it as cyclical or 49 The truth appears to be that hiseven regressive.
torical development, like evolutionary change, is neither necessarily progressive nor
necessarily regressive. It is just one thing happening after another. ''Evolution

they have a powerful record of social responsibility'' (Tikkun, May/June 2002).
Americans have been encouraged to think that the official separation of church and
state means their religious convictions should affect only their activities in the
private sphere, not in the public or political sphere. We give readily to charities
that help the poor, but we fail to push for welfare reforms that would be far more
effective than any private charity ever could be in meeting the needs of the
economically disadvantaged. We are appalled at the apparent moral bankruptcy of
people in business, but rather that pushing for tighter governmental regulation of
business, we persist in what is, at this point, the clearly irrational belief that
these problems will take care of themselves. Every spiritual tradition has values.
Those values that resonate with the greatest number of people in a society ought
properly to influence the policies of that state. The great fact/value distinction
that came to characterize modernism appears to have frightened many Americans away
from the public advocation of any values but crass materialism. Materialism is indeed
a value, however, just as the failure to make a decision is a decision. It is just
that it is a very impoverished value. We have seen something of the havoc it can
wreak when it is not accompanied by other values such as respect for the inherent
dignity and quality of life of all human beings.<component x="309.6" y="94.28"

for example, by Goethe is that Americans are not weighed 54 as are down by ''useless
memories'' (1825, p. 739) so many Europeans. Indeed, the United States has been
referred to as ''the country of the perpetual present tense'' (Sante, 1996, p. 67).
To prefer present goods, however, to long-term goods is irrational. Such preferences,
as Hobbes observed, can give rise to many ''unforeseen evils'' (Hobbes, 1642, p. 48)
This is something, one could argue, that people in older parts of the world, where
memories are longer, have a better grasp of than do Americans. The weight of memory
can drag one down and it is undoubtedly part of American exceptionalism in the
positive sense that Americans tend not to be dragged down by the ''blight of useless
memories and 55 Some senseless fights'' (Goethe, 1825, p. 739). memories are useful
though. If we have no memory, we cannot learn from our experience. Memory can weigh
one down in the positive sense that it can provide an anchor in the turbulent seas of
the contemporary market. We need to remember how increasing controls on business
throughout the first part of the 20th century improved the quality of life in this
country. We need to expand our focus from surviving until the next paycheck or the
next quarter to thriving into the next decade and beyond.<component x="58.51"

words of S&#xF8;ren Kierkegaard, ''something both to laugh at and to weep over.''
That is, even if it were true (and I will argue that it is not), it would be little
comfort to those whom the market mercilessly crushes on its purportedly inexorable
path to ''eventual'' benevolence. 24 As cited in Coleman (1989, p. 207). 25 See, for
example, Willis (2000), Coleman (1989) and Mokhiber and Weisman (1999) also contain a
wealth of examples of corporate crime. 26 ''A poll of 3,123 excellent high school
students listed in Who's Who Among American High School Students found that 80% of
the students said they do not think cheating is a big deal (Chicago Tribune, December

revealed that one in six college students had lied on a resume, job application, or
during a job interview; that two out of five had lied to a boss and a third had lied
to a customer during the past year; and that one out of five admitted to cheating on

national public opinion poll of citizens found that three of four believed the
country's values and morals are in serious decline and nearly two-thirds said they
are dissatisfied with the 'honesty standards of behavior of people in this country'
(Washington Post National Weekly Edition, September 21, 1998, p. 10)'' (Johannesen,
2002, p. 5). 27 See, for example, Robert Solomon's reference to American management
style as dysfunctional (1993, p. 135). 28 See Pryor (2002, p. 11). 29 In Germany,
employee governance, or ''codetermination,'' of this sort, is actually mandated by
law (see Marshall and Tucker, 1992, pp. 47-48). 30 See, for example, the Danish
general strike of 1998 initiated primarily by the demand by one of the largest labor
unions in the country, LO (Landsorganisationen i Danmark), for a mandatory sixth week
of vacation. Danish law already requires 5 weeks of paid vacation a year. 31
Europeans work, on average, 350 hours less per year than Americans (see, Reich, 2000,
p. 6 and 112 and ''Key Indicators of the Labor Market'' and Report on the American
Workforce). 32 See, for example, Marshall and Tucker (1992, pp. 10- 11) and Chapter
4, ''Our Competitors take the Lead'' (1992, pp. 43-59). 33 See Sennett (1998, p. 50
and 151). It might be objected that part of the reason these countries outpaced the
U.S. from 1950 until approximately 1970 was that they were recovering from the
devastation of WWII. This fails to explain, however, why they continued to outpace us
in productivity growth after 1970. 34 Denmark, for example, has the highest taxes in
Europe, but it also pays the highest wages, with a minimum wage at DK 82, or about 10
an hour (see Pay in Europe 2001: Remuneration Policy and Practice) (The Federation of
European Employers, 2001). 35 Sennett's failure to appreciate this may be part of the
reason he provides no answer to the question of how we might avoid the evils of
contemporary Anglo-American capitalism. He acknowledges that it fails to meet the
inner needs of the people it purportedly serves. ''What political programs follow
from those inner needs,'' he concludes however, ''I simply don't know'' (1998, p.
148). This resignation is strange when a careful reader, I will argue, can find the
answer within the pages of Sennett's own book. 36 See note 3 above. It is sometimes
argued that the most successful and talented citizens of these social welfare states
will eventually be lured away by countries such as the U.S. that have lower taxes
(see, for example, Reich, 2000, p. 80) and that these states will thus have to lower
their taxes to prevent brain drain. This argument seems irrefutable to most
Americans, whose lack of economic security and eroded connection to place has taught
them to ''go where the money is.'' Most Europeans, however, have much stronger
connections to their communities than do Americans and are thus reluctant to relocate
simply for money. Danes, for example, have effectively been raising taxes since 1994
by gradually disallowing certain tax exemptions (see, for example, Hansen, 2001).
This appears to have had little effect, however, on the purported Danish ''brain
drain.'' Part of the pull of community felt by most Europeans is historical. They
have a stronger connection to place, one could argue, because most of them have been
in one place longer (i.e., for more generations) than have most Americans. This is
undoubtedly true. What is also true, however, is that the social-economic systems of
many European countries have allowed their citizens to maintain this connection to
place, while ours has eroded what connection was beginning to develop. 37 See, for
example, B&#xF8;rsting (2001). 38 Pryor (2002, p. 9). 39 See, Budtz (1996, passim).
40 Many Americans seem unaware, in fact, that even in this country capitalism has not
always had such an inhuman face. Pryor explains ignorance of the changing faces of
economic systems are a result partly of the complexity of these systems and partly
''due to the passage of time and the isolation of one generation from the experience
of another - grandchildren,'' he explains, ''usually have little knowledge of the
concrete circumstances of how their grand parents lived'' (Pryor, 2002, p. 41 42 43
16). See, for example, Pryor (2002, p. 13). See Schur (1969, p. 187). See, for
example, Weber (1920-21, passim). 44 See note 43 above. 45 See, for example, Feagin
(1975, passim). 46 See Willis (2000). 47 It may seem contentious to claim that
someone who may be forced to pay millions of dollars in fines and perhaps even serve
time in prison is unscathed. To those, however, who are facing the very real threat
of economic destitution upon retirement, someone who can pay millions of dollars in
fines and still have millions of dollars left over and who if he serves time in
prison it will very likely be short and in a relatively luxurious minimum security
institution, would appear to be getting off very lightly indeed. 48 See Coleman's
remarks on the anthropological evidence concerning hunter-gatherer societies (1989,
pp. 207-208). 49 See Charles A Beard's introduction to Bury (1955, p. xi). 50
Defenders of contemporary American capitalism argue that crime has actually gone down
in the last few years. Pryor notes, however, that part of the reason for the reduced
crime rate is that the rate of incarceration has gone up. ''If the incarceration rate
had remained at its 1980 level, so that many more potential criminals were at large
and committing one crime a month, then both the FBI and the victimization rates would
have risen steadily from 1980 onward'' (Pryor, 2002, p. 220). The U.S., reports The
Economist, ''now has 700 people out of every 100,000 under lock and key, five times
the proportion in Britain, the toughest sentencer in Western Europe'' (2002). Putting
people in prison is a short-sighted solution to reducing crime. It may create the
appearance of a harmonious society, but like painting over rust, it will only
exacerbate the problem in the long run. The majority of those currently incarcerated
will, after all, one day return to the streets. 51 Kierkegaard (1846, p. 102). The
''disease,'' one could argue, of the grossly inequitable distribution of wealth in
the U.S. has done just that. 52 Kierkegaard (1846, p. 267). 53 The Tikkun Community

part of the reason these countries outpaced the U.S. from 1950 until approximately
1970 was that they were recovering from the devastation of WWII. This fails to
explain, however, why they continued to outpace us in productivity growth after
1970.</reference>
  <reference order="34">Denmark, for example, has the highest taxes in Europe, but it
also pays the highest wages, with a minimum wage at DK 82, or about 10 an hour (see
Pay in Europe 2001: Remuneration Policy and Practice) (The Federation of European
Employers, 2001).</reference>
  <reference order="35">Sennett's failure to appreciate this may be part of the
reason he provides no answer to the question of how we might avoid the evils of
contemporary Anglo-American capitalism. He acknowledges that it fails to meet the
inner needs of the people it purportedly serves. ''What political programs follow
from those inner needs,'' he concludes however, ''I simply don't know'' (1998, p.
148). This resignation is strange when a careful reader, I will argue, can find the
answer within the pages of Sennett's own book.</reference>
  <reference order="36">See note 3 above. It is sometimes argued that the most
successful and talented citizens of these social welfare states will eventually be
lured away by countries such as the U.S. that have lower taxes (see, for example,
Reich, 2000, p. 80) and that these states will thus have to lower their taxes to
prevent brain drain. This argument seems irrefutable to most Americans, whose lack of
economic security and eroded connection to place has taught them to ''go where the
money is.'' Most Europeans, however, have much stronger connections to their
communities than do Americans and are thus reluctant to relocate simply for money.
Danes, for example, have effectively been raising taxes since 1994 by gradually
disallowing certain tax exemptions (see, for example, Hansen, 2001). This appears to
have had little effect, however, on the purported Danish ''brain drain.'' Part of the
pull of community felt by most Europeans is historical. They have a stronger
connection to place, one could argue, because most of them have been in one place
longer (i.e., for more generations) than have most Americans. This is undoubtedly
true. What is also true, however, is that the social-economic systems of many
European countries have allowed their citizens to maintain this connection to place,
while ours has eroded what connection was beginning to develop.</reference>

  <reference order="40">Many Americans seem unaware, in fact, that even in this
country capitalism has not always had such an inhuman face. Pryor explains ignorance
of the changing faces of economic systems are a result partly of the complexity of
these systems and partly ''due to the passage of time and the isolation of one
generation from the experience of another - grandchildren,'' he explains, ''usually
have little knowledge of the concrete circumstances of how their grand parents
lived'' (Pryor, 2002, p.</reference>

  <reference order="47">It may seem contentious to claim that someone who may be
forced to pay millions of dollars in fines and perhaps even serve time in prison is
unscathed. To those, however, who are facing the very real threat of economic
destitution upon retirement, someone who can pay millions of dollars in fines and
still have millions of dollars left over and who if he serves time in prison it will
very likely be short and in a relatively luxurious minimum security institution,
would appear to be getting off very lightly indeed.</reference>

  <reference order="50">Defenders of contemporary American capitalism argue that
crime has actually gone down in the last few years. Pryor notes, however, that part
of the reason for the reduced crime rate is that the rate of incarceration has gone
up. ''If the incarceration rate had remained at its 1980 level, so that many more
potential criminals were at large and committing one crime a month, then both the FBI
and the victimization rates would have risen steadily from 1980 onward'' (Pryor,
2002, p. 220). The U.S., reports The Economist, ''now has 700 people out of every
100,000 under lock and key, five times the proportion in Britain, the toughest
sentencer in Western Europe'' (2002). Putting people in prison is a short-sighted
solution to reducing crime. It may create the appearance of a harmonious society, but
like painting over rust, it will only exacerbate the problem in the long run. The
majority of those currently incarcerated will, after all, one day return to the
streets.</reference>

  <reference order="35">Sennett's failure to appreciate this may be part of the
reason he provides no answer to the question of how we might avoid the evils of
contemporary Anglo-American capitalism. He acknowledges that it fails to meet the
inner needs of the people it purportedly serves. ''What political programs follow
from those inner needs,'' he concludes however, ''I simply don't know'' (1998, p.

answer within the pages of Sennett's own book.</reference>
  <reference order="36">See note 3 above. It is sometimes argued that the most
successful and talented citizens of these social welfare states will eventually be
lured away by countries such as the U.S. that have lower taxes (see, for example,
Reich, 2000, p. 80) and that these states will thus have to lower their taxes to
prevent brain drain. This argument seems irrefutable to most Americans, whose lack of
economic security and eroded connection to place has taught them to ''go where the
money is.'' Most Europeans, however, have much stronger connections to their
communities than do Americans and are thus reluctant to relocate simply for money.
Danes, for example, have effectively been raising taxes since 1994 by gradually
disallowing certain tax exemptions (see, for example, Hansen, 2001). This appears to
have had little effect, however, on the purported Danish ''brain drain.'' Part of the
pull of community felt by most Europeans is historical. They have a stronger
connection to place, one could argue, because most of them have been in one place
longer (i.e., for more generations) than have most Americans. This is undoubtedly
true. What is also true, however, is that the social-economic systems of many
European countries have allowed their citizens to maintain this connection to place,
while ours has eroded what connection was beginning to develop.</reference>

  <reference order="50">Defenders of contemporary American capitalism argue that
crime has actually gone down in the last few years. Pryor notes, however, that part
of the reason for the reduced crime rate is that the rate of incarceration has gone
up. ''If the incarceration rate had remained at its 1980 level, so that many more
potential criminals were at large and committing one crime a month, then both the FBI
and the victimization rates would have risen steadily from 1980 onward'' (Pryor,
2002, p. 220). The U.S., reports The Economist, ''now has 700 people out of every
100,000 under lock and key, five times the proportion in Britain, the toughest
sentencer in Western Europe'' (2002). Putting people in prison is a short-sighted
solution to reducing crime. It may create the appearance of a harmonious society, but
like painting over rust, it will only exacerbate the problem in the long run. The
majority of those currently incarcerated will, after all, one day return to the
streets.</reference>
