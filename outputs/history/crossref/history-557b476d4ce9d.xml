  <reference order="14">Hobbes' claim that adherence to basic principles of morality
is in the interest of the individual is often interpreted to mean that anything that
is in the interest of the individual is therefore moral. This is nothing other,
however, than the classical, logical fallacy of affirming the
consequent.</reference>
  <reference order="15">I recently overheard two lawyers talking in a popular

recently offered to take over all the duties of an associate who had just left his
firm for half her salary because, he continued, he did not have a wife and family to
make demands on his time.</reference>

  <reference order="23">This qualification of ''eventually'' is, in the words of
S&#xF8;ren Kierkegaard, ''something both to laugh at and to weep over.'' That is,
even if it were true (and I will argue that it is not), it would be little comfort
to those whom the market mercilessly crushes on its purportedly inexorable path to
''eventual'' benevolence.</reference>

  <reference order="26">''A poll of 3,123 excellent high school students listed in
Who's Who Among American High School Students found that 80% of the students said
they do not think cheating is a big deal (Chicago Tribune, December 5, 1999, Sec.
13, p. 5). A national survey of 3,600 college students at 23 colleges revealed that
one in six college students had lied on a resume, job application, or during a job
interview; that two out of five had lied to a boss and a third had lied to a
customer during the past year; and that one out of five admitted to cheating on an
exam (Washington Post National Weekly Edition, December 7-13, 1992, p. 36). A
national public opinion poll of citizens found that three of four believed the
country's values and morals are in serious decline and nearly two-thirds said they
are dissatisfied with the 'honesty standards of behavior of people in this country'
(Washington Post National Weekly Edition, September 21, 1998, p. 10)'' (Johannesen,
2002, p. 5).</reference>

  <reference order="29">In Germany, employee governance, or ''codetermination,'' of
this sort, is actually mandated by law (see Marshall and Tucker, 1992, pp.
47-48).</reference>
  <reference order="30">See, for example, the Danish general strike of 1998
initiated primarily by the demand by one of the largest labor unions in the country,
LO (Landsorganisationen i Danmark), for a mandatory sixth week of vacation. Danish
law already requires 5 weeks of paid vacation a year.</reference>
  <reference order="31">Europeans work, on average, 350 hours less per year than
Americans (see, Reich, 2000, p. 6 and 112 and ''Key Indicators of the Labor Market''
and Report on the American Workforce).</reference>
  <reference order="32">See, for example, Marshall and Tucker (1992, pp. 10- 11) and
Chapter 4, ''Our Competitors take the Lead'' (1992, pp. 43-59).</reference>
  <reference order="33">See Sennett (1998, p. 50 and 151). It might be objected that
part of the reason these countries outpaced the U.S. from 1950 until approximately
1970 was that they were recovering from the devastation of WWII. This fails to
explain, however, why they continued to outpace us in productivity growth after
1970.</reference>
  <reference order="34">Denmark, for example, has the highest taxes in Europe, but
it also pays the highest wages, with a minimum wage at DK 82, or about 10 an hour
(see Pay in Europe 2001: Remuneration Policy and Practice) (The Federation of
European Employers, 2001).</reference>
  <reference order="35">Sennett's failure to appreciate this may be part of the
reason he provides no answer to the question of how we might avoid the evils of
contemporary Anglo-American capitalism. He acknowledges that it fails to meet the
inner needs of the people it purportedly serves. ''What political programs follow
from those inner needs,'' he concludes however, ''I simply don't know'' (1998, p.
148). This resignation is strange when a careful reader, I will argue, can find the
answer within the pages of Sennett's own book.</reference>
  <reference order="36">See note 3 above. It is sometimes argued that the most
successful and talented citizens of these social welfare states will eventually be
lured away by countries such as the U.S. that have lower taxes (see, for example,
Reich, 2000, p. 80) and that these states will thus have to lower their taxes to
prevent brain drain. This argument seems irrefutable to most Americans, whose lack
of economic security and eroded connection to place has taught them to ''go where
the money is.'' Most Europeans, however, have much stronger connections to their
communities than do Americans and are thus reluctant to relocate simply for money.
Danes, for example, have effectively been raising taxes since 1994 by gradually
disallowing certain tax exemptions (see, for example, Hansen, 2001). This appears to
have had little effect, however, on the purported Danish ''brain drain.'' Part of
the pull of community felt by most Europeans is historical. They have a stronger
connection to place, one could argue, because most of them have been in one place
longer (i.e., for more generations) than have most Americans. This is undoubtedly
true. What is also true, however, is that the social-economic systems of many
European countries have allowed their citizens to maintain this connection to place,
while ours has eroded what connection was beginning to develop.</reference>

  <reference order="40">Many Americans seem unaware, in fact, that even in this
country capitalism has not always had such an inhuman face. Pryor explains ignorance
of the changing faces of economic systems are a result partly of the complexity of
these systems and partly ''due to the passage of time and the isolation of one
generation from the experience of another - grandchildren,'' he explains, ''usually
have little knowledge of the concrete circumstances of how their grand parents
lived'' (Pryor, 2002, p.</reference>

  <reference order="46">See Willis (2000).</reference>
  <reference order="47">It may seem contentious to claim that someone who may be
forced to pay millions of dollars in fines and perhaps even serve time in prison is
unscathed. To those, however, who are facing the very real threat of economic
destitution upon retirement, someone who can pay millions of dollars in fines and
still have millions of dollars left over and who if he serves time in prison it will
very likely be short and in a relatively luxurious minimum security institution,
would appear to be getting off very lightly indeed.</reference>
  <reference order="48">See Coleman's remarks on the anthropological evidence
concerning hunter-gatherer societies (1989, pp. 207-208).</reference>
  <reference order="49">See Charles A Beard's introduction to Bury (1955, p.
xi).</reference>
  <reference order="50">Defenders of contemporary American capitalism argue that
crime has actually gone down in the last few years. Pryor notes, however, that part
of the reason for the reduced crime rate is that the rate of incarceration has gone
up. ''If the incarceration rate had remained at its 1980 level, so that many more
potential criminals were at large and committing one crime a month, then both the
FBI and the victimization rates would have risen steadily from 1980 onward'' (Pryor,
2002, p. 220). The U.S., reports The Economist, ''now has 700 people out of every
100,000 under lock and key, five times the proportion in Britain, the toughest
sentencer in Western Europe'' (2002). Putting people in prison is a short-sighted
solution to reducing crime. It may create the appearance of a harmonious society,
but like painting over rust, it will only exacerbate the problem in the long run.
The majority of those currently incarcerated will, after all, one day return to the
streets.</reference>
