question of this article is how can we develop a critical understanding of the social
place of highways and automobility in the case of a non-capitalist European context
such as socialist Albania? Socialism was a period of modernisation for Albania. Part
of this modernisation project was the production of a modern built environment,
especially infrastructures and urban spaces. Within this context during socialism
thousands of miles of new roads were constructed in the country. The remarkably
limited use of ' roads, combined with their systematic building and maintenance, kept
this infrastructure s materiality in a relatively good condition for many decades.
Since the early 1990s, though, the end of the regime has signi ed a period of booming
mobility and automobility. Postsofi cialism and the wider context of neoliberalism
have been marked by state withdrawal from many of its previous roles, and the
maintenance of basic infrastructures has become increasingly dependent on
international aid. Nevertheless, the roads are currently being socially
reappropriated and recon gured, as people embrace automobility, which was a very
limited fi practice during socialism. This article explores the kind of
socio-material relationships that road construction and the roads themselves
generated in socialist Albania and how these are linked to postsocialist spatial
practices. K EY ORDS:W Socialism; Infrastructure; Highways; Materiality; Materialism;

postsocialist anecdote suggests that socialism was the longest and most ' painful
road from capitalism to capitalism (Verdery 1996, p. vii). In the case of Albania
this assertion was materialised very literally, as the great majority of Alba- - nian
citizens between 1945 and 1990 were forced or volunteered to create their socialist
homeland by building many km of new roads and resurfacing existing ones. fi According
to the doctrines of scienti c socialism such personal involvement in public works
would lead to new socio-material relationships and consequently to an emergence of
new socialist human subjects. So, Albanian people did not only partic<component

modern infrastructure, but also in the rest of the Albanian socialist modernisation
project, which included the collective construction of their own socialist
subjectivity. In this framework, the highways built during socialism in Albania must
be seen as one of the most emblematic and symbolically loaded projects of the regime.
But more importantly road construction has to be perceived as a - - key measure of
social engineering, since in a materialist manner what was primarily created via the
production of road materiality were new human subjectivities. fi If the materialism
of scienti c socialism advocates the necessity of novel material infrastructures in
order to move towards a new communist social formation, it is also the case that a
rather romantic but celebrated trend of Marxist materialist thought, based on the
other side of the cold war divide, were not big fans of motor-roads. They were mostly
unhappy for a similar reason, namely due to the sociocultural formations emerging out
of the new materialities and infrastructures of daily life. A good example of such
authors is Henri Lefebvre, who considered motorways as the archetypal spaces produced
for the domination of society and the environment (1991 - [1974], pp. 124 125, p.
165). Harvey (1990) also draws attention to the political sigfi ' ni cance of the
highway systems for late capitalism s urban growth. A few years before Harvey,
Virilio (1974) described modernity as the regime and the rule of the roads
(dromocracy) and referred to the city of Paris as being in a permanent state of fl
siege by its peripheral highway with its ceaseless ow of cars. (2004[2005], p. 3).
Already since the 1960s some of the most radical thinkers of the continent such as
the Situationists, were explicitly paving the way for the critique of highways and
automobility. The academic offspring of this wave articulated their critiques not '
longer after Debord (1967 [1994], p. 123) stated that: The dictatorship of the auto-
fi - mobile the pilot product of the rst stage of commodity abundance has left its
mark on the landscape with the dominance of freeways, which tear up the old urban '
centres and promote an ever-wider dispersal . Perhaps within this tradition we have '
to consider Marc Aug&#xE9; s perception of motor-roads as exemplary of non-place: fi
- spaces which lack social signi cance (1995, pp. 73 74, p. 100, p. 106, p. 118). The
major concern of the aforementioned Marxist studies of modern spatialities - is
speed, the so-called time space compression and the new socio-material relationships
it produces in late capitalism. This condition took place thanks to the
generalisation in the use of transportation and communication technologies after the
Second World War, which resulted in what Marx called poetically and prophetically ' '
annihilation of space by time (Marx 1858[1993, p. 539]). After the Second World War,
in the West, express-ways and cars were together creating the iconic autopias (Wollen
and Kerr 2002) of late capitalism, becoming the major reference of an accelerating
and long-distance cosmology of everyday life (Baudrillard 1986). The aforementioned
authors correctly perceived motorways not merely as an ' economic tool, but as a
major political and ideological apparatus of the state s sovereignty and most
importantly also as a formidable element of a completely new sociocultural condition.
However, we should bear in mind that a major initial reference for the most critical
of these authors (e.g. Virilio or Lefebvre) was the emphasis put on motorway
construction by both the Italian Fascist and German Nazi regimes. The modern
motorways were adopted, developed and extended by these two fi regimes, with the
autostrada of the lakes in Milan to be considered the rst modern motorways as we know
them today. A few years later, the autobahnen of the Third fi 1 ganda (see Vahrenkamp
2002, Mom 2005, 2006, Zeller 2010). Reich provided one of the most lmed, promoted and
iconic elements of Nazist propaIf the cement-surfaced motorways of the 1920s and
1930s were symbols of totalitarian regimes and the essential part of an economy of
war, currently in late modernity we in fact live in an 2 - ' inverted and asphalted
-version of Hitler s autobahn dream. After the Second - World War motorways were
elevated from the rural landscape aesthetics and the far- right war machine into the
standard spatial forms of late modern urban sprawl. In spite of the vernacularisation
of the process, all over the world governments and societies after the Second World
War, started imagining their development and modernisation as a process that would
require the hard surfaced, modernist lineal highway aesthetics. Roads were largely
about extending the built environment and surfacing ' ' natural landscapes with these
tangible proofs of technological advancement. Nevertheless, this aforementioned
critical thinking about automobility and motorways occasionally seems to be too
Western-centric. In most non-capitalist or non-Western contexts historically the mass
construction of roads was not necessarily - accompanied by the widespread
introduction of automobility. Nor did time space compression or high speeds follow
for the great majority of people. On the contrary, in most non-Western and
non-capitalist contexts automobility and high(er) speeds were so exclusive that the
asymmetric power divisions were explicitly materialised on the roads, where the more
powerful (e.g. the colonialist, the elite etc.) fi could enjoy the symbolic and
practical bene ts of fast(er) and more private mobility (see also Ingold 2004). The
social differentiation of road use was increased by the fact that in some places
those who did not have access to automobility were the same ones who had to build the
roads, as happened in colonialist African frameworks (Evans-Pritchard 1960, Thomas
2002) or as we will see below in socialist Albania (Dalakoglou 2009a, 2010a). Under
these circumstances, in non-capitalist and non-Western contexts, probably the promise
to expand automobility and the aspiration of the poor and disempowered to be included
in the emerging worlds of automobility should be approached fi critically, but
simultaneously this critical thinking should break away to a signi cant extent from
the critiques of automobility in Western late capitalism. Within this context, the
overall purpose of this article is to explore how we can understand highways and
automobility critically in the non-capitalist context of socialist Albania and its
postsocialist version. Based on my ethnographic and archival research of - 2005 2006
(Dalakoglou 2009a), I argue that post-Second World War road construction in Albania
emerged initially as a de-alienating process through which people aspired to create a
novel, socialist and modern future. Later it evolved into a monolithic state-run
project, failing on its basic materialist conception, namely the creation of certain
social relationships and human subjects. Nevertheless, this incomplete de-alienation
paved the way for postsocialist spatial practices and sociospatial relationships.
However, these newer socio-spatial relationships do not comprise a panacea of
human-material de-alienation either, but on the contrary they create new social
asymmetries. The Roads of an Immobile Society fi fi The of cially approved history of
Albania when it refers to the rst post-Second World War years states: the rest of the
country were all set in motion on local and national scale. Voluntary, unpaid work
was to play an important role, which was to be one of the most characteristic
features of the reconstruction effort in the country. (Pollo and Puto 1981, p. 249)
In the 1940s the idea was that the building of socialism needed the participation of
' ' every individual, and the government s plans called for people s direct
involvement. fi These ideological principles were articulated in a report by the
editorial of ces of the ' ' 1946 Constitution of the People s Republic of Albania:
People are not solidly supporting the democracy unless they grasp the economic
problem in their own ' - hands pretty literally. This theoretical statement was soon
materialised on the roads with the law No. 747 which came into force on 30 December
1949, dictating ' ' that it was compulsory for adult men, until the age of 45, to
work voluntarily in road maintenance and construction (Gazeta Zyrtare 1950, p. 4),
similar laws ' remained active until the end of socialism. For example, when the Road
Code of the ' ' - People s Socialist Republic of Albania of 1984 (Gazeta Zyrtare
1984, pp. 85 115) was introduced, it included articles outlining the responsibility
of countryside dwellers for the administration and maintenance of the roads within
their villages. Besides the voluntary maintenance, the regime also extended a policy
of paid road maintenance during the 1980s. Several university students in the late
1980s were paid to work during their summer holidays in some of these road works,
although ' ' the majority of road works in Albania were still constructed by
volunteers . These motorways in Albania were an economically and symbolically
oriented priority of the socialist regime and did not address the issue of
automobility for the wider society, with the exception of mobility to and from places
of work, and sometimes not even that. For example, in the relatively favoured
Gjirokast&#xEB;r region, where I conducted my own ethnography, people of various ages
would recall how during socialism they had almost always walked to work; also when
inhabitants of the surrounding villages wanted to go to the capital city of their
prefecture they had to walk, sometimes for several hours. Although the distances fl
within the city were relatively short, this re ected a more general lack of spatial
mobility. It also points to the respective scarcity of vehicles: In 1969, the entire
country (with a population of more than 2,000,000 and a total 4000 km of highways)
had no more than 2700 passenger vehicles, plus 7700 heavy vehicles (trucks and buses)
(Britannica 1974, p. 191; Marmullaku 1975, p. 101; Vjetari Statistikor 1991). Most of
my informants claimed that they travelled very little, if at all, by passenger car
during socialism. Private cars were not allowed in socialist Albania, until
permission was granted in a law passed on 19 March - 1991 (Fletorja Zyrtare 1991, pp.
122 124). Furthermore, another dimension of the general condition of spatial
immobility was the strict control of internal migration; no one was allowed to leave
her or his fi settlement for another without speci c permission. Certainly regarding
international mobility the condition was notoriously bad as passports were not
available to the general population. Mehmet Biber, one of the few journalists to
obtain a visa for Albania in the early 1980s, wrote in a National Geographic article
with a certain amount of exoticism involved: fl ights have to come from seaward and
[in] daylight hours only. (Biber 1980, p. 532). If one had to travel abroad she or he
had to obtain a special one-page permission, a fi temporary passport which was very
dif cult to secure and was exclusively available fi to people with state and Party af
liations. Potential escapees automatically con' fi ' ' demned their kinship group to
a bad biogra a , the regime s blacklist, leading, if fi nothing else, to serious dif
culty in gaining access to tertiary education, to Party or fi other public af
liations. Informants who did their national service on the borders fi con rmed that
border guards during socialism had shoot-to-kill-on-the-spot orders in case they saw
an escapee or invader, both considered equally dangerous for the social order. These
instructions caused some macabre and at the same time ridiculous incidents when they
came into force, such as the execution of people whose - backyards were divided by
the obscured Albanian Greek border (see Green 2005 and Dalakoglou (2010a) about this
ambiguous border). Nevertheless, already in 1945 several major automobile arteries
and plethora of bridges blown up during the war had been reconstructed. While the
Party was organising a socialist politico-economic system, road construction became
one of fi ' ' the rst priorities; Transport and Communications accounted for the
highest investment, after industry and agriculture, during the entire socialist
period (Vjetari Statistikor 1991). This emphasis on economic modernisation and roads
fi resulted in a signi cant increase in the length of asphalt-surfaced highways in
Albania, from 181 km in 1950 to 2850 km in 1990 (Vjetari Statistikor 1991). According
to the regime-friendly publications of the 1970s and 1980s, the total ' (surfaced and
unsurfaced) automobile roads length was increased three times in 3 ' comparison to
the pre-war period (Anonymous 1984, p. 165; Marmullaku 1975, p. 101). These
statistics though do not only hide the practical limitations on road - - usage by the
Albanian society but most importantly they mask that this very same society was
ideologically and physically forced to work on road building without payment.
Building the Roads fi As an Albanian-Kosovar sociologist and Yugoslavia state of cial
(Marmullaku - ' 1975, pp. 101 102) put it in the mid-1970s, In Albania every citizen
must spend one month taking part in work drives; even diplomats roll up their sleeves
and give ' a hand in the work brigades when they are home on leave . A decade later
in the '&#x2026; 1980s the Party of Labour of Albania intellectuals claimed that In
Albania [ ] you are liable to come across workers of the administration, people of
intellectual pursuit who are working directly in production shoulder to shoulder with
the work' ers and the peasants (Anonymous 1984, p. 216). Although these texts have
certain propaganda elements involved; it is true that most informants do not recall
ever riding in a passenger vehicle during socialism but they recall helping in the
building and rehabilitation of the road network in the country. The unpaid road works
involved many different categories of people. First of all were the convicts who did
systematic labour on roads and other public works; for some of the (imagined or
actual) anti-communist inmates, road construction facilitated the embedding of
state-socialist principles and thus their ideological reha' bilitation. Besides
prisoners, various youth unions, women s unions, unions of various non-manual labour
workers, local Democratic Fronts, cooperatives and other ' ' ' groupings, all under
the Party s control, organised expeditions of voluntary labour ' ' - on public works,
such as roads. Students in higher education also volunteered - and later were paid
for some road construction. The political power of an apparatus which involved almost
everyone capable of work is apparent. Building roads, besides the practical value of
providing infrastructures, could be considered ideologically as powerful as the
universal and mandatory school education and the universal military training
programmes of the socialist ' regime. As stated explicitly by a popular slogan of the
period: Let us found a socia' list state with a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the
other (Pollo and Puto 1981, p. 267). The two processes were often materialised
through the same policy; as a ' helpful informant recalled of his army service in the
1970s: What guns? We were ' digging roads and holes in the mountain [bunkers], rather
than learning army things . Materialities of Modernisation ' According to socialist
Albanian historiography: The ACP were hoping to make Albania, which until then had
been the most backward country in Europe, a ' developed and modern state in the
shortest possible period (Pollo and Puto 1981, p. 251). This modernisation had as its
main objectives the industrialisation of production and urbanisation. The latter
processes were advertised a lot by the ' regime: Before the war, over 85 per cent of
the population was rural and lived in backward and unhygienic conditions, with a high
illiteracy rate. Since the revolution ' this ratio has been completely altered
Marmullaku wrote (1975, p. 107). Or another ' anonymous Party s intellectual
explicitly set out the elements comprising the urban ' materiality of Albanian
modernisation: In 1975 the urban population made up 34.4 per cent of the population
of the country, as against 15.4 per cent in 1938. The number of towns now is nearly
threefold that of 1945. The old towns are being reconstructed, too, with wide,
asphalted streets, multi-storeyed modern buildings, ' cultural and sports
institutions, parks and gardens (Anonymous 1978). The state authorities undertook the
urbanisation projects having built new urban dwellings, industrial zones, redesigning
districts, expanding the cities and introducing new infrastructures. This emphasis on
urbanisation is indicated by the fact that almost every new residential building
constructed by the state was located in the cities; the people in the countryside had
private or semi-private houses and they had to take care of the refurbishment mostly
by themselves (Dalakoglou 2009a). A necessary part of this new urban planning was the
surfacing of roads which were evolving into the key element to complete the picture
of modernisation and, by fi extension, of socialism per se. Besides this of cial
literature, people even today never fail to mention the roads as one of the successes
of the socialist period. Dino, fi a former low-ranking of cial in the Party of Labour
of Albania argued during a conversation about progress: Enver and the Party made this
place a country, before they had nothing here, you are young, but if you had been
here you would have seen that Albania before the war was nothing because of the king
and the foreign interventions! Without state, without order, with poverty, without
doctors, if you were sick you were dead! Finished! Illiteracy, to exploit them
better, without big buildings, without electricity, without water, without roads,
without army, without police, without anything! N-o-t-h-i-n-g! Everyone with a
pickaxe, and very few ' ' clever ones who had the primary accumulation since the
Turks [Ottoman per4 iod], that was Albania. Eh, Hoxha made some mistakes, but he took
care of &#x2026; the country the Party was ordered, today this, tomorrow that,
slowly-slowly. Road construction was accompanied by the building of a modern state
apparatus which would have control over its territorial domain and the people living
there. 5 Historically the problem that the Ottoman and early post-Ottoman authorities
of Albania faced had been the mountainous terrain of the country. This is to say that
often the authorities had to confront semi-isolated mountainous populations who
refused to exchange their customary political system for the new modern nationstate.
Two pre-Second World War ethnologists of North Albania (Durham 1909, Huslack 1954)
and other contemporary travellers (Swire 1929, 1937) provided graphic descriptions of
this situation. This disobedience in the early twentieth century was regularly
articulated as a refusal to build the roads for free, since voluntary road building
was a policy that supposedly was applied by presocialist regimes, indeed with little
success. For example, Swire (1937) mentions that local ' chiefs amongst the Catholic
clans of the North had refused to allow their clan s participation in these projects.
These disobedient Albanian highlanders had an - elaborated unwritten customary law
which, among other things, was associated with extensive weapon use so several
presocialist state interventions ended up in ' armed revolts. In contrast, socialism
s roads were often translated as successful ' ' penetration of national state
presence. State-run publications would express their ' admiration: Motor transport
now penetrates deep into the mountain regions of the ' interior which were
inaccessible before (Anonymous 1978). Besides the roads as such, the socialist state
had very effective apparatuses against possible disobedience, precisely via
spatialisation of the punishment (exile and displacement) for ' the ones who would
refuse to build the state s spatialities. An informant who is a migrant in Greece
today, explained: We come originally from Shkod&#xEB;r [North], but when they brought
the road to our village and my grandfather, with some others, said that they would
not build the road for its entire length, but only the section of our plateau, they
exiled them with their entire families to the mountains down [South]. The roads, when
they arrived, connected up the various remote corners of Albania, effectively
networking the state. This expansion of the state apparatuses actually imposed a
national identity upon people who had for decades neglected the nation-state idea and
remained focused on their local regional systems of fi references. Since the 1940s,
socialism and modern nationalism as uni ed and unifying ideologies were introduced to
local communities, through the inspiration that communist ideals provided to
impoverished population of rural Albania and via a Second World War national
resistance movement which physically involved thousands of men and women from all
over the country. Certainly for the ones who were not inspired by the new ideologies
or were indifferent, the enforcement of the new political structure was materialised
very tangibly after the Second fi fi signi ed rst of all the coming of policing
apparatuses World War victory. The post-war introduction of roads to remote villages
-comprised partly of ' Partisans who had just liberated the country and certainly
people s justice system. Gradually, the land collectivisation and the foundation of
local agricultural or/and ' pastoral cooperatives and the local Party s branches
arrived along the roads. These processes established completely new spatialities to
the local communities alongside innovative ethos and new temporalities. A number of
straightforward ideological state apparatuses appeared at the same time as the roads;
state school' ' ' ing, libraries with Party s publications and of course the
volunteering for the construction and maintenance of public works were established in
towns and in fi villages. In fact socialism was the rst regime which managed to
effectively apply a body of such radical reforms on a national scale in Albania. The
Incomplete Subjectivities of the Road Some of the aforementioned statements, in
documents and by informants, imply a relationship between individual subjectivity and
the construction of surfaced - roads. The individual potentially socialist subject
was shaping the roads of- socialism with his/her body and the building of the road
was shaping the body and hypothetically the psyche of the individual into a socialist
one. An informant, Adil, explained with positive feelings the logic of the collective
building of infrastructures: That was the socialism of Hoxha, Enverism, all together
working one next to the other, with our own hands, with our own sweat to build
Albania and to progress, in order to understand what it means, how it is being
created, not to wake up in the morning and see a road ready, a square ready, a block
of fl ats high like this ready, like it happens now, but to know well how that was fi
made, how dif cult it is and its importance. Arber, from Gjirokast&#xEB;r,
articulated road construction in the 1980 as oppression, but he also emphasised what
seemed like an irrational character of the process: ' ' That was Hoxha: shut up and
work . Sit here, break stone, build the road, build the wall and do not speak! They
were above your head; they were &#x2026; guarding your mouth if you would dare,
speak! Say something! Complain &#x2026; about working! And see what would happen to
you [ ] what did they want the roads for, without cars? Why did they have the roads?
I tell you, in order &#x2026; to see who complains, they were clever to see who had
contacts abroad, who received television (signal) from Greece and knew that out there
everybody had cars! Not like us, we made the roads without cars. Although this
paradox principle noticed by Arber was very much a fact, the collective road
construction had a logic; a peculiar one perhaps, but it was a logic. The former
members of the Party of Labour of Albania that I knew in Gjirokast&#xEB;r and
generally a large number of socialist ideologists considered these kinds of practices
as the core of a socialist lifestyle. The collective participation in the building
and the consequent development of the new sense of belonging to the new entity of the
socialist social body was probably the most powerful ideological element in that
process; while the concrete materialisation of this collective effervescence, the
road, was standing there reminding the participants of their contribution to the
building of ' ' the new Albania and their socialist self. I built this road is what
four different people told me about the same road section on four separate occasions
in the Gjirokast&#xEB;r - area. The road section that they referred to and that all
of them claim to have built - has been largely reconstructed and repaired since 1990,
yet the strength of their fi identi cation with the site was such that still they
state that it was they who built it. Several men and women were, for a while,
collectively transformed into road builders. This innovative experience was embodied
by the subjects through intensive physical labour, eventually resulting in the
creation of a physical, tangible entity: the road. This was materializing
emblematically that collective experience and was comprising a material memory of
their collective socialist subjectivity. This ' ' ' was the case particularly with
the Party s pionieri (analogous to the Soviet KomSoMol) or in the case of students
and young soldiers who had to participate in this road constructions at a particular
point in with their lives. In their case one can observe very explicitly the power of
the experience of collective building. This was a type of accreditation of the
individual communist self. It was the passage from childhood to the real communist
adult, who got his hands dirty in a real, manual and productive type of job. The
Materiality of Declining Socialism ' ' fi Phrases like I built this road imply
individual identi cations with the state infrafi structure. But at the same time,
they offer a striking reminder that this identi cation merely referred to the labour
for the building of roads, but could not be expanded to the usage of these same
roads. Probably this fragmented connection to state projects was expressed best in
the question posed by a woman, who as a student in the early 1970s had participated
in the surfacing of the mountainous road that links ' ' Gjirokast&#xEB;r with the
city of Sarand&#xEB;. For whom were we making the roads? she wondered, as we chatted
together on the bus journey between the two towns. The Tiran&#xEB; Party authorities
assumed that everyone who participated in road confi ' struction automatically identi
ed with the regime s project. As a result, within three decades the regime had become
increasingly alienated from the society that had initially inspired. A society which
had participated actively during Second World War in the resistance organised by
communists and subsequently had voluntarily taken part in the construction of a
socialist country, was the same society which a generation or so later challenged the
socialist regime precisely in relation to its favoured infrastructure. In the 1970s
(especially after the 1976 constitution), the Albanian state turned completely into
an isolationist regime; it attempted to enforce total colfl lectivisation even on the
level of small domestic ocks and house gardens. However, without international
economic exchange and without that small-scale decentralised food production, it
could no longer sustain the availability or variety ' ' of basic goods. Even the
central committee of the Party , in 1990, admitted in one ' of its last publications,
in a rare spirit of self-critique: Nothing can justify shortages ' of vegetables,
milk, even of meat on the market of any city (Vickers and Pettifer fi 1997, p. 22).
But the majority of the Tiran&#xEB; of cials were counting numbers rather ' than
people. The state could not offer the various elements of a potentially pleas' fi ant
identi cation with its project (such as adequate food or petrol in the stores or the
possibility of geographic mobility) but it nevertheless expected the less pleasant -
aspects such as unpaid road building. Within this framework, even if the evidence
suggests that the collective building of roads was a genuinely voluntary activity
during the 1940s and 1950s, in the 1970s it had become an oppressive apparatus and
served to complete an increasingly widespread perception of a state working against
society. Besides the collective feeling of disappointment, this condition was
eventually fl re ected in the materiality of infrastructure, as the road building and
maintenance gradually diminished in quality. Many people did not put all their
efforts into the fi road construction while the authorities did not have suf cient
local support to mobilise the volunteers. Eventually, in the late 1980s, the
government had to pay more and more people for the maintenance of the roads and the
voluntary labour was employed only now and then, making newspaper headlines. The
materiality of decline can be illustrated by the story narrated by Kosta who
remembers with joy an event that took place in the mid-1980s. Someone important for
the regime was to visit from Tiran&#xEB; to review their livestock cooperative. The
local Party authorities mobilised almost everyone, to work on the rapid repair of the
worn out road that fi ' the of cial s convoy would use. The VIP visitor from
Tiran&#xEB; used the road to arrive punctually at the time announced, but a storm
forced him to stay overnight. The locals did their best to satisfy their visitor, who
of course enjoyed his stay. But the next morning, the new road was not there anymore
as it had been washed away by the rain since nobody had bothered much with the
quality of their work. Postsocialism as Spatial-Material Challenge of Socialism The
collapse of Albanian socialism is closely linked to the challenge of geographic
immobility. So the new cities, the roads and the borders, the domains where Albanian
socialism had spatialised its own political, social and material existence gradually
became the spaces where the everyday challenge to socialism was located. fi The
revolt which signi ed the end of socialism and the transition to a multi-Party state
actually took place in the Tiran&#xEB; neighbourhood where the foreign embassies were
concentrated. On 2 July 1990, a crowd of hundreds of youngsters clashed with ' the
police, jumped over the fences into the embassies enclosures and claimed asy' ' lum
abroad (Vickers and Pettifer 1997). Soon after those events the once sealed and
unpeopled highways in the south leading to the Albanian border with Greece fi were
transformed into vast crossing elds. According to a report (de Zwager et al. ' fi
2005) by the International Organization of Migration s Tiran&#xEB; of ce, from 30 to
31 - December 1990 alone, more than 800 Albanian citizens crossed the Albanian Greek
border at night. Today, Albania is the most migratory society in Europe: in 2000 it
was estimated that around 800,000 Albanians were migrants to Greece and Italy alone,
in comparison to 2,500,000 living within the country (King and Barjaba fl 2005, p.
3). This migratory ow and its scale proved determinant for the demise of socialism as
the most productive age groups and thus the most important means of fl production for
Albania, i.e. labour, literally owed out, within a few months. State plans could no
longer be materialised without workers. ' Despite the halt to the country s
productivity, international migration led to an increase to family budgets due to
remittances, which still constitute the major source of cash in Albania (see
Dalakoglou 2010b). However, the extended web of highways, their promise of mobility
and the past prohibition on private vehicles have to be seen as closely linked to the
development of particular consumption patfi terns and spatial practices in
postsocialist Albania: the rst two consumption priorities for those who could afford
them were the purchase of a private vehicle, preferably a Mercedes-Benz, and the
building and/or restoration of a house (Dalakoglou 2009b, 2010b). Thus, it was that a
country with a couple of thousand publicly owned vehicles in 1990, only three years
later had ca. 130,000 registered road vehicles and unknown numbers of unregistered
ones. But motor-roads and borders were not the only domains where the regime tried to
spatialise its own foundational project and which were subsequently used by people to
challenge the entire socialist construction; as was mentioned above, urban planning
was another ideologically loaded arena. During postsocialism, the urban planning
undertaken by the previous regime was also transformed into precisely a site from
which to challenge the values of the old regime. The example of the urban topography
of Gjirokast&#xEB;r city where I carried out my ethnography perfectly fi exempli es
this phenomenon: the old part of the city was registered as national fi architectural
heritage since the 1960s and since 2006 has been classi ed as a UNESCO world heritage
site. Thanks to conservation policies, the city has three relatively
well-distinguished zones which correspond to their respective historical periods: (a)
presocialist, (b) socialist and (c) postsocialist. Socialist urban planning included
everything that dominant modernist socialist ' ideology recommended: a wide
asphalt-paved boulevard named Boulevard 18 ' September (Figures 1 and 2), after the
date that Partisans liberated the city, including a roundabout (Figure 3) at its west
end, plenty of multi-storeyed modernist fl blocks of ats, a stadium and a sports
centre. - ' The post 1990 outburst of private building mainly sponsored by migrants
remittances -shapes the most recent urban expansion, on the periphery of the
socialist city complex (see Figure 2).<component x="68.03" y="43.79" width="358.72"

important part of the postsocialist spatial transformations is not the gigantic
expansion of the town, but the rapid relocation of the city centre. The Socialist
city inherited and expanded the presocialist urban centre: the ' market district
(Pazari) of the Gjirokast&#xEB;r s pre-war plan, which is located on the hills under
the Medieval citadel. However, since 1990, this old centre is rapidly declining and a
new one is emerging. The new social centre is the asphalt-paved ' ' Boulevard 18
September , which was built during socialism as one of the most emblematic spaces of
the new system at the time (see Figures 2 and 3). Since 1990, the social, economic,
political and juridical activity of the city has been concentrated along this 1 km
boulevard. Most of the retail shops are there, as are most of the ready-made food and
drink outlets. Moreover, some public services fi such as the police department, tax
of ce and courthouse have moved from the Pazari area down to the Boulevard. The daily
open-air market takes place there as well, fi and the three supermarkets of the city
are also located there. A second post of ce fi was opened on the Boulevard, along
with ve bank branches, in contrast to the one branch in Pazari. In Pazari, there are
less and less people and the shopkeepers there complain about the dramatic loss of
clientele. Every summer afternoon the Boulevard and its side-walks are packed with
cars and people, (see Figure 3) while the transport of both pedestrians and cars in
the Pazari district is strikingly diminished; the shops there are gradually closing
down while new ones open almost monthly along the Boulevard (see Figure 4). This
urban centralisation of road infrastructure in the form of the Boulevard is closely
linked to the mass introduction of private vehicles and the limited space for
automobiles in the hilly and steep narrow streets of Pazari by comparison to a wide
and asphalted Boulevard. However, the relocation of the urban centre is not only a
practical or a spatial phenomenon; it is primarily a social one. The people of the
city and the region of Gjirokast&#xEB;r dramatically centralise geographic mobility
in ' their daily lives. It is estimated that more than one-third of Gjirokast&#xEB;r
s pre-1990 population lives abroad, above all in Greece. So the Boulevard did not
emerge as the ideal new centre simply because it meets the requirements of an
increased use of motor vehicles as an integral part of urban living, but also because
this same - Boulevard links the city with the 29 km motorway leading to the Albanian
Greek border. (Dalakoglou 2010b). Given that today about half a million Albanian
passport holders live in Greece, these 29 km today, arguably concentrate one of the
most fi fi amazing volumes of traf c in the country, as they are the few last (or
rst) kilome- tres of the largest Albanian Greek cross-border passage. This
cross-border road was indeed one of the best examples of the paradox of the road
policies of Albanian socialism. It was literally a forbidden road for the ones who
did not hold special permission to reach the borders. Conclusions According to
several anthropologists of postsocialism (e.g. Humphrey 2003, Buchli 1999, Alexander
et al. 2007, Verdery 2002, etc.) infrastructures in (post)socialist societies have to
be approached from a Marxist materialist perspective. That is as -- both physical
material economic entities and also more abstractly as entities on which the
sociocultural superstructure is being erected. But it is not only anthropologists who
think in this way; the majority of people who lived under socialist regimes
understand how infrastructures are foundational systems of reference for the entire '
society (Humphrey 2003). The seemingly inevitable analogy between infrastructure s
materiality and the social order is what causes deeply ontological uncertainty and
moral panics in many postsocialist contexts, when infrastructures regularly break
down due to the cuts in public expenditure and the consequent collapse of the state
apparatus in these neoliberal times (see, Humphrey 2003). This material decline
represents to most people a wider social decline that has an immediate impact on
individual personhood and contributes immensely to the uncertainties of everyday
life. However, the case of roads in Albania seems to be different from other kind of
material infrastructures. For example, in the case of postsocialist Albania, although
the materiality of substantial parts of the roads was or is in severe disrepair the
society reappropriated the roads anew in completely different terms. In spite of the
moral panics involved in the increase of automobility, the new postsocialist usage of
roads and the explicit inequalities to the ways roads are used and accessed
(Dalakoglou 2009a), there are much less feelings of uncertainty linked with the
materiality of collapsing roads than one would perhaps expect from a society largely
socialised to approach the world in materialist terms. On the contrary, while the
materiality of roads is an important subject of discussion in Albania today, and
although the material decay of the roads in late socialism led to collective concerns
at the time, Albanians in postsocialism seem not to be worried by the uneven qual'
ity or simply bad quality of their country s roads per se. Such responses imply
ethnographically that the roads in our case are socially appropriated during
postsocialism in ways that neglect their materiality. More generfi ally it also
implies that roads are a different kind of infrastructure. By de nition roads are a
far more archetypical social infrastructure than for instance electricity networks -
or pipelines. Even when roads take their most modern(ist) form that of motorways -
they are still in principle considered part of a familiar technological realm, linked
conceptually with the usual categories of familiar mobility infrastructure, well
embedded in human experience, imagination and language. So whereas the vast majority
of people in socialist modernity were introduced to the other infrastructural
networks (such as electricity lines, telephone lines or pipelines) these were
experienced as more fi novel, more modernist, mysti ed and fetishised than roads
were. During socialism, road construction was prioritised because roads were the
material entities that would tangibly and explicitly link the central state to the
people of Albania, through controlling a semiologically established material entity.
The building of new roads or the repair of existing ones suggested that the state
could be imagined not only as a modernising force bringing new things like electric
light or other unfamiliar and new technologies, but one that explicitly sought to
transform existing daily materialities and provide nationwide networks linking the
bodies of ' new socialist subjects with the state. This link was achieved mostly via
people s involvement in the (re)construction of these infrastructures. However, as we
saw above, given the restrictions in mobility roads had little value as
infrastructures of human mobility, but they had enormous value as a political
technology and material entity that resurfaced the new national territory with the
new lineal materiality of the socialist state. However, the materialism of socialist
cosmology sooner or later led to a fetishism of the material infrastructure as such.
It prioritised material infrastructures and their economy, missing the links with
social relationships and individual subjectivity. Theoretically, the latter ones
would be determined in relation to the material form and the socialist mode of their
production, which would lead to the consequent socialist consciousness. The physical
involvement of people with the emergent infrastructure was considered necessary in
order for the 6 desired social order to be (re)produced. Although the roads under the
Albanian Party-Socialist regime were supposed to be produced based on labour
relationships that were intended to unite state and worker, eventually this
experience of roads alienated the masses from the state. By late socialism, the
internal contradictions had become more evident. The value of roads became primarily
that of political emblems, monuments to what socialism meant to be and eventually
also to its own failure. The spatial policies of the socialist state, in fact
literally paved the way for the postsocialist spatial practices of Albanian society.
However today in Albania possessing a car becomes one of the most explicit markers of
social and class distinction. So despite the promises of the postsocialist dream
which were incorporated into the new spatial practices, these practices are not
de-alienating for the majority either. Acknowledgements I would like to thank very

World War automobility and non-railway-based inland mobility emerge as major elements
of the war machine since millions of people had to move to the fronts to kill each
other. However, it was during the Second World War when automobility becomes both a
major war technology and an ideological state apparatus. ' 2. The Third Reich s
motorways were surfaced with cement not asphalt. ' ' 3. A lot of books published by
the state-run publishing house 8 Nentori during socialism in Albania have no author
or other entity which signs them. This is a standard practice seen in the context of
socialist states or organisations. As a librarian from Tirana explained, the idea
behind this practice was that a lot of these books were describing the achievements
of all Albanian people and so were representations of the collective spirit. 4. Enver
Hoxha was the leader of the Party of Labour of Albania (Communist Party) and iconic
leader of the country after the end of Second World War until 1985. 5. The
territories that comprise Albania today were part of the Ottoman empire until 1912. '
' 6. A situation that can also be seen in the most social of material infrastructures
: housing. The claim here is that in socialist contexts the mass housing projects
should be seen as part of the fi wider infrastructure construction projects, with
particular signi cance in fact, since they refer to one of the most intimate and
familiar spheres of daily life (see Buchli 1999, Dalakoglou 2009a, 2009b, 2010b)

question of this article is how can we develop a critical understanding of the social
place of highways and automobility in the case of a non-capitalist European context
such as socialist Albania? Socialism was a period of modernisation for Albania. Part
of this modernisation project was the production of a modern built environment,
especially infrastructures and urban spaces. Within this context during socialism
thousands of miles of new roads were constructed in the country. The remarkably
limited use of ' roads, combined with their systematic building and maintenance, kept
this infrastructure s materiality in a relatively good condition for many decades.
Since the early 1990s, though, the end of the regime has signi ed a period of booming
mobility and automobility. Postsofi cialism and the wider context of neoliberalism
have been marked by state withdrawal from many of its previous roles, and the
maintenance of basic infrastructures has become increasingly dependent on
international aid. Nevertheless, the roads are currently being socially
reappropriated and recon gured, as people embrace automobility, which was a very
limited fi practice during socialism. This article explores the kind of
socio-material relationships that road construction and the roads themselves
generated in socialist Albania and how these are linked to postsocialist spatial
practices. K EY ORDS:W Socialism; Infrastructure; Highways; Materiality; Materialism;

postsocialist anecdote suggests that socialism was the longest and most ' painful
road from capitalism to capitalism (Verdery 1996, p. vii). In the case of Albania
this assertion was materialised very literally, as the great majority of Alba- - nian
citizens between 1945 and 1990 were forced or volunteered to create their socialist
homeland by building many km of new roads and resurfacing existing ones. fi According
to the doctrines of scienti c socialism such personal involvement in public works
would lead to new socio-material relationships and consequently to an emergence of
new socialist human subjects. So, Albanian people did not only partic<component

modern infrastructure, but also in the rest of the Albanian socialist modernisation
project, which included the collective construction of their own socialist
subjectivity. In this framework, the highways built during socialism in Albania must
be seen as one of the most emblematic and symbolically loaded projects of the regime.
But more importantly road construction has to be perceived as a - - key measure of
social engineering, since in a materialist manner what was primarily created via the
production of road materiality were new human subjectivities. fi If the materialism
of scienti c socialism advocates the necessity of novel material infrastructures in
order to move towards a new communist social formation, it is also the case that a
rather romantic but celebrated trend of Marxist materialist thought, based on the
other side of the cold war divide, were not big fans of motor-roads. They were mostly
unhappy for a similar reason, namely due to the sociocultural formations emerging out
of the new materialities and infrastructures of daily life. A good example of such
authors is Henri Lefebvre, who considered motorways as the archetypal spaces produced
for the domination of society and the environment (1991 - [1974], pp. 124 125, p.
165). Harvey (1990) also draws attention to the political sigfi ' ni cance of the
highway systems for late capitalism s urban growth. A few years before Harvey,
Virilio (1974) described modernity as the regime and the rule of the roads
(dromocracy) and referred to the city of Paris as being in a permanent state of fl
siege by its peripheral highway with its ceaseless ow of cars. (2004[2005], p. 3).
Already since the 1960s some of the most radical thinkers of the continent such as
the Situationists, were explicitly paving the way for the critique of highways and
automobility. The academic offspring of this wave articulated their critiques not '
longer after Debord (1967 [1994], p. 123) stated that: The dictatorship of the auto-
fi - mobile the pilot product of the rst stage of commodity abundance has left its
mark on the landscape with the dominance of freeways, which tear up the old urban '
centres and promote an ever-wider dispersal . Perhaps within this tradition we have '
to consider Marc Aug&#xE9; s perception of motor-roads as exemplary of non-place: fi
- spaces which lack social signi cance (1995, pp. 73 74, p. 100, p. 106, p. 118). The
major concern of the aforementioned Marxist studies of modern spatialities - is
speed, the so-called time space compression and the new socio-material relationships
it produces in late capitalism. This condition took place thanks to the
generalisation in the use of transportation and communication technologies after the
Second World War, which resulted in what Marx called poetically and prophetically ' '
annihilation of space by time (Marx 1858[1993, p. 539]). After the Second World War,
in the West, express-ways and cars were together creating the iconic autopias (Wollen
and Kerr 2002) of late capitalism, becoming the major reference of an accelerating
and long-distance cosmology of everyday life (Baudrillard 1986). The aforementioned
authors correctly perceived motorways not merely as an ' economic tool, but as a
major political and ideological apparatus of the state s sovereignty and most
importantly also as a formidable element of a completely new sociocultural condition.
However, we should bear in mind that a major initial reference for the most critical
of these authors (e.g. Virilio or Lefebvre) was the emphasis put on motorway
construction by both the Italian Fascist and German Nazi regimes. The modern
motorways were adopted, developed and extended by these two fi regimes, with the
autostrada of the lakes in Milan to be considered the rst modern motorways as we know
them today. A few years later, the autobahnen of the Third fi 1 ganda (see Vahrenkamp
2002, Mom 2005, 2006, Zeller 2010). Reich provided one of the most lmed, promoted and
iconic elements of Nazist propaIf the cement-surfaced motorways of the 1920s and
1930s were symbols of totalitarian regimes and the essential part of an economy of
war, currently in late modernity we in fact live in an 2 - ' inverted and asphalted
-version of Hitler s autobahn dream. After the Second - World War motorways were
elevated from the rural landscape aesthetics and the far- right war machine into the
standard spatial forms of late modern urban sprawl. In spite of the vernacularisation
of the process, all over the world governments and societies after the Second World
War, started imagining their development and modernisation as a process that would
require the hard surfaced, modernist lineal highway aesthetics. Roads were largely
about extending the built environment and surfacing ' ' natural landscapes with these
tangible proofs of technological advancement. Nevertheless, this aforementioned
critical thinking about automobility and motorways occasionally seems to be too
Western-centric. In most non-capitalist or non-Western contexts historically the mass
construction of roads was not necessarily - accompanied by the widespread
introduction of automobility. Nor did time space compression or high speeds follow
for the great majority of people. On the contrary, in most non-Western and
non-capitalist contexts automobility and high(er) speeds were so exclusive that the
asymmetric power divisions were explicitly materialised on the roads, where the more
powerful (e.g. the colonialist, the elite etc.) fi could enjoy the symbolic and
practical bene ts of fast(er) and more private mobility (see also Ingold 2004). The
social differentiation of road use was increased by the fact that in some places
those who did not have access to automobility were the same ones who had to build the
roads, as happened in colonialist African frameworks (Evans-Pritchard 1960, Thomas
2002) or as we will see below in socialist Albania (Dalakoglou 2009a, 2010a). Under
these circumstances, in non-capitalist and non-Western contexts, probably the promise
to expand automobility and the aspiration of the poor and disempowered to be included
in the emerging worlds of automobility should be approached fi critically, but
simultaneously this critical thinking should break away to a signi cant extent from
the critiques of automobility in Western late capitalism. Within this context, the
overall purpose of this article is to explore how we can understand highways and
automobility critically in the non-capitalist context of socialist Albania and its
postsocialist version. Based on my ethnographic and archival research of - 2005 2006
(Dalakoglou 2009a), I argue that post-Second World War road construction in Albania
emerged initially as a de-alienating process through which people aspired to create a
novel, socialist and modern future. Later it evolved into a monolithic state-run
project, failing on its basic materialist conception, namely the creation of certain
social relationships and human subjects. Nevertheless, this incomplete de-alienation
paved the way for postsocialist spatial practices and sociospatial relationships.
However, these newer socio-spatial relationships do not comprise a panacea of
human-material de-alienation either, but on the contrary they create new social
asymmetries. The Roads of an Immobile Society fi fi The of cially approved history of
Albania when it refers to the rst post-Second World War years states: the rest of the
country were all set in motion on local and national scale. Voluntary, unpaid work
was to play an important role, which was to be one of the most characteristic
features of the reconstruction effort in the country. (Pollo and Puto 1981, p. 249)
In the 1940s the idea was that the building of socialism needed the participation of
' ' every individual, and the government s plans called for people s direct
involvement. fi These ideological principles were articulated in a report by the
editorial of ces of the ' ' 1946 Constitution of the People s Republic of Albania:
People are not solidly supporting the democracy unless they grasp the economic
problem in their own ' - hands pretty literally. This theoretical statement was soon
materialised on the roads with the law No. 747 which came into force on 30 December
1949, dictating ' ' that it was compulsory for adult men, until the age of 45, to
work voluntarily in road maintenance and construction (Gazeta Zyrtare 1950, p. 4),
similar laws ' remained active until the end of socialism. For example, when the Road
Code of the ' ' - People s Socialist Republic of Albania of 1984 (Gazeta Zyrtare
1984, pp. 85 115) was introduced, it included articles outlining the responsibility
of countryside dwellers for the administration and maintenance of the roads within
their villages. Besides the voluntary maintenance, the regime also extended a policy
of paid road maintenance during the 1980s. Several university students in the late
1980s were paid to work during their summer holidays in some of these road works,
although ' ' the majority of road works in Albania were still constructed by
volunteers . These motorways in Albania were an economically and symbolically
oriented priority of the socialist regime and did not address the issue of
automobility for the wider society, with the exception of mobility to and from places
of work, and sometimes not even that. For example, in the relatively favoured
Gjirokast&#xEB;r region, where I conducted my own ethnography, people of various ages
would recall how during socialism they had almost always walked to work; also when
inhabitants of the surrounding villages wanted to go to the capital city of their
prefecture they had to walk, sometimes for several hours. Although the distances fl
within the city were relatively short, this re ected a more general lack of spatial
mobility. It also points to the respective scarcity of vehicles: In 1969, the entire
country (with a population of more than 2,000,000 and a total 4000 km of highways)
had no more than 2700 passenger vehicles, plus 7700 heavy vehicles (trucks and buses)
(Britannica 1974, p. 191; Marmullaku 1975, p. 101; Vjetari Statistikor 1991). Most of
my informants claimed that they travelled very little, if at all, by passenger car
during socialism. Private cars were not allowed in socialist Albania, until
permission was granted in a law passed on 19 March - 1991 (Fletorja Zyrtare 1991, pp.
122 124). Furthermore, another dimension of the general condition of spatial
immobility was the strict control of internal migration; no one was allowed to leave
her or his fi settlement for another without speci c permission. Certainly regarding
international mobility the condition was notoriously bad as passports were not
available to the general population. Mehmet Biber, one of the few journalists to
obtain a visa for Albania in the early 1980s, wrote in a National Geographic article
with a certain amount of exoticism involved: fl ights have to come from seaward and
[in] daylight hours only. (Biber 1980, p. 532). If one had to travel abroad she or he
had to obtain a special one-page permission, a fi temporary passport which was very
dif cult to secure and was exclusively available fi to people with state and Party af
liations. Potential escapees automatically con' fi ' ' demned their kinship group to
a bad biogra a , the regime s blacklist, leading, if fi nothing else, to serious dif
culty in gaining access to tertiary education, to Party or fi other public af
liations. Informants who did their national service on the borders fi con rmed that
border guards during socialism had shoot-to-kill-on-the-spot orders in case they saw
an escapee or invader, both considered equally dangerous for the social order. These
instructions caused some macabre and at the same time ridiculous incidents when they
came into force, such as the execution of people whose - backyards were divided by
the obscured Albanian Greek border (see Green 2005 and Dalakoglou (2010a) about this
ambiguous border). Nevertheless, already in 1945 several major automobile arteries
and plethora of bridges blown up during the war had been reconstructed. While the
Party was organising a socialist politico-economic system, road construction became
one of fi ' ' the rst priorities; Transport and Communications accounted for the
highest investment, after industry and agriculture, during the entire socialist
period (Vjetari Statistikor 1991). This emphasis on economic modernisation and roads
fi resulted in a signi cant increase in the length of asphalt-surfaced highways in
Albania, from 181 km in 1950 to 2850 km in 1990 (Vjetari Statistikor 1991). According
to the regime-friendly publications of the 1970s and 1980s, the total ' (surfaced and
unsurfaced) automobile roads length was increased three times in 3 ' comparison to
the pre-war period (Anonymous 1984, p. 165; Marmullaku 1975, p. 101). These
statistics though do not only hide the practical limitations on road - - usage by the
Albanian society but most importantly they mask that this very same society was
ideologically and physically forced to work on road building without payment.
Building the Roads fi As an Albanian-Kosovar sociologist and Yugoslavia state of cial
(Marmullaku - ' 1975, pp. 101 102) put it in the mid-1970s, In Albania every citizen
must spend one month taking part in work drives; even diplomats roll up their sleeves
and give ' a hand in the work brigades when they are home on leave . A decade later
in the '&#x2026; 1980s the Party of Labour of Albania intellectuals claimed that In
Albania [ ] you are liable to come across workers of the administration, people of
intellectual pursuit who are working directly in production shoulder to shoulder with
the work' ers and the peasants (Anonymous 1984, p. 216). Although these texts have
certain propaganda elements involved; it is true that most informants do not recall
ever riding in a passenger vehicle during socialism but they recall helping in the
building and rehabilitation of the road network in the country. The unpaid road works
involved many different categories of people. First of all were the convicts who did
systematic labour on roads and other public works; for some of the (imagined or
actual) anti-communist inmates, road construction facilitated the embedding of
state-socialist principles and thus their ideological reha' bilitation. Besides
prisoners, various youth unions, women s unions, unions of various non-manual labour
workers, local Democratic Fronts, cooperatives and other ' ' ' groupings, all under
the Party s control, organised expeditions of voluntary labour ' ' - on public works,
such as roads. Students in higher education also volunteered - and later were paid
for some road construction. The political power of an apparatus which involved almost
everyone capable of work is apparent. Building roads, besides the practical value of
providing infrastructures, could be considered ideologically as powerful as the
universal and mandatory school education and the universal military training
programmes of the socialist ' regime. As stated explicitly by a popular slogan of the
period: Let us found a socia' list state with a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the
other (Pollo and Puto 1981, p. 267). The two processes were often materialised
through the same policy; as a ' helpful informant recalled of his army service in the
1970s: What guns? We were ' digging roads and holes in the mountain [bunkers], rather
than learning army things . Materialities of Modernisation ' According to socialist
Albanian historiography: The ACP were hoping to make Albania, which until then had
been the most backward country in Europe, a ' developed and modern state in the
shortest possible period (Pollo and Puto 1981, p. 251). This modernisation had as its
main objectives the industrialisation of production and urbanisation. The latter
processes were advertised a lot by the ' regime: Before the war, over 85 per cent of
the population was rural and lived in backward and unhygienic conditions, with a high
illiteracy rate. Since the revolution ' this ratio has been completely altered
Marmullaku wrote (1975, p. 107). Or another ' anonymous Party s intellectual
explicitly set out the elements comprising the urban ' materiality of Albanian
modernisation: In 1975 the urban population made up 34.4 per cent of the population
of the country, as against 15.4 per cent in 1938. The number of towns now is nearly
threefold that of 1945. The old towns are being reconstructed, too, with wide,
asphalted streets, multi-storeyed modern buildings, ' cultural and sports
institutions, parks and gardens (Anonymous 1978). The state authorities undertook the
urbanisation projects having built new urban dwellings, industrial zones, redesigning
districts, expanding the cities and introducing new infrastructures. This emphasis on
urbanisation is indicated by the fact that almost every new residential building
constructed by the state was located in the cities; the people in the countryside had
private or semi-private houses and they had to take care of the refurbishment mostly
by themselves (Dalakoglou 2009a). A necessary part of this new urban planning was the
surfacing of roads which were evolving into the key element to complete the picture
of modernisation and, by fi extension, of socialism per se. Besides this of cial
literature, people even today never fail to mention the roads as one of the successes
of the socialist period. Dino, fi a former low-ranking of cial in the Party of Labour
of Albania argued during a conversation about progress: Enver and the Party made this
place a country, before they had nothing here, you are young, but if you had been
here you would have seen that Albania before the war was nothing because of the king
and the foreign interventions! Without state, without order, with poverty, without
doctors, if you were sick you were dead! Finished! Illiteracy, to exploit them
better, without big buildings, without electricity, without water, without roads,
without army, without police, without anything! N-o-t-h-i-n-g! Everyone with a
pickaxe, and very few ' ' clever ones who had the primary accumulation since the
Turks [Ottoman per4 iod], that was Albania. Eh, Hoxha made some mistakes, but he took
care of &#x2026; the country the Party was ordered, today this, tomorrow that,
slowly-slowly. Road construction was accompanied by the building of a modern state
apparatus which would have control over its territorial domain and the people living
there. 5 Historically the problem that the Ottoman and early post-Ottoman authorities
of Albania faced had been the mountainous terrain of the country. This is to say that
often the authorities had to confront semi-isolated mountainous populations who
refused to exchange their customary political system for the new modern nationstate.
Two pre-Second World War ethnologists of North Albania (Durham 1909, Huslack 1954)
and other contemporary travellers (Swire 1929, 1937) provided graphic descriptions of
this situation. This disobedience in the early twentieth century was regularly
articulated as a refusal to build the roads for free, since voluntary road building
was a policy that supposedly was applied by presocialist regimes, indeed with little
success. For example, Swire (1937) mentions that local ' chiefs amongst the Catholic
clans of the North had refused to allow their clan s participation in these projects.
These disobedient Albanian highlanders had an - elaborated unwritten customary law
which, among other things, was associated with extensive weapon use so several
presocialist state interventions ended up in ' armed revolts. In contrast, socialism
s roads were often translated as successful ' ' penetration of national state
presence. State-run publications would express their ' admiration: Motor transport
now penetrates deep into the mountain regions of the ' interior which were
inaccessible before (Anonymous 1978). Besides the roads as such, the socialist state
had very effective apparatuses against possible disobedience, precisely via
spatialisation of the punishment (exile and displacement) for ' the ones who would
refuse to build the state s spatialities. An informant who is a migrant in Greece
today, explained: We come originally from Shkod&#xEB;r [North], but when they brought
the road to our village and my grandfather, with some others, said that they would
not build the road for its entire length, but only the section of our plateau, they
exiled them with their entire families to the mountains down [South]. The roads, when
they arrived, connected up the various remote corners of Albania, effectively
networking the state. This expansion of the state apparatuses actually imposed a
national identity upon people who had for decades neglected the nation-state idea and
remained focused on their local regional systems of fi references. Since the 1940s,
socialism and modern nationalism as uni ed and unifying ideologies were introduced to
local communities, through the inspiration that communist ideals provided to
impoverished population of rural Albania and via a Second World War national
resistance movement which physically involved thousands of men and women from all
over the country. Certainly for the ones who were not inspired by the new ideologies
or were indifferent, the enforcement of the new political structure was materialised
very tangibly after the Second fi fi signi ed rst of all the coming of policing
apparatuses World War victory. The post-war introduction of roads to remote villages
-comprised partly of ' Partisans who had just liberated the country and certainly
people s justice system. Gradually, the land collectivisation and the foundation of
local agricultural or/and ' pastoral cooperatives and the local Party s branches
arrived along the roads. These processes established completely new spatialities to
the local communities alongside innovative ethos and new temporalities. A number of
straightforward ideological state apparatuses appeared at the same time as the roads;
state school' ' ' ing, libraries with Party s publications and of course the
volunteering for the construction and maintenance of public works were established in
towns and in fi villages. In fact socialism was the rst regime which managed to
effectively apply a body of such radical reforms on a national scale in Albania. The
Incomplete Subjectivities of the Road Some of the aforementioned statements, in
documents and by informants, imply a relationship between individual subjectivity and
the construction of surfaced - roads. The individual potentially socialist subject
was shaping the roads of- socialism with his/her body and the building of the road
was shaping the body and hypothetically the psyche of the individual into a socialist
one. An informant, Adil, explained with positive feelings the logic of the collective
building of infrastructures: That was the socialism of Hoxha, Enverism, all together
working one next to the other, with our own hands, with our own sweat to build
Albania and to progress, in order to understand what it means, how it is being
created, not to wake up in the morning and see a road ready, a square ready, a block
of fl ats high like this ready, like it happens now, but to know well how that was fi
made, how dif cult it is and its importance. Arber, from Gjirokast&#xEB;r,
articulated road construction in the 1980 as oppression, but he also emphasised what
seemed like an irrational character of the process: ' ' That was Hoxha: shut up and
work . Sit here, break stone, build the road, build the wall and do not speak! They
were above your head; they were &#x2026; guarding your mouth if you would dare,
speak! Say something! Complain &#x2026; about working! And see what would happen to
you [ ] what did they want the roads for, without cars? Why did they have the roads?
I tell you, in order &#x2026; to see who complains, they were clever to see who had
contacts abroad, who received television (signal) from Greece and knew that out there
everybody had cars! Not like us, we made the roads without cars. Although this
paradox principle noticed by Arber was very much a fact, the collective road
construction had a logic; a peculiar one perhaps, but it was a logic. The former
members of the Party of Labour of Albania that I knew in Gjirokast&#xEB;r and
generally a large number of socialist ideologists considered these kinds of practices
as the core of a socialist lifestyle. The collective participation in the building
and the consequent development of the new sense of belonging to the new entity of the
socialist social body was probably the most powerful ideological element in that
process; while the concrete materialisation of this collective effervescence, the
road, was standing there reminding the participants of their contribution to the
building of ' ' the new Albania and their socialist self. I built this road is what
four different people told me about the same road section on four separate occasions
in the Gjirokast&#xEB;r - area. The road section that they referred to and that all
of them claim to have built - has been largely reconstructed and repaired since 1990,
yet the strength of their fi identi cation with the site was such that still they
state that it was they who built it. Several men and women were, for a while,
collectively transformed into road builders. This innovative experience was embodied
by the subjects through intensive physical labour, eventually resulting in the
creation of a physical, tangible entity: the road. This was materializing
emblematically that collective experience and was comprising a material memory of
their collective socialist subjectivity. This ' ' ' was the case particularly with
the Party s pionieri (analogous to the Soviet KomSoMol) or in the case of students
and young soldiers who had to participate in this road constructions at a particular
point in with their lives. In their case one can observe very explicitly the power of
the experience of collective building. This was a type of accreditation of the
individual communist self. It was the passage from childhood to the real communist
adult, who got his hands dirty in a real, manual and productive type of job. The
Materiality of Declining Socialism ' ' fi Phrases like I built this road imply
individual identi cations with the state infrafi structure. But at the same time,
they offer a striking reminder that this identi cation merely referred to the labour
for the building of roads, but could not be expanded to the usage of these same
roads. Probably this fragmented connection to state projects was expressed best in
the question posed by a woman, who as a student in the early 1970s had participated
in the surfacing of the mountainous road that links ' ' Gjirokast&#xEB;r with the
city of Sarand&#xEB;. For whom were we making the roads? she wondered, as we chatted
together on the bus journey between the two towns. The Tiran&#xEB; Party authorities
assumed that everyone who participated in road confi ' struction automatically identi
ed with the regime s project. As a result, within three decades the regime had become
increasingly alienated from the society that had initially inspired. A society which
had participated actively during Second World War in the resistance organised by
communists and subsequently had voluntarily taken part in the construction of a
socialist country, was the same society which a generation or so later challenged the
socialist regime precisely in relation to its favoured infrastructure. In the 1970s
(especially after the 1976 constitution), the Albanian state turned completely into
an isolationist regime; it attempted to enforce total colfl lectivisation even on the
level of small domestic ocks and house gardens. However, without international
economic exchange and without that small-scale decentralised food production, it
could no longer sustain the availability or variety ' ' of basic goods. Even the
central committee of the Party , in 1990, admitted in one ' of its last publications,
in a rare spirit of self-critique: Nothing can justify shortages ' of vegetables,
milk, even of meat on the market of any city (Vickers and Pettifer fi 1997, p. 22).
But the majority of the Tiran&#xEB; of cials were counting numbers rather ' than
people. The state could not offer the various elements of a potentially pleas' fi ant
identi cation with its project (such as adequate food or petrol in the stores or the
possibility of geographic mobility) but it nevertheless expected the less pleasant -
aspects such as unpaid road building. Within this framework, even if the evidence
suggests that the collective building of roads was a genuinely voluntary activity
during the 1940s and 1950s, in the 1970s it had become an oppressive apparatus and
served to complete an increasingly widespread perception of a state working against
society. Besides the collective feeling of disappointment, this condition was
eventually fl re ected in the materiality of infrastructure, as the road building and
maintenance gradually diminished in quality. Many people did not put all their
efforts into the fi road construction while the authorities did not have suf cient
local support to mobilise the volunteers. Eventually, in the late 1980s, the
government had to pay more and more people for the maintenance of the roads and the
voluntary labour was employed only now and then, making newspaper headlines. The
materiality of decline can be illustrated by the story narrated by Kosta who
remembers with joy an event that took place in the mid-1980s. Someone important for
the regime was to visit from Tiran&#xEB; to review their livestock cooperative. The
local Party authorities mobilised almost everyone, to work on the rapid repair of the
worn out road that fi ' the of cial s convoy would use. The VIP visitor from
Tiran&#xEB; used the road to arrive punctually at the time announced, but a storm
forced him to stay overnight. The locals did their best to satisfy their visitor, who
of course enjoyed his stay. But the next morning, the new road was not there anymore
as it had been washed away by the rain since nobody had bothered much with the
quality of their work. Postsocialism as Spatial-Material Challenge of Socialism The
collapse of Albanian socialism is closely linked to the challenge of geographic
immobility. So the new cities, the roads and the borders, the domains where Albanian
socialism had spatialised its own political, social and material existence gradually
became the spaces where the everyday challenge to socialism was located. fi The
revolt which signi ed the end of socialism and the transition to a multi-Party state
actually took place in the Tiran&#xEB; neighbourhood where the foreign embassies were
concentrated. On 2 July 1990, a crowd of hundreds of youngsters clashed with ' the
police, jumped over the fences into the embassies enclosures and claimed asy' ' lum
abroad (Vickers and Pettifer 1997). Soon after those events the once sealed and
unpeopled highways in the south leading to the Albanian border with Greece fi were
transformed into vast crossing elds. According to a report (de Zwager et al. ' fi
2005) by the International Organization of Migration s Tiran&#xEB; of ce, from 30 to
31 - December 1990 alone, more than 800 Albanian citizens crossed the Albanian Greek
border at night. Today, Albania is the most migratory society in Europe: in 2000 it
was estimated that around 800,000 Albanians were migrants to Greece and Italy alone,
in comparison to 2,500,000 living within the country (King and Barjaba fl 2005, p.
3). This migratory ow and its scale proved determinant for the demise of socialism as
the most productive age groups and thus the most important means of fl production for
Albania, i.e. labour, literally owed out, within a few months. State plans could no
longer be materialised without workers. ' Despite the halt to the country s
productivity, international migration led to an increase to family budgets due to
remittances, which still constitute the major source of cash in Albania (see
Dalakoglou 2010b). However, the extended web of highways, their promise of mobility
and the past prohibition on private vehicles have to be seen as closely linked to the
development of particular consumption patfi terns and spatial practices in
postsocialist Albania: the rst two consumption priorities for those who could afford
them were the purchase of a private vehicle, preferably a Mercedes-Benz, and the
building and/or restoration of a house (Dalakoglou 2009b, 2010b). Thus, it was that a
country with a couple of thousand publicly owned vehicles in 1990, only three years
later had ca. 130,000 registered road vehicles and unknown numbers of unregistered
ones. But motor-roads and borders were not the only domains where the regime tried to
spatialise its own foundational project and which were subsequently used by people to
challenge the entire socialist construction; as was mentioned above, urban planning
was another ideologically loaded arena. During postsocialism, the urban planning
undertaken by the previous regime was also transformed into precisely a site from
which to challenge the values of the old regime. The example of the urban topography
of Gjirokast&#xEB;r city where I carried out my ethnography perfectly fi exempli es
this phenomenon: the old part of the city was registered as national fi architectural
heritage since the 1960s and since 2006 has been classi ed as a UNESCO world heritage
site. Thanks to conservation policies, the city has three relatively
well-distinguished zones which correspond to their respective historical periods: (a)
presocialist, (b) socialist and (c) postsocialist. Socialist urban planning included
everything that dominant modernist socialist ' ideology recommended: a wide
asphalt-paved boulevard named Boulevard 18 ' September (Figures 1 and 2), after the
date that Partisans liberated the city, including a roundabout (Figure 3) at its west
end, plenty of multi-storeyed modernist fl blocks of ats, a stadium and a sports
centre. - ' The post 1990 outburst of private building mainly sponsored by migrants
remittances -shapes the most recent urban expansion, on the periphery of the
socialist city complex (see Figure 2).<component x="68.03" y="43.79" width="358.72"

important part of the postsocialist spatial transformations is not the gigantic
expansion of the town, but the rapid relocation of the city centre. The Socialist
city inherited and expanded the presocialist urban centre: the ' market district
(Pazari) of the Gjirokast&#xEB;r s pre-war plan, which is located on the hills under
the Medieval citadel. However, since 1990, this old centre is rapidly declining and a
new one is emerging. The new social centre is the asphalt-paved ' ' Boulevard 18
September , which was built during socialism as one of the most emblematic spaces of
the new system at the time (see Figures 2 and 3). Since 1990, the social, economic,
political and juridical activity of the city has been concentrated along this 1 km
boulevard. Most of the retail shops are there, as are most of the ready-made food and
drink outlets. Moreover, some public services fi such as the police department, tax
of ce and courthouse have moved from the Pazari area down to the Boulevard. The daily
open-air market takes place there as well, fi and the three supermarkets of the city
are also located there. A second post of ce fi was opened on the Boulevard, along
with ve bank branches, in contrast to the one branch in Pazari. In Pazari, there are
less and less people and the shopkeepers there complain about the dramatic loss of
clientele. Every summer afternoon the Boulevard and its side-walks are packed with
cars and people, (see Figure 3) while the transport of both pedestrians and cars in
the Pazari district is strikingly diminished; the shops there are gradually closing
down while new ones open almost monthly along the Boulevard (see Figure 4). This
urban centralisation of road infrastructure in the form of the Boulevard is closely
linked to the mass introduction of private vehicles and the limited space for
automobiles in the hilly and steep narrow streets of Pazari by comparison to a wide
and asphalted Boulevard. However, the relocation of the urban centre is not only a
practical or a spatial phenomenon; it is primarily a social one. The people of the
city and the region of Gjirokast&#xEB;r dramatically centralise geographic mobility
in ' their daily lives. It is estimated that more than one-third of Gjirokast&#xEB;r
s pre-1990 population lives abroad, above all in Greece. So the Boulevard did not
emerge as the ideal new centre simply because it meets the requirements of an
increased use of motor vehicles as an integral part of urban living, but also because
this same - Boulevard links the city with the 29 km motorway leading to the Albanian
Greek border. (Dalakoglou 2010b). Given that today about half a million Albanian
passport holders live in Greece, these 29 km today, arguably concentrate one of the
most fi fi amazing volumes of traf c in the country, as they are the few last (or
rst) kilome- tres of the largest Albanian Greek cross-border passage. This
cross-border road was indeed one of the best examples of the paradox of the road
policies of Albanian socialism. It was literally a forbidden road for the ones who
did not hold special permission to reach the borders. Conclusions According to
several anthropologists of postsocialism (e.g. Humphrey 2003, Buchli 1999, Alexander
et al. 2007, Verdery 2002, etc.) infrastructures in (post)socialist societies have to
be approached from a Marxist materialist perspective. That is as -- both physical
material economic entities and also more abstractly as entities on which the
sociocultural superstructure is being erected. But it is not only anthropologists who
think in this way; the majority of people who lived under socialist regimes
understand how infrastructures are foundational systems of reference for the entire '
society (Humphrey 2003). The seemingly inevitable analogy between infrastructure s
materiality and the social order is what causes deeply ontological uncertainty and
moral panics in many postsocialist contexts, when infrastructures regularly break
down due to the cuts in public expenditure and the consequent collapse of the state
apparatus in these neoliberal times (see, Humphrey 2003). This material decline
represents to most people a wider social decline that has an immediate impact on
individual personhood and contributes immensely to the uncertainties of everyday
life. However, the case of roads in Albania seems to be different from other kind of
material infrastructures. For example, in the case of postsocialist Albania, although
the materiality of substantial parts of the roads was or is in severe disrepair the
society reappropriated the roads anew in completely different terms. In spite of the
moral panics involved in the increase of automobility, the new postsocialist usage of
roads and the explicit inequalities to the ways roads are used and accessed
(Dalakoglou 2009a), there are much less feelings of uncertainty linked with the
materiality of collapsing roads than one would perhaps expect from a society largely
socialised to approach the world in materialist terms. On the contrary, while the
materiality of roads is an important subject of discussion in Albania today, and
although the material decay of the roads in late socialism led to collective concerns
at the time, Albanians in postsocialism seem not to be worried by the uneven qual'
ity or simply bad quality of their country s roads per se. Such responses imply
ethnographically that the roads in our case are socially appropriated during
postsocialism in ways that neglect their materiality. More generfi ally it also
implies that roads are a different kind of infrastructure. By de nition roads are a
far more archetypical social infrastructure than for instance electricity networks -
or pipelines. Even when roads take their most modern(ist) form that of motorways -
they are still in principle considered part of a familiar technological realm, linked
conceptually with the usual categories of familiar mobility infrastructure, well
embedded in human experience, imagination and language. So whereas the vast majority
of people in socialist modernity were introduced to the other infrastructural
networks (such as electricity lines, telephone lines or pipelines) these were
experienced as more fi novel, more modernist, mysti ed and fetishised than roads
were. During socialism, road construction was prioritised because roads were the
material entities that would tangibly and explicitly link the central state to the
people of Albania, through controlling a semiologically established material entity.
The building of new roads or the repair of existing ones suggested that the state
could be imagined not only as a modernising force bringing new things like electric
light or other unfamiliar and new technologies, but one that explicitly sought to
transform existing daily materialities and provide nationwide networks linking the
bodies of ' new socialist subjects with the state. This link was achieved mostly via
people s involvement in the (re)construction of these infrastructures. However, as we
saw above, given the restrictions in mobility roads had little value as
infrastructures of human mobility, but they had enormous value as a political
technology and material entity that resurfaced the new national territory with the
new lineal materiality of the socialist state. However, the materialism of socialist
cosmology sooner or later led to a fetishism of the material infrastructure as such.
It prioritised material infrastructures and their economy, missing the links with
social relationships and individual subjectivity. Theoretically, the latter ones
would be determined in relation to the material form and the socialist mode of their
production, which would lead to the consequent socialist consciousness. The physical
involvement of people with the emergent infrastructure was considered necessary in
order for the 6 desired social order to be (re)produced. Although the roads under the
Albanian Party-Socialist regime were supposed to be produced based on labour
relationships that were intended to unite state and worker, eventually this
experience of roads alienated the masses from the state. By late socialism, the
internal contradictions had become more evident. The value of roads became primarily
that of political emblems, monuments to what socialism meant to be and eventually
also to its own failure. The spatial policies of the socialist state, in fact
literally paved the way for the postsocialist spatial practices of Albanian society.
However today in Albania possessing a car becomes one of the most explicit markers of
social and class distinction. So despite the promises of the postsocialist dream
which were incorporated into the new spatial practices, these practices are not
de-alienating for the majority either. Acknowledgements I would like to thank very

World War automobility and non-railway-based inland mobility emerge as major elements
of the war machine since millions of people had to move to the fronts to kill each
other. However, it was during the Second World War when automobility becomes both a
major war technology and an ideological state apparatus. ' 2. The Third Reich s
motorways were surfaced with cement not asphalt. ' ' 3. A lot of books published by
the state-run publishing house 8 Nentori during socialism in Albania have no author
or other entity which signs them. This is a standard practice seen in the context of
socialist states or organisations. As a librarian from Tirana explained, the idea
behind this practice was that a lot of these books were describing the achievements
of all Albanian people and so were representations of the collective spirit. 4. Enver
Hoxha was the leader of the Party of Labour of Albania (Communist Party) and iconic
leader of the country after the end of Second World War until 1985. 5. The
territories that comprise Albania today were part of the Ottoman empire until 1912. '
' 6. A situation that can also be seen in the most social of material infrastructures
: housing. The claim here is that in socialist contexts the mass housing projects
should be seen as part of the fi wider infrastructure construction projects, with
particular signi cance in fact, since they refer to one of the most intimate and
familiar spheres of daily life (see Buchli 1999, Dalakoglou 2009a, 2009b, 2010b)
