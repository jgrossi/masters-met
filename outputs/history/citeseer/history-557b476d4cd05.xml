In these circumstances, people are willing voluntarily to submit to collective decisions without need for an authoritarian regime.11 There will certainly be conflict; unlike Sayer (1995: 80, 85), we have never imagined a socialist society as conflict- (or indeed contradiction-) free. We believe that collective decisions can be arrived at discursively since communication is possible despite social difference (Habermas, 1979; Doyal and Harris, 1991; Alexander, 1995). It is true that different social groups often have different ‘standards of merit’ (Sayer, 1995: 85); but these can be debated, greater understanding gained, and compromises or syntheses agreed. Sayer implicitly adopts the postmodern view that such communication is impossible; and, again in postmodern fashion, conflict can then only be resolved through violence (authoritarianism).12 Secondly, Sayer, following much postmodern writing, does not analyse the sources of difference, nor distinguish between desirable and undesirable differences.

But it would no longer be influenced by the factors discussed in the previous section: weakening of labour, private property in knowledge, and uneven access to finance. To this extent it would correspond more closely to Sayer’s ideal (and his potrayal of capitalism), that is, an enterprise division of labour serving technical efficiency. In addition, the enterprise division of labour would be revolutionized by drastic change from capitalism in such areas as banking, business services and advertising (Baran and Sweezy, 1974; Kidron and Gluckstein, 1974). (8) As Sayer and Walker point out (1992: 245–6), in any industrial society a worker‘s security in their particular job may be threatened by shifts in demand and changes in production methods. But they do not mention that the effects of this are strongly a function of levels of unemployment, degree of geographical uneveness, and resources for retraining and for reconversion of enterprises. These are far more favourable in our model than in capitalism (2, 3, 4 above). Again, technical and class determinants of the division of labour cannot be separated. (9) Despit</context>

Competition proceeds through, and depends on, attempts by individual capitals to increase their extraction of surplus value, that is, competition is inseparable from struggle between capital and labour (Bryan, 1985).3 Moreover, competition between enterprises elicits competition between the workers in those enterprises, since the quality and even existence of their jobs depend on successful competition by the capital employing them.

Dominant currents of the ruling elites have supported privatization of these economies in order to remove this threat of politicization and popular involvement. In the capitalist world, the move away from state intervention in the economy has been supported by capital as a means of imposing order on an economy which, in the 1960s and 1970s, had become dangerously overpoliticized (Habermas, 1976; Clarke, 1988). At any rate, the standard reasons given for the ‘death of socialism’ need to be problematized. The emergence of a more complex and technologically dynamic economy is not the whole picture, as it appears in Sayer and in dominant discourses: the role of the conflict between elites and the working class and the politicization arising from high socialization need to be considered in their dialectic with technological development.

There has certainly been insufficient attention by marxists in recent decades to how such coordination might work.

Sayer mentions this issue only once (1995: 86); this is because economic coordination for him is an essentially technical question, whereas for us it is essentially one of social relations, and specifically of people’s dedication to social production. Devine (1988) explicitly excludes this question from his work. The commonly given answer, that the existence of a democratically controlled economy will, cumulatively, elicit dedication and altruism, is partly true; but, especially in early decades, it cannot be the only process relied on. Peer pressures, at different spatial scales, will be important. Enterprises should be audited by workers in the same sector to see if effort is sufficient and work intensity roughly equal, and whole sectors similarly by workers in other sectors.

Finally, we argue that Sayer’s mistakes on these issues are connected to his theoretical approach. Opposing divisions of workers under capitalism Sayer argues that the development of the division of labour under capitalism, while it may have caused alienation and a loss of community, is necessary to economic growth (1995: 81–2); if the division of labour was ‘drastically reduced . . . the level of economic development would plummet’ (ibid.: 82); thus the division of labour is a product of industrial society, not capitalism. Sayer (1995: 92–3) accordingly criticizes as luddite our argument (Eisenschitz and Gough, 1993: 208) that divisions in labour should be combatted by socialist (local) economic policy. But Sayer’s argument elides a whole number of distinct aspects of the division of labour. It is certainly true that the division of labour between a myriad of particular skills deployed in an advanced economy is necessary in order to develop those skills to a sufficiently high level: one cannot be a clothing machinist on Monday, an architectural design softwear writer on Tuesday, and so on through the week, without loss of productivity.

(10) In the production of some consumer goods and services, it would be possible to go further, and to have an active and collective input from final ‘consumers’, or rather, from the producers of labour for whom consumption goods are inputs (ILO, 1962; Elson, 1988). Production and reproduction are then planned together, altering the division of labour between them. Consumption choices can go beyond what an individual might decide on their own (e.g. the choice between private and public transport may be different when taken individually and collectively respectively). This is done now, in very limited ways, in education, health, housing and transport; but such planning is constantly broken up by private decision-making and by capital’s fear of excessive demands and the politicization of the process whereby the mode of production is reproduced.

The contemporary production system is finely tuned to such differences among workers (see second section), and the contemporary design and marketing of products addresses, and reinforces, these differences among consumers (Gough, forthcoming); but this should be something to be combatted, not accepted (Fraser, 1995). Thirdly, there are certainly social differences, some inherited by and some produced by capitalism, which are positive and life-enhancing, and which economic organization should enable or promote. But the capitalist economy, far from being uniformly responsive to such differences, suppresses many of them. Most obviously, positive aspects of many ethnic or regionally-specific cultures are eroded not merely by marketing by powerful capitalist firms (McDonaldization), but by the erosion of traditional cultures by the uncontrolled development of capitalist production relations; our model of a so</context>

An important part of the increase in subcontracting by large firms is due, not to benefits of specialization, but to a wish to weaken the collective organization of labour 2 See note 4. 3 This can be neglected if one follows Hayek and supposes that within enterprises there is a ‘unitary hierarchy of ends’, that is, no fundamental conflict. Sayer makes this assumption in most of his argument (Sayer, 1995:</context>

(2) By planning to avoid overcapacity it can reduce premature devalorization of enterprises, local economies and labour power. (3) By planning the investment-productivity-wage relation at the national level it can minimize unemployment. This then reduces the division of workers by labour market competition (see second section; Gough, 1992). This capability, together with (1) and (2), means that demand is far more stable and predictable than under capitalism; part of the unpredictability faced by enterprises under capitalism is thus specific to the mode of production, a product of capitalism’s fragmented decisionmaking and tendency to overaccumulation, a point missed by Sayer.

To this extent it would correspond more closely to Sayer’s ideal (and his potrayal of capitalism), that is, an enterprise division of labour serving technical efficiency. In addition, the enterprise division of labour would be revolutionized by drastic change from capitalism in such areas as banking, business services and advertising (Baran and Sweezy, 1974; Kidron and Gluckstein, 1974).

The discussion is constructed around ideal type categories which are portrayed as simple opposites: the division of labour and capitalist relations of production, catallaxies and ‘economies*’, total plan versus total fragmentation, rationalization versus liberty. But we have seen that, at all but the very highest levels of abstraction, these opposites infuse and construct each other in crucial ways (Ollman, 1993). Similarly, class, gender, ‘race’ and other social relations are treated as if they were effectively exterior to each other. Sayer’s proposed ‘dual analysis’, division of labour plus capitalist relations, thus suffers from the same weakness as ‘dual systems analysis’ of gender (patriarchy plus capitalism): basic elements of the two systems (at a high level of abstraction) construct each other, so that the nature of the systems cannot be separately specified in anything but the most abstract fashion.15 This is a characteristic failing of critical realism, which focuses on specifying the ‘causa</context>

We have seen how he counterposes concrete difference to abstract commonalities (‘simple empiricism’), for example in viewing divisions within the working class as the negation of any common interests. We have tried to suggest how the two are dialectically related. At the same time, he uses extreme abstraction in a way which squeezes out much relevant medium level and concrete complexity. Following Hayek (Palmer, 1993), he poses a choice between a completely centrally planned economy and a completely fragmented one (albeit with an unspecified amount of ‘intervention’ allowed in the latter); but both of these are too schematic to correspond to any conceivable reality. Consequently, he poses a choice between an unalienated, conflict-free economy with the totally unified collective subject, and one of completely individualized enterprises, workers and consumers.

These tensions between private control of enterprises and the productive logic of coordination can also be seen at the level of whole societies. The ‘death of socialism’ is the political and intellectual backdrop to Sayer’s article. He argues that ‘[t]o a certain extent, as the demise of state socialist or centrally planned economies shows, an advanced division of labour is intractable whatever the social relations of production’ (Sayer, 1995: 83; cf. ibid.: 87; see also Sayer, 1992: 345).

The latter is left very vague; but it is evident that this intervention is to be mild and pragmatic (ibid.: 90–1). Indeed, the logic of Sayer’s main argument is, as in Hayek, against any intervention: only enterprises know their business and only individual consumers know their needs; any planning authority is less knowledgeable, and its intervention will therefore result in inefficiency.4 Thus, although he has a caveat that intervention may be positive, Sayer’s theoretical arguments remain within the notorious polarization of Hayek: total plan or total fragmentation (compare Sayer and Walker, 1992: 262–3). Sayer’s model does not solve many problems. It would be capable of ameliorating the negative aspects of the division of labour created by individual enterprise management (second section, part one). But, as we have already noted, these are connected with, and would thus be undermined by, aspects of the division of labour created by wider patterns of accumulation (second section, part two): progressive gender divisions within the enterprise would be undermined by lack of attention to gender in the reproduction sphere, for example, while competition between enterprises produces pressur</context>

In fact, Hayek’s central arguments are exactly why this should be the case. ß Joint Editors and Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1997 28 Jamie Gough and Aram Eisenschitz and spatial uneven development is inevitable. Like other versions of ‘market socialism’ (Nove, 1983), then, Sayer’s model suffers from not containing significantly more coordination of enterprises than capitalism (Palmer, 1993).5 One can agree that an economy whose investment, inter-enterprise purchases and prices are planned entirely from the centre is infeasible (Sayer and Walker, 1992: 255–9); but this is a straw man, for there are many other possibilities between total centralization and total fragmentation. There has certainly been insufficient attention by marxists in recent decades to how such coordination might work. Sayer (1995: 92–3) and other critics have pointed out that we did not provide any model of this in our book (Eisenschitz and Gough, 1993); we plead lack of space. In our view the work of Devine (1988) provides a good starting point for a debate on socialist planning of an advanced economy; the bare bones of his model, plus some ideas of our own, will suff</context>

But he does not give any substantial reasons why arguments such as that given here, developed for bourgeois political democracy, do not apply to economic democracy. 12 Sayer’s argument that enterprise coordination leads to authoritarianism appeals to the experience of the non-capitalist socities (Sayer, 1995: 84). A more plausible explanation is that authoritarianism has its roots in distribution, to secure a high living standard for the bureaucracy (Trotsky, 1972). ß Joint Editors and Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1997 The division of labour, capitalism and socialism 33 economy to enhance skill levels and people’s participation in generating and acquiring knowledge (sections two and four (6)) would encourage the development and expression of difference. In these ways, coordination of the economy, far from imposing uniformity, would enable many positive individual and group differences to flourish.
