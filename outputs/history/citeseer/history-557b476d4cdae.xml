Stark’s (1982) dissertation focused on new class configurations in capitalist and state socialist societies, but his later work on labor markets (1986) already anticipated his subsequent manifest institutionalism. I recognize far more continuity than does Burawoy in the work of these individuals, but I think Burawoy is quite right on another score. Class is not where it used to be, and socialism is not the counterculture to capitalism it once was (Bauman 1976). The intellectual field around social change has shifted dramatically, in part because Eastern Europe is far more important to American sociology than it ever was. But one misses the significance of that shift by focusing on what has happened to class analysis and socialism. One of the most dramatic changes in sociology has occurred in the explosion of opportunity to conduct ethnographies in Eastern Europe. Communist rule severely restricted this kind of scholarship (Verdery 1996). In fact, one reason Burawoy wound up working in Hungary under communist rule was because he could not gain acces</context>

Janos Kornai’s (1992) political economy provides the point of departure for many assessments of socialism. Jozsef Borocz,Martha Lampland, Akos Rona-Tas, and Szonya Szelenyi, all leading figures in the American sociology of postsocialism, are grounded in Hungary. Burawoy challenges the centrality of Hungary in discussion by introducing Russia. But why Russia? Its size, military power, and position as the home of the October Revolution certainly elevate its significance, but it is also a place that encourages deep pessimism about capitalist futures. As Burawoy and Krotov (1992) argued after the Soviet Union’s collapse, this was mercantile capitalism at best. Perhaps Burawoy is drawn to a more “critical approach to capitalism in order to rescue the positive potential of socialism” when capitalism is so badly done (p. 30). At the same time, however, Russia hardly produces much optimism about socialist possibilities either. While its communist party may call for a return to the rights of state socialism, they have little sense of how this could be achieved in the new economic and political environment (Cook,Orenstein, This content downloaded from 200.130.19.155 on Fri,</context>

That power bloc uses three rituals—purification, sacrifice, and confession—initially to purge postcommunists from power and later society from socialist pollution to build the rational economy. Culture is, however, also marginal to the argument. Following Bourdieu, Eyal et al. (1998) treat culture as a form of capital and use the dominance of different types of capital to distinguish social structures. But this Bourdieuian notion of capital fails to recognize its mediating function in the constitution of actors or in the coordination of action (Calhoun 1995, p. 155). Consider, for instance, how the complicated biographies one might find in life histories are understood through categories of actors. Eyal et al. (1998) distinguish dissidents, whose degrees of opposition go unmarked, from socialist technocrats and managers, all with different allocations of cultural capital. Their kinship ties, friendship networks, early career trajectories, and personal memories during communist rule and its end go unmarked before their classification, whose class base in turn shapes the action that gets theorized.

One might recall the words of Janos Kenedi (1982) in this: “Do it yourself.” Indeed, the whole argument, apart from Bourdieu’s invocation, resonates with the work emerging from Hungary more than elsewhere. The data, while initially from Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Russia, are mainly from Hungary in the latter years of the decade. When narratives, even with comparison, are elaborated, Hungary tends to provide the illustration (e.g. pp. 183–84). There is even a certain style to the argument. It reminds me of the argument that Akos Rona-Tas (1997) made about the second great transformation, which was made in small incremental steps. I also recall Jozsef Borocz’s (1995) description of the dynamics of postcommunist capitalism with “fusion,” the “creative reinterpretation of old and new elements, creating substantively distinguishable qualities of social experience,” in which he uses the musical repertoire of Bela Bartok to produce the image.

When we seek to exhume socialism, we cannot forget that it was communist state violence that destroyed alternatives—some of them socialist—many times, most notably in Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and in Poland in 1981. This history matters, especially in Poland. It forms part of a tradition that is recalled to shape the politics of protest, the politics of parties, and the politics of the labor movement itself (Kennedy and Stukuls 1998; Ekiert and Kubik 1999). And these different histories affect the plausibility of theories that overlook the articulation of the nation in their argument. Konrad and Szelenyi’s (1979) anticipation of intellectuals on the road to class power was grounded in Hungarian social conditions and history, even though its reference was to state socialism (Kennedy 1992).

These are collective actors whose collective action can be found in the cumulation of individual strategies. True to Weberian sociology, the analyst is the one best situated to recognize classes in the identification of common patterns. You apparently cannot rely on their organization or coordinated effort to show their class formation, although others have offered an alternative account doing just that (e.g., Gianoplus 1999). Culture is quite important to Eyal et al.’s (1998) argument. The civilizing project of the East Central European intelligentsia serves as the spirit that travels through history to provide different versions of the intellectuals’ mission. Bourdieu’s invocation tempers the Hegelian impulse, as the authors (p. 17) emphasize the “dialectical interaction between agents (their dispositions, habits, biographies, collective memories) and their positions (in institutions, class relations, and networks).” The cultural bourgeoisie is also building the postcommunist capitalist order.

It theorized an intelligentsia on the route to class power. Its ancestry owed more to Hungarian populism than to Marxism (Kennedy 1994), but Szelenyi fit with the then-blooming interest in the critical sociology of intellectuals and knowledge (Gouldner 1979). Szelenyi could thus be recognized as a part of Marxist inquiries (Burawoy and Skocpol 1982), even while both he and Gouldner were better characterized as “ridge riders” between Marxism and sociology.

Some have argued that it is genesis itself (Jowitt 1992), although that is a bit more hyperbole than I can manage. But I do find the invitation to think with my colleagues from Eastern Europe about social and intellectual change both compelling and liberating. Calhoun’s (1995) emphasis on theory’s place in dialogue among cultures is therefore central to the mission of critical sociology, and critical for theory’s relevance to practice. In this sense, our authors may represent the critical tradition of sociology more accurately than does Burawoy. Socialism is no longer a vision of the future, nor much of a guide to action in Eastern Europe. Transiti</context>

The data, while initially from Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Russia, are mainly from Hungary in the latter years of the decade. When narratives, even with comparison, are elaborated, Hungary tends to provide the illustration (e.g. pp. 183–84). There is even a certain style to the argument.

But perhaps we should not be looking at socialism in terms of feasibility. Perhaps we should look at it in terms of resistance and look to the country best known for mobilizing opposition. Poland is the nation in the world once ruled by communists with the greatest tradition of labor movements. Solidarity, its independent selfgoverning trade union of 1980–81, was an emancipatory movement embodying all sorts of alternatives that were themselves “rapidly closed off” when martial law was imposed (Kennedy 1991). When we seek to exhume socialism, we cannot forget that it was communist state violence that destroyed alternatives—some of them socialist—many times, most notably in Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and in Poland in 1981. This history matters, especially in Poland. It forms part of a tradition that is recalled to shape the politics of protest, the politics of parties, and the politics of the labor movement itself (Kennedy and Stukuls 1998; Ekiert and Kubik 1999).

Ivan Szelenyi is one of the leading figures of Hungarian social science. Laszlo Bruszt is not only the former acting rector of Central European University in Budapest, but was himself a participant in the Hungarian Round Table negotiations of 1989. If one considers a broader sociology of postcommunist change, one is struck by the degree to which Hungarian research, Hungarian data, and Hungarian intellectuals in diaspora or at home, shape the debate in the United States. Janos Kornai’s (1992) political economy provides the point of departure for many assessments of socialism. Jozsef Borocz,Martha Lampland, Akos Rona-Tas, and Szonya Szelenyi, all leading figures in the American sociology of postsocialism, are grounded in Hungary. Burawoy challenges the centrality of Hungary in discussion by introducing Russia. But why Russia? Its size, military power, and position as the home of the October Revolution certainly elevate its significance, but it is also a place that encourages deep pessimism about capitalist futures. As Burawoy and Krotov (1992) argued after the Soviet Union’s c</context>

China’s economic growth has been relatively spectacular, and Burawoy (1996) suggests that Russia should be viewed through its lens. China’s record on democracy and human rights hardly inspires the emancipatory hope that socialism did at one time for very many people, however. Our Hungarian authors and their colleagues have been at the heart of social change itself, and social change in these times is based on variations in capitalism’s configuration, democracy’s institutionalization, and civil society’s mobilization. Bauman (1992) argued that critical intellectuals have for the most part become the “interpreters” for dispossessed groups, but over the last decade in the postcommunist world, they have played an invaluable role in legislating alternatives for better or worse. Eyal et al. (1998) and Stark and Bruszt (1998) were looking in the right place to develop critical sociology. Eyal et al. even define their sociology of social change by it. THE CULTURE AND PRACTICE OF POSTCOMMUNIST ELITES Eyal et al. (1998) proclaim a new sociology based on a theory of the fourth new class project of the East Central European intell</context>

I also recall Jozsef Borocz’s (1995) description of the dynamics of postcommunist capitalism with “fusion,” the “creative reinterpretation of old and new elements, creating substantively distinguishable qualities of social experience,” in which he uses the musical repertoire of Bela Bartok to produce the image. Citing the Hungarian pianist Zoltan Kocsis, “Bartok’s oeuvre is a perfect synthesis between central east European folklore and composed music in the hands of a superbly creative individual.” It even reminds me of Burawoy and Lukacs’s (1992) argument about painting socialism, rather than building an organization like Solidarity. While certainly Polish culture also had a sense of załatwiac, or to arrange for things, Polish sociology under communist rule, and even today, still struggles with a sense of social structure connected to that past in which Solidarity made “us and them.” Hungarians hardly have that sense in their scholarship, or in their politics (Kennedy 1992). Indeed, Stark and Bruszt (1998) argue that this lack of a mobilized civil society enabled the Hungarians to leap ahead of Poland in negotiating a more democratic</context>

Instead, these cultural formations are themselves emergent and filled with contradictions and possibilities that imaginative elites, and entrepreneurial activists, exploit. Agency, Sewell (1992) reminds us, derives not only from the confrontation of habitus and structure, or innovation through networks, but through the contradictions of structures themselves. And that, it seems to me, is the big challenge facing critical sociology. Burawoy, in his plea for postsocialist theory, focuses on the search for alternatives.

Verdery (1996) has argued elsewhere that one of the greatest challenges for understanding socialism and its sequel is the ethnography of the state. While some critical sociologists might be content to transport sensibilities of social justice directly to the postcommunist world, ethnographers have cautioned us that politics, from elections to gender, should not be read through a Western lens (Stukuls 1997, 1998; Gal and Kligman 2000).

But if Marxism’s core rests in the struggle for socialism itself, as Burawoy seems to imply, Marxism’s most critical challenge does not lie in exhuming socialism. If Eastern Europe matters to socialism’s viability, Marxism’s most critical challenge lies in addressing socialism’s cultural effect. For those who have not lived in a society ruled by communists, socialism can function as “an ontologically absent but epistemologically structuring desire” rather than a lived experience with great emotional effect and very different national meanings (Kennedy and Galtz 1996). Even after this generation passes, the connotations of communist rule will not disappear from memory. That memory will affect the ways in which socialism, even if based on resistance to capitalism, can be articulated. If socialism is an unnamed form of resistance to capitalism using the organizational forms left by communist rule, then, perhaps, ethnography unbound can suffice. If, however, socialism is a counterculture that requires a postsocialist theory elaborated by East Europeans, the meaning of communist rule cannot be overlooked.

The civilizing project of the East Central European intelligentsia serves as the spirit that travels through history to provide different versions of the intellectuals’ mission. Bourdieu’s invocation tempers the Hegelian impulse, as the authors (p. 17) emphasize the “dialectical interaction between agents (their dispositions, habits, biographies, collective memories) and their positions (in institutions, class relations, and networks).” The cultural bourgeoisie is also building the postcommunist capitalist order. The “spirit of postcommunism” (see also Kennedy and Gianoplus 1994) drew on the idea of civil society and monetarism to become the power bloc’s ideology. That power bloc uses three rituals—purification, sacrifice, and confession—initially to purge postcommunists from power and later society from socialist pollution to build the rational economy. Culture is, however, also marginal to the argument. Following Bourdieu, Eyal et al. (1998) treat culture as a form of capital and use the dominance of different types of capital to distinguish social structures.

Its ancestry owed more to Hungarian populism than to Marxism (Kennedy 1994), but Szelenyi fit with the then-blooming interest in the critical sociology of intellectuals and knowledge (Gouldner 1979). Szelenyi could thus be recognized as a part of Marxist inquiries (Burawoy and Skocpol 1982), even while both he and Gouldner were better characterized as “ridge riders” between Marxism and sociology. Stark’s (1982) dissertation focused on new class configurations in capitalist and state socialist societies, but his later work on labor markets (1986) already anticipated his subsequent manifest institutionalism.

His invitation to postsocialist theory is no exception, but his opposition between Marxist and neoclassical sociology may get in the way of recognizing a critical, historical, and cultural sociology beyond Marx. In this discussion, I like Burawoy’s description of the differencebetween neoclassical and classical sociology. Neoclassical sociologists Eyal, Szelenyi, and Townsley (1998) and Stark and Bruszt (1998) are more interested in exploring capitalism’s possibilities through its plurality than in elaborating the classical concern for capitalism’s systemic distinction. The neoclassical sociologists’ interest in capitalist variety also attends insufficiently to the global articulation of national capitalisms. Burawoy especially uses the common concern of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim for the individual’s estrangement from capitalism to cast postsocialist theory’s critical difference with neoclassical sociology.

Bauman (1992) argued that critical intellectuals have for the most part become the “interpreters” for dispossessed groups, but over the last decade in the postcommunist world, they have played an invaluable role in legislating alternatives for better or worse. Eyal et al. (1998) and Stark and Bruszt (1998) were looking in the right place to develop critical sociology. Eyal et al. even define their sociology of social change by it.

Indeed, Stark and Bruszt (1998) argue that this lack of a mobilized civil society enabled the Hungarians to leap ahead of Poland in negotiating a more democratic transition at the Round Table.

It forms part of a tradition that is recalled to shape the politics of protest, the politics of parties, and the politics of the labor movement itself (Kennedy and Stukuls 1998; Ekiert and Kubik 1999). And these different histories affect the plausibility of theories that overlook the articulation of the nation in their argument. Konrad and Szelenyi’s (1979) anticipation of intellectuals on the road to class power was grounded in Hungarian social conditions and history, even though its reference was to state socialism (Kennedy 1992). When Eyal et al. (1998) write that this class project has been realized, made manifest in the coalition government between the parties descended from the dissident cultural intelligentsia and communist party reformers, they elevate Hungarian experience in generalization. Poland has not (yet?) managed such a coalition at the national level, and only very occasionally at the local level. Indeed, the controversy attending the individual decision by the prominent Solidarity activist Barbara Labuda to work in the cabinet of the very popular president Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former communist, suggests that Polish cultu</context>

These are not collective actors in the sense of the term most theorists of class struggle or social movements know. These are collective actors whose collective action can be found in the cumulation of individual strategies. True to Weberian sociology, the analyst is the one best situated to recognize classes in the identification of common patterns. You apparently cannot rely on their organization or coordinated effort to show their class formation, although others have offered an alternative account doing just that (e.g., Gianoplus 1999). Culture is quite important to Eyal et al.’s (1998) argument. The civilizing project of the East Central European intelligentsia serves as the spirit that travels through history to provide different versions of the intellectuals’ mission. Bourdieu’s invocation tempers the Hegelian impulse, as the authors (p. 17) emphasize the “dialectical interaction between agents (their dispositions, habits, biographies, collective memories) and their positions (in institutions, class relations, and networks).” The cultural bourgeoisie is also building the postcommunist capitalist order. The “spirit of postcommunism” (see also Kennedy and Gianoplus 1994) dr</context>

Culture is, however, also marginal to the argument. Following Bourdieu, Eyal et al. (1998) treat culture as a form of capital and use the dominance of different types of capital to distinguish social structures. But this Bourdieuian notion of capital fails to recognize its mediating function in the constitution of actors or in the coordination of action (Calhoun 1995, p. 155). Consider, for instance, how the complicated biographies one might find in life histories are understood through categories of actors. Eyal et al. (1998) distinguish dissidents, whose degrees of opposition go unmarked, from socialist technocrats and managers, all with different allocations of cultural capital. Their kinship ties, friendship networks, early career trajectories, and personal memories during communist rule and its end go unmarked before their classification, whose class base in turn shapes the action that gets theorized. We learn about ideologies that reflect those class positions and about rituals that help make capitalism without capitalists, but the individual strategies themselves disappear beneath class.

Communist rule severely restricted this kind of scholarship (Verdery 1996).
