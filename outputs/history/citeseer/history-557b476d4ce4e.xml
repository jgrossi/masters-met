			<abstract>
				<p>In his recent work, Robin Hahnel defends a monolithic metric of economic desert: to each according to effort or sacrifice. I criticize from an egalitarian standpoint this meritocratic distributive principle on theoretical, practical, and normative grounds. I also question his argument that in market socialism the allocation of labor cannot accommodate an egalitarian distribution of labor income; his not unfamiliar argument rests on a fatal theoretical error that conflates the allocative and distributive functions of market prices. I treat Hahnel's work in the context of larger issues about competing concepts of justice and the distributive institutions that might suit them.</p>

There are factors within the “constraints” of the real world of market economies that play routinely a role in determining wages and salaries; in addition to oligopolies and other imperfections, there are taxation and regulative law, collective bargaining, historical precedent, cultural factors, various government policies, and so on. We know, e.g., that there is strong rigidity in the ordinal wage ranking of most occupations. Even in recessionary times, wages do not fall as predicted by the conventional equilibrium price-auction model of neoclassical economics (see Bewley 2000).4 The foregoing supports the conclusion that market entitlements do not fit pre-institutional desert based on individual contribution. This is, of course, not a peculiarly “leftist” or egalitarian view. Milton Friedman understands that markets, especially in their “perfectively competitive” form, are no respecters of economic desert, whether its basis is contribution or effort. “Most differences in status or position or wealth can be regarded as the product of chance at a far enough remove . . . .” According to Friedman, chance determines our genetic makeup and, to some extent, our mental and</context>

Rawls does not rule out altogether effort as a desert basis, and he certainly rules in personal responsibility for choosing preferences and goals.

As opposed “to differences [due to] circumstance, talent, training, luck . . . people control only their effort” (Hahnel 2005a: 137). John Rawls famously objects. We do not deserve our place in the distribution of natural endowments, any more than we deserve our initial starting place in society. That we deserve the superior character that enables us to make the effort to cultivate our capacities is also problematic; for such character depends in good part upon fortunate family and social circumstances in early life for which we can claim no credit. The notion of desert does not apply here (1999, 89). [It] seems clear that the effort a person is willing to make is influenced by his natural abilities and skills and the alternatives open to him. The better endowed are more likely, other things equal, to strive conscientiously, and there seems to be no way to discount for their greater good fortune. The idea of rewarding desert is impracticable. (1999: 274) Robert Nozick (1974: 213-16) initiated a serious misreading of these passages, playing on the expression “can claim no credit” for family and social circumstances and moving illicitly to the conclusion that a person’s effortful capacity i</context>

If we intervene in the labor market and legislate wage rates we consider to be fair, but allow markets to determine how resources are allocated, not only will different kinds of labor be allocated inefficiently, the entire price structure will fail to reflect the opportunity costs of producing different goods and services leading to further inefficiencies. There is no getting around the dilemma: in a market economy we must either allow the market system to reward people unfairly, or, if we try to correct for inequalities we must tolerate even greater inefficiencies.

It appears to be utilitarian. “Its only justification is that it is effective in getting things done” (1935: 74).

Against contribution-based theories of desert, Hahnel commits to a pre-institutional theory whose sole basis is differential sacrifice; he then argues that market entitlements fail to square with desert, so understood. I think he is largely right about market entitlements, but he assumes rashly that a sacrificial basis satisfies the requirement of what he includes as an essential ingredient of distributional justice, namely that individuals fully control, and thus are responsible for, what it is that warrants their differential desert, namely their effort. As opposed “to differences [d</context>

Effort and contribution mesh in ways that effort theorists, such as Hahnel, cannot reasonably isolate from one another. Even among those who exercise effort equally (assuming its discrete measurement), Hahnel discounts the efforts of those who fall short of their “economic duty” or “social endeavor,” by which he must mean contributing to social welfare as measured by the demand of others for which the contributors are not fully responsible. So not all equally effortful work is to be equally rewarded. As Lamont (1995: 215) argues, theorists who play up effort as the sole desert basis “are also committed, despite appearances, to increasing the social product . . . which undermines any sharp distinction between effort- and productivity-based distributive proposals.” The bottom line is that it is difficult to separate systematically desert from morally arbitrary factors. That is why Rawls and those of us who suspect appeals to effort as a desert basis are wary about according it a (or the, as in Hahnel’s case) decisive place in a theory of justice. This is not to deny that we can be roughly successful in par</context>

The laborer’s work may be dirty and dangerous, but the professional’s involves more responsibility and mental pressure. And we can go on and on: from accountants through zoologists; imagine the difficulty judging relative effort levels required by different types of inter and intra occupations, or branches of the economy. Further, not only occupations need be ranked, but also, and especially, the individuals who fit these jobs, and this gets us into the hoary issue of the interpersonal comparisons of disutility. Lamont (1995: 222-23), reflecting on failures of utilitarian theory, wonders whether “it may be impossible to reduce everything down to effort units and to use these in any meaningful way.” Carens drives home the point: “Some people are lucky enough to find their work a great pleasure and source of self-realization. They are likely [to] work long, intense hours. Should this lead us to reconsider whether they deserve compensation for the ‘burdens’ of their work, especially as compared with those who work shorter hours at boring, alienating tasks?” Consider, too, that for some people the danger of a job may</context>

And worse, might not epistemic paucity incite ethical corruption in the form of individuals deceiving each other about the relative disutility undergone in work? Lamont (1995: 225) calls this the “moral hazard problem of effort theory,” according to which “people are presented with an opportunity to exploit the system by modifying their behavior in such a way as to maximize their income (by maximizing their scores on the employed criteria) while minimizing their effort within the constraints set by the system.” Might the institution of the market more so than administrative agencies help in determining accurately and less intrusively the relative efforts of workers across an entire economy?

Social ownership can take the form of worker-owned cooperatives, state-owned enterprises controlled by workers, or privatelyowned enterprises so widely held by individuals as to count as social ownership, as in the case of John Roemer’s “voucher socialism” or John Rawls’s “private property-owning democracy.”10 The idea is that in market socialism, whatever its form, labor markets operate against the background of an egalitarian distribution of wealth, equality of practical opportunity, and full employment. Lamont (1997) argues that when these conditions are in place, markets tend to automatically reward workers according to effort, which is to say, as I would put it, that the procedure of the market yields a substantive calculation of the distribution of relative effort among individuals. Suppose all jobs were paid the same base wage rate. Then consider what would prompt a person to choose a job different than the one she has at that rate. Lamont (1997: 35) argues that her choice depends on the weight she accords the base wage rate when compared to the non-monetary costs attached to jobs with the result that</context>

Departures from equal distribution require justification and have a place in less than ideal circumstances, so that sacrificial effort as a desert basis has a role to play in market socialism on the level of precepts, as discussed above. The precepts might even be raised to a political level if epistemic problems can find a practical solution. Roemer (1993) tries this by having the state supplement and implement the effort precept. He constructs a model that seeks to separate morally arbitrary factors, in particular talent, from the measurement of effort which remains as the only variable determining distributive outcomes. Put very simply, using educational attainment as a proxy for talent, Roemer divides the workforce into highly- and less-educated groups and, prompted by an egalitarian impulse, proposes that the average wage of both groups should be the same.

The problem with the model, unless it builds in tautology, is its failure to account for the “exogenous” determination of wages in actual market systems. Thurow traces the model’s deficiency to the micro-foundations of neoclassical economics. Hahnel displays an ambivalent stance towards the marginal productivity theory of distribution. As we have seen (above), he is wary about its ability to separate individual from collective contribution. Still, he relies on it to score ethical points against market entitlements. “When young people flock to join the profession I have labored in for t</context>

Remember that Hahnel’s desert basis is effort defined as personal cost or disutility. Think about the epistemic hurdles that get in the way of publicly auditing the distribution of relative effort among occupations and, ultimately, individuals. “A feasible theory should not require access to information we cannot acquire,” which is not to deny the fairness of effort theory but rather to say it is not viable, which counts importantly against it (Wolff: 224, 227).8 Further, if individuals lack assurance that others are doing their part because they lack access to information they cannot acquir</context>

Hahnel, an “avowed market abolitionist” (2008: 16) and advocate of participatory administration, assigns to compensation boards at local workplaces the task of determining pay schedules that reflect differential effort among individual workers. He leaves it to “the abilities of workmates to reasonably judge one another’s sacrifices and motivate one another to work diligently and intelligently” (2005b: 138). But, as Jonathan Wolff says, this “knowledge will be too dispersed, and its sources too unreliable, to serve the purpose required by the [effort] theory” (Wolff 2003: 225). Too disbursed because the theory requires a determination of the relative efforts of individuals across an entire economy, and, he goes on, this unreliability generates “too great a possibility of corruption,” that can accompany the application of criteria not adequately publicly accessible.

(DiQuattro 1983: 63). I no longer subscribe to what I said then. Carens (1986: 40-1) scored effective criticism of my “false assumption about how a market system would work if Rawls’s background conditions were satisfied.” Although effort counts, market prices would still reflect the relative scarcity of factors such as natural abilities and talents for which individuals are not responsible.13 Or as Wolff (2003: 230) puts it: “The labour market rewards not just extra effort but scarce talents and luck.” And to top it off, as I pointed out earlier, (1) individuals are not fully responsible for their effortful capacities, and (2) effort and contribution mesh in ways that market demand, which eludes individual responsibility, impinges on the reward of effort. So where does this leave us with respect to effort and desert? Rawls is right about the nonfeasibility of implementing the principle of to each according to effort.
