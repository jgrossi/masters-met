			<abstract>
				<p>This cross-cultural study investigated and compared the infl uence of hardiness in burnout among Por-tuguese and Brazilian nurses, as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Service Survey (MBI-HSS) and the Personal Views Survey (PVS). The sample consisted of 630 nurses working in hospitals (394 Portuguese, 236 Brazilians). The statistical analysis using multiple linear regression showed that hardiness is a personality trait that explains burnout, presenting different predictive models for each sample. Results suggested that overall work characteristics and work settings of Portuguese and Brazilian nurses explained the differences found between the samples. Findings suggested that future applied interventions aiming to reduce burnout among Portuguese and Brazilian nurses, should contemplate different hardiness dimensions. Hardiness e Sindrome de Burnout: Um Estudo Transcultural entre Enfermeiros Portugueses e Brasileiros Resumo Estudo transcultural que buscou explorar a infl uência do hardiness nas dimensões da Síndrome de Burnout em enfermeiros portugueses e brasileiros, avaliados através do Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services (MBI-HSS) e do Personal Views Survey (PVS). A amostra foi constituída por 630 enfermeiros (394 Portugueses, 236 Brasileiros) que exerciam as suas funções no contexto hospitalar. Os resultados, obtidos por meio de análise de Regressão Linear Múltipla, indicam que hardiness, enquanto traço de personalidade, explica de forma signifi cativa a Síndrome de Burnout nos enfermeiros, revelando dife-renças nos modelos preditivos de acordo com a nacionalidade. As evidências encontradas sugerem a im-portância das características do trabalho e do contexto laboral na explicação das diferenças encontradas em ambas as amostras. Os resultados sugerem que intervenções para reduzir o burnout dos enfermeiros portugueses e brasileiros devem contemplar as diferentes dimensões do hardiness.

The model of Burnout proposed by Maslach, Schaufeli, and Leiter (2001) emphasizes the importance of work characteristics and context as predictors of burnout. However, it is lkely that personality traits also play an important role in the development of burnout. Although some evidence has emerged supporting this view, little is known about this particular relationship (Azeem, 2010; Ghorpade, Lackritz, &amp; Singh, 2007). In a meta-analysis conducted by Alarcon, Eschleman and Bowling (2009) examining the relationship between personality and burnout, it was found that self-esteem, self-effi cacy, locus of control, emotional stability, extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, positive affectivity, negative affectivity, optimism, proactive personality, and hardiness were associated with the three dimensions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory.

Results partially support our hypothesis that the predictive model of hardiness in burnout among nurses in these two countries is mainly different, except for personal accomplishment. Additionally, although the values were relatively low, our fi ndings showed that all the dimensions of hardiness were related with burnout for both the Portuguese and Brazilian nurses. Hence, in agreement with previous research (e.g., Azeem, 2010; Ebling &amp; Carlotto, 2012; Garrosa et al., 2010), our results suggest that hardiness, as personality trait, is likely to explain only part of the experience of burnout for Portuguese and Brazilian nurses. Results suggest that there are differences between nurses in Brazil and Portugal in what concerns to variables explaining Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization. Particularly, for Portuguese nurses, it seems that Commitment was the personality trait that best explained variability in burnout. On the other hand, for Brazilian nurses, Control seemed to be the most important variable explain</context>

Hence, it is believed that these factors may also contribute to the explanation of similarities and differences found in the predictive models of burnout among Portuguese and Brazilian nurses in the current study. In agreement with this idea, Vanheule et al. (2007) suggested that burnout differences across samples can be influenced by differences in job content, work circumstances, and professional goals in the respective sectors. Our results, support the idea that personality traits are important predictors of burnout (Azeem, 2010; Ghorpade et al., 2011; Schaufeli &amp; Enzmann, 1998; Sheard &amp; Golby, 2007). Additionally, the percentage of explanation of the variation found in burnout in our study (between 12% and 27%) was superior to that found previously in a study by Ghorpade et al. (2011) in the occupational setting. Particularly, the authors found that personality provides an additional 6.9% of explanation of the variation of emotional exhaustion; an additional 11.7% explanation of the variation in depersonalization; and an additional 13.8% of the variation in personal accomplishments.

In sum, some individual characteristics such as hardiness, may work as protectors against occupational stress and burnout among Portuguese and Brazilian nurses. A major strength of this study was the use of a strong theoretical basis, as well as reliable and accurate instruments for data collection purposes. Additionally, the effect size found, fi t the values recommended by Cohen (1988). The encouraging results of this study should be considered in light of several limitations. Firstly, as a cross-sectional study, it precludes evaluation of temporality and causality of the observed relationships. Further research is required using longitudinal or experimental designs. Secondly, although sample size of the samples support the statistical analyses, results cannot be Carlotto, M.

Nurses were also required to show empathy and kindness for the patient health status and support patient empowerment (Amendoeira, 2006). When analyzing the Portuguese nurses in our study, the best predictors of Emotional Exhaustion for these participants were Commitment and Challenge. It is believed that these fi ndings may be explained by the professional emphasis of nurses’ job in Portugal, since it is more based on nurse-patient assistance and care (Antunes, 2007). Additionally, these fi ndings also support previous theory in the area of assistance care jobs (Edelwich &amp; Brodsky, 1980), suggesting that people who work in health care professions are strongly motivated by the will to help others. Furthermore, when analysing the Brazilian and Portuguese nurse’s demographic characteristics, it is clear that Portuguese nurses spend more time working in the same institution, compared with Brazilian nurses. Thus, they suffer less changes in their work environment. This fact is extremely important in assistant care jobs, since professionals have an opportunity to develop their experience of learning and personal growth in that institution (Leipold, Schacke, &amp; Zank, 2008).

Particularly, hardiness showed the stronger relationship with all the three dimensions of burnout compared with the other personality factors under study. As recommended by the authors, these fi ndings highlight the need to further examine the relationship between hardiness and burnout. Hardiness has been defi ned as a personality construct that refl ects the extent to which a person is able to face stressors without experiencing ill effects, such as psychological or physical strains (Kobasa, 1979). Kobasa suggested that the concept is a resilience resource that can be applied in stressful situations and which is assumed to protect the person from stress. Hence, the construct has emerged as an important buffer in the relationship between stressors and illness (Maddi, 1999). Hardiness comprises a high sense of life and work commitment, perceptions of control, and high openness to change and challenge, as well as a more positive appraisal of stress.

Palabras clave: Síndrome de Burnout, personalidad hardiness enfermeras, estudio transcultural. The Syndrome of Burnout (SB) has received increased attention over the last years across nations. This fact is associated with a global change in socio economic factors, particularly moving from an economy based on industry to an economy based on services. Consequently, this change caused increased demands for professionals, experiencing more and more psychological pressure over time (Schaufeli, Leiter, &amp; Maslach, 2009). Maslach and Jackson (1981) defi ned burnout symptoms as: (a) emotional exhaustion, in which professionals feel that they are no longer able to cope at a psychological level; (b) depersonalization (or cynicism), characterized as negative and cynical attitudes and feelings towards clients. The last dimension represents the interpersonal context dimension of burnout (c) reduced effi - cacy or personal accomplishment, understood as the professionals’ tendency to evaluate oneself negatively, particularly their work with clients. It is related with feelings of incompetence and a lack of achieveme</context>

Hence, it is believed that these factors may also contribute to the explanation of similarities and differences found in the predictive models of burnout among Portuguese and Brazilian nurses in the current study. In agreement with this idea, Vanheule et al. (2007) suggested that burnout differences across samples can be influenced by differences in job content, work circumstances, and professional goals in the respective sectors. Our results, support the idea that personality traits are important predictors of burnout (Azeem, 2010; Ghorpade et al., 2011; Schaufeli &amp; Enzmann, 1998; Sheard &amp; Golby, 2007). Additionally, the percentage of explanation of the variation found in burnout in our study (between 12% and 27%) was superior to that found previously in a study by Ghorpade et al. (2011) in the occupational setting. Particularly, the authors found that personality provides an additional 6.9% of explanation of the variation of emotional exhaustion; an additional 11.7% explanation of the variation in depersonalization; and an additional 13.8% of the variation in personal accomplishments. As suggested by Azeem (2010), the minimum variance of 10% was considered signifi cant and meaningful. Thes</context>

In agreement with this idea, Smith, Fisher, and Sale (2001) suggested that recently the need for cross-cultural studies in Occupational Psychology (OP) research has become more and more evident. Despite this necessity, Carlotto, M. S., Queirós, C., Dias, S., Kaiseler, M.124 cross-cultural studies in OP are not very common, mostly due to methodological diffi culties of cross-cultural research (Smith et al., 2001). Thus, the current study aimed to compare whether there was a different predictive model of hardiness in burnout for Portuguese and Brazilian nurses. Since this study is exploratory in nature, therefore no detailed hypothesis can be presented. However, contemplating nursing job characteristics variations across both countries, it is hypothesized that different dimensions of hardiness would predict burnout for Brazilian and Portuguese nurses. Findings from this original research study, will develop the theoretical knowledge in the area of cross-cultural research in OP, and will highly contribu</context>

Added to this fact, individual characteristics have shown to also infl uence nurses’ experience of stress in the work context (Saksvik-Lehouilliera et al., 2012). Additionally, culture appears to be an important concept infl uencing burnout levels among nurses (Turnipseed &amp; Turnipseed, 1997). However, little is known about the infl uence of personality factors predicting burnout Hardiness and Burnout Syndrome: A Cross-Cultural Study among Portuguese and Brazilian Nurses 123 among nurses across different cultures, especially between Portugal and Brazil. Since as suggested by Triandis and Suh (2002) there are both universal and culture-specifi c aspects of variation in personality. It would be interesting to further understand the differences in personality factors predicting burnout among nurses across cultures. Furthermore, as nursing is a profession that involves cultural care diversity (Leininger, 1978) it seems critical to further understand how personality factors across cultures predict nurses’ burnout in order to design cultural sensitive interventions. The model of Burnout proposed by Maslach, Schaufeli, and Leiter (2001) emphasizes the importance of work characteristics and con</context>

This result can be explained by a historical and universal meaning, related with nursing job. In support of this idea, White (2002) suggested that nursing vocation is to be dedicated and committed to assisting another one who is disadvantaged, seeking public recognition of their work. The variance explained by this model was larger among Brazilian nurses (25.6%) compared with Portuguese nurses (13%). Functional, cultural, economic and contextual factors of organizations do also play an important role in infl uencing professional’s behavior (Hofstede, 1991; Raiger, 2005; Silva &amp; Gomes, 2009; Vanheule, Rosseel, &amp; Vlerick, 2007).
