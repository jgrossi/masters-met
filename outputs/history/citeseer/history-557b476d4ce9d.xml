			<abstract>
				<p>One of the most significant developments in the latter part of the 20th century and the first part of this new millennium has been the triumph of short-term over long-term thinking. We are increasingly a culture that looks neither to the past nor to the future, but only to the next ''quarter,'' or to the next Delphic pronouncement by Alan Greenspan. This cultural construction of time has given rise to social, political and personal problems of unprecedented magnitude. The short-term focus of contemporary American capitalism is causing us to behave, both individually and collectively, in an increasingly irrational and thus self-destructive manner. Ours is now the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world. Capitalism is sometimes blamed for this, yet there are other capitalist societies that do not suffer the same evils we suffer. I argue that we can learn from these societies how to correct some of the ills of our own system and in this way construct a new paradigm of the market, a paradigm for the new millennium, a more mature, rational version of capitalism that would focus on the long rather than the short term.</p>

But two careers means less time for a personal life, less time for family and friends. Indeed, we have fewer friends and smaller families than we used to, and even they do not receive the attention they deserve. We have become impoverished, in both a material and a spiritual sense, in spite of ourselves. Companies struggling to survive in an increasingly hostile market environment bombard us with advertising and ‘‘the message that possessions and the wealth to buy them are the road to happiness’’ (Coleman, 1989, p. 210). The lack of meaningful relationships and opportunities for moral, or spiritual, self-actualization creates a void in our lives that we rush to fill with the immediate gratification of material pleasures. We work furiously to support a life we have been led to believe we will find fulfilling, but which we do not have time for, and then find we could not afford it even it if we did.

Not surprisingly, the struggles for economic survival that characterize American capitalism are seen by many Americans ‘‘as a fair battle in which the most capable and the hardest working individuals emerge victorious. This belief in turn becomes an important legitimation for social inequality, as it implies that the poor deserve their inferior position because they are lazy or incompetent’’ (Coleman, 1989, p. 205).45 Recent events, however, are beginning to change American attitudes toward the economically disadvantaged as well as toward the market in general. There are many newly poor, and there will be many more as the result of the Enron and WorldCom disasters as well as other similar disasters such as that at Procter and Gamble in 2000.46 Popular contempt in these instances is reserved not for those who saw their retirement account evaporate in a matter of days, but for those ‘‘captains of industry’’ who willfully brought about these debacles but will themselves very likely emerge relative</context>

We have seen something of the havoc it can wreak when it is not accompanied by other values such as respect for the inherent dignity and quality of life of all human beings. 114 M.G. Piety Conclusion Part of American exceptionalism as observed, for example, by Goethe is that Americans are not weighed down by ‘‘useless memories’’ (1825, p. 739)54 as are so many Europeans. Indeed, the United States has been referred to as ‘‘the country of the perpetual present tense’’ (Sante, 1996, p. 67). To prefer present goods, however, to long-term goods is irrational. Such preferences, as Hobbes observed, can give rise to many ‘‘unforeseen evils’’ (Hobbes, 1642, p. 48) This is something, one could argue, that people in older parts of the world, where memories are longer, have a better grasp of than do Americans. The weight of memory can drag one down and it is undoubtedly part of American exceptionalism in the positive sense that Americans tend not to be dragged down by the ‘‘blight of useless memories and senseless fights’’ (Goethe, 1825, p. 739).55 Some memories are useful thoug</context>

Sennett, using IBM as his point of departure, provides an excellent account of what happened to many large corporations during this period. I will thus rely heavily upon Sennett’s account in the first part of this paper. IBM had practiced a kind of ‘‘paternalistic capitalism’’ up until the 1980s. That is, it provided a host of lavish benefits including excellent health care, child care, education and pensions, and ‘‘provided a lifetime ladder of employment [with] all the stages of a career laid out for people who were expected to stay and to climb’’ (Sennett, 1998, p. 123). Unfortunately, IBM miscalculated the growth of the personal computer industry and as a result suffered massive financial losses in the early ‘90s. An elaborate internal bureaucracy had proved immobilizing as the company was outmaneuvered by Bill Gate’s Microsoft. IBM also faced stiff competition from Japanese and American upstarts. In 1993, it began… to fashion itself into a competitive corporate machine, and made an equally dramatic turn around. It sought to replace the rigid hierarchical structure of work with more flexible forms of organization, and with flexible production aimed</context>

Downsizing The volatility of contemporary markets has made flexibility crucial to the survival of corporations. Flexibility, argues Sennett, means, among other things, a willingness to ‘‘reinvent’’ institutions. This turns out to be what is more commonly known as ‘‘reengineering,’’ or more specifically, ‘‘downsizing.’’ This practice, by now so well established that it requires no explanation, is carried out in the name of increasing efficiency. Evidence suggests, however, that ‘‘many, even most, reengineering efforts fail’’ (Sennett, 1998, p. 49). Studies conducted by the American Management Association and the Wyatt Companies reveal that ‘‘repeated downsizing produces ‘lower profits and declining worker productivity’’’(Sennett, 1998, p. 50). Downsizing reduces productivity, at least in part, because it hurts morale. Anthony Sampson, an English journalist who visited IBM’s home offices in the mid-1990s, found, according to Sennett, social disorganization rife within the company, rather than a reinvigorated work force. One official admitted, ‘‘There’s much more stress, domestic violence and need for mental services – directly l</context>

Few people are truly indispensable, however, and that accounts, at least in part, for the frequency with which people now change jobs, and even careers. [T]he traditional career progressing step by step through the corridors of one or two institutions is withering; so is the development of a single set of skills through the course of a working life. Today, a young American with at least 2 years of college can expect to change jobs at least 11 times during those 40 years of labor (Sennett, 1998, p. 22). Changing jobs often means relocating, uprooting oneself from one community and one set of coworkers to be transplanted to another community and another set of coworkers. It means that our connections to our neighbors and colleagues are becoming increasingly tenuous. We have little incentive to form lasting relationships with people with whom we may be in contact for only a short time and the increasing length of the work day means we have little time to devote to sustaining the few friendships, or commitments, we may succeed in establishing. Character, argues Sennett, ‘‘focuses on th</context>

It does not guarantee that one will not lose one’s job for expressing them. American employment law is based on the doctrine of ‘‘employment at will.’’ That means, with a few exceptions such as race, gender or age, employees can be fired for any reason an employer chooses. Add to this fact the uncertainties of the market already described, and a minimalistic social welfare system, and the ‘‘go along to get along’’ mentality takes hold like never before.21 Even consulting, celebrated by many as ‘‘the acme of flexible business behavior’’ (Sennett, 1998, p. 139) imposes pressure to conform. A consultant is doubly vulnerable because he is acting without the cushion of benefits traditionally provided by the employer. ‘‘A consultant has to tack one way and then another in response to the changing whims or thoughts of those who pay’’ (Sennett, 1998, p. 19). Contemporary American capitalism is thus not merely corroding character in the specifically moral sense. It is corroding it in the general sense as well in that it is imposing forces of conformity that are stifling ‘‘[t]he qualities that distinguish one person from another.’’22 White collar c</context>
