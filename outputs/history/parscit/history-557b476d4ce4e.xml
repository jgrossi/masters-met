market socialism, economic justice, income distribution theories, property-owning democracy
In his essay “Economic Justice” (2005b) and other recent work (2005a, 2006, 2008), Robin
Hahnel proposes and defends a monolithic metric of economic desert: to each according to
effort or sacrifice. In what follows, I criticize from an egalitarian standpoint this meritocratic
distributive principle on theoretical, normative, and practical grounds. I conclude my critique by
questioning his argument that in market socialism the allocation of labor cannot accommodate
an egalitarian distribution of labor income. Hahnel and Milton Friedman are one in identifying
socialist and capitalist markets with respect to the distributive function of prices and both are
wrong. My treatment of Hahnel’s work proceeds in the context of larger debates about concepts
of justice and the distributive institutions that might suit them.
Before confronting Hahnel’s case, let me establish a framework that treats the concept of
desert. Joel Feinberg, in his seminal work Doing and Deserving (1970) provides a largely noncontroversial analysis: to deserve something one must possess some characteristic or have done
something that constitutes the desert bases for which she is (to some extent) responsible, which
is to say “under her control.” Further, Feinberg and almost all desert theorists distinguish between
pre-institutional desert and institutional entitlement, with the former serving as a principle that
assesses the justice of the latter. To paraphrase Serena Olsaretti (2004: 16-17): institutional entitlement rewards individuals by the rules and purposes within which desert claims are registered;

pre-institutional desert rewards individuals according to intuitive or “natural” understandings1
not reducible to the rules and purposes of institutions. She uses as a pre-institutional example that
of hard-working people who deserve rewards for their efforts. But we know that some distributive institutions, e.g. the market, do not systematically reward people in proportion to their
effortful work. In such cases, they are entitled to their rewards even though they do not deserve
them. Entitlements, or “legitimate expectations,” as John Rawls dubs them (1999: 273-77), proceed from institutional conventions, leaving open the question of whether these expectations are
deserved, which is not to deny that sometimes pre-institutional desert and institutional entitlement overlap.2 Indeed, some theories of justice, e.g. Hahnel’s, seek to jibe desert with entitlements.
Whether this is practically feasible—Rawls thinks not—is a topic I address later on.
We find in the literature two preeminent contenders for desert bases in modern economies:
contribution and effort. Should individuals working in an economy along with others, engaged
in joint production, be rewarded differentially according to effort or contribution, or both?
Hahnel argues persuasively that contribution theories fall short of the ethical requirements of
pre-institutional desert and matching institutional entitlements. He addresses “conservative” and
“liberal” maxims. According to the first, payment to individuals proceeds “according to the value
of one’s personal contribution and the contribution of the productive property one owns”; on the
latter view, payment proceeds “according to the value of one’s personal contribution only.” The
conservative maxim runs up against the liberal complaint that payment accruing from inherited
wealth is not deserved. But what underlies that complaint, namely that individuals deserve only
what they are personally responsible for, can be turned against the liberal maxim itself. This is
because, says Hahnel (2006: 184-85), many “differences in people’s productivities are due to
intrinsic qualities of people themselves, which are beyond their control . . . . The bottom line is
that the ‘genetic lottery’ [e.g., involving talent] greatly influences how valuable a person’s contribution will be. Yet the genetic lottery is no more fair than the inheritance lottery.”3
So far we have Hahnel’s rejection of contribution as a pre-institutional basis of economic
desert. He also argues well that even if one honors pre-institutionally the contribution theory,
markets fail systematically to deliver entitlements in line with it. One thorny issue consists in
how, theoretically and practically, markets sort out the value of individual contributions from
the value of jointly produced products. The marginal theory of productivity is usually summoned here, but it lacks both explanatory and justificatory power. As Hahnel says (2005b: 136),
according to that theory, “the marginal [contribution] of an input depends as much on the
number of other units of that input available, and on the quality and quantity of other, complimentary inputs, as on any intrinsic quality of the additional input itself.” Hahnel might have also
mentioned the damage inflicted on marginal productivity theory during the 1960s Cambridge

“To reward and punish people for things they cannot control violates a basic tenet of social justice” (Hahnel 2005b: 137). Hahnel advocates what contemporary philosophers call “luck egalitarianism.” “The intuitive idea [luck egalitarians] all share is that persons should not be disadvantaged simply on account of bad
or good luck . . . . After all, if we accept the premise that individuals are equal moral agents, then it seems to
follow that individuals can only be held responsible for outcomes that are due to their own choices but not
due to circumstances over which they exercise no agential control” (Tan 2008: 665, 667).

controversies in the theory of capital in which Joan Robinson (1966) elaborated the theoretical
shortcomings of attempts to separate the marginal contributions labor and capital, complete
with ethically profound and negative consequences for the marginal productivity theory of distribution among owners of different factors of production (see DiQuattro 1978: 871-2). Daniel
Attas (2003: 100-01) sums up much of this in his critique of David Miller’s (1990) influential
defense of the market as an institution that can reward individuals according to contribution.
Given the distribution of talents, the level of technology, and the distribution of tastes,
there is normally more than one possible [market] equilibrium. The distribution of income
enters at both ends of the explanation of value: first, as a factor in the determination of
prices; second, as the outcome of market prices. This suggests that the distribution of
income and the price vector at equilibrium are mutually sustaining. A disequilibrating
shock to the system would not necessarily result in a fluctuating reversion to a unique
stable point. There is, therefore, no unique value that the producer deserves. So, the value
defined as (an) equilibrium price turns out to be completely morally arbitrary from a moral
point of view.
But wait, there is more. In addition to the weakness of neoclassical models of the marginal
productivity theory of distribution, there is the brute fact that, even if they withstand criticism,
their bearing on the real world of capitalist markets lacks credible application. When we step
outside of neoclassical textbooks, we find that labor incomes in capitalist market economies are
not set by “pure” market forces. There are factors within the “constraints” of the real world of
market economies that play routinely a role in determining wages and salaries; in addition to
oligopolies and other imperfections, there are taxation and regulative law, collective bargaining,
historical precedent, cultural factors, various government policies, and so on. We know, e.g., that
there is strong rigidity in the ordinal wage ranking of most occupations. Even in recessionary
times, wages do not fall as predicted by the conventional equilibrium price-auction model of
neoclassical economics (see Bewley 2000).4
The foregoing supports the conclusion that market entitlements do not fit pre-institutional
desert based on individual contribution. This is, of course, not a peculiarly “leftist” or egalitarian
view. Milton Friedman understands that markets, especially in their “perfectively competitive”
form, are no respecters of economic desert, whether its basis is contribution or effort. “Most
differences in status or position or wealth can be regarded as the product of chance at a far
enough remove . . . .” According to Friedman, chance determines our genetic makeup and, to
some extent, our mental and physical capacities as well as differential opportunities that derive

Lester Thurow embeds the marginal productivity theory of distribution within the neoclassical price-auction model in which “the labor market is treated as if it were like any other market in which price (wage)
is the short-term market-clearing mechanism” (Thurow 1983: 181). The problem with the model, unless it
builds in tautology, is its failure to account for the “exogenous” determination of wages in actual market
systems. Thurow traces the model’s deficiency to the micro-foundations of neoclassical economics. Hahnel
displays an ambivalent stance towards the marginal productivity theory of distribution. As we have seen
(above), he is wary about its ability to separate individual from collective contribution. Still, he relies on it
to score ethical points against market entitlements. “When young people flock to join the profession I have
labored in for twenty years, my marginal revenue product declines [and I thus ‘earn’ less salary]” (2005b:
137). If professor Hahnel is referring to university teaching, academic tenure obviously gets in the way of
the theory, but “the protection of tenure or its equivalent (seniority hiring and firing, offers to work for less
are rejected) seems to exist almost everywhere in the labor market” (Thurow 1983: 192).

from family and cultural environments into which we are born, not to mention the choices that
other people are always making in markets set against these morally-indifferent natural and
institutional backgrounds (Friedman 1962: 165-6). Friedman may have taken his cue on this
from his mentor at the University of Chicago’s school of economics, Frank Knight (1935: 64-5,
68), who went further by reflecting on the intimate connection between those twins of moral
arbitrariness: luck and power. Consider this gem.
Everyone is compelled to play the economic game and be judged by his success in playing
it. The luck element is so large—far larger than fairly successful players in the game will
admit—that capacity and effort may count for nothing. And this luck element works cumulatively, as in gambling games generally . . . . Differences in the capacity to play the game
are inordinately great from one person to another. But as the game is organized, the weak
contestants are thrown in with the strong in one grand melee; there is no classification of
the participants or distribution of handicaps such as always recognized to be necessary to
sportsmanship when unevenly matched contestants are to meet. In fact the situation is
worse still; there are handicaps, but as we have seen, they are distributed to the advantage
of the strong rather than the weak . . . . It is terms of power, then, if at all, that competitive
economies and the competitive view of life for which it must be largely accountable are to
be justified. Whether we are to regard them as justified at all depends on whether we are
willing to accept an ethics of power as the basis of our world view.5
As I interpret these passages, Friedman discounts pre-institutional desert, Knight credits it,
but both agree that market entitlements do not systematically match desert bases, whether
contribution or effort.
In contrast to “conservative” and “liberal” distributive maxims, based on contribution, Hahnel
endorses the “radical” maxim: “to each according to personal sacrifice, or effort” (2005a: 137).
Now this needs some unpacking since the conjunction “or” can be put to different uses. Consider: an unmarried man or a bachelor; a table or a chair. In the first case, “or” expresses an
identity and in the second a difference. Hahnel apparently identifies effort with sacrifice. “By
effort, I simply mean personal sacrifice or inconveniences incurred in performing one’s economic duties . . . . According [to this] maxim, no other consideration (other than differential
sacrifice) can justify one person [getting more income] than another” (2005a: 137, emphasis
added). This is problematical, though, because Hahnel uses “or” in an equivocal way. He says
that “effort takes many forms. It may be longer hours, less pleasant hours, [and so on]” (2005a:
137). But duration of labor is not necessarily a proxy for sacrifice because some people enjoy
working long and hard at certain tasks, so Hahnel must mean that only those longer hours that
are sacrificial count in his metric of desert. Yet his assertion that “I can decide to work longer
hours or work more intensely than others and qualify for greater rewards” (2005a: 138) implies
that his measure consists in duration and intensity. I am not just splitting definitional hairs;
important practical consequences follow from Hahnel’s equivocation. I take Hahnel to mean by
effort sacrifice. If so, intractable problems of measurement arise since, unlike duration and intensity, sacrifice is less open to inter-personal comparison, standardization, and publicity. I will
expand on this concern later on, but it is one that moves practically-minded theorists to define

So on what basis does Knight justify capitalism? It appears to be utilitarian. “Its only justification is that
it is effective in getting things done” (1935: 74). He also thinks that socialism fares worse than capitalism
with respect to liberty.

effort operationally in terms of duration, “the most common criterion suggested in the past”
(Lamont 1995: 223).
Against contribution-based theories of desert, Hahnel commits to a pre-institutional theory
whose sole basis is differential sacrifice; he then argues that market entitlements fail to square
with desert, so understood. I think he is largely right about market entitlements, but he assumes
rashly that a sacrificial basis satisfies the requirement of what he includes as an essential ingredient of distributional justice, namely that individuals fully control, and thus are responsible for,
what it is that warrants their differential desert, namely their effort. As opposed “to differences
[due to] circumstance, talent, training, luck . . . people control only their effort” (Hahnel 2005a:
137). John Rawls famously objects.
We do not deserve our place in the distribution of natural endowments, any more than we
deserve our initial starting place in society. That we deserve the superior character that
enables us to make the effort to cultivate our capacities is also problematic; for such character depends in good part upon fortunate family and social circumstances in early life for
which we can claim no credit. The notion of desert does not apply here (1999, 89). [It]
seems clear that the effort a person is willing to make is influenced by his natural abilities
and skills and the alternatives open to him. The better endowed are more likely, other
things equal, to strive conscientiously, and there seems to be no way to discount for their
greater good fortune. The idea of rewarding desert is impracticable. (1999: 274)
Robert Nozick (1974: 213-16) initiated a serious misreading of these passages, playing on the
expression “can claim no credit” for family and social circumstances and moving illicitly to the
conclusion that a person’s effortful capacity is fully determined.6 But as the passages show,
Rawls is saying instead it is only those influences which play a “good part” that are not creditable,
not that individuals can claim no credit for effort, namely the effortful capacities they have
cultivated in addition to those influences. “In good part” does not mean in “whole part.”7 As
G. A. Cohen (1989: 914) says of Nozick’s mischievous reading, “influenced” does not mean
“wholly determined,” and so it does not follow that, for Rawls, effort deserves no reward at all
as in the determinist doctrines with which Nozick, complicit in a long tradition of anti-egalitarian
rhetoric, seeks to saddle Rawls. Rawls does not rule out altogether effort as a desert basis, and he
certainly rules in personal responsibility for choosing preferences and goals. Cohen cites pertinent
passages in which Rawls holds citizens responsible if they cultivate expensive tastes that unjustly
pressure scarce public resources; they could have chosen otherwise, “and if and when they press
for compensation, others are entitled to insist that they themselves bear the cost ‘of their lack of
foresight or self-discipline’” (Cohen 1989: 913-15). Rawls is no hard-determinist.

Nozick (1974: 214) writes: “[Rawls’s] line of argument can [my italics] succeed in blocking the introduction of a person’s autonomous choices and actions . . . only by attributing everything noteworthy about the
person to certain sorts of ‘external’ factors.” Other commentators slip from the subjunctive to the indicative
and predictive, e.g. “there will be no room for pre-institutional desert” (Sher 1987: 22); “virtually all of the
characteristics that distinguish us from one another are rooted in natural or social factors over which we
have no control” (Steinberger 1989: 56); “the notion of natural or pre-institutional desert evaporates” and
“since we are simply products of the Natural Lottery,” so does the notion of self-respect since that is not
deserved either (Pojman 1999: 284, 295).

In the first edition of Theory of Justice (1971: 104), Rawls uses the expression “in large part.” But what
does that entail? 51 percent? 75 percent? Rawls clearly leaves some room for pre-institutional personal
desert.

Review of Radical Political Economics 43(4)
Why, then, does Rawls have qualms about according desert largesse in his (or any) egalitarian
theory of distributive justice? It is impracticable, he says, to sort out in any systematic way desert
from morally arbitrary factors, especially on the institutional level. With respect to effortful
capacities, they are distributed unequally among individuals due, in part, to fortunate circumstances for which they are not responsible. And some by virtue of natural abilities are better able
to accomplish tasks and therefore more likely to become motivated to strive, whereas those with
lesser abilities are likely to become frustrated and slack off in their efforts to excel, with the result
that more naturally talented people score better on an effort metric. Rawls’s first point rests on
biological and sociological evidence and the second on psychological insight, both of which find
support in our informed common sense or reflective intuitions (Rawls 1999: 89). In addition to
Rawls’s two points, consider the tight connection between effort and contribution and how the
latter influences the rewards attached to the former. Effort and contribution mesh in ways that
effort theorists, such as Hahnel, cannot reasonably isolate from one another. Even among those
who exercise effort equally (assuming its discrete measurement), Hahnel discounts the efforts of
those who fall short of their “economic duty” or “social endeavor,” by which he must mean contributing to social welfare as measured by the demand of others for which the contributors are not
fully responsible. So not all equally effortful work is to be equally rewarded. As Lamont (1995:
215) argues, theorists who play up effort as the sole desert basis “are also committed, despite
appearances, to increasing the social product . . . which undermines any sharp distinction between
effort- and productivity-based distributive proposals.”
The bottom line is that it is difficult to separate systematically desert from morally arbitrary
factors. That is why Rawls and those of us who suspect appeals to effort as a desert basis are wary
about according it a (or the, as in Hahnel’s case) decisive place in a theory of justice. This is not
to deny that we can be roughly successful in parochial circumstances which epistemically enable
reliable assessments. For example, parents say of Billy that he is putting in more effort than Suzie
in their household chores; or a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse, who gets to know her students,
is positioned to give Billy a “C” in performance and an “A” in effort, whereas Suzie gets a “B” in
performance and a “C” for effort. In settings such as these, we usually try to give desert based on
effort some of its due. But is this feasible in an economy involving tens of millions of individuals
impersonally related? And which institutions can accomplish such a daunting task?
It is difficult enough at the pre-institutional level. How do we go about ranking occupations
and the individuals who occupy them according to the metric of differential cost or sacrifice?
Hahnel’s (2006: 185) featured illustration compares the surgeon and the garbage collector, portraying the highly-paid surgeon as putting in less effortful hours than the poorly-paid garbage
man. According to Hahnel, this is unjust. Feinberg (1973: 117), to the contrary, thinks that
according to the effort principle, hard-working doctors and corporate executives should receive
exactly the same remuneration as hard-working laborers. The laborer’s work may be dirty and
dangerous, but the professional’s involves more responsibility and mental pressure. And we can
go on and on: from accountants through zoologists; imagine the difficulty judging relative effort
levels required by different types of inter and intra occupations, or branches of the economy.
Further, not only occupations need be ranked, but also, and especially, the individuals who fit
these jobs, and this gets us into the hoary issue of the interpersonal comparisons of disutility.
Lamont (1995: 222-23), reflecting on failures of utilitarian theory, wonders whether “it may be
impossible to reduce everything down to effort units and to use these in any meaningful way.”
Carens drives home the point: “Some people are lucky enough to find their work a great pleasure
and source of self-realization. They are likely [to] work long, intense hours. Should this lead us
to reconsider whether they deserve compensation for the ‘burdens’ of their work, especially as
compared with those who work shorter hours at boring, alienating tasks?” Consider, too, that for
some people the danger of a job may be part of its attraction. And what about the varied factors

that affect the costs and benefits of work: colleagues, bosses, job security, location, etc.? “There
is no principled way to distinguish factors that deserve compensation from those that do not, and
no objective way to measure burdens for most factors” (Carens 2003: 159-60).
Maybe institutions, whether administrative or market, can accomplish the calculation feat by
informing our pre-institutional intuitions. Hahnel, an “avowed market abolitionist” (2008: 16)
and advocate of participatory administration, assigns to compensation boards at local workplaces
the task of determining pay schedules that reflect differential effort among individual workers.
He leaves it to “the abilities of workmates to reasonably judge one another’s sacrifices and motivate one another to work diligently and intelligently” (2005b: 138). But, as Jonathan Wolff says,
this “knowledge will be too dispersed, and its sources too unreliable, to serve the purpose
required by the [effort] theory” (Wolff 2003: 225). Too disbursed because the theory requires a
determination of the relative efforts of individuals across an entire economy, and, he goes on, this
unreliability generates “too great a possibility of corruption,” that can accompany the application
of criteria not adequately publicly accessible. This criticism weighs heavily if justice must satisfy
a publicity requirement, which says that it should be possible to confirm whether or not a principle of justice is being followed. If in a cooperative enterprise, say an economy at the national
level, “cooperators in which each must know that others are cooperating—they are bound by
justice to cooperate only when they know that others, too, are cooperating: it would be unfair to
expect them to take up the burden of justice unless (they can know that) others are doing so”
(Cohen 2008: 347, summarizing Williams 1998). Remember that Hahnel’s desert basis is effort
defined as personal cost or disutility. Think about the epistemic hurdles that get in the way of
publicly auditing the distribution of relative effort among occupations and, ultimately, individuals. “A feasible theory should not require access to information we cannot acquire,” which is not
to deny the fairness of effort theory but rather to say it is not viable, which counts importantly
against it (Wolff: 224, 227).8
Further, if individuals lack assurance that others are doing their part because they lack access
to information they cannot acquire, might they not be justified, as a matter of personal prerogative,9 in overriding their prima facie obligation to live up to a distributive principle based on
effort? In such a case, the corruption of the effort principle can be caused not so much by moral
laxity as by epistemic limitation. Is it not unfair for cooperative members to bear the burdens of
just principles when they lack assurance that others are doing so? In the face of an irresolvable

The issue of measurement is problematical enough at the occupational level. The epistemic problem looms
even larger at the individual level, the one that really counts: “People, not jobs, deserve wages. And the
wage a person deserves depends (I have argued) not only about facts about the person’s job, but also upon
the facts of the person. Unfortunately, there is no way to know, for example, each person’s moral character,
need, or the amount of good and evil she has already received. Therefore there is no way to include these
factors in job evaluation schemes” (McLeod 1999: 280). But suppose that we try to overcome this epistemic
challenge. At what cost? Not only is there time and effort involved in calculation (think about how many
meetings must be devoted to determining individual effort, especially with a mobile work force). Consider,
too, the intrusion into workers’ personal lives. “Why is Joe not performing up to snuff at his job?” ask his
fellow workers. “Fess up Joe, problems with drinking too much at the pub, not getting along with your wife
and kids, as a child you were encouraged to be a slouch?” and so on and on. Hahnel’s scheme involves
“effort rating committees” of workmates, whose responsibilities include observing others, collecting testimony from others, as well as self-testimony, hearing grievances, and deciding on controversial procedures
to use in calculating effort (see Hahnel 2005a: 228-34).

assurance problem, their appeal to legitimate self-interest may morally justify the overriding of
their prima facie obligation to act justly. And worse, might not epistemic paucity incite ethical
corruption in the form of individuals deceiving each other about the relative disutility undergone
in work? Lamont (1995: 225) calls this the “moral hazard problem of effort theory,” according to
which “people are presented with an opportunity to exploit the system by modifying their behavior in such a way as to maximize their income (by maximizing their scores on the employed
criteria) while minimizing their effort within the constraints set by the system.”
Might the institution of the market more so than administrative agencies help in determining
accurately and less intrusively the relative efforts of workers across an entire economy? Not
capitalist markets, of course, for all the reasons (nicely summed up by Knight in my citation
above) given by disparate thinkers ranging from Friedman to Rawls. What about socialist markets? There are at least three different models of market socialism, all of which share the
common features of social ownership of the means of production (excluding labor) and considerable use of markets to allocate resources, including labor. Social ownership can take the form
of worker-owned cooperatives, state-owned enterprises controlled by workers, or privatelyowned enterprises so widely held by individuals as to count as social ownership, as in the case
of John Roemer’s “voucher socialism” or John Rawls’s “private property-owning democracy.”10
The idea is that in market socialism, whatever its form, labor markets operate against the background of an egalitarian distribution of wealth, equality of practical opportunity, and full
employment. Lamont (1997) argues that when these conditions are in place, markets tend to
automatically reward workers according to effort, which is to say, as I would put it, that the procedure of the market yields a substantive calculation of the distribution of relative effort among
individuals. Suppose all jobs were paid the same base wage rate. Then consider what would
prompt a person to choose a job different than the one she has at that rate. Lamont (1997: 35)
argues that her choice depends on the weight she accords the base wage rate when compared to
the non-monetary costs attached to jobs with the result that she gets compensated for those costs.
If a job requires an incentive payment to induce people to work in it, then that means it
has burdens (or disutility) over and above some (arbitrary) base level. Under the desert
theory being used here, the payment will be justified because it compensates for this
burden (or disutility)—not because it would increase the social product (although it will
normally do that).
Lamont says that these incentive payments constitute compensatory desert as distinct from
economic rents which are greater than what is required to keep workers at their present occupations.
Rent collection results from the relative scarcity of the worker’s factor input, something determined
by natural and institutional barriers for which the worker is not responsible. Economic rents, unlike
incentive payments, are not compensatory, since they exceed what is necessary to induce a worker
to transfer jobs. Socialist markets, which have the requisite egalitarian background institutions, tend
to automatically pay labor unequally according to differential effort so that market entitlements
mesh with economic desert.
This is fine, as far as it goes, but its simplicity misleads. What is attractive is its apparent
egalitarian thrust. As Miller (1976: 111) notes, “the principle that unpleasant, onerous, and

hazardous jobs deserve economic compensation . . . is an equalitarian one. For it says only that
deprivations for which there is no good reason should be compensated to the point where the
deprived one is again brought back to a position of equality with his fellows.” The idea is that
differences in pay compensate for non-monetary differences in work. Oskar Lange (1935: 101-02),
in his classic exposition of market socialism, put it this way:
By putting leisure, safety, agreeableness of work, etc., into the utility scales of individuals,
the disutility of any occupation can be represented as an opportunity cost. The choice of an
occupation offering a lower money income, but also a lower disutility, may be interpreted
as the purchase of leisure, safety, agreeableness of work, etc., at a price equal to the difference between the money income earned in that particular occupation and others. Thus the
difference of incomes required by condition 2 are only apparent. They represent prices
paid by individuals for different conditions of work. Instead of attaching different money
incomes to the various occupations the administration of a socialist economy might pay all
citizens the same money income and charge a price for the pursuit of each occupation. It
becomes obvious not only that there is no contradiction between both conditions, but that
condition 2 is necessary to satisfy condition 1.
Notice that what renders this scheme egalitarian is its reliance on the metric of welfare, by
which is meant utility or preference satisfaction. The disutility involved in some work is offset
or balanced by an unequal payment of resources, by which is meant monetary income whose
expenditure yields utility that presumedly matches the disutility undergone in disagreeable
work. But just how egalitarian is this? Not only is there the usual problem of commensurability
that complicates the feasibility of implementation, but even if that were resolved, consider that
monetary income, unlike the utility experienced in certain jobs, can be saved and transferred to
other people. As long as the family exists, would not parents with greater incomes pass on, inter
vivos, to their children benefits that are not deserved in the way required by effort theory?11 I do
not think that effort theorists such as Hahnel successfully come to terms with this conundrum,
made all the more difficult for them because they believe that unequal incomes (of parents) are
deserved and therefore prima facie inoculated against taxation and redistribution. Hahnel never
tells us how much income inequality his meritocratic scheme permits. How deep does it go? And
does effort theory justify unequal (monetary income) outcomes if, as Rawls and others hold,
effortful capacities themselves are tangled up with morally arbitrary influences?
As part of an analysis of Rawls’s difference principle, I once argued for a version of effort
theory that incorporated markets. I wrote that a perfectly competitive market set against the
background of just institutions “tends to satisfy the compensatory requirement of the difference
principle.”
A justly ordered society, in which there is freedom of employment, would no doubt have to
award greater benefits to individuals who undertake activities involving “uncertain or
unstable employment, or which are performed under hazardous and unpleasantly strenuous
conditions . . . . Otherwise men cannot be found to fill them. From this circumstance arise
such precepts as to each according to effort or the risks he bears” (Rawls 1999: 269).12 In

this way, the market works to compensate individuals in proportion to the disutility undergone in satisfying social want. And in a market economy regulated by fair equality of
opportunity and other egalitarian measures, the shortage of individuals prepared to offer
their services in unenjoyable and risky activities would ensure them a higher marginal rate
of return in contrast to those enjoyable activities (which in present capitalist societies pay
high rates because of the imperfections sustained by acute class inequalities and consequent
structured lack of equality of opportunity) that would pay less because of the greater supply
of labor. (DiQuattro 1983: 63).
I no longer subscribe to what I said then. Carens (1986: 40-1) scored effective criticism of
my “false assumption about how a market system would work if Rawls’s background conditions
were satisfied.” Although effort counts, market prices would still reflect the relative scarcity of
factors such as natural abilities and talents for which individuals are not responsible.13 Or as
Wolff (2003: 230) puts it: “The labour market rewards not just extra effort but scarce talents and
luck.” And to top it off, as I pointed out earlier, (1) individuals are not fully responsible for their
effortful capacities, and (2) effort and contribution mesh in ways that market demand, which
eludes individual responsibility, impinges on the reward of effort.
So where does this leave us with respect to effort and desert? Rawls is right about the nonfeasibility of implementing the principle of to each according to effort. I have argued that measurement
is on its shakiest ground when determined by administrative agencies, with respect to both efficiency
(calculation) and ethics (intrusion of privacy), and that socialist markets do a better job on both
counts, which is to say less worse than planners. Remember that, for Rawls, there is a place in
socialist markets for distributional “precepts,” one of which honors effort. But socialist markets,
for reasons I have given, come up short of the desideratum and so must be supplemented by state
policies that reduce the element of moral arbitrariness in the distribution of income and/or welfare.
These policies assume the form of redistributive taxation and spending on public goods, more of
which about shortly. But Hahnel says that market socialism is incompatible with a properly egalitarian distribution of income. He says that “market socialist economies cannot avoid being
inequitable” (Hahnel 2005a: 131, emphasis added). Hahnel is wrong on this and I show why in the
following comments that bring together some of the issues discussed above.

Rawls is here referring to the “precept” of “to each according to effort,” by which he means a “common
sense norm” that “cannot be plausibly raised to a first principle” (1971: 307). Rawls does not include compensation for effort in the difference principle because as a resource egalitarian he cannot give that much
room to welfare considerations. This is why Hahnel (2005b: 144) is mistaken in saying “there is nothing in
his theory that should lead him to distinguish between a dangerous job and a smaller ration of food rations
as negative aspects of someone’s ‘outcome.’” Cohen objects forcefully to Rawls’s principled disparagement
of a welfare metric, saying that “ignoring welfare in matters of social justice is ludicrous . . . Rawls’s reasons
for thinking otherwise are misplaced.” Rawls’s “prescinding from the quality of people’s work experience
is [not] defensible at the bar of egalitarian justice,” with Cohen favoring unequal monetary compensation
for differential labor burdens, “whatever obstacles there may be to taking full account of it in practice”
(Cohen 2008: 200-02). What softens Cohen’s blow against Rawls, however, is that Cohen overlooks (inexcusably?) altogether Rawls’s inclusion of effort as a precept when that is set against the background of a
“basic structure” governed by the principles of justice.

Also see Krouse and McPherson (1988: 96): “Despite DiQuattro’s assertion, [the difference principle is
not] a purely compensatory principle of justice; it encompasses compensatory considerations, but not to
the exclusion of other considerations . . . . The difference principle . . . would appear to justify paying those
with scarce natural talents their transfer price (i.e., the amount necessary to prevent them from switching to
a socially less desirable use of their talents)—even if that price includes an element of blackmail.”

The last section of Hahnel’s “Economic Justice” is titled ‘Why Market Socialist Economies
Will Be Unfair’ and he picks up on this theme in “Against the Market Economy” appearing in
Monthly Review (2008) which advises the Venezuelan regime to steer clear of reliance on markets in allocating and distributing economic resources. He thinks that in any market economy,
whether socialist or capitalist, “those with more human capital will receive more, even if they
make no greater sacrifice, and those with less human capital will receive less, even if they sacrifice just as much” (2008: 14). He goes on to say that any attempt to fix the problem—the
unfairness of the distribution—will “create a great deal of inefficiency.”
If wages are determined by the laws of supply and demand in labor markets the best that
can be hoped for is distribution according to maxim 2: to each according to the value of the
contribution of his or her labor (2005b: 173). If we intervene in the labor market and legislate wage rates we consider to be fair, but allow markets to determine how resources are
allocated, not only will different kinds of labor be allocated inefficiently, the entire price
structure will fail to reflect the opportunity costs of producing different goods and services
leading to further inefficiencies. There is no getting around the dilemma: in a market economy we must either allow the market system to reward people unfairly, or, if we try to
correct for inequalities we must tolerate even greater inefficiencies. (Hahnel 2008: 14-15)14
Milton Friedman (1980: 24, 23) criticizes market socialism along the same lines.
We once heard a brilliant talk by a Hungarian Marxist economist. He had discovered for
himself Adam Smith’s invisible hand . . . .He tried, however, to improve upon it in order to
use the price system to transmit information and organize production efficiently but not to
distribute income. Needless to say, he failed in theory, as the communist countries have
failed in practice. . . . It is simply not possible to use prices to transmit information and
provide an incentive to act on that information without also to affect, even if not completely
determine, the distribution of income . . . . If prices are prevented from affecting the distribution of income, they cannot be used for other purposes. The alternative is command.
Now if Hahnel and Friedman are talking about labor markets in capitalism their observation
is on track. But are they right about labor markets in socialism? I have already shown that effort
counts for more, at the level of precepts, in socialist markets than those in capitalism. Still, even
socialist labor markets fall short of justice, whatever desert bases one goes with, whether effort,
contribution, or need. There is, therefore, an important place for state intervention via taxing and
spending policies. But Hahnel and Friedman insist that a market socialist regime cannot secure
egalitarian justice without sacrificing economic efficiency. Why? Because they believe that, in
the interest of fair distribution of workers’ income, a market socialist regime must legislate
workers’ wages. This belief rests on a fatal theoretical mistake. To appreciate why, distinguish
between the allocative and distributive functions of market prices.15 With respect to efficiency,
the assumption is that market pricing effectively allocates resources; that is, if high prices are

According to Hahnel the dilemma is this: “If we allow the labor market to determine wage rates, we
will get something approximating marginal revenue product wages,” but then “the compensation workers
receive will be unfair.” “Any modification of market-based wage rates in the direction of equitable wage
rates will generate inefficiency losses in market socialist economies as labor is misallocated” (Hahnel
2005b: 151). “If wages are determined by the laws of supply and demand in labor markets the best that can
be hoped for is distribution according to maxim 2: to each according to the value of the contribution of his
or her labor” (2005a: 173).

levied on scarce goods and low prices on abundant goods, then the users of these goods will be
informed automatically on how to achieve a Pareto-optimal allocation of economic resources.16
But prices used for this efficiency purpose may result in an extremely undesirable spread of wealth
and income. This is the distributional aspect of the price mechanism. This potential conflict
between efficiency and distribution should come as no surprise since the theorem of optimal
competition takes no account of distribution so that resource allocation would be considered to
satisfy this optimum property even though half of the population were starving while the other
half were enjoying great luxury.
The upshot: in market socialism, market prices are used as accounting devices or efficiency
indicators but not to distribute income as this is done in market capitalism. Most obviously,
because of the egalitarian distribution of non-human capital, interest and profit incomes are distributed differently. For example, banks charge interest on loans scheduled for investment by
enterprises, but the price assessed on loans does not take the form of income paid to a small
group of capitalists; profit is distributed widely to shareholders who socially own the means of
production, and so on. Interest and profit incomes coexist with egalitarian aims. But what about
labor income, which is the focus of interest here? Branko Horvat (1964: 130) casts some light on
this in his ethical defense of market socialism. He distinguishes between gross and net wages of
labor, the gross wage reflecting the marginal productivity of labor17 and the net wage determined
by a political decision consistent with social expectations as to what labor income distribution
constitutes fairness. “The difference between the gross wages and the net wages represents rent
which is taxed away by the Planning Authority. One may say that the net wage-rates represent
the supply price of labor, while the gross wage-rates are its demand price.” Horvat thinks the net
wage-rates “include not only ‘efficiency’ differentials, but also positive differentials for dirty,
strenuous, dangerous, more responsible, etc., work, and, conversely differentials for agreeable
and leisurely work, i.e., they include ‘cost’ differentials as well.” Gross wages signal an efficient
allocation of labor; net wages are what workers receive as income after the state accomplishes a
redistribution of gross wages through egalitarian taxation and spending policies. Which is to say
that in the interest of efficiency, it is important that workers seek to maximize the gross wage
even though they receive only the politically-determined net or fair wage, i.e., income. In this
way, justice holds sway in the sphere of distribution while efficiency reigns in the sphere of production. What should be apparent by now is Friedman’s and Hahnel’s theoretical error in asserting
that in market socialism gross wages are legislated. They are not; instead, labor income is, so
legislation does not get in the way of an efficient allocation of labor resources. Unless, of course,
an egalitarian distribution of labor income interferes with allocative efficiency by reducing
“incentives,” which is what Hahnel also claims. “Income policies and limits on wage differentials create inefficiencies by forcing some wages to differ from a worker’s actual marginal

I am more concerned in this paper with justice than efficiency, whether Pareto-optimality or broader (and
more satisfactory) conceptions that maximize net social benefits, including those that focus on furthering
“opportunity capabilities” and well-being understood as more than mere preference satisfaction (see, e.g.,
the work of Amartya Sen 2009: part 3). Hahnel rehearses all the usual objections to market efficiency, some
of which are telling indeed. The question, however, is whether these objections carry the same force when
applied to socialist markets rather than capitalist ones. For example, negative externalities such as pollution loom large in capitalist markets, but might not the egalitarian distribution of wealth in socialist ones
mitigate that? Roemer and Bardhan (1994: 180) give us good reason to believe that “the level of certain
profit-inducing public ‘bads’ are likely to be lower when profits are more equally distributed, as in our
market socialist regime, than under capitalism where profits are concentrated.”

Though Horvat relies here on the theory of the marginal product of labor, he thinks that the “possibility of applying marginal product calculus is rather questionable.” Elsewhere (1982: 272), he questions its
theoretical coherence.

revenue product, as explained above. Welfare payments and progressive taxes [in market socialism] create motivational inefficiencies . . . [there are] political and psychological obstacles that
would work against achieving equity correctives in any real-world market socialist economy . . .”
(Hahnel 2005b: 151).18
I have already shown how Hahnel’s saying this rests on a mistaken conflation of gross wages
with income, the latter consisting of what workers get after redistributive taxation and spending
on public goods. Already, in social democracies such as Sweden, workers’ income, both monetary and in-kind, differs importantly from their gross wages, thus demonstrating that, theoretically
and empirically, fairness and efficiency can go together in market socialism, as they do in social
democracies, to a degree that Hahnel, on the basis of a theoretical mistake, denies. Still, Hahnel
raises the important issue of incentives in market socialism, thinking that “the logic of the labor
market” encourages people to defend their gross wages on the basis of contribution and thus to
resist redistribution in line with egalitarian aims. Roemer (1994: 119) worries similarly, “Perhaps
[the liberal maxim] is psychologically mandated in people who compete on labor markets. If so,
this places a political limit on the degree of redistribution that can be accomplished by socialdemocratic methods.” But what does Roemer mean by “competition”? If labor incomes are
politically determined, then on what level are workers competing? If there is competition for
income, then this takes place at the political level, where it belongs, not in the market. Of course,
minus a prevalent egalitarian ethos in a market socialist society, politics will not take an egalitarian course. I do not see why labor markets, when set against the background of socialist institutions,
must prompt inegalitarian attitudes among their participants. If it is obvious to some of us, including me and Hahnel, that the gross wages in labor markets are unjust, then why cannot this view
find expression among many other people, so that the state pursues policies, in a democratic setting, that accomplish an egalitarian distribution? Why cannot citizens see through the illusion that
market allocation and distribution are necessarily wedded and opt for a politically-determined
distribution while relying on markets for efficient allocation? And remember that we are talking
about market socialism here, not market capitalism, so that labor markets are operating against
the background of an egalitarian ethos which accompanies an egalitarian distribution of wealth
and political authority.
What is ultimately important is the ethos, one transcending the issue of market vs. planned
economies. After all, even in planned economic systems people can decide to rely on inegalitarian bases of desert, including those that play up contribution. We know that in contemporary
market capitalist societies most people subscribe to a plurality of desert bases, with contribution
heading the list, although interpretation of the empirical studies gets complicated because often
“effort” is subsumed under “contribution” (see Miller 1992).19 We also know that public opinion
in Eastern Europe, very soon after things changed in 1989, was not too dissimilar from that in
Western Europe with respect to the ethical importance of contribution as a desert basis for labor
income (see Marshall, Swift, Routh, Burgoyne 1999). People who lived in planned economies

Review of Radical Political Economics 43(4)
shared views about contribution as a desert base of labor income that was similar to those living
in market economies. So market allocation is not a necessary condition for people subscribing to
the kind of justice that Hahnel deems ethically suspect.
Some concluding comments: radical egalitarians want, ideally, equality of outcomes, whether
income or welfare (I side with welfare; DiQuattro 1998). I have argued here that the use of markets
as an allocative device is consistent with that, which is not to deny that market socialism is but a
transitional stage to communism, as some Marxists project. Realization of the ideal awaits communism. The aim is to replace economic desert, whether based on contribution or effort, both of
which reflect morally arbitrary factors, with the radical egalitarian ideal of “to each according to
need.”20 During the interval period, because of scarcity and left-over bourgeois beliefs (“muck,”
in Marx’s word) about desert, the ideal requires compromise, but always in the direction of the
egalitarian default, which seeks distributive equality. The default is both practical and principled.
If it is the case that we lack reliable information about differential desert—whether based on contribution or effort—among individuals on the level of a national economy, then, as Miller (1992:
560) suggests, practical reason “opts for equality as the fairest distribution in the circumstances”
and this passes the test of rationality because in the face of ignorance of individuals’ particular
contributions to a joint output, minimizing the expected unfairness of the distribution requires an
equal distribution of payment; “by dividing the reward equally [between the workers] you minimize the greatest possible underpayment and by extension minimize the expected underpayment.”
In addition, there is a tendency to equality on principled grounds. The basic premise of egalitarians
is that people are equally free and moral persons, so that “the obvious starting point is for them to
suppose that all social primary goods, including income and wealth, should be equal; everyone
should have an equal share” (Rawls 2005: 281). Departures from equal distribution require justification and have a place in less than ideal circumstances, so that sacrificial effort as a desert basis
has a role to play in market socialism on the level of precepts, as discussed above.
The precepts might even be raised to a political level if epistemic problems can find a practical
solution. Roemer (1993) tries this by having the state supplement and implement the effort precept. He constructs a model that seeks to separate morally arbitrary factors, in particular talent,
from the measurement of effort which remains as the only variable determining distributive outcomes. Put very simply, using educational attainment as a proxy for talent, Roemer divides the
workforce into highly- and less-educated groups and, prompted by an egalitarian impulse, proposes that the average wage of both groups should be the same. But within each group workers
should be rewarded in proportion to differential effort. This gets implemented by the state instituting a progressive tax based on educational attainment, i.e. a talent tax, with the result that while
gross-wages reflect both talent and effort, net-wages reflect effort alone. In Roemer’s model,
socialist markets and progressive taxation go some distance in resolving practical problems of
effort measurement, and they do so automatically at the state level as opposed to leaving it to
complicated and idiosyncratic determinations by “effort commissions” at local workplaces. Just
how practical Roemer’s scheme is I leave to readers. It may not provide a method that successfully separates the morally arbitrary from that for which individuals are “fully responsible.”
Following Rawls, I have already questioned whether effort and responsibility always go together.
And as Wolff says (2003: 231) of Roemer’s attempt, it does not address native talent within the

Andrew Levine (1998: 37) characterizes as liberal what Hahnel calls the “radical” maxim. According to
Levine, the radical maxim is “to each the same,” in contrast to liberal egalitarian theories of justice that
permit inequality with their emphasis on the tie between individual responsibility and economic desert.
“Thus liberal egalitarians, unlike egalitarians sans phrase do not want everyone to have equal shares [of
the favored distribuand—welfare or resources] . . . .Their view of individual responsibility contravenes this
desideratum.” Also, see Levine 1999.

different educational groups, “so although theoretically this approach provides insight of high
order, it does not solve the problem. It is no more possible [in our current state of knowledge] to
measure talent levels with confidence than it is for effort levels.”
Is the practice of economic desert compatible with radical egalitarian ideals? One way of
reconciling the two may be to eliminate that part of its definition which includes differential
personal responsibility, thus questioning what Hahnel and other liberal egalitarians deem so
important (see footnote 20). Why must desert have a basis in some attribute or action for which
individuals are personally responsible? Do we not sometimes assert that individuals, qua persons, deserve equal baseline respect and concern, even though as Fred Feldman says (1995: 69)
they are not responsible for being persons, and does this not “provide evidence for the [sometimes] independence of responsibility and desert?”21 William Galston writes (1991: 131-2):
“There is nothing self-contradictory about basing a [desert claim] on some undeserved feature of
yourself . . . [e.g., if] moral personality is the basis of your claim to be taken into consideration.”
He goes on to say that Rawls “establishes as the sole, relevant desert basis a feature of our lives
(moral personality) that equally characterizes nearly all of us.” I think Galston is right on Rawls
and I have argued that a similar idea inspires Marx’s model of a perfectly just society in which
everyone, by virtue of personhood, is deserving of equal welfare accorded by the communist
principle of distribution: to each according to need (DiQuattro 1998). According to the communist ideal, those economies which deny this by permitting morally arbitrary factors (e.g. those
allowed by meritocratic principles such as “to each according to effort”) to systematically influence distributive outcomes count as exploitative and unjust.

Feldman provides numerous examples of successful desert claims not entailing personal responsibility,
prompting him to wonder why so many philosophers have accepted “without argument” the connection as
necessary. One example consists of people who suffer from food poisoning at a restaurant due to careless
preparation. Do they not deserve some compensation for their illness even though they bear no responsibility
for the fact that they were poisoned? Also see Feldman 1996.

There are factors within the “constraints” of the real world of market economies that play routinely a role in determining wages and salaries; in addition to oligopolies and other imperfections, there are taxation and regulative law, collective bargaining, historical precedent, cultural factors, various government policies, and so on. We know, e.g., that there is strong rigidity in the ordinal wage ranking of most occupations. Even in recessionary times, wages do not fall as predicted by the conventional equilibrium price-auction model of neoclassical economics (see Bewley 2000).4 The foregoing supports the conclusion that market entitlements do not fit pre-institutional desert based on individual contribution. This is, of course, not a peculiarly “leftist” or egalitarian view. Milton Friedman understands that markets, especially in their “perfectively competitive” form, are no respecters of economic desert, whether its basis is contribution or effort. “Most differences in status or position or wealth can be regarded as the product of chance at a far enough remove . . . .” According to Friedman, chance determines our genetic makeup and, to some extent, our mental and</context>

A.

Rawls does not rule out altogether effort as a desert basis, and he certainly rules in personal responsibility for choosing preferences and goals.

As opposed “to differences [due to] circumstance, talent, training, luck . . . people control only their effort” (Hahnel 2005a: 137). John Rawls famously objects. We do not deserve our place in the distribution of natural endowments, any more than we deserve our initial starting place in society. That we deserve the superior character that enables us to make the effort to cultivate our capacities is also problematic; for such character depends in good part upon fortunate family and social circumstances in early life for which we can claim no credit. The notion of desert does not apply here (1999, 89). [It] seems clear that the effort a person is willing to make is influenced by his natural abilities and skills and the alternatives open to him. The better endowed are more likely, other things equal, to strive conscientiously, and there seems to be no way to discount for their greater good fortune. The idea of rewarding desert is impracticable.

Consider this gem. Everyone is compelled to play the economic game and be judged by his success in playing it.

If we intervene in the labor market and legislate wage rates we consider to be fair, but allow markets to determine how resources are allocated, not only will different kinds of labor be allocated inefficiently, the entire price structure will fail to reflect the opportunity costs of producing different goods and services leading to further inefficiencies. There is no getting around the dilemma: in a market economy we must either allow the market system to reward people unfairly, or, if we try to correct for inequalities we must tolerate even greater inefficiencies.

Against contribution-based theories of desert, Hahnel commits to a pre-institutional theory whose sole basis is differential sacrifice; he then argues that market entitlements fail to square with desert, so understood. I think he is largely right about market entitlements, but he assumes rashly that a sacrificial basis satisfies the requirement of what he includes as an essential ingredient of distributional justice, namely that individuals fully control, and thus are responsible for, what it is that warrants their differential desert, namely their effort.

Effort and contribution mesh in ways that effort theorists, such as Hahnel, cannot reasonably isolate from one another. Even among those who exercise effort equally (assuming its discrete measurement), Hahnel discounts the efforts of those who fall short of their “economic duty” or “social endeavor,” by which he must mean contributing to social welfare as measured by the demand of others for which the contributors are not fully responsible. So not all equally effortful work is to be equally rewarded. As Lamont (1995: 215) argues, theorists who play up effort as the sole desert basis “are also committed, despite appearances, to increasing the social product . . . which undermines any sharp distinction between effort- and productivity-based distributive proposals.” The bottom line is that it is difficult to separate systematically desert from morally arbitrary factors. That is why Rawls and those of us who suspect appeals to effort as a desert basis are wary about according it a (or the, as in Hahnel’s case) decisive place in a theory of justice.

And we can go on and on: from accountants through zoologists; imagine the difficulty judging relative effort levels required by different types of inter and intra occupations, or branches of the economy. Further, not only occupations need be ranked, but also, and especially, the individuals who fit these jobs, and this gets us into the hoary issue of the interpersonal comparisons of disutility. Lamont (1995: 222-23), reflecting on failures of utilitarian theory, wonders whether “it may be impossible to reduce everything down to effort units and to use these in any meaningful way.” Carens drives home the point: “Some people are lucky enough to find their work a great pleasure and source of self-realization. They are likely [to] work long, intense hours.

And worse, might not epistemic paucity incite ethical corruption in the form of individuals deceiving each other about the relative disutility undergone in work? Lamont (1995: 225) calls this the “moral hazard problem of effort theory,” according to which “people are presented with an opportunity to exploit the system by modifying their behavior in such a way as to maximize their income (by maximizing their scores on the employed criteria) while minimizing their effort within the constraints set by the system.” Might the institution of the market more so than administrative agencies help in determining accurately and less intrusively the relative efforts of workers across an entire economy?

Social ownership can take the form of worker-owned cooperatives, state-owned enterprises controlled by workers, or privatelyowned enterprises so widely held by individuals as to count as social ownership, as in the case of John Roemer’s “voucher socialism” or John Rawls’s “private property-owning democracy.”10 The idea is that in market socialism, whatever its form, labor markets operate against the background of an egalitarian distribution of wealth, equality of practical opportunity, and full employment. Lamont (1997) argues that when these conditions are in place, markets tend to automatically reward workers according to effort, which is to say, as I would put it, that the procedure of the market yields a substantive calculation of the distribution of relative effort among individuals. Suppose all jobs were paid the same base wage rate. Then consider what would prompt a person to choose a job different than the one she has at that rate. Lamont (1997: 35) argues that her choice depends on the weight she accords the base wage rate when compared to the non-monetary costs attached to jobs with the result that</context>

Departures from equal distribution require justification and have a place in less than ideal circumstances, so that sacrificial effort as a desert basis has a role to play in market socialism on the level of precepts, as discussed above. The precepts might even be raised to a political level if epistemic problems can find a practical solution. Roemer (1993) tries this by having the state supplement and implement the effort precept. He constructs a model that seeks to separate morally arbitrary factors, in particular talent, from the measurement of effort which remains as the only variable determining distributive outcomes. Put very simply, using educational attainment as a proxy for talent, Roemer divides the workforce into highly- and less-educated groups and, prompted by an egalitarian impulse, proposes that the average wage of both groups should be the same. But within each group workers should be rewarded in proportion to differential effort</context>

The problem with the model, unless it builds in tautology, is its failure to account for the “exogenous” determination of wages in actual market systems. Thurow traces the model’s deficiency to the micro-foundations of neoclassical economics. Hahnel displays an ambivalent stance towards the marginal productivity theory of distribution. As we have seen (above), he is wary about its ability to separate individual from collective contribution. Still, he relies on it to score ethical points against market entitlements. “When young people flock to join the profession I have labored in for t</context>

Think about the epistemic hurdles that get in the way of publicly auditing the distribution of relative effort among occupations and, ultimately, individuals. “A feasible theory should not require access to information we cannot acquire,” which is not to deny the fairness of effort theory but rather to say it is not viable, which counts importantly against it (Wolff: 224, 227).8 Further, if individuals lack assurance that others are doing their part because they lack access to information they cannot acquir</context>

Hahnel, an “avowed market abolitionist” (2008: 16) and advocate of participatory administration, assigns to compensation boards at local workplaces the task of determining pay schedules that reflect differential effort among individual workers. He leaves it to “the abilities of workmates to reasonably judge one another’s sacrifices and motivate one another to work diligently and intelligently” (2005b: 138). But, as Jonathan Wolff says, this “knowledge will be too dispersed, and its sources too unreliable, to serve the purpose required by the [effort] theory” (Wolff 2003: 225). Too disbursed because the theory requires a determination of the relative efforts of individuals across an entire economy, and, he goes on, this unreliability generates “too great a possibility of corruption,” that can accompany the application of criteria not adequately publicly accessible. This criticism weighs heavily if justice must satisfy a publicity requirement, which says that it should be possible to confirm whether or not a principle of justice is being followed.

(DiQuattro 1983: 63). I no longer subscribe to what I said then. Carens (1986: 40-1) scored effective criticism of my “false assumption about how a market system would work if Rawls’s background conditions were satisfied.” Although effort counts, market prices would still reflect the relative scarcity of factors such as natural abilities and talents for which individuals are not responsible.13 Or as Wolff (2003: 230) puts it: “The labour market rewards not just extra effort but scarce talents and luck.” And to top it off, as I pointed out earlier, (1) individuals are not fully responsible for their effortful capacities, and (2) effort and contribution mesh in ways that market demand, which eludes individual responsibility, impinges on the reward of effort. So where does this leave us with respect to effort and desert? Rawls is right about the nonfeasibility of implementing the principle of to each according to effort.
