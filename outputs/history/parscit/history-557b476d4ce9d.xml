The Long Term: Capitalism and
Culture in the New Millennium
ABSTRACT. One of the most significant developments
in the latter part of the 20th century and the first part of
this new millennium has been the triumph of short-term
over long-term thinking. We are increasingly a culture
that looks neither to the past nor to the future, but only to
the next ‘‘quarter,’’ or to the next Delphic pronouncement by Alan Greenspan. This cultural construction of
time has given rise to social, political and personal
problems of unprecedented magnitude. The short-term
focus of contemporary American capitalism is causing us
to behave, both individually and collectively, in an
increasingly irrational and thus self-destructive manner.
Ours is now the most violent, crime-ridden society in the
industrialized world. Capitalism is sometimes blamed for
this, yet there are other capitalist societies that do not
suffer the same evils we suffer. I argue that we can learn
from these societies how to correct some of the ills of our
own system and in this way construct a new paradigm of
the market, a paradigm for the new millennium, a more
mature, rational version of capitalism that would focus on
the long rather than the short term.

Whatsoever therefore is consequent to a time of war,
where every man is enemy to every man; the same is
consequent to the time, wherein men live without
other security than what their own strength, and their
own invention shall furnish them withal. In such
condition, there is no place for industry; because the
fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently, no culture
of the earth; no navigation, nor use of commodities
that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing such
things as require much force; no knowledge of the face
of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no
society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and
danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary,
poor, nasty, brutish and short.

One of the most significant developments in the
latter part of the 20th century and the first part of this
new millennium has been the triumph of short-term
over long-term thinking. We are increasingly a
culture that looks neither to the past nor to the future, but only to the next ‘‘quarter,’’ or to the next
Delphic pronouncement by Alan Greenspan. The
proliferation of online stock trading and 24-hour
news and financial services has compressed our
experience of time to the frenetic pursuit of shortterm gains. This cultural construction of time has
given rise to social, political and personal problems
of unprecedented magnitude. Sociologist Richard
Sennett argues, for example, in The Corrosion of
Character: The Personal Consequences of Work in the
New Capitalism, that this preoccupation with the
short term corrodes character because ‘‘character
focuses on the long-term aspect of our emotional
experience’’ (1998, p. 10). ‘‘How are we,’’ he asks,

society that is impatient, which focuses on the
immediate moment?’’ (1998, p. 10).
The issue is not, however, merely an ethical one.
Preoccupation with the short term has traditionally
been seen as ‘‘shortsightedness,’’ and is thus often
disparaged as an expression of immaturity – or
worse. Thomas Hobbes asserted, for example, that
such a focus is irrational.2 I argue that the short-term
focus of contemporary American society is causing
us to behave both individually and collectively, in an
increasingly irrational and self-destructive manner.
The United States used to be a model for the rest
of the world. Our current preoccupation, however,
with the short term is not merely, as Sennett argues,
corroding the character of individuals, it is dismantling our culture. Ours is now the most violent,
crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.3
Capitalism is sometimes blamed for this,4 yet there
are other capitalist societies that do not suffer the
same evils we suffer.
It is not capitalism, I will argue, that is to blame
for the unraveling of American culture. It is the
contemporary American paradigm of capitalism,
with its short-term orientation, that is at fault. That
something is dreadfully wrong with contemporary
American capitalism is, of course, no revelation.
Scores of books have been written on this topic in
the last 20 years.5 We are now familiar with the
problem. What we need are answers, or at least a
direction in which to turn to seek answers. I will
argue that we have the power, however, to construct
a new paradigm of the market, a paradigm for the
new millennium, a more mature, rational version of
capitalism that would focus on the long rather than
the short term and provide solutions to many of our
current social, political and personal problems.
mandated minimum wages spread the wealth more
equitably across populations. These newly affluent
populations represented huge markets for consumer
goods. These markets gave rise to a proliferation of
large corporations, and large corporations required
large number of employees who they, in turn, offered the possibility of employment for life.
The latter part of the 20th century saw an explosion
in the rate of the development of technology. This
explosion dramatically increased the variety of products available to consumers. This increased the volatility of consumer demand and thus of the market in
general. Sennett, using IBM as his point of departure,
provides an excellent account of what happened to
many large corporations during this period. I will thus
rely heavily upon Sennett’s account in the first part of
this paper. IBM had practiced a kind of ‘‘paternalistic
capitalism’’ up until the 1980s. That is, it provided a
host of lavish benefits including excellent health care,
child care, education and pensions, and ‘‘provided a
lifetime ladder of employment [with] all the stages of a
career laid out for people who were expected to stay
and to climb’’ (Sennett, 1998, p. 123).
Unfortunately, IBM miscalculated the growth of
the personal computer industry and as a result suffered massive financial losses in the early ‘90s. An
elaborate internal bureaucracy
The problem
IBM eventually returned to profitability, and stock
prices rose, at least for the short term. But that,
according to Richard Sennett, is the problem: our
focus has shifted to the short term. ‘‘[T]he average
length of time stocks have been held on British and
American exchanges has dropped 60% in the last
15 years. The market believes rapid market return is
best generated by rapid institutional change’’ (1998,
p. 23). The difficulty is that in today’s market,
conditions can change overnight, and a company
that is not able to respond to these changes to survive
The evolution of contemporary capitalism
The development of science that began in the
Renaissance, and the technology to which it gave
rise, paved the way for the industrial revolution.
This revolution created enormous wealth. Much of
it was initially concentrated in the hands of a few
industrialists, but the rise of labor unions and the
institution of labor laws such as governmentally
had proved immobilizing as the company was outmaneuvered by Bill Gate’s Microsoft. IBM also faced
stiff competition from Japanese and American upstarts.
In 1993, it began … to fashion itself into a competitive
corporate machine, and made an equally dramatic turn
around. It sought to replace the rigid hierarchical
structure of work with more flexible forms of organization, and with flexible production aimed at getting
more products more quickly to market (Sennett, 1998,
p. 123).
The Long Term
in the short term will not be around to worry about
how best to survive in the long run. Flexibility is
perceived as positive. Stock prices, Sennett observes,
‘‘of institutions in the course of reorganization
thereby often rise, as though any change is better
than continuing on as before. In the operation of
modern markets,’’ he continues,
disruption of organizations has become profitable.
While disruption may not be justifiable in terms of
productivity, the short-term returns to stockholders
provide a strong incentive to the powers of chaos
disguised by the seemingly assuring word ‘‘reengineering.’’ Perfectly viable institutions are gutted or
abandoned, capable employees are set adrift rather than
rewarded, simply because the organization must prove
to the market that it is capable of change (1998, p. 51).
The phenomenon of natural selection has become a
popular metaphor for understanding the workings of
the market.6 Organizations that can withstand rapid
change survive, it is believed, because they are better
adapted to dealing with today’s volatile markets than
those that cannot withstand such change. This way
of understanding market forces is undoubtedly part
of the popular appeal of the laissez-faire approach to
economics espoused by those of the Chicago school.
That is, governmental regulation of business
becomes superfluous. No matter how harsh the
market may seem, we all win, on this view, in the
long run because the companies that survive in
this competitive environment survive because they
are ideally adapted to meeting the needs of consumers.
Shortsightedness and the corrosion of culture
The beauty of using natural selection as a metaphor
for understanding the workings of the market is that
it appears to relieve those in business of the burden of
thinking about the long-term consequences of their
decisions. The future would appear to take care of
itself. This is appealing not simply because predicting
the long-term consequences of an action has
always been a complicated and thus often onerous
task, but because the speed at which technology is
now developing has necessitated unprecedented
focus on the short-term consequences of business
decisions.

Downsizing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996608684210527">
The volatility of contemporary markets has made
flexibility crucial to the survival of corporations.
Flexibility, argues Sennett, means, among other
things, a willingness to ‘‘reinvent’’ institutions. This
turns out to be what is more commonly known as
‘‘reengineering,’’ or more specifically, ‘‘downsizing.’’ This practice, by now so well established that it
requires no explanation, is carried out in the name of
increasing efficiency. Evidence suggests, however,
that ‘‘many, even most, reengineering efforts fail’’
(Sennett, 1998, p. 49). Studies conducted by the
American Management Association and the Wyatt
Companies reveal that ‘‘repeated downsizing produces ‘lower profits and declining worker productivity’’’(Sennett, 1998, p. 50). Downsizing reduces
productivity, at least in part, because it hurts morale.
Anthony Sampson, an English journalist who visited
IBM’s home offices in the mid-1990s, found,
according to Sennett,
social disorganization rife within the company, rather
than a reinvigorated work force. One official admitted, ‘‘There’s much more stress, domestic violence
and need for mental services – directly linked to
the layoffs. Even inside IBM the environment
has changed radically: they have great unease, without their security.’’7 People who had survived
behaved as though they lived on borrowed time,
feeling they had survived for no good reason (1998,
p. 125).
The deleterious effects of downsizing are mitigated in countries with stronger unions, more
stringent labor laws and more extensive social
welfare programs than those of the U.S. The
former tend to limit the scale of downsizing by
guaranteeing greater job security.8 The latter
tends to make being ‘‘downsized’’ a less frightening prospect since extensive social welfare programs mean losing one’s job is not attended by the
specter of economic destitution. There is little,
however, to mitigate the emotionally and socially
corrosive nature of downsizing in the U.S., where
employees can be fired at will and where losing one’s
job can involve the very real threat of economic
destitution. Yet downsizing continues to be a
popular ‘‘corrective’’ here despite its devastating
effects.

What drives downsizing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991338959677419">
Many theorists target greed as the source of what
appears to be the moral bankruptcy of contemporary
capitalism.9 Greed may well be partially responsible
for the inhumane face of the contemporary American marketplace. It is an oversimplification, however, to suggest that greed is entirely responsible.
‘‘Greed for money – for the sake of money alone,’’
writes Michael Lewis in The Money Culture,
‘‘requires years of practice to learn’’ (xiii–xiv). Greed
is thus clearly not the only driving force in contemporary American capitalism. Fear is also an
important force. The evidence, again, is that
downsizing is not ultimately good for the bottom
line. It would therefore be irrational to turn to
downsizing as a way of increasing profits in the long
term. Many companies must thus do it out of a fear
that it is necessary to survive in the short term. That
is, companies must fear that if they do not do
everything conceivable to increase the bottom line
in the short term, they will not be around for the
long term.
This is true not merely of corporations as a whole,
but of individuals within corporations. James William
Coleman observes, in The Criminal Elite, that many
white-collar criminals are driven by ‘‘the fear that
they will lose what they already have. Several studies
show,’’ he continues, ‘‘that illegal activities are more
common in firms that are doing poorly than in firms
that are making big profits’’ (1989, p. 204).
What are people afraid of ? They are afraid of
losing the economic struggle in this culture of
competition. They are afraid of being out competed
in a Darwinian sense. That is, they are afraid that if
they do not win the struggle in the short term, they
will not survive for the long term. The difficulty is
that this focus on the short term has numerous
negative consequences both for individuals and for
society as a whole.
Personal disruption
To survive in the short term, companies must be
flexible. The continual ‘‘reengineering’’ of corporations means no one’s job is safe. This has inadvertently increased the length of the average
working day. ‘‘The typical American,’’ observes
Robert Reich, now ‘‘works 350 more hours a year
than the typical European, more hours even the
notoriously industrious Japanese’’ (2000, p. 6).10
People are coming to work early and leaving late in
an effort to make themselves indispensable. Few
people are truly indispensable, however, and that
accounts, at least in part, for the frequency with
which people now change jobs, and even careers.
[T]he traditional career progressing step by step
through the corridors of one or two institutions is
withering; so is the development of a single set of skills
through the course of a working life. Today, a young
American with at least 2 years of college can expect to
change jobs at least 11 times during those 40 years of
labor (Sennett, 1998, p. 22).
Changing jobs often means relocating, uprooting
oneself from one community and one set of
coworkers to be transplanted to another community
and another set of coworkers. It means that our
connections to our neighbors and colleagues are
becoming increasingly tenuous. We have little
incentive to form lasting relationships with people
with whom we may be in contact for only a short
time and the increasing length of the work day
means we have little time to devote to sustaining the
few friendships, or commitments, we may succeed
in establishing.
Character, argues Sennett, ‘‘focuses on the longterm aspects of our emotional experience’’ (1998, p.
10). That is, character focuses on who we are beyond the shifting chaos of our immediate experiences. But who we are is more than the sum of our
choices. It is a product, in part, of our self-conceptions, of the stories we tell ourselves about the kinds
of people we are, who and what we care about, how
successful we have been in expressing that concern
and what we need to do to bring our lives into
conformity with our conceptions of the shape they
ought to have. These are our life narratives.
It is becoming increasingly difficult, however, for
people to construct coherent narratives of their lives,
to define themselves as individuals in a world characterized by constant change. Who are my neighbors? Who are my friends? Where do I call home?
What do I value? These questions are difficult for
people who move frequently and have little leisure
during which to develop interests outside of work.
The Long Term
Our conceptions of our roles within our immediate
families are diminished as the time we have to be
with our families is increasingly compromised. We
cannot even take refuge in our conceptions of ourselves as professionals: Am I in banking or insurance?
Well, I was in banking, but now I’m in insurance.
Our self-conceptions are dwindling to the bare
minimum we need to make sense of our experience:
‘‘I am a person doing what I have to do to survive in
the new economic market.’’ But even this explanation is unsatisfactory, because there is nothing
distinctively human about doing what one has to do
to survive. ‘‘I am a creature doing what it has to do
to survive.’’ That is how many of us conceive of
ourselves these days – i.e., as creatures doing what
they have to do to survive.
It is thus no surprise that the Darwinian metaphor
for the business world has become so popular. It is
‘‘survival of the fittest.’’11 We each struggle to be fitter
than our neighbors and coworkers, whom we have
come to view not as a source of companionship and
support, but as competition. As if this picture were
not bleak enough, the rapidly changing market means
we have no enduring picture of what would constitute ‘‘fitness.’’ An education used to provide a certain
assurance of economic success, but this is not true
anymore. No one can say with any certainty today
what kind of knowledge or skills will be in demand
tomorrow. This uncertainty begets fear, and fear can
erode positive moral qualities such as trust and loyalty
and personal integrity to the extent that we become
no better than the beasts in the Darwinian metaphor.
Social and cultural corrosion
It is not my purpose here to defend the ideal that
man is nobler than beasts. I want rather to point out
that the path on which we appear to be traveling
leads away not simply from higher ideals of the self,
but ultimately from civilization and thus from the
very conditions under which current economic life
is made possible. This is a fact that ought to attract
some attention, because even people who have long
since abandoned any concern for whether the way
they do business is morally defensible care about
whether they can continue to do business at all.
Hobbes believed that people were motivated by
two things – greed and the fear of death.12 It was the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998711">

<bodyText confidence="0.99777025">
latter, he believed, that eventually brought people
together to form societies. It dawned on everyone, if
we are to believe Hobbes’ account, that they would
be much better off individually if they agreed to stop
attacking each other and abide by some basic moral
principles such as truth telling, promise keeping and
respecting property.
The point is not whether Hobbes’s account of the
origin of civilization is correct. The point is that
even Hobbes, a figure often invoked to justify
morally reprehensible business practices,13 saw that
cohesive social units were impossible without some
kind of moral foundation (even if the foundation of
that foundation was self-interest).14 Yes, he believed
that people were motivated by greed. But even
Hobbes recognized that the lives of human beings, if
they were motivated by nothing else, would be
‘‘solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.’’
Wealth inequality
As business comes increasingly to see adherence to
basic moral principles as counterproductive, our lives
come increasingly to resemble life in Hobbes’s ‘‘state
of nature.’’ Many of us have come to accept the
‘‘solitary’’ part15 and perhaps, if we are to judge by
the yardsticks of things like infant mortality and
urban crime16 (including not merely the traditional
theft and muggings, but entirely new phenomena
such as school and office shootings and road rage),
the ‘‘nasty and brutish’’ part. Many, it could be argued, have even come to accept ‘‘short’’ lives to the
extent that they work themselves, despite repeated
warnings, into early graves.17 It appears that few of
us, however, and certainly none of the defenders of
contemporary American capitalism openly accept
the ‘‘poor’’ part of Hobbes’s description of life devoid of any concern for basic moral principles.
The irony, however, is that while we have created a
materialistic or ‘‘money culture,’’ real earnings for the
majority of Americans have been declining over the
past 25 years. ‘‘The brute facts,’’ observes Sennett,
of wealth inequality in the Anglo-American regime are
indeed staggering. The economist Simon Head has
calculated that for the bottom 80% of the American
working population, average weekly wages (adjusted
for inflation) fell by 18% from 1973 to 1995, while the
pay of the corporate elite rose 19% before taxes, and

M.G. Piety
66% after the tax accountants had worked their magic.18 Another economist, Paul Krugman, argues that
the top 1% of American wage earners more than
doubled their real incomes in the decade 1979–1989,
in comparison to a much lower rate of wealth accumulated in the decades before (1998, p. 54).19
The rich have been getting richer, but everyone else,
including most of the middle class, has been getting
poorer. This wealth inequality has even been cited
by the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank as ‘‘a
major threat to our society.’’20 Families have to have
two incomes now to support a standard of living that
used to be possible on one. But two careers means
less time for a personal life, less time for family and
friends. Indeed, we have fewer friends and smaller
families than we used to, and even they do not receive the attention they deserve. We have become
impoverished, in both a material and a spiritual
sense, in spite of ourselves.
Companies struggling to survive in an increasingly
hostile market environment bombard us with
advertising and ‘‘the message that possessions and the
wealth to buy them are the road to happiness’’
(Coleman, 1989, p. 210). The lack of meaningful
relationships and opportunities for moral, or spiritual, self-actualization creates a void in our lives that
we rush to fill with the immediate gratification of
material pleasures. We work furiously to support a
life we have been led to believe we will find fulfilling, but which we do not have time for, and then
find we could not afford it even it if we did.
Increasing conformity
There is another cultural consequence to the uncertainties that characterize contemporary American
capitalism. It is beginning to impose a kind of conformity on workers that threatens what has often
been seen as one of our culture’s greatest strengths –
its tolerance for individuality and thus originality.
There is, for example, little freedom of expression
now in the American workplace. The First Amendment guarantees one cannot be punished simply for
expressing one’s views, but it applies only to actions
by the government. It does not guarantee that one
will not lose one’s job for expressing them. American
employment law is based on the doctrine of
‘‘employment at will.’’ That means, with a few
exceptions such as race, gender or age, employees can
be fired for any reason an employer chooses. Add to
this fact the uncertainties of the market already described, and a minimalistic social welfare system, and
the ‘‘go along to get along’’ mentality takes hold like
never before.21
Even consulting, celebrated by many as ‘‘the acme
of flexible business behavior’’ (Sennett, 1998, p. 139)
imposes pressure to conform. A consultant is doubly
vulnerable because he is acting without the cushion
of benefits traditionally provided by the employer.
‘‘A consultant has to tack one way and then another
in response to the changing whims or thoughts of
those who pay’’ (Sennett, 1998, p. 19).
Contemporary American capitalism is thus not
merely corroding character in the specifically moral
sense. It is corroding it in the general sense as well in
that it is imposing forces of conformity that are stifling ‘‘[t]he qualities that distinguish one person from
another.’’22
White collar crime.
At this point, the poverty that characterizes contemporary American society, both literal and figurative, appears to have left the upper echelon of the
business world untouched. Indeed, the rich, as is
now widely acknowledged, are richer than they
have ever been before. There is another sense,
however, in which even the purported winners in
this system have become impoverished. They have
seen their own values diminished in that their
commitment to laissez-faire capitalism has caused
many to lose concern for the welfare of others in a
general sense, and even for obeying the law.
The laissez-faire theory of capitalism that came to
dominate both American economic theory and
official governmental policy in the last part of the
20th century taught us that we did not need to
concern ourselves with the moral consequences of
economic activity, that the market would eventually23 take optimal care of all its participants without
the need for any deliberate humanitarian intervention. Americans are bombarded with the message that
immediate gratification is the highest good, and they
are increasingly deprived of opportunities for experiences that would contradict this message. Deprive
them, as well, of any lasting assurances that they will
The Long Term
be able to continue to indulge in the kind of pleasures they have been led to believe make life meaningful, and we have the beginnings of the ultimately
self-destructive phenomenon of the criminal culture, or what Frederic L. Pryor refers to, in The Future
of U.S. Capitalism, as ‘‘mafia capitalism’’ (2002,
p. 11).
‘‘Criminal behavior,’’ explains Sutherland in
White Collar Crime, ‘‘is learned in association with
those who define such behavior favorably’’ (1949,
p. 234).24 ‘‘Those involved in business crimes,’’
explains Coleman in The Criminal Elite,
frequently justify their behavior by claiming that the
law itself is unnecessary or unjust. Business people
complain loudly about ‘‘government interference’’ in
their affairs, often using the ideology of laissez-faire
capitalism to point out what they consider to be
inappropriate statutes and regulations. According to
such beliefs, it is the law that causes harm to the public
and not the illegal activities of business. Given this
system of beliefs, a host of business crimes can easily be
justified (1998, p. 213).
Viewed through this lens, we have the frightening
prospect that Enron was not an anomaly. There is, in
fact, increasing evidence that it was not.25
Unraveling the social fabric
Sennett asserts that character ‘‘concerns personal
traits for which we seek to be valued by others’’
(1998, p. 10). It would be more accurate, however,
to say that it concerns the personal traits for which
we are, in fact, valued by others, not merely those for
which we seek to be valued by others. Character
concerns traits such as honesty, loyalty, sympathy,
self-discipline and judgment. A person who is dishonest, disloyal, unsympathetic, and unable to forgo
immediate gratification makes a very poor companion and, one could argue, a very poor partner in
a business transaction. Character, in the moral sense,
has traditionally been thought to be something good
in itself. It has been argued, however, that our
aversion to ‘‘immoral’’ people is pragmatic in origin, that ‘‘immoral’’ people are not well suited
to cooperative endeavors. But business is based
on cooperative endeavors. No cooperation, no
commerce and eventually, ‘‘no arts, no letters, no
society.’’

Contemporary American capitalism is corroding
character. The struggle merely to survive is making
people less honest, less loyal and less sympathetic26
and it is destroying their judgment in that it is
depriving them of opportunities to reflect on the
long-term consequences of their actions and on what
is really valuable and meaningful to them. This
process, if it is not halted, will eventually undermine
the cooperation and commitment that are necessary
to sustain contemporary economic life and our
culture more generally. Contemporary American
capitalism is dysfunctional.27 It is not merely ethically indefensible, it is ultimately self-destructive.
The road we are on is likely to lead to ‘‘mafia capitalism’’ and to end in Hobbesian anarchy.28
The solution
Adopting the long-term view
Contemporary American capitalism is shortsighted.
What we need is a paradigm of capitalism that takes a
more long-term approach to the market. One fact,
however, about contemporary economic life seems
incontrovertible. The speed at which technology is
developing means that markets will continue to be
volatile. That means flexibility will continue to be
important to the survival of both individuals and
businesses. So flexibility is here to stay. The question
is: How is it possible to take a long-term approach to
the market that will still allow the requisite focus on
the short term? The answer is not a return to the
rigidity of old-style corporate paternalism, but an
approach to flexibility that will minimize, if not
eliminate, the evils that have come to be associated
with its American instantiation.
Learning from others
‘‘Questions about flexibility,’’ observes Sennett,
‘‘address matters of political economy proper, and do
find contrasting formulations today in America and
in parts of Europe’’ (1998, p. 52). Many European
countries have adopted an approach to flexibility
that appears to respond well both to today’s rapidly
changing market and to the long-term needs of their
populations. We can learn from their example.

Living comfortably with risk
Flexibility refers to the ability of organizations to
withstand rapid change. Change is associated with
risk. If, however, risk is to be imposed not merely on
those who by nature deal well with it, but also upon
the mass of humanity that does not, the answer to
the evils associated with such an imposition would
appear to involve making risk less risky.
Much of what makes risk, in this context, so
frightening is its specific interpretation as economic
insecurity. But if flexible capitalism begets wealth, as
its proponents argue, then economic insecurity
would appear to be an unnecessary evil of flexibility.
The answer to eliminating this evil would appear to
be socking some of this wealth away to form a safety
net for those whose roles in the new system do not
provide them this luxury. Government, observes
Sennett, ‘‘can give people something like the tensile
strength of a tree, so that individuals do not break
under the force of change’’ (1998, p. 53).
This is exactly what the governments of many
countries are doing. The Scandinavian countries, as
well as countries as diverse as France, Germany, Italy
and Japan have adopted what the French banker Michel Albert calls the ‘‘Rhine’’ model of political
economy. This model, observes Sennett, ‘‘has existed
for nearly a century in the Netherlands, Germany and
France: in it labor unions and management share
power, and the welfare apparatus of the government
provides a comparatively tightly woven safety net of
pensions, education, and health benefits’’ (1998, p. 53).
Laws in Europe often make it difficult to fire
employees. This inclines many companies to view
employees as a kind of investment an asset that can
be improved but not discarded. Employees in many
European countries have a voice in the management
of the firms for which they work.29 This means,
according to Marshal and Tucker in Thinking for a
Living, that
they are far more willing than American workers to
take the long-term view, forgoing short-term benefits
for the long range. That makes it possible for management, in turn, to concentrate on the long term
too. Both management and labor are in this way
significantly isolated from some of the short-term
pressures that operate on American employers. (1992,
p. 48).
Some people would object that much of Europe is
effectively socialist rather than capitalist. ‘‘It is certainly not laissez-faire capitalism,’’ observe Marshall
and Tucker, ‘‘for government involvement goes
well beyond the management of macroeconomic
policy. But it is not socialism either, if by socialism
is meant the ownership and control of capital and
industry by the community as a whole through
government’’ (1992, p. 58). Ownership of capital in
most European countries is overwhelmingly private,
and ‘‘competition in open markets is very intense’’
(Marshall and Tucker, 1992, p. 58).
‘‘The Rhine model’’ of capitalism can be as flexible, it appears, as the American model. ‘‘Northern
Italy, for instance’’ observes Sennett
is quite ‘‘Rhinish’’ in its mix of government and private enterprise and also flexible in changing quickly
and adeptly to changing market demand. In some
forms of high-tech manufacturing, the thick Rhinish
network of shifting associations can indeed be more
responsive to consumer demand than its neoliberal
cousin [U.S. capitalism] locked in dubious battle
against government ‘‘interference’’ and bent on annihilating its competitors (1998, p. 53).
So this European form of capitalism is at least as
flexible, if not more so, than the American form, yet
it protects ordinary workers from the harsher economic consequences that are associated in the U.S.
with flexibility. Generous unemployment compensation and state pensions help to take much of the
sting out of the loss of a job or the change of a
career. Laws also restrict overtime, mandate extended vacations,30 paid maternity, paternity and
family leaves, as well as a host of services including
affordable, if not free, health care, childcare and
education. There is still a certain amount of uncertainty, but basic needs will always be met, and there
is time for friends and family.31
Not surprisingly, business in these countries tends
to be less cutthroat and more cooperative than it is
in the U.S. Coworkers are inclined to see each other
as sources of support rather than competition. Subordinate employees are more likely to be candid
with managers, which both encourages innovation and increases efficiency. Employee morale also
tends to be better, which improves productivity.32
In fact, France, Germany and Japan have routinely

(Early) death or taxes
This security, Sennett observes however, comes at
a price, and that price, in addition to high taxes,
appears to be high unemployment. Contemporary
American laissez-faire capitalism ‘‘has few political
restraints on wealth inequality but full employment,
while the welfare networks of the Rhinish states,
which are more sensitive to ordinary workers, are a
drag on its creation. Which evil you tolerate,’’
according to Sennett (i.e., the evil of inequitable wealth distribution or the evil of high unemployment), ‘‘depends on which goal you pursue’’
(1998, p. 55).
It is misleading, however, to suggest that the
goods and evils of these two forms of political
economy are roughly equal. Let us look for a minute
at these purported goods and evils. The kind of
wealth inequality that characterizes the U.S. today is
an evil. Even its defenders seldom try to justify it as
good in itself. It is good, they argue, because it is a
means to the end of the creation of wealth in general, because it encourages entrepreneurship, which
provides jobs, which, in turn, spreads greater wealth
throughout the population. That is, the huge discrepancies in wealth in the U.S. are defended as a
means to eventually making those lower down on
the economic ladder better off than they would have
been in an initially more egalitarian system such as
those in the Rhinish states.
The difficulty with this account is that most
Americans, as we saw, have not benefitted from
these inequalities; they have suffered from them.
That is, the inequality is due not merely to the rich
getting richer. Most of the participants in the
American form of flexible capitalism have become
poorer, both in money and in spirit, in the last
25 years even as the rich have become richer. They
have jobs, it is true (at least many have jobs), but
those jobs pay less, in real terms, than they used to,
offer less security and leave less time for a life outside
of work – for friends, for family, for taking an active
role in one’s community.
Taxes are higher in the Rhinish states, but so are
wages, 34 so the burden is not so onerous as it might

appear35 and people get a great deal for the money
they pay in taxes. They get cheap, if not free, health
care, childcare and education. They get time for a
life outside work, and the incalculable luxury of
taking a more active role in the lives of their children
than most Americans are able to. They get cleaner,
safer, speedier systems of public transportation and
cleaner, safer cities.36
Mitigating the evil of unemployment
Many of the ‘‘Rhinish’’ states of Northern Europe
have higher unemployment than does the U.S.
What is seldom explained when this ‘‘evil’’ is cited
against the defenders of the welfare state is that it is
not nearly so bad to be unemployed in a country
with extensive social welfare programs as it is to be
unemployed in a country without them. No one
need worry about going hungry or going without
adequate health care, and there are plenty of educational and cultural opportunities for those who are
not working. I don’t mean to suggest here that the
Rhinish states have magically transformed unemployment into a delightfully extended holiday.
People like working. Even in the Scandinavian
countries, which have the most extensive social
welfare programs in the world, unemployment is
seen by most who experience it as a challenge,
something that has to be faced and dealt with, not
something to be savored. 37
Americans have heard now for years that the fewer
controls we have on business, the better. An objective assessment, however, of the pros and cons of the
American, or laissez-faire, model of capitalism and
the Rhine, or ‘‘social market’’ model,38 which involves more controls, make the latter appear a clear
winner. A comparison of crime statistics alone would
indicate that these societies have got something right
that we have gotten wrong.39 That many Americans
fail to appreciate this is very likely because they have
been persuaded by ‘‘free market’’ rhetoric.
Some might argue that part of the foundation of
contemporary American capitalism is how we define
the common good, that we think it is good for most
people to have to make huge personal sacrifices to
succeed economically. It seems more likely, however, that most Americans, with their limited
experience of the variety of forms capitalism can

take, are simply unaware that such sacrifices should
not be necessary in an already wealthy and industrialized country.40
Bringing back values
The successes of the 20th century were, one could
argue, substantially a result of the increasing role
government came to play in the lives of individuals
and in business. What could we have achieved
without minimum wage or child labor laws, without
laws concerning occupational safety, limiting the
length of the workday and mandating that employers
provide health insurance? What could we have
achieved without anti-trust laws and laws governing
banking and the exchange of securities? We have
come as far as we have because we have been
standing on the shoulders of the giants whose values
led them to lobby for those reforms.
American exceptionalism
Despite the fact that many Americans confuse capitalism as it operates in this country with capitalism
in the abstract, American capitalism is so unlike
capitalism in other OECD nations that it falls under
the heading of what scholars refer to as ‘‘American
exceptionalism.’’41 Edwin Schur, Coleman observes,
‘‘has argued that the United States puts greater
emphasis upon competitive individualism than can
be accounted for solely on the basis of its capitalist
economic system: ‘It is difficult not to conclude that
American society has what might be termed capitalism with a vengeance’’’ (1998, p. 210).42
But why is American capitalism so unlike capitalism in other parts of the world? I suggested in the
preceding section that Americans might actually
believe it is good for people to have to make huge
personal sacrifices to succeed economically. It would
be unfair to say that this attitude characterizes all
Americans. There is no question, however, that
there is a strong Calvinist strain in American culture.43 It would appear that it is this strain that gives
a harder edge to the Protestant work ethic that it has
even in the predominantly Protestant countries of
Northern Europe, where Protestantism sits on a
much older foundation of Catholic humanism. The
oldest and most fundamental spiritual and ideological
foundation of American culture is Protestant or,
more specifically Calvinist.44 On this view, material
success is associated with spiritual election.
Not surprisingly, the struggles for economic survival that characterize American capitalism are seen
by many Americans ‘‘as a fair battle in which the most
capable and the hardest working individuals emerge
victorious. This belief in turn becomes an important
legitimation for social inequality, as it implies that the
poor deserve their inferior position because they are
lazy or incompetent’’ (Coleman, 1989, p. 205).45
Recent events, however, are beginning to change
American attitudes toward the economically disadvantaged as well as toward the market in general.
There are many newly poor, and there will be many
more as the result of the Enron and WorldCom
disasters as well as other similar disasters such as that
at Procter and Gamble in 2000.46 Popular contempt
in these instances is reserved not for those who saw
their retirement account evaporate in a matter of
days, but for those ‘‘captains of industry’’ who
willfully brought about these debacles but will
themselves very likely emerge relatively unscathed.47
Misplaced metaphors for the market
‘‘Darwinism,’’ assert Breton and Largent in The Soul
of Economics, ‘‘rules the marketplace’’ (1991, p. 13).
Many people believe this is a good thing because
competition, they argue, will ensure that the businesses that survive will be ideally adapted to supply
the needs of consumers. Everybody wins!
It is becoming clear to an increasing number of
Americans that an unregulated market does not
automatically work out to the advantage of those
most deserving (let alone to the advantage of everyone). Competition has become so intense that some
people feel compelled to do things that are unethical,
illegal or both, simply to survive. They are afraid of
being out competed in a Darwinian sense. They are
afraid that if they do not win the struggle in the short
term, they will not survive for the long term.
People seem confusedly to believe that only the
winner in an economic competition gets to survive.
This is undoubtedly based on a misunderstanding of
natural selection whereby it is interpreted to ensure
optimal adaptation to the environment. That is,
creatures, or corporations, that are not optimally
adapted will be out competed by those that are and
The Long Term
thus become extinct. Natural selection does not,
however, ensure optimal adaptation to the environment. All natural selection says is that organisms that
survive in an environment must be minimally adapted
to that environment. They may well exist along side
organisms that are better adapted to that same
environment. One does not have to be the winner
to survive an economic competition. ‘‘Placing,’’ in
the racing sense, is quite sufficient. ‘‘Showing,’’ in
fact, is often sufficient. The market actually tolerates
a fairly broad spectrum of economic success. That
one is the least profitable company of a particular
sort does not necessarily mean one cannot continue
to survive. It does not even necessarily mean one’s
position is more precarious than that of more profitable companies. Highly profitable companies
sometimes go belly up with little warning. Recent
experience ought to make that point clear.
We have come to think of competition as a kind of
panacea for a variety of social and economic ills. But
competition in the marketplace, like competition in
nature, is neither bad nor good. It can be good if, for
example, it encourages innovation, but it can be bad if
it drives either creatures or corporations to behavior
that will be destructive in the long term. Natural
selection does not actually guarantee that anything will
survive in a highly competitive environment. Whole
populations can be driven, or indeed can drive
themselves, to extinction. If we are going to use natural selection as a metaphor for understanding the
contemporary American marketplace, we would do
well to appreciate what it actually implies.
The myth of historical progress. Hobbes thought that life
in a state of nature was ‘‘solitary, poor, nasty, brutish
and short.’’ It is indeed commonly believed that the
historical development has been progressive not
merely in a technological sense, but in a moral sense as
well. Evidence suggests, however, that human beings
have always been social creatures and that the earliest
human societies were even more egalitarian than the
welfare states of contemporary northern Europe.48
We tend to think of history as progressive, yet
people in earlier periods understood it as cyclical or
even regressive.49 The truth appears to be that historical development, like evolutionary change, is neither necessarily progressive nor necessarily regressive.
It is just one thing happening after another. ‘‘Evolution
itself,’’ observes J.B. Bury in The Idea of Progress,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997904">

<bodyText confidence="0.998583565217392">
does not necessarily mean, applied to society, the
movement of man toward a desirable goal. It is a
neutral scientific conception, compatible either with
optimism or with pessimism. According to different
estimates it may appear to be a cruel sentence or a
guarantee of steady amelioration. And it has been
actually interpreted in both ways (1955, pp. 335–336).
Even the supposition that evolution or historical
development is progressive in that it is at least always
in the direction of increasing complexity is flawed.
Environmental changes, both sudden and gradual,
could well favor simpler over more complex organisms. Hence the oft-stated prediction that cockroaches will survive human beings. Progress in any
meaningful sense is possible only through deliberate
human intervention in the course of natural events.
Pryor uses a medical metaphor at the beginning of
his book, The Future of U.S. Capitalism. He states in
the first chapter that his ‘‘primary purpose is to
diagnose, not to prescribe. In economics as in
medicine,’’ he continues however, ‘‘diagnosis is
necessary before the proper remedies can be considered. Pryor predicts a bleak future for U.S. capitalism. ‘‘Fortunately,’’ he observes in the last
paragraph of the book, ‘‘the future depends on many
factors, of which deliberate human intervention is
one of the most important’’ (2002, p. 367).

‘‘Success,’’ Reich asserts in his book, The Future of
Success, ‘‘depends on our spiritual grounding, the
richness of our relationships, the structure of our
families and the character of our communities’’
(2000, p. 248). But these are precisely the things that
are being eroded by contemporary American laissezfaire capitalism, the inherent uncertainties of which
drive us to jettison our friends, families, communities, even our personal integrity in the struggle to
survive. Sennett is right to point out the shortsightedness of this approach. We are surviving for now,
but how long can we, as individuals, endure this kind
of strain and what is it doing to the culture of which
we have been so proud?
We need, as a people, to examine our current
system of political economy and determine what
changes are necessary to help survive and thrive in
the long term. This must not, exhorts Reich, be

solely an economic conversation. It is more fundamentally a moral one. We are not mere instruments of
the new economy. We are not slaves to its technological trends. And we should not misdirect the blame
for its less desirable, more worrisome consequences. As
citizens, we have the power to arrange the new
economy to suit our needs, and in so doing, to
determine the shape of our emerging civilization
(2000, p. 250).
The contemporary American paradigm of laissez-faire
capitalism is dysfunctional. It has given rise to more
anomalies than answers. If it is supposed to be the most
effective way to facilitate the spread of wealth, why has
wealth become increasingly concentrated in the hands
of a very few? If it is supposed to improve the quality of
people’s lives, why do so few people feel their lives
have improved and why is our society increasingly
characterized by crime and violence?50
Capitalism for a new millennium
It is time we start questioning the dogma that the evils
of this system will disappear of themselves. When a
disease, observed a famous Scandinavian, is ‘‘allowed
to choose its own treatment, …it waxes and
thrives.’’51 That is not to say, however, that we
should abandon capitalism alltogether. That would be
to cure the disease by killing the patient.52 No, it is
time for us to realize that ours is not the only form of
capitalism.
The American version of the ‘‘free market,’’
Robert Reich observes in The Future of Success,
doesn’t exist in a state of nature. It wasn’t created by God
on any of the first six days, nor is it maintained by divine
will. It is a human artifact, the shifting sum of a set of
judgments about individual rights and responsibilities.
What’s mine? What’s yours’’ What’s ours … [What’s
important? What matters?] (2000, pp. 234–235).
‘‘The answers,’’ he continues
are not found in logic or analysis alone. Different cultures, at different times, answer them differently. The
answers depend on the values a society professes, the
weight it places on solidarity, prosperity, tradition, piety.
As a culture accumulates its answers to these questions, it
creates its version of the market. To the extent that
political rhetoric frames the issue as one grand choice –
between government and the market – it befogs our
view of the series of choices about the wisest and fairest
of an endless set of alternative ways to structure the rules
of ownership and exchange (2000, p. 235).
If government in the U.S. is to take a greater role
in regulating business and more generally in facilitating a better quality of life for all citizens, then it
is the citizens themselves who must provide
the values that will change the face of government and thus of America. A radical example is
the ‘‘Social Responsibility Amendment’’ sponsored
by the Tikkun Community, a nonsectarian religious
group working for positive social change.53 The
proposed amendment would require ‘‘[e]very corporation doing business in the United States with an
income above $20 million …[to] receive a new
corporate charter once every 20 years, which will
only be granted to corporations that prove (to a jury
of citizens) that they have a powerful record of social
responsibility’’ (Tikkun, May/June 2002).
Americans have been encouraged to think
that the official separation of church and state
means their religious convictions should affect
only their activities in the private sphere, not in the
public or political sphere. We give readily to charities that help the poor, but we fail to push for
welfare reforms that would be far more effective
than any private charity ever could be in meeting the
needs of the economically disadvantaged. We are
appalled at the apparent moral bankruptcy of people
in business, but rather that pushing for tighter governmental regulation of business, we persist in what
is, at this point, the clearly irrational belief that these
problems will take care of themselves.
Every spiritual tradition has values. Those values
that resonate with the greatest number of people in a
society ought properly to influence the policies of
that state. The great fact/value distinction that came
to characterize modernism appears to have frightened many Americans away from the public advocation of any values but crass materialism.
Materialism is indeed a value, however, just as the
failure to make a decision is a decision. It is just that
it is a very impoverished value. We have seen
something of the havoc it can wreak when it is not
accompanied by other values such as respect for the
inherent dignity and quality of life of all human
beings.
The Long Term
Conclusion
Part of American exceptionalism as observed, for example, by Goethe is that Americans are not weighed
down by ‘‘useless memories’’ (1825, p. 739)54 as are
so many Europeans. Indeed, the United States has
been referred to as ‘‘the country of the perpetual
present tense’’ (Sante, 1996, p. 67). To prefer present
goods, however, to long-term goods is irrational.
Such preferences, as Hobbes observed, can give rise
to many ‘‘unforeseen evils’’ (Hobbes, 1642, p. 48)
This is something, one could argue, that people in
older parts of the world, where memories are longer,
have a better grasp of than do Americans.
The weight of memory can drag one down and it
is undoubtedly part of American exceptionalism in
the positive sense that Americans tend not to be
dragged down by the ‘‘blight of useless memories and
senseless fights’’ (Goethe, 1825, p. 739).55 Some
memories are useful though. If we have no memory,
we cannot learn from our experience. Memory can
weigh one down in the positive sense that it can
provide an anchor in the turbulent seas of the contemporary market. We need to remember how
increasing controls on business throughout the first
part of the 20th century improved the quality of life
in this country. We need to expand our focus from
surviving until the next paycheck or the next quarter
to thriving into the next decade and beyond.

This qualification of ‘‘eventually’’ is, in the words of
Søren Kierkegaard, ‘‘something both to laugh at and to
weep over.’’ That is, even if it were true (and I will argue

‘‘A poll of 3,123 excellent high school students listed in
Who’s Who Among American High School Students found
that 80% of the students said they do not think cheating is a
big deal (Chicago Tribune, December 5, 1999, Sec. 13, p.
5). A national survey of 3,600 college students at 23
colleges revealed that one in six college students had lied
on a re´sume´, job application, or during a job interview;
that two out of five had lied to a boss and a third had lied to
a customer during the past year; and that one out of five
admitted to cheating on an exam (Washington Post National
Weekly Edition, December 7–13, 1992, p. 36). A national
public opinion poll of citizens found that three of
four believed the country’s values and morals are in
serious decline and nearly two-thirds said they are
dissatisfied with the ‘honesty standards of behavior of
people in this country’ (Washington Post National Weekly
Edition, September 21, 1998, p. 10)’’ (Johannesen, 2002,

See Sennett (1998, p. 50 and 151). It might be
objected that part of the reason these countries outpaced
the U.S. from 1950 until approximately 1970 was that
they were recovering from the devastation of WWII.
This fails to explain, however, why they continued to
outpace us in productivity growth after 1970.

Denmark, for example, has the highest taxes in

Sennett’s failure to appreciate this may be part of the
reason he provides no answer to the question of how we
might avoid the evils of contemporary Anglo-American
capitalism. He acknowledges that it fails to meet the inner
needs of the people it purportedly serves. ‘‘What political
programs follow from those inner needs,’’ he concludes
however, ‘‘I simply don’t know’’ (1998, p. 148). This
resignation is strange when a careful reader, I will argue,
can find the answer within the pages of Sennett’s own
book.

See note 3 above. It is sometimes argued that the most
successful and talented citizens of these social welfare
states will eventually be lured away by countries such as
the U.S. that have lower taxes (see, for example, Reich,
2000, p. 80) and that these states will thus have to lower
their taxes to prevent brain drain. This argument seems
irrefutable to most Americans, whose lack of economic
security and eroded connection to place has taught them
to ‘‘go where the money is.’’ Most Europeans, however,
have much stronger connections to their communities
than do Americans and are thus reluctant to relocate
simply for money. Danes, for example, have effectively
been raising taxes since 1994 by gradually disallowing
certain tax exemptions (see, for example, Hansen, 2001).
This appears to have had little effect, however, on the
purported Danish ‘‘brain drain.’’ Part of the pull of
community felt by most Europeans is historical. They
have a stronger connection to place, one could argue,
because most of them have been in one place longer (i.e.,
for more generations) than have most Americans. This is
undoubtedly true. What is also true, however, is that the
social-economic systems of many European countries
have allowed their citizens to maintain this connection to
place, while ours has eroded what connection was
beginning to develop.

Many Americans seem unaware, in fact, that even in
this country capitalism has not always had such an
inhuman face. Pryor explains ignorance of the changing
faces of economic systems are a result partly of the
complexity of these systems and partly ‘‘due to the passage
of time and the isolation of one generation from the
experience of another – grandchildren,’’ he explains,
‘‘usually have little knowledge of the concrete circumstances of how their grand parents lived’’ (Pryor, 2002, p.
16).

It may seem contentious to claim that someone who
may be forced to pay millions of dollars in fines and
perhaps even serve time in prison is unscathed. To those,
however, who are facing the very real threat of economic
destitution upon retirement, someone who can pay
millions of dollars in fines and still have millions of dollars
left over and who if he serves time in prison it will very
likely be short and in a relatively luxurious minimum
security institution, would appear to be getting off very
lightly indeed.

Defenders of contemporary American capitalism argue
that crime has actually gone down in the last few years.
Pryor notes, however, that part of the reason for the
reduced crime rate is that the rate of incarceration has gone
up. ‘‘If the incarceration rate had remained at its 1980
level, so that many more potential criminals were at large
and committing one crime a month, then both the FBI
and the victimization rates would have risen steadily from
1980 onward’’ (Pryor, 2002, p. 220). The U.S., reports
The Economist, ‘‘now has 700 people out of every 100,000
under lock and key, five times the proportion in Britain,
the toughest sentencer in Western Europe’’ (2002).
Putting people in prison is a short-sighted solution to
reducing crime. It may create the appearance of a
harmonious society, but like painting over rust, it will
only exacerbate the problem in the long run. The majority
of those currently incarcerated will, after all, one day
return to the streets.

But two careers means less time for a personal life, less time for family and friends. Indeed, we have fewer friends and smaller families than we used to, and even they do not receive the attention they deserve. We have become impoverished, in both a material and a spiritual sense, in spite of ourselves. Companies struggling to survive in an increasingly hostile market environment bombard us with advertising and ‘‘the message that possessions and the wealth to buy them are the road to happiness’’ (Coleman, 1989, p. 210). The lack of meaningful relationships and opportunities for moral, or spiritual, self-actualization creates a void in our lives that we rush to fill with the immediate gratification of material pleasures. We work furiously to support a life we have been led to believe we will find fulfilling, but which we do not have time for, and then find we could not afford it even it if we did. Increasing conformity There is another cultural consequence to the uncertainties that characterize contemporary American capitalism.

Not surprisingly, the struggles for economic survival that characterize American capitalism are seen by many Americans ‘‘as a fair battle in which the most capable and the hardest working individuals emerge victorious. This belief in turn becomes an important legitimation for social inequality, as it implies that the poor deserve their inferior position because they are lazy or incompetent’’ (Coleman, 1989, p. 205).45 Recent events, however, are beginning to change American attitudes toward the economically disadvantaged as well as toward the market in general. There are many newly poor, and there will be many more as the result of the Enron and WorldCom disasters as well as other similar disasters such as that at Procter and Gamble in 2000.46 Popular contempt in these instances is reserved not for those who saw their retirement account evaporate in a matter of days, but for those ‘‘captains of industry’’ who willfully brought about these debacles but will themselves very likely emerge relative</context>

It is just that it is a very impoverished value. We have seen something of the havoc it can wreak when it is not accompanied by other values such as respect for the inherent dignity and quality of life of all human beings. The Long Term Conclusion Part of American exceptionalism as observed, for example, by Goethe is that Americans are not weighed down by ‘‘useless memories’’ (1825, p. 739)54 as are so many Europeans. Indeed, the United States has been referred to as ‘‘the country of the perpetual present tense’’ (Sante, 1996, p. 67). To prefer present goods, however, to long-term goods is irrational. Such preferences, as Hobbes observed, can give rise to many ‘‘unforeseen evils’’ (Hobbes, 1642, p. 48) This is something, one could argue, that people in older parts of the world, where memories are longer, have a better grasp of than do Americans. The weight of memory can drag one down and it is undoubtedly part of American exceptionalism in the positive sense that Americans tend not to be dragged down by the ‘‘blight of useless memories and senseless fights’’ (Goethe, 1825, p. 739).55 Some memories are useful thoug</context>

Sennett, using IBM as his point of departure, provides an excellent account of what happened to many large corporations during this period. I will thus rely heavily upon Sennett’s account in the first part of this paper. IBM had practiced a kind of ‘‘paternalistic capitalism’’ up until the 1980s. That is, it provided a host of lavish benefits including excellent health care, child care, education and pensions, and ‘‘provided a lifetime ladder of employment [with] all the stages of a career laid out for people who were expected to stay and to climb’’ (Sennett, 1998, p. 123). Unfortunately, IBM miscalculated the growth of the personal computer industry and as a result suffered massive financial losses in the early ‘90s. An elaborate internal bureaucracy The problem IBM eventually returned to profitability, and stock prices rose, at least for the short term. But that, according to Richard Sennett, is the problem: our focus has shifted to the short term. ‘‘[T]he average length of time stocks have been held on British and American exchanges has dropped 60% in the last 15 years. The market believes rapid market return is best generated by rapid institutional</context>

IBM also faced stiff competition from Japanese and American upstarts. In 1993, it began … to fashion itself into a competitive corporate machine, and made an equally dramatic turn around. It sought to replace the rigid hierarchical structure of work with more flexible forms of organization, and with flexible production aimed at getting more products more quickly to market (Sennett, 1998, p. 123). The Long Term in the short term will not be around to worry about how best to survive in the long run. Flexibility is perceived as positive. Stock prices, Sennett observes, ‘‘of institutions in the course of reorganization thereby often rise, as though any change is better than continuing on as before. In the operation of modern markets,’’ he continues, disruption of organizations has become profitable. While disruption may not be justifiable in terms of productivity, the short-term returns to stockholders provide a strong incentive to the powers of chaos disguised by the seemingly </context>

Flexibility, argues Sennett, means, among other things, a willingness to ‘‘reinvent’’ institutions. This turns out to be what is more commonly known as ‘‘reengineering,’’ or more specifically, ‘‘downsizing.’’ This practice, by now so well established that it requires no explanation, is carried out in the name of increasing efficiency. Evidence suggests, however, that ‘‘many, even most, reengineering efforts fail’’ (Sennett, 1998, p. 49). Studies conducted by the American Management Association and the Wyatt Companies reveal that ‘‘repeated downsizing produces ‘lower profits and declining worker productivity’’’(Sennett, 1998, p. 50). Downsizing reduces productivity, at least in part, because it hurts morale. Anthony Sampson, an English journalist who visited IBM’s home offices in the mid-1990s, found, according to Sennett, social disorganization rife within the company, rather than a reinvigorated work force. One official admitted, ‘‘There’s much more stress, domestic violence and need for mental services – directly l</context>
<context position="15935" citStr="Sennett, 1998" startWordPosition="2525" endWordPosition="2526">’’ (2000, p. 6).10 People are coming to work early and leaving late in an effort to make themselves indispensable. Few people are truly indispensable, however, and that accounts, at least in part, for the frequency with which people now change jobs, and even careers. [T]he traditional career progressing step by step through the corridors of one or two institutions is withering; so is the development of a single set of skills through the course of a working life. Today, a young American with at least 2 years of college can expect to change jobs at least 11 times during those 40 years of labor (Sennett, 1998, p. 22). Changing jobs often means relocating, uprooting oneself from one community and one set of coworkers to be transplanted to another community and another set of coworkers. It means that our connections to our neighbors and colleagues are becoming increasingly tenuous. We have little incentive to form lasting relationships with people with whom we may be in contact for only a short time and the increasing length of the work day means we have little time to devote to sustaining the few friendships, or commitments, we may succeed in establishing. Character, argues Sennett, ‘‘focuses on th</context>

It does not guarantee that one will not lose one’s job for expressing them. American employment law is based on the doctrine of ‘‘employment at will.’’ That means, with a few exceptions such as race, gender or age, employees can be fired for any reason an employer chooses. Add to this fact the uncertainties of the market already described, and a minimalistic social welfare system, and the ‘‘go along to get along’’ mentality takes hold like never before.21 Even consulting, celebrated by many as ‘‘the acme of flexible business behavior’’ (Sennett, 1998, p. 139) imposes pressure to conform. A consultant is doubly vulnerable because he is acting without the cushion of benefits traditionally provided by the employer. ‘‘A consultant has to tack one way and then another in response to the changing whims or thoughts of those who pay’’ (Sennett, 1998, p. 19). Contemporary American capitalism is thus not merely corroding character in the specifically moral sense. It is corroding it in the general sense as well in that it is imposing forces of conformity that are stifling ‘‘[t]he qualities that distinguish one person from another.’’22 White collar c</context>
