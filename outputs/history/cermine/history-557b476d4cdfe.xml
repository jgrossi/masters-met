        <p>The overarching question of this article is how can we develop a critical understanding of the social place of highways and automobility in the case of a non-capitalist European context such as socialist Albania? Socialism was a period of modernisation for Albania. Part of this modernisation project was the production of a modern built environment, especially infrastructures and urban spaces. Within this context during socialism thousands of miles of new roads were constructed in the country. The remarkably limited use of roads, combined with their systematic building and maintenance, kept this infrastructure's materiality in a relatively good condition for many decades. Since the early 1990s, though, the end of the regime has signified a period of booming mobility and automobility. Postsocialism and the wider context of neoliberalism have been marked by state withdrawal from many of its previous roles, and the maintenance of basic infrastructures has become increasingly dependent on international aid. Nevertheless, the roads are currently being socially reappropriated and reconfigured, as people embrace automobility, which was a very limited practice during socialism. This article explores the kind of socio-material relationships that road construction and the roads themselves generated in socialist Albania and how these are linked to postsocialist spatial practices.</p>

      <p>A celebrated postsocialist anecdote suggests that ‘socialism was the longest and most
painful road from capitalism to capitalism’ (Verdery 1996, p. vii). In the case of
Albania this assertion was materialised very literally, as the great majority of
Albanian citizens – between 1945 and 1990 – were forced or volunteered to create their
socialist homeland by building many km of new roads and resurfacing existing ones.
According to the doctrines of scientific socialism such personal involvement in
public works would lead to new socio-material relationships and consequently to an
emergence of new socialist human subjects. So, Albanian people did not only
participate in the production of modern infrastructure, but also in the rest of the Albanian
socialist modernisation project, which included the collective construction of their
own socialist subjectivity. In this framework, the highways built during socialism in
Albania must be seen as one of the most emblematic and symbolically loaded
projects of the regime. But more importantly road construction has to be perceived as a
key measure of social engineering, since – in a materialist manner – what was
primarily created via the production of road materiality were new human subjectivities.</p>
      <p>If the materialism of scientific socialism advocates the necessity of novel material
infrastructures in order to move towards a new communist social formation, it is also
the case that a rather romantic but celebrated trend of Marxist materialist thought,
based on the other side of the cold war divide, were not big fans of motor-roads.
They were mostly unhappy for a similar reason, namely due to the sociocultural
formations emerging out of the new materialities and infrastructures of daily life. A
good example of such authors is Henri Lefebvre, who considered motorways as the
archetypal spaces produced for the domination of society and the environment (1991
[1974], pp. 124–125, p. 165). Harvey (1990) also draws attention to the political
significance of the highway systems for late capitalism’s urban growth. A few years
before Harvey, Virilio (1974) described modernity as the regime and the rule of the
roads (dromocracy) and referred to the city of Paris as being in a permanent state of
siege by its peripheral highway with its ceaseless flow of cars. (2004[2005], p. 3).
Already since the 1960s some of the most radical thinkers of the continent such as
the Situationists, were explicitly paving the way for the critique of highways and
automobility. The academic offspring of this wave articulated their critiques not
longer after Debord (1967 [1994], p. 123) stated that: ‘The dictatorship of the
automobile – the pilot product of the first stage of commodity abundance – has left its
mark on the landscape with the dominance of freeways, which tear up the old urban
centres and promote an ever-wider dispersal’. Perhaps within this tradition we have
to consider Marc Augé’s perception of motor-roads as exemplary of non-place:
spaces which lack social significance (1995, pp. 73–74, p. 100, p. 106, p. 118).</p>
      <p>The major concern of the aforementioned Marxist studies of modern spatialities
is speed, the so-called time–space compression and the new socio-material
relationships it produces in late capitalism. This condition took place thanks to the
generalisation in the use of transportation and communication technologies after the
Second World War, which resulted in what Marx called poetically and prophetically
‘annihilation of space by time’ (Marx 1858[1993, p. 539]). After the Second World
War, in the West, express-ways and cars were together creating the iconic autopias
(Wollen and Kerr 2002) of late capitalism, becoming the major reference of an
accelerating and long-distance cosmology of everyday life (Baudrillard 1986).</p>
      <p>The aforementioned authors correctly perceived motorways not merely as an
economic tool, but as a major political and ideological apparatus of the state’s
sovereignty and most importantly also as a formidable element of a completely new
sociocultural condition. However, we should bear in mind that a major initial
reference for the most critical of these authors (e.g. Virilio or Lefebvre) was the
emphasis put on motorway construction by both the Italian Fascist and German Nazi
regimes. The modern motorways were adopted, developed and extended by these two
regimes, with the autostrada of the lakes in Milan to be considered the first modern
motorways as we know them today. A few years later, the autobahnen of the Third
Reich provided one of the most filmed, promoted and iconic elements of Nazist
propa</p>

      <title>ganda (see Vahrenkamp 2002, Mom 2005, 2006, Zeller 2010).1 If the cement-surfaced</title>
      <p>motorways of the 1920s and 1930s were symbols of totalitarian regimes and the
essential part of an economy of war, currently in late modernity we in fact live in an
inverted – and asphalted2 – version of Hitler’s autobahn dream. After the Second
World War motorways were elevated – from the rural landscape aesthetics and the
farright war machine – into the standard spatial forms of late modern urban sprawl. In
spite of the vernacularisation of the process, all over the world governments and
societies after the Second World War, started imagining their development and
modernisation as a process that would require the hard surfaced, modernist lineal highway
aesthetics. Roads were largely about extending the built environment and surfacing
‘natural’ landscapes with these tangible proofs of technological advancement.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, this aforementioned critical thinking about automobility and
motorways occasionally seems to be too Western-centric. In most non-capitalist or
non-Western contexts historically the mass construction of roads was not necessarily
accompanied by the widespread introduction of automobility. Nor did time–space
compression or high speeds follow for the great majority of people. On the
contrary, in most non-Western and non-capitalist contexts automobility and high(er)
speeds were so exclusive that the asymmetric power divisions were explicitly
materialised on the roads, where the more powerful (e.g. the colonialist, the elite etc.)
could enjoy the symbolic and practical benefits of fast(er) and more private mobility
(see also Ingold 2004). The social differentiation of road use was increased by the
fact that in some places those who did not have access to automobility were the
same ones who had to build the roads, as happened in colonialist African
frameworks (Evans-Pritchard 1960, Thomas 2002) or as we will see below in socialist
Albania (Dalakoglou 2009a, 2010a).</p>
      <p>Under these circumstances, in non-capitalist and non-Western contexts, probably
the promise to expand automobility and the aspiration of the poor and
disempowered to be included in the emerging worlds of automobility should be approached
critically, but simultaneously this critical thinking should break away to a significant
extent from the critiques of automobility in Western late capitalism. Within this
context, the overall purpose of this article is to explore how we can understand
highways and automobility critically in the non-capitalist context of socialist
Albania and its postsocialist version. Based on my ethnographic and archival research of
2005–2006 (Dalakoglou 2009a), I argue that post-Second World War road
construction in Albania emerged initially as a de-alienating process through which
people aspired to create a novel, socialist and modern future. Later it evolved into a
monolithic state-run project, failing on its basic materialist conception, namely the
creation of certain social relationships and human subjects. Nevertheless, this
incomplete de-alienation paved the way for postsocialist spatial practices and
sociospatial relationships. However, these newer socio-spatial relationships do not
comprise a panacea of human-material de-alienation either, but on the contrary they
create new social asymmetries.</p>
      <p>The Roads of an Immobile Society</p>
      <p>In the great burst of rebuilding, the reclaiming of the marsh, the cutting of
irrigation-canals and the construction of roads to link the distant regions with
the rest of the country were all set in motion on local and national scale.
Voluntary, unpaid work was to play an important role, which was to be one of
the most characteristic features of the reconstruction effort in the country.
(Pollo and Puto 1981, p. 249)
In the 1940s the idea was that the building of socialism needed the participation of
every individual, and the government’s plans called for people’s direct involvement.
These ideological principles were articulated in a report by the editorial offices of the
1946 Constitution of the People’s Republic of Albania: ‘People are not solidly
supporting the democracy unless they grasp the economic problem in their own
hands’ – pretty literally. This theoretical statement was soon materialised on the
roads with the law No. 747 which came into force on 30 December 1949, dictating
that it was compulsory for adult men, until the age of 45, to work ‘voluntarily’ in
road maintenance and construction (Gazeta Zyrtare 1950, p. 4), similar laws
remained active until the end of socialism. For example, when the ‘Road Code of the
People’s Socialist Republic of Albania’ of 1984 (Gazeta Zyrtare 1984, pp. 85–115)
was introduced, it included articles outlining the responsibility of countryside
dwellers for the administration and maintenance of the roads within their villages.
Besides the voluntary maintenance, the regime also extended a policy of paid road
maintenance during the 1980s. Several university students in the late 1980s were
paid to work during their summer holidays in some of these road works, although
the majority of road works in Albania were still constructed by ‘volunteers’.</p>
      <p>These motorways in Albania were an economically and symbolically oriented
priority of the socialist regime and did not address the issue of automobility for
the wider society, with the exception of mobility to and from places of work,
and sometimes not even that. For example, in the relatively favoured Gjirokastër
region, where I conducted my own ethnography, people of various ages would
recall how during socialism they had almost always walked to work; also when
inhabitants of the surrounding villages wanted to go to the capital city of their
prefecture they had to walk, sometimes for several hours. Although the distances
within the city were relatively short, this reflected a more general lack of spatial
mobility. It also points to the respective scarcity of vehicles: In 1969, the entire
country (with a population of more than 2,000,000 and a total 4000 km of
highways) had no more than 2700 passenger vehicles, plus 7700 heavy vehicles
(trucks and buses) (Britannica 1974, p. 191; Marmullaku 1975, p. 101; Vjetari
Statistikor 1991). Most of my informants claimed that they travelled very little,
if at all, by passenger car during socialism. Private cars were not allowed in
socialist Albania, until permission was granted in a law passed on 19 March
1991 (Fletorja Zyrtare 1991, pp. 122–124).</p>
      <p>Furthermore, another dimension of the general condition of spatial immobility
was the strict control of internal migration; no one was allowed to leave her or his
settlement for another without specific permission. Certainly regarding international
mobility the condition was notoriously bad as passports were not available to the
general population. Mehmet Biber, one of the few journalists to obtain a visa for
Albania in the early 1980s, wrote in a National Geographic article with a certain
amount of exoticism involved:</p>
      <p>No international highway crosses Albania, no railway crosses its frontier and
no foreign airplane is allowed to fly across its airspace, the few commercial</p>
      <p>If one had to travel abroad she or he had to obtain a special one-page permission, a
temporary passport which was very difficult to secure and was exclusively available
to people with state and Party affiliations. Potential escapees automatically
condemned their kinship group to a bad ‘biografia’, the regime’s blacklist, leading, if
nothing else, to serious difficulty in gaining access to tertiary education, to Party or
other public affiliations. Informants who did their national service on the borders
confirmed that border guards during socialism had shoot-to-kill-on-the-spot orders
in case they saw an escapee or invader, both considered equally dangerous for the
social order. These instructions caused some macabre and at the same time
ridiculous incidents when they came into force, such as the execution of people whose
backyards were divided by the obscured Albanian–Greek border (see Green 2005
and Dalakoglou (2010a) about this ambiguous border).</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, already in 1945 several major automobile arteries and plethora of
bridges blown up during the war had been reconstructed. While the Party was
organising a socialist politico-economic system, road construction became one of
the first priorities; ‘Transport and Communications’ accounted for the highest
investment, after industry and agriculture, during the entire socialist period
(Vjetari Statistikor 1991). This emphasis on economic modernisation and roads
resulted in a significant increase in the length of asphalt-surfaced highways in
Albania, from 181 km in 1950 to 2850 km in 1990 (Vjetari Statistikor 1991).
According to the regime-friendly publications of the 1970s and 1980s, the total
(surfaced and unsurfaced) ‘automobile roads length was increased three times in
comparison to the pre-war period’ (Anonymous3 1984, p. 165; Marmullaku 1975,
p. 101). These statistics though do not only hide the practical limitations on road
usage by the Albanian society – but most importantly – they mask that this very
same society was ideologically and physically forced to work on road building
without payment.
As an Albanian-Kosovar sociologist and Yugoslavia state official (Marmullaku
1975, pp. 101–102) put it in the mid-1970s, ‘In Albania every citizen must spend
one month taking part in work drives; even diplomats roll up their sleeves and give
a hand in the work brigades when they are home on leave’. A decade later in the
1980s the Party of Labour of Albania intellectuals claimed that ‘In Albania […]
you are liable to come across workers of the administration, people of intellectual
pursuit who are working directly in production shoulder to shoulder with the
workers and the peasants’ (Anonymous 1984, p. 216).</p>
      <p>Although these texts have certain propaganda elements involved; it is true that
most informants do not recall ever riding in a passenger vehicle during socialism
but they recall helping in the building and rehabilitation of the road network in the
country. The unpaid road works involved many different categories of people. First
of all were the convicts who did systematic labour on roads and other public works;
for some of the (imagined or actual) anti-communist inmates, road construction
facilitated the embedding of state-socialist principles and thus their ideological
rehabilitation. Besides prisoners, various youth unions, women’s unions, unions of
various non-manual labour workers, local Democratic Fronts, cooperatives and other
groupings, all under the Party’s control, organised expeditions of ‘voluntary’ labour
on public works, such as roads. Students in higher education also ‘volunteered’ –
and later were paid – for some road construction.</p>
      <p>The political power of an apparatus which involved almost everyone capable of
work is apparent. Building roads, besides the practical value of providing
infrastructures, could be considered ideologically as powerful as the universal and mandatory
school education and the universal military training programmes of the socialist
regime. As stated explicitly by a popular slogan of the period: ‘Let us found a
socialist state with a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other’ (Pollo and Puto 1981,
p. 267). The two processes were often materialised through the same policy; as a
helpful informant recalled of his army service in the 1970s: ‘What guns? We were
digging roads and holes in the mountain [bunkers], rather than learning army things’.
Materialities of Modernisation
According to socialist Albanian historiography: ‘The ACP were hoping to make
Albania, which until then had been the most backward country in Europe, a
developed and modern state in the shortest possible period’ (Pollo and Puto 1981,
p. 251). This modernisation had as its main objectives the industrialisation of
production and urbanisation. The latter processes were advertised a lot by the
regime: ‘Before the war, over 85 per cent of the population was rural and lived in
backward and unhygienic conditions, with a high illiteracy rate. Since the revolution
this ratio has been completely altered’ Marmullaku wrote (1975, p. 107). Or another
anonymous Party’s intellectual explicitly set out the elements comprising the urban
materiality of Albanian modernisation: ‘In 1975 the urban population made up 34.4
per cent of the population of the country, as against 15.4 per cent in 1938. The
number of towns now is nearly threefold that of 1945. The old towns are being
reconstructed, too, with wide, asphalted streets, multi-storeyed modern buildings,
cultural and sports institutions, parks and gardens’ (Anonymous 1978).</p>
      <p>The state authorities undertook the urbanisation projects having built new urban
dwellings, industrial zones, redesigning districts, expanding the cities and
introducing new infrastructures. This emphasis on urbanisation is indicated by the fact that
almost every new residential building constructed by the state was located in the
cities; the people in the countryside had private or semi-private houses and they
had to take care of the refurbishment mostly by themselves (Dalakoglou 2009a). A
necessary part of this new urban planning was the surfacing of roads which were
evolving into the key element to complete the picture of modernisation and, by
extension, of socialism per se. Besides this official literature, people even today
never fail to mention the roads as one of the successes of the socialist period. Dino,
a former low-ranking official in the Party of Labour of Albania argued during a
conversation about progress:</p>
      <p>Enver and the Party made this place a country, before they had nothing here,
you are young, but if you had been here you would have seen that Albania
before the war was nothing because of the king and the foreign interventions!
Without state, without order, with poverty, without doctors, if you were sick
you were dead! Finished! Illiteracy, to exploit them better, without big
buildings, without electricity, without water, without roads, without army, without
police, without anything! N-o-t-h-i-n-g! Everyone with a pickaxe, and very few
‘clever’ ones who had the primary accumulation since the Turks [Ottoman
period], that was Albania. Eh, Hoxha4 made some mistakes, but he took care of
the country … the Party was ordered, today this, tomorrow that, slowly-slowly.
Road construction was accompanied by the building of a modern state apparatus
which would have control over its territorial domain and the people living there.
Historically the problem that the Ottoman and early post-Ottoman5 authorities of
Albania faced had been the mountainous terrain of the country. This is to say that
often the authorities had to confront semi-isolated mountainous populations who
refused to exchange their customary political system for the new modern
nationstate. Two pre-Second World War ethnologists of North Albania (Durham 1909,
Huslack 1954) and other contemporary travellers (Swire 1929, 1937) provided
graphic descriptions of this situation. This disobedience in the early twentieth
century was regularly articulated as a refusal to build the roads for free, since
voluntary road building was a policy that supposedly was applied by presocialist
regimes, indeed with little success. For example, Swire (1937) mentions that local
chiefs amongst the Catholic clans of the North had refused to allow their clan’s
participation in these projects. These disobedient Albanian highlanders had an
elaborated unwritten customary law – which, among other things, was associated
with extensive weapon use so several presocialist state interventions ended up in
armed revolts. In contrast, socialism’s roads were often translated as successful
‘penetration’ of national state presence. State-run publications would express their
admiration: ‘Motor transport now penetrates deep into the mountain regions of the
interior which were inaccessible before’ (Anonymous 1978). Besides the roads as
such, the socialist state had very effective apparatuses against possible
disobedience, precisely via spatialisation of the punishment (exile and displacement) for
the ones who would refuse to build the state’s spatialities. An informant who is a
migrant in Greece today, explained:</p>
      <p>We come originally from Shkodër [North], but when they brought the road to
our village and my grandfather, with some others, said that they would not
build the road for its entire length, but only the section of our plateau, they
exiled them with their entire families to the mountains down [South].
The roads, when they arrived, connected up the various remote corners of
Albania, effectively networking the state. This expansion of the state apparatuses
actually imposed a national identity upon people who had for decades neglected
the nation-state idea and remained focused on their local regional systems of
references. Since the 1940s, socialism and modern nationalism as unified and
unifying ideologies were introduced to local communities, through the inspiration
that communist ideals provided to impoverished population of rural Albania and
via a Second World War national resistance movement which physically involved
thousands of men and women from all over the country. Certainly for the ones
who were not inspired by the new ideologies or were indifferent, the enforcement
of the new political structure was materialised very tangibly after the Second
World War victory. The post-war introduction of roads to remote villages
signified first of all the coming of policing apparatuses – comprised partly of
Partisans who had just liberated the country and certainly people’s justice system.
Gradually, the land collectivisation and the foundation of local agricultural or/and
pastoral cooperatives and the local Party’s branches arrived along the roads.
These processes established completely new spatialities to the local communities
alongside innovative ethos and new temporalities. A number of straightforward
ideological state apparatuses appeared at the same time as the roads; state
schooling, libraries with Party’s publications and of course the ‘volunteering’ for the
construction and maintenance of public works were established in towns and in
villages. In fact socialism was the first regime which managed to effectively
apply a body of such radical reforms on a national scale in Albania.
The Incomplete Subjectivities of the Road
Some of the aforementioned statements, in documents and by informants, imply
a relationship between individual subjectivity and the construction of surfaced
roads. The individual – potentially – socialist subject was shaping the roads of
socialism with his/her body and the building of the road was shaping the body
and hypothetically the psyche of the individual into a socialist one. An
informant, Adil, explained with positive feelings the logic of the collective building
of infrastructures:</p>
      <p>That was the socialism of Hoxha, Enverism, all together working one next to
the other, with our own hands, with our own sweat to build Albania and to
progress, in order to understand what it means, how it is being created, not
to wake up in the morning and see a road ready, a square ready, a block of
flats high like this ready, like it happens now, but to know well how that was
made, how difficult it is and its importance.</p>
      <p>Arber, from Gjirokastër, articulated road construction in the 1980 as oppression,
but he also emphasised what seemed like an irrational character of the process:
That was Hoxha: ‘shut up and work’. Sit here, break stone, build the road,
build the wall and do not speak! They were above your head; they were
guarding your mouth … if you would dare, speak! Say something! Complain
about working! And see what would happen to you [ … ] what did they want
the roads for, without cars? Why did they have the roads? I tell you, in order
to see who complains, they were clever…to see who had contacts abroad,
who received television (signal) from Greece and knew that out there
everybody had cars! Not like us, we made the roads without cars.</p>
      <p>Although this paradox principle noticed by Arber was very much a fact, the
collective road construction had a logic; a peculiar one perhaps, but it was a logic. The
former members of the Party of Labour of Albania that I knew in Gjirokastër and
generally a large number of socialist ideologists considered these kinds of practices
as the core of a socialist lifestyle. The collective participation in the building and the
consequent development of the new sense of belonging to the new entity of the
socialist social body was probably the most powerful ideological element in that
process; while the concrete materialisation of this collective effervescence, the road,
was standing there reminding the participants of their contribution to the building of
the new Albania and their socialist self. ‘I built this road’ is what four different
people told me about the same road section on four separate occasions in the Gjirokastër
area. The road section that they referred to – and that all of them claim to have built
– has been largely reconstructed and repaired since 1990, yet the strength of their
identification with the site was such that still they state that it was they who built it.</p>
      <p>Several men and women were, for a while, collectively transformed into road
builders. This innovative experience was embodied by the subjects through
intensive physical labour, eventually resulting in the creation of a physical, tangible
entity: the road. This was materializing emblematically that collective experience
and was comprising a material memory of their collective socialist subjectivity. This
was the case particularly with the Party’s ‘pionieri’ (analogous to the Soviet
KomSoMol) or in the case of students and young soldiers who had to participate in
this road constructions at a particular point in with their lives. In their case one can
observe very explicitly the power of the experience of collective building. This was
a type of accreditation of the individual communist self. It was the passage from
childhood to the real communist adult, who got his hands dirty in a real, manual
and productive type of job.</p>
      <p>The Materiality of Declining Socialism
Phrases like ‘I built this road’ imply individual identifications with the state
infrastructure. But at the same time, they offer a striking reminder that this identification
merely referred to the labour for the building of roads, but could not be expanded
to the usage of these same roads. Probably this fragmented connection to state
projects was expressed best in the question posed by a woman, who as a student in the
early 1970s had participated in the surfacing of the mountainous road that links
Gjirokastër with the city of Sarandë. ‘For whom were we making the roads?’ she
wondered, as we chatted together on the bus journey between the two towns.</p>
      <p>The Tiranë Party authorities assumed that everyone who participated in road
construction automatically identified with the regime’s project. As a result, within three
decades the regime had become increasingly alienated from the society that had
initially inspired. A society which had participated actively during Second World War
in the resistance organised by communists and subsequently had voluntarily taken
part in the construction of a socialist country, was the same society which a
generation or so later challenged the socialist regime precisely in relation to its favoured
infrastructure. In the 1970s (especially after the 1976 constitution), the Albanian
state turned completely into an isolationist regime; it attempted to enforce total
collectivisation even on the level of small domestic flocks and house gardens.
However, without international economic exchange and without that small-scale
decentralised food production, it could no longer sustain the availability or variety
of basic goods. Even the central committee of the ‘Party’, in 1990, admitted in one
of its last publications, in a rare spirit of self-critique: ‘Nothing can justify shortages
of vegetables, milk, even of meat on the market of any city’ (Vickers and Pettifer
1997, p. 22). But the majority of the Tiranë officials were counting numbers rather
than people. The state could not offer the various elements of a potentially
‘pleasant’ identification with its project (such as adequate food or petrol in the stores or
the possibility of geographic mobility) but it nevertheless expected the less pleasant
aspects – such as unpaid road building. Within this framework, even if the evidence
suggests that the collective building of roads was a genuinely voluntary activity
during the 1940s and 1950s, in the 1970s it had become an oppressive apparatus
and served to complete an increasingly widespread perception of a state working
against society.</p>
      <p>Besides the collective feeling of disappointment, this condition was eventually
reflected in the materiality of infrastructure, as the road building and maintenance
gradually diminished in quality. Many people did not put all their efforts into the
road construction while the authorities did not have sufficient local support to
mobilise the volunteers. Eventually, in the late 1980s, the government had to pay more
and more people for the maintenance of the roads and the voluntary labour was
employed only now and then, making newspaper headlines. The materiality of
decline can be illustrated by the story narrated by Kosta who remembers with joy
an event that took place in the mid-1980s. Someone important for the regime was
to visit from Tiranë to review their livestock cooperative. The local Party authorities
mobilised almost everyone, to work on the rapid repair of the worn out road that
the official’s convoy would use. The VIP visitor from Tiranë used the road to arrive
punctually at the time announced, but a storm forced him to stay overnight. The
locals did their best to satisfy their visitor, who of course enjoyed his stay. But the
next morning, the new road was not there anymore as it had been washed away by
the rain since nobody had bothered much with the quality of their work.
Postsocialism as Spatial-Material Challenge of Socialism
The collapse of Albanian socialism is closely linked to the challenge of geographic
immobility. So the new cities, the roads and the borders, the domains where
Albanian socialism had spatialised its own political, social and material existence
gradually became the spaces where the everyday challenge to socialism was located.</p>
      <p>The revolt which signified the end of socialism and the transition to a multi-Party
state actually took place in the Tiranë neighbourhood where the foreign embassies
were concentrated. On 2 July 1990, a crowd of hundreds of youngsters clashed with
the police, jumped over the fences into the embassies’ enclosures and claimed
asylum ‘abroad’ (Vickers and Pettifer 1997). Soon after those events the once sealed
and unpeopled highways in the south leading to the Albanian border with Greece
were transformed into vast crossing fields. According to a report (de Zwager et al.
2005) by the International Organization of Migration’s Tiranë office, from 30 to 31
December 1990 alone, more than 800 Albanian citizens crossed the Albanian–Greek
border at night. Today, Albania is the most migratory society in Europe: in 2000 it
was estimated that around 800,000 Albanians were migrants to Greece and Italy
alone, in comparison to 2,500,000 living within the country (King and Barjaba
2005, p. 3). This migratory flow and its scale proved determinant for the demise of
socialism as the most productive age groups and thus the most important means of
production for Albania, i.e. labour, literally flowed out, within a few months. State
plans could no longer be materialised without workers.</p>
      <p>Despite the halt to the country’s productivity, international migration led to an
increase to family budgets due to remittances, which still constitute the major
source of cash in Albania (see Dalakoglou 2010b). However, the extended web of
highways, their promise of mobility and the past prohibition on private vehicles
have to be seen as closely linked to the development of particular consumption
patterns and spatial practices in postsocialist Albania: the first two consumption
priorities for those who could afford them were the purchase of a private vehicle,
preferably a Mercedes-Benz, and the building and/or restoration of a house
(Dalakoglou 2009b, 2010b). Thus, it was that a country with a couple of thousand
publicly owned vehicles in 1990, only three years later had ca. 130,000 registered
road vehicles and unknown numbers of unregistered ones.</p>
      <p>But motor-roads and borders were not the only domains where the regime tried
to spatialise its own foundational project and which were subsequently used by
people to challenge the entire socialist construction; as was mentioned above, urban
planning was another ideologically loaded arena. During postsocialism, the urban
planning undertaken by the previous regime was also transformed into precisely a
site from which to challenge the values of the old regime. The example of the
urban topography of Gjirokastër city where I carried out my ethnography perfectly
exemplifies this phenomenon: the old part of the city was registered as national
architectural heritage since the 1960s and since 2006 has been classified as a
UNESCO world heritage site. Thanks to conservation policies, the city has three
relatively well-distinguished zones which correspond to their respective historical
periods: (a) presocialist, (b) socialist and (c) postsocialist.</p>
      <p>Socialist urban planning included everything that dominant modernist socialist
ideology recommended: a wide asphalt-paved boulevard named ‘Boulevard 18
September’ (Figures 1 and 2), after the date that Partisans liberated the city,
including a roundabout (Figure 3) at its west end, plenty of multi-storeyed modernist
blocks of flats, a stadium and a sports centre.</p>
      <p>The post 1990 outburst of private building – mainly sponsored by migrants’
remittances – shapes the most recent urban expansion, on the periphery of the
socialist city complex (see Figure 2).</p>
      <p>However, socially, the most important part of the postsocialist spatial
transformations is not the gigantic expansion of the town, but the rapid relocation of the city
centre. The Socialist city inherited and expanded the presocialist urban centre: the
market district (Pazari) of the Gjirokastër’s pre-war plan, which is located on the
hills under the Medieval citadel. However, since 1990, this old centre is rapidly
declining and a new one is emerging. The new social centre is the asphalt-paved
Boulevard ‘18 September’, which was built during socialism as one of the most
emblematic spaces of the new system at the time (see Figures 2 and 3).</p>
      <p>Since 1990, the social, economic, political and juridical activity of the city has
been concentrated along this 1 km boulevard. Most of the retail shops are there, as
are most of the ready-made food and drink outlets. Moreover, some public services
such as the police department, tax office and courthouse have moved from the
Pazari area down to the Boulevard. The daily open-air market takes place there as well,
and the three supermarkets of the city are also located there. A second post office
was opened on the Boulevard, along with five bank branches, in contrast to the one
branch in Pazari. In Pazari, there are less and less people and the shopkeepers there
complain about the dramatic loss of clientele. Every summer afternoon the
Boulevard and its side-walks are packed with cars and people, (see Figure 3) while the
transport of both pedestrians and cars in the Pazari district is strikingly diminished;
the shops there are gradually closing down while new ones open almost monthly
along the Boulevard (see Figure 4).</p>
      <p>This urban centralisation of road infrastructure in the form of the Boulevard is
closely linked to the mass introduction of private vehicles and the limited space for
automobiles in the hilly and steep narrow streets of Pazari by comparison to a wide
and asphalted Boulevard. However, the relocation of the urban centre is not only a
practical or a spatial phenomenon; it is primarily a social one. The people of the
city and the region of Gjirokastër dramatically centralise geographic mobility in
their daily lives. It is estimated that more than one-third of Gjirokastër’s pre-1990
population lives abroad, above all in Greece. So the Boulevard did not emerge as
the ideal new centre simply because it meets the requirements of an increased use
of motor vehicles as an integral part of urban living, but also because this same
Boulevard links the city with the 29 km motorway leading to the Albanian–Greek
border. (Dalakoglou 2010b). Given that today about half a million Albanian
passport holders live in Greece, these 29 km today, arguably concentrate one of the most
amazing volumes of traffic in the country, as they are the few last (or first)
kilometres of the largest Albanian–Greek cross-border passage. This cross-border road was
indeed one of the best examples of the paradox of the road policies of Albanian
socialism. It was literally a forbidden road for the ones who did not hold special
permission to reach the borders.
According to several anthropologists of postsocialism (e.g. Humphrey 2003, Buchli
1999, Alexander et al. 2007, Verdery 2002, etc.) infrastructures in (post)socialist
societies have to be approached from a Marxist materialist perspective. That is as
both physical–material–economic entities and also more abstractly as entities on
which the sociocultural superstructure is being erected. But it is not only
anthropologists who think in this way; the majority of people who lived under socialist regimes
understand how infrastructures are foundational systems of reference for the entire
society (Humphrey 2003). The seemingly inevitable analogy between infrastructure’s
materiality and the social order is what causes deeply ontological uncertainty and
moral panics in many postsocialist contexts, when infrastructures regularly break
down due to the cuts in public expenditure and the consequent collapse of the state
apparatus in these neoliberal times (see, Humphrey 2003). This material decline
represents to most people a wider social decline that has an immediate impact on
individual personhood and contributes immensely to the uncertainties of everyday life.</p>
      <p>However, the case of roads in Albania seems to be different from other kind of
material infrastructures. For example, in the case of postsocialist Albania, although
the materiality of substantial parts of the roads was or is in severe disrepair the
society reappropriated the roads anew in completely different terms. In spite of the
moral panics involved in the increase of automobility, the new postsocialist usage
of roads and the explicit inequalities to the ways roads are used and accessed
(Dalakoglou 2009a), there are much less feelings of uncertainty linked with the
materiality of collapsing roads than one would perhaps expect from a society
largely socialised to approach the world in materialist terms. On the contrary, while
the materiality of roads is an important subject of discussion in Albania today, and
although the material decay of the roads in late socialism led to collective concerns
at the time, Albanians in postsocialism seem not to be worried by the uneven
quality or simply bad quality of their country’s roads per se.</p>
      <p>Such responses imply ethnographically that the roads in our case are socially
appropriated during postsocialism in ways that neglect their materiality. More
generally it also implies that roads are a different kind of infrastructure. By definition roads
are a far more archetypical social infrastructure than for instance electricity networks
or pipelines. Even when roads take their most modern(ist) form – that of motorways
– they are still in principle considered part of a familiar technological realm, linked
conceptually with the usual categories of familiar mobility infrastructure, well
embedded in human experience, imagination and language. So whereas the vast majority of
people in socialist modernity were introduced to the other infrastructural networks
(such as electricity lines, telephone lines or pipelines) these were experienced as more
novel, more modernist, mystified and fetishised than roads were.</p>
      <p>During socialism, road construction was prioritised because roads were the
material entities that would tangibly and explicitly link the central state to the people of
Albania, through controlling a semiologically established material entity. The
building of new roads or the repair of existing ones suggested that the state could be
imagined not only as a modernising force bringing new things like electric light or
other unfamiliar and new technologies, but one that explicitly sought to transform
existing daily materialities and provide nationwide networks linking the bodies of
new socialist subjects with the state. This link was achieved mostly via people’s
involvement in the (re)construction of these infrastructures. However, as we saw
above, given the restrictions in mobility roads had little value as infrastructures of
human mobility, but they had enormous value as a political technology and material
entity that resurfaced the new national territory with the new lineal materiality of
the socialist state.</p>
      <p>However, the materialism of socialist cosmology sooner or later led to a
fetishism of the material infrastructure as such. It prioritised material
infrastructures and their economy, missing the links with social relationships and
individual subjectivity. Theoretically, the latter ones would be determined in relation to
the material form and the socialist mode of their production, which would lead
to the consequent socialist consciousness. The physical involvement of people
with the emergent infrastructure was considered necessary in order for the
desired social order to be (re)produced.6 Although the roads under the Albanian
Party-Socialist regime were supposed to be produced based on labour
relationships that were intended to unite state and worker, eventually this experience of
roads alienated the masses from the state. By late socialism, the internal
contradictions had become more evident. The value of roads became primarily that
of political emblems, monuments to what socialism meant to be and eventually
also to its own failure. The spatial policies of the socialist state, in fact literally
paved the way for the postsocialist spatial practices of Albanian society.
However today in Albania possessing a car becomes one of the most explicit
markers of social and class distinction. So despite the promises of the postsocialist
dream which were incorporated into the new spatial practices, these practices are
not de-alienating for the majority either.</p>
