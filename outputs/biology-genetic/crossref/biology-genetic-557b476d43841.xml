paternity (EPP) ( in avian species is so widespread (e.g. 86% of all socially
monogamous passerine species are not genetically monogamous; Griffith et al. 2002)
and its benefits so varied (e.g. Petrie and Kempenaers 1998, Tregenza and Wedell
2000, Griffith et al. 2002, Foerster et al. 2003), that recent research has tried to
identify factors explaining its absence in some species (Arnold and Owens 2002,
Griffith et al. 2002). More than 50% of inter-specific variation in EPP can be
explained by phylogeny, making the identification of particular traits difficult
(Owens and Bennett 1995, Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). Nevertheless,
the degree of paternal care required and low annual mortality rates (i.e. long life
spans) appear to be key predictors of genetic monogamy (Arnold and Owens 2002,
Griffith et al. 2002). The need for paternal care to successfully raise offspring
affects whether a female will seek EPP and risk reduced effort or even desertion by
her social mate. Females that can rear offspring with little or no paternal care
(e.g. many passerines), should be likely to seek EPP (Griffith et al. 2002). If
paternal care is essential (e.g. seabirds), rates of EPP should be low. These
theoretical predictions are borne out by comparative analyses that have controlled
for the effect of phylogeny (Arnold and Owens 2002). Similarly, phylogeny-based
methods using evolutionarily independent contrasts show that longevity explains 25%
of the variation in rates of EPP across species (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et
al. 2002). Males of short-lived species should stay with their mate, even when
paternity is uncertain, because the probability of finding a new mate and breeding
again is low. In contrast, males of long-lived species should never tolerate EPP
because they have many<component x="62.36" y="71.02" width="231.02" height="350.13"

mates. Indeed, inter-specific analyses demonstrate that species with annual mortality
rates below 30% usually have EPP rates below 20% (Mauck et al. 1999). Phylogeny-based
analyses have been constrained by limited data for species with low annual mortality
rates. Most documented EPP for long-lived species exists for nonpasserines,
especially species in which longevity and obligatory paternal care co-occur (Appendix
A in Arnold and Owens 2002). Therefore correlations between longevity and genetic
monogamy are biased by certain taxonomic groups and relatively little information is
available for passerines, a group that is usually short-lived. In their dataset,
Arnold and Owens (Appendix A, 2002) listed only three passerine species with
mortality rates below 20%, while the remaining 39 species had values well above this
level. In New Zealand, saddlebacks Philesturnus carunculatus and robins Petroica
australis are relatively long-lived passerines when introduced predators are absent.
Saddle( backs are known to live for 17 21 years (Higgins et al. 2006) with estimated
annual adult mortality ranging ( between 6.5 11% (Armstrong et al. 2005, I. Jamieson
unpubl. data). Robins can live up to 14 years (D. Armstrong unpubl. data) with annual
adult mortality rates ( between 10 20% (Dimond and Armstrong 2007, I. Jamieson
unpubl. data). We examined the frequency of EPP in saddlebacks and robins over
several seasons and for robins, across several populations. We predict that low
annual mortality rates in both passerine species should result in genetic
monogamy.<component x="307.56" y="71.02" width="231.01" height="350.12" page="1"

sexually mature in their first year, although saddlebacks do not normally breed until
their second year. Each has a modal clutch size of two eggs ( ( (range 1 3) and
normally lays 1 2 clutches per season (Higgins and Peter 2002, Higgins et al. 2006,
I. Jamieson unpubl. data). Both are socially monogamous with high mate retention from
one season to the next. Males provide care by feeding females during incubation as
well as the nestlings and fledglings after hatch (Higgins and Peter 2002, Higgins et
al. 2006). It is unknown whether paternal care is required to successfully raise
young in these species.<component x="56.69" y="551.44" width="231.0" height="141.32"

of EPP, EPP was not counted if discrepancies between parent and offspring genotypes
occurred at a single locus (Ulva Island ( ( robins: n 4; saddlebacks: n 1; Pemberton

reported on rare occasions in New Zealand robins and in one instance a male robin
paired with and fed the offspring of a female that had lost her mate (Higgins and
Peters 2002), social monogamy is the norm and, according to our results, strict
genetic monogamy appears to be the rule for both saddlebacks and robins. A previous
study on robins using minisatellite DNA also found no evidence of EPP (Ardern et al.
1997), although sample sizes were small and no data on adult mortality rates were
given. Information on EPP is important for on-going field studies of saddlebacks and
robins. Both species are threatened endemics in New Zealand and part of longterm
studies examining translocation success and inbreeding depression in wild
populations. With known genetic monogamy, field observations of breeding pairs at the
nest site can be used to accurately construct pedigrees and estimate reproductive
success. Our results are also important for inter-specific analyses investigating the
prevalence and potential causes of avian EPP. At present, little data exist for rates
of EPP in long-lived passerine species. Previous research indicated that species with
annual mortality rates below 30% should also show low levels of EPP (Mauck et al.
1999). Both saddlebacks and robins have mortality rates well below 30% and have
correspondingly low levels of EPP (0% and 1.9%). These results expand the range of
passerine species with low annual mortality and known rates of EPP and should help to
reduce the taxonomic bias evident in earlier inter-specific analyses. Although
alternative explanations may exist for the occurrence of genetic monogamy in our
study species (e.g. Petrie et al. 1998, Griffith 2000) our data are consistent with
the hypothesis that low annual mortality rates play an important role in explaining
low rates of EPP across species. Publication of a large number of studies that could
be incorporated into cross-species analyses has done much to clarify the causes of
inter-specific variation in rates of EPP (Owens and Bennett 1995, Mauck et al. 1999,
Arnold and Owens 2002). Cross-species studies have shown that two of the most
important life history traits are longevity and paternal care (Griffith et al. 2002).
Unfortunately, these traits appear to be closely correlated in many species (Westneat
and Stewart 2003). In addition to seabirds (Arnold and Owens 2002), long life spans
occur jointly with obligatory paternal care in owls (Arsenault et al. 2002, Saladin
et al. 2007), parrots (Masello et al. 2002), vultures (Decker et al. 1993), and
corvids (Henderson et al. 2000). Determining the importance of low mortality rate
versus obligatory paternal care will depend on future studies in species where these
traits do not co-occur or where their effect can be distinguished.<component

and its benefits so varied (e.g. Petrie and Kempenaers 1998, Tregenza and Wedell
2000, Griffith et al. 2002, Foerster et al. 2003), that recent research has tried to
identify factors explaining its absence in some species (Arnold and Owens 2002,
Griffith et al. 2002). More than 50% of inter-specific variation in EPP can be
explained by phylogeny, making the identification of particular traits difficult
(Owens and Bennett 1995, Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). Nevertheless,
the degree of paternal care required and low annual mortality rates (i.e. long life
spans) appear to be key predictors of genetic monogamy (Arnold and Owens 2002,
Griffith et al. 2002). The need for paternal care to successfully raise offspring
affects whether a female will seek EPP and risk reduced effort or even desertion by
her social mate. Females that can rear offspring with little or no paternal care
(e.g. many passerines), should be likely to seek EPP (Griffith et al. 2002). If
paternal care is essential (e.g. seabirds), rates of EPP should be low. These
theoretical predictions are borne out by comparative analyses that have controlled
for the effect of phylogeny (Arnold and Owens 2002). Similarly, phylogeny-based
methods using evolutionarily independent contrasts show that longevity explains 25%
of the variation in rates of EPP across species (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et
al. 2002). Males of short-lived species should stay with their mate, even when
paternity is uncertain, because the probability of finding a new mate and breeding
again is low. In contrast, males of long-lived species should never tolerate EPP
because they have many<component x="62.36" y="71.02" width="231.02" height="350.13"

mates. Indeed, inter-specific analyses demonstrate that species with annual mortality
rates below 30% usually have EPP rates below 20% (Mauck et al. 1999). Phylogeny-based
analyses have been constrained by limited data for species with low annual mortality
rates. Most documented EPP for long-lived species exists for nonpasserines,
especially species in which longevity and obligatory paternal care co-occur (Appendix
A in Arnold and Owens 2002). Therefore correlations between longevity and genetic
monogamy are biased by certain taxonomic groups and relatively little information is
available for passerines, a group that is usually short-lived. In their dataset,
Arnold and Owens (Appendix A, 2002) listed only three passerine species with
mortality rates below 20%, while the remaining 39 species had values well above this
level. In New Zealand, saddlebacks Philesturnus carunculatus and robins Petroica
australis are relatively long-lived passerines when introduced predators are absent.
Saddle( backs are known to live for 17 21 years (Higgins et al. 2006) with estimated
annual adult mortality ranging ( between 6.5 11% (Armstrong et al. 2005, I. Jamieson
unpubl. data). Robins can live up to 14 years (D. Armstrong unpubl. data) with annual
adult mortality rates ( between 10 20% (Dimond and Armstrong 2007, I. Jamieson
unpubl. data). We examined the frequency of EPP in saddlebacks and robins over
several seasons and for robins, across several populations. We predict that low
annual mortality rates in both passerine species should result in genetic
monogamy.<component x="307.56" y="71.02" width="231.01" height="350.12" page="1"

reported on rare occasions in New Zealand robins and in one instance a male robin
paired with and fed the offspring of a female that had lost her mate (Higgins and
Peters 2002), social monogamy is the norm and, according to our results, strict
genetic monogamy appears to be the rule for both saddlebacks and robins. A previous
study on robins using minisatellite DNA also found no evidence of EPP (Ardern et al.
1997), although sample sizes were small and no data on adult mortality rates were
given. Information on EPP is important for on-going field studies of saddlebacks and
robins. Both species are threatened endemics in New Zealand and part of longterm
studies examining translocation success and inbreeding depression in wild
populations. With known genetic monogamy, field observations of breeding pairs at the
nest site can be used to accurately construct pedigrees and estimate reproductive
success. Our results are also important for inter-specific analyses investigating the
prevalence and potential causes of avian EPP. At present, little data exist for rates
of EPP in long-lived passerine species. Previous research indicated that species with
annual mortality rates below 30% should also show low levels of EPP (Mauck et al.
1999). Both saddlebacks and robins have mortality rates well below 30% and have
correspondingly low levels of EPP (0% and 1.9%). These results expand the range of
passerine species with low annual mortality and known rates of EPP and should help to
reduce the taxonomic bias evident in earlier inter-specific analyses. Although
alternative explanations may exist for the occurrence of genetic monogamy in our
study species (e.g. Petrie et al. 1998, Griffith 2000) our data are consistent with
the hypothesis that low annual mortality rates play an important role in explaining
low rates of EPP across species. Publication of a large number of studies that could
be incorporated into cross-species analyses has done much to clarify the causes of
inter-specific variation in rates of EPP (Owens and Bennett 1995, Mauck et al. 1999,
Arnold and Owens 2002). Cross-species studies have shown that two of the most
important life history traits are longevity and paternal care (Griffith et al. 2002).
Unfortunately, these traits appear to be closely correlated in many species (Westneat
and Stewart 2003). In addition to seabirds (Arnold and Owens 2002), long life spans
occur jointly with obligatory paternal care in owls (Arsenault et al. 2002, Saladin
et al. 2007), parrots (Masello et al. 2002), vultures (Decker et al. 1993), and
corvids (Henderson et al. 2000). Determining the importance of low mortality rate
versus obligatory paternal care will depend on future studies in species where these
traits do not co-occur or where their effect can be distinguished.<component
