presence of chromosome-specific lowAbstract: copy repeats or segmental duplications.
This region of the chromosome is very unstable and susceptible to mutations. The
misalignment of low-copy repeats during nonallelic homologous recombination leads to
the deletion of the 22q11.2 region, which results in 22q11 deletion syndrome
(22q11DS). The 22q11.2 deletion is associated with a wide variety of phenotypes. The
term 22q11DS is an umbrella term that is used to encompass all 22q11.2
deletion-associated phenotypes. The haploinsufficiency of genes located at 22q11.2
affects the early morphogenesis of the pharyngeal arches, heart, skeleton, and brain.
TBX1 is the most important gene for 22q11DS. This syndrome can ultimately affect many
organs or systems; therefore, it has a very wide phenotypic spectrum. An increasing
amount of information is available related to the pathogenesis, clinical phenotypes,
and management of this syndrome in recent years. This review summarizes the current
clinical and genetic status related to 22q11DS. DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial

individuals have shorter deletions in the same region. Mechanism of the deletion at
22q11.2 Complex low-copy repeats (LCRs, also termed segmental duplications), which
are composed of multiple repeat elements, provide the structural basis for a diverse
range of genomic variations and combinations of variations. These regions of
chromosomes are susceptible to transloca tions, inversions, deletions, and
duplications. LCRs are region-specific DNA blocks usually sized 5-10 kb that share
95%-97% similarity with each other. Nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) is a
form of homologous recombination that occurs between two lengths of DNA that share
high sequence similarity but are not alleles. NAHR is one of the major genomic
rearrangements, and most recurrent genomic rearrangements are caused by NAHR between
two LCRs. Due to their high sequence identity, nonallelic copies of LCRs, instead of
copies at the usual allelic positions, can sometimes be aligned during meiosis or
mitosis.<component x="53.85" y="70.15" width="489.83" height="668.94" page="2"

findings associated with 2 2q11DS; h owever, little is known about how such changes
lead to the phenotypes of 2 2q11DS. The 3 Mb chromosomal region contains 35 genes,
many of which have not been well characterized (Figure 2). The diminished dose of
these genes, or their haploinsufficiency, likely compromises early morphogenesis in
the pharyngeal arches, heart, skeleton, and brain. However, there is no correlation
between the size or 2,7,8 type of deletion and the resulting phenotype. Numerous
candidate genes have been linked with the 22q11DS phenotype. In 1999, murine models
identified TBX1 as a candidate gene for this syndrome. TBX1, which encodes a
T-box-containing transcription factor that belongs to a large family of transcription
factors, has distinct roles in a wide range of embryonic differentiation or response
pathways. 14 TBX1 is the most important gene for 22q11DS. The pharyngeal apparatus is
an embryonic structure that becomes remodeled to form the face, neck, and cardiac
OFT. The transcription factors expressed in pharyngeal mesoderm progenitors form a
regulatory network that coordinates normal heart and craniofacial development. TBX1
is expressed in the endoderm and mesoderm of pharyngeal arches, and the ectoderm of
the distal pharyngeal apparatus. Animal models have shown that the haploinsufficiency
of TBX1 causes abnormal growth and remodeling in the p haryngeal apparatus and
related structures. This information might explain many of the clinical f indings of
the syndrome, The diminished gene expression on 2 2q11.2 is respon- (cNCCs) are
needed for the proper septation of the OFT into the aorta and pulmonary trunk, as
well as for the develop ment of the cardiac valves. TBX1 regulates the
differentiation and migration of cNCCs. Cardiac progenitor cells from the second
heart field (SHF) contribute to the rapid growth of the embryonic heart, giving rise
to the right ventricle and OFT, the myocardium at the arterial pole of the heart, and
the atrial myocardium at the venous pole. TBX1 is required for both inflow tract and
OFT morphogenesis because it regulates the segregation and deployment of progenitor
cells in the posterior SHF. The primary heart field gives rise to the primitive
linear tube, and is not dependent on TBX1. TBX1 knockout animal models supported the
importance of this gene in cardiac development. In summary, TBX1 haploinsuff iciency
contributes to the conotruncal and cardiac OFT anomalies that are observed commonly
in 17-19 22q11DS. WNT5A is an important gene for embryogenesis and is critically
required for SHF deployment. Recent study showed that TBX1 is likely to be promoting
SHF development through activating WNT5A transcription, and disruption of
WNT5A-mediated SHF deployment may contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of OFT
malformations in 20 22q11DS. Various pathways downstream of TBX1 and modifiers of
TBX1 activity seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of 22q11DS. TBX1

phenotype The clinical presentation of 22q11DS in pediatric patients and neonates is
highly variable. The manifestations involve m ultiple organ systems and vary in
severity and from patient to patient; the symptoms also vary depending on the age of
the patient. Nevertheless, they commonly include the following classic findings:
behavioral problems, developmental and/or learning disabilities, conotruncal cardiac
anomalies, palatal defects, hypernasal speech, immunodeficiency, hypocalce2,3,31,32
mia, and characteristic facial features. Congenital heart disease is present in 80%
of patients with 22q11DS, and conotruncal and aortic arch defects are the most
typical cardiac malformations associated with 22q11DS. The conotruncal defects
include tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, truncus arteriosus, an interrupted
aortic arch, and a double outlet right ventricle. N onconotruncal defects such as
ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and atrioventricular septal
defects have also been reported. Tetralogy of Fallot is the most prevalent cardiac
defect in 22q11DS, but interrupted aortic arch type B (distal to the left common
carotid artery) is the most specific defect. C ardiopathies might appear shortly
after birth with cyanosis or cardiovascular collapse, or could be defined in
adulthood. An aberrant subclavian artery might present with feeding 31,32,35
difficulties or respiratory symptoms. Although hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine
disorder in pediatric-aged patients, the hypocalcemia caused by hypoparathyroidism is
one of the classic symptoms 2 of 2 2q11DS, and is present in 1 6%-70% of patients.
Hypoparathyroidism can be diagnosed in children of all ages with 22q11DS; diagnosis
occurs commonly in the newborn 36 period but can also occur during the late
adolescent period. Mild hypocalcemia without symptoms might last for several 37
years. Hypoparathyroidism is often transient and resolves after the neonatal period,
but it may manifest later in life as episodes of hypocalcemia during stresses such as
infectious diseases, surgery, or pregnancy. Patients develop permanent
hypoparathyroidism only rarely. Neonatal hypocalcemia is not associated with the
later development of permanent hypopara38 thyroidism. However, the early onset of
hypoparathyroidism 39 is associated with a high risk of later recurrence. A recent
study concluded that the occurrence of neonatal seizures related to hypocalcemia
might increase the risk of more severe 40 intellectual deficits in patients with
22q11DS. The metabolic features of hypoparathyroidism include hypocalcemia,
hyperphosphatemia, and reduced or low-range parathyroid hormone levels. The usual
signs and symptoms are muscle cramps and tingling, numbing, seizures, tetany,
positive Chvostek signs, and positive Trousseau signs. Stridor can also be a symptom,
but it must be differentiated from laryngeal web. Hypocalcemia in 22q11DS has a wide
clinical manifestation, ranging from only paresthesia and numbness 3,31,32,41 to
convulsions. The congenital cardiac defects associated with neonatal hypocalcemia are
the most frequent features that lead to diagnosis in the first 2 years of life. The
most common symptoms leading to diagnosis in patients older than 2 years are
neuropsychological manifestations, otorhinolaryngologic 2,3,28,31-33 manifestations,
and typical facial findings. Hypotonia and ligamentous laxity are very common in the
infantile period. An unsteady gait, a lack of coordination, and clumsy hand skills
are also observed commonly. Patients with 22q11DS also have an increased risk of
spinal deformities such as cervical spinal abnormalities and scoliosis, and
idio3,31-33,42 pathic leg pains are seen commonly in childhood. The neurocognitive
profile of 2 2q11DS is also highly variable, both among individuals and throughout
its d evelopment. Almost all individuals with 2 2q11DS cope with the resulting
cognitive deficits. Borderline intellectual function (an IQ of 70-75) is the most
common intellectual disability in these patients. The mathematic ability is usually
weak, but their memory is good. Attention difficulties, visual spatial abnormalities,
and impaired executive function are also common. Most children with 22q11DS achieve
higher scores in verbal tasks than in non-verbal tasks. In addition, learning
difficulties are very common during the preschool and in primary school-aged
children. Psychiatric problems related to 2 2q11DS have also been described in
children and adolescents, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders,
anxiety disorders, depression, and autism spectrum 43-46 disorders. Most 2 2q11DS
patients have speech or language d iff iculties. The most common speech abnormality
is velopharyngeal insufficiency, which manifests typically as hypernasal speech,
increased nasal resonance, and nasal regurgitation. Velopharyngeal insufficiency that
becomes increasingly apparent with age and submucous cleft palate might also be
observed, although overt cleft palate is rare. In addition to immune deficiency,
palatal weakness and Eustachian tube dysfunction lead to recurrent ear infections in
these patients. Hearing loss is a frequent problem in patients 31,32,47,48 with
22q11DS. Immunodeficiency is another key feature of 22q11DS. The observed
immunodeficiencies are secondary to thymic aplasia or hypoplasia with subsequent
impaired thymocyte development. The degree of immunodef iciency seen in patients with
22q11DS is highly variable, and might include defects in T-lymphocyte number and
function, as well as humoral defects. The thymus and the T-cells are absent
completely (complete DGS) in a very small number of patients, but most subjects have
a milder form of immunodeficiency (incomplete DGS). Despite the low-for-age T-cell
counts in most patients in infancy, this usually improves 43,49 during the f irst
year of life. Antibody def iciencies ( hypogammaglobulinemia) have also been
described in a minority of patients, most commonly IgA deficiency. An increased
frequency of infections, mainly respiratory tract infections, is common in children
with 2 2q11DS, but the 43,49,50 frequency commonly diminishes with increasing age. An
increased prevalence of autoimmune conditions was 49 reported in both children and
adults with 22q11DS. Despite the phenotypic variability, most children with 22q11DS
share a combination of features and have a charac36 teristic dysmorphic facial
appearance (Figure 3). The facial characteristics described in individuals with
22q11DS are a long face, malar flattening, hypertelorism, short palpebral fissures,
hooded/swollen eyelids, a wide and prominent nasal root, a wide/broad nasal bridge, a
low nasal bridge, a bulbous nasal tip (becoming evident with age), hypoplastic alae

ultrasonography should be per formed after diagnosis. Children with 2 2q11DS should
be screened for scoliosis, and surgical treatment might be necessary to correct this
condition. Symmetric leg pain is seen frequently in 22q11DS patients during
childhood, whereas asymmetric leg pain suggests other pathologies. Patients should
also be screened for thyroid function and if necessary, thyroid m orphology. Vomiting
is common with 22q11DS, and can indicate a problem in the gastro intestinal system
such as reflux or malrotation. If indicated clinically, patients should also be
screened for autoimmune disorders such as Celiac d isease. Subjects should also be
screened for strabismus and refractive errors at 2 years or 31,32 3 years of age.

presence of chromosome-specific lowAbstract: copy repeats or segmental duplications.
This region of the chromosome is very unstable and susceptible to mutations. The
misalignment of low-copy repeats during nonallelic homologous recombination leads to
the deletion of the 22q11.2 region, which results in 22q11 deletion syndrome
(22q11DS). The 22q11.2 deletion is associated with a wide variety of phenotypes. The
term 22q11DS is an umbrella term that is used to encompass all 22q11.2
deletion-associated phenotypes. The haploinsufficiency of genes located at 22q11.2
affects the early morphogenesis of the pharyngeal arches, heart, skeleton, and brain.
TBX1 is the most important gene for 22q11DS. This syndrome can ultimately affect many
organs or systems; therefore, it has a very wide phenotypic spectrum. An increasing
amount of information is available related to the pathogenesis, clinical phenotypes,
and management of this syndrome in recent years. This review summarizes the current
clinical and genetic status related to 22q11DS. DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial

Although different-sized lesions have been identified, 90% of patients have a common

individuals have shorter deletions in the same region. Mechanism of the deletion at
22q11.2 Complex low-copy repeats (LCRs, also termed segmental duplications), which
are composed of multiple repeat elements, provide the structural basis for a diverse
range of genomic variations and combinations of variations. These regions of
chromosomes are susceptible to transloca tions, inversions, deletions, and
duplications. LCRs are region-specific DNA blocks usually sized 5-10 kb that share
95%-97% similarity with each other. Nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) is a
form of homologous recombination that occurs between two lengths of DNA that share
high sequence similarity but are not alleles. NAHR is one of the major genomic
rearrangements, and most recurrent genomic rearrangements are caused by NAHR between
two LCRs. Due to their high sequence identity, nonallelic copies of LCRs, instead of
copies at the usual allelic positions, can sometimes be aligned during meiosis or
mitosis.<component x="53.85" y="70.15" width="489.83" height="668.94" page="2"

findings associated with 2 2q11DS; h owever, little is known about how such changes
lead to the phenotypes of 2 2q11DS. The 3 Mb chromosomal region contains 35 genes,
many of which have not been well characterized (Figure 2). The diminished dose of
these genes, or their haploinsufficiency, likely compromises early morphogenesis in
the pharyngeal arches, heart, skeleton, and brain. However, there is no correlation
between the size or 2,7,8 type of deletion and the resulting phenotype. Numerous
candidate genes have been linked with the 22q11DS phenotype. In 1999, murine models
identified TBX1 as a candidate gene for this syndrome. TBX1, which encodes a
T-box-containing transcription factor that belongs to a large family of transcription
factors, has distinct roles in a wide range of embryonic differentiation or response
pathways. 14 TBX1 is the most important gene for 22q11DS. The pharyngeal apparatus is
an embryonic structure that becomes remodeled to form the face, neck, and cardiac
OFT. The transcription factors expressed in pharyngeal mesoderm progenitors form a
regulatory network that coordinates normal heart and craniofacial development. TBX1
is expressed in the endoderm and mesoderm of pharyngeal arches, and the ectoderm of
the distal pharyngeal apparatus. Animal models have shown that the haploinsufficiency
of TBX1 causes abnormal growth and remodeling in the p haryngeal apparatus and
related structures. This information might explain many of the clinical f indings of
the syndrome, The diminished gene expression on 2 2q11.2 is respon- (cNCCs) are
needed for the proper septation of the OFT into the aorta and pulmonary trunk, as
well as for the develop ment of the cardiac valves. TBX1 regulates the
differentiation and migration of cNCCs. Cardiac progenitor cells from the second
heart field (SHF) contribute to the rapid growth of the embryonic heart, giving rise
to the right ventricle and OFT, the myocardium at the arterial pole of the heart, and
the atrial myocardium at the venous pole. TBX1 is required for both inflow tract and
OFT morphogenesis because it regulates the segregation and deployment of progenitor
cells in the posterior SHF. The primary heart field gives rise to the primitive
linear tube, and is not dependent on TBX1. TBX1 knockout animal models supported the
importance of this gene in cardiac development. In summary, TBX1 haploinsuff iciency
contributes to the conotruncal and cardiac OFT anomalies that are observed commonly
in 17-19 22q11DS. WNT5A is an important gene for embryogenesis and is critically
required for SHF deployment. Recent study showed that TBX1 is likely to be promoting
SHF development through activating WNT5A transcription, and disruption of
WNT5A-mediated SHF deployment may contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of OFT
malformations in 20 22q11DS. Various pathways downstream of TBX1 and modifiers of
TBX1 activity seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of 22q11DS. TBX1

phenotype The clinical presentation of 22q11DS in pediatric patients and neonates is
highly variable. The manifestations involve m ultiple organ systems and vary in
severity and from patient to patient; the symptoms also vary depending on the age of
the patient. Nevertheless, they commonly include the following classic findings:
behavioral problems, developmental and/or learning disabilities, conotruncal cardiac
anomalies, palatal defects, hypernasal speech, immunodeficiency, hypocalce2,3,31,32
mia, and characteristic facial features. Congenital heart disease is present in 80%
of patients with 22q11DS, and conotruncal and aortic arch defects are the most
typical cardiac malformations associated with 22q11DS. The conotruncal defects
include tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, truncus arteriosus, an interrupted
aortic arch, and a double outlet right ventricle. N onconotruncal defects such as
ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and atrioventricular septal
defects have also been reported. Tetralogy of Fallot is the most prevalent cardiac
defect in 22q11DS, but interrupted aortic arch type B (distal to the left common
carotid artery) is the most specific defect. C ardiopathies might appear shortly
after birth with cyanosis or cardiovascular collapse, or could be defined in
adulthood. An aberrant subclavian artery might present with feeding 31,32,35
difficulties or respiratory symptoms. Although hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine
disorder in pediatric-aged patients, the hypocalcemia caused by hypoparathyroidism is
one of the classic symptoms 2 of 2 2q11DS, and is present in 1 6%-70% of patients.
Hypoparathyroidism can be diagnosed in children of all ages with 22q11DS; diagnosis
occurs commonly in the newborn 36 period but can also occur during the late
adolescent period. Mild hypocalcemia without symptoms might last for several 37
years. Hypoparathyroidism is often transient and resolves after the neonatal period,
but it may manifest later in life as episodes of hypocalcemia during stresses such as
infectious diseases, surgery, or pregnancy. Patients develop permanent
hypoparathyroidism only rarely. Neonatal hypocalcemia is not associated with the
later development of permanent hypopara38 thyroidism. However, the early onset of
hypoparathyroidism 39 is associated with a high risk of later recurrence. A recent
study concluded that the occurrence of neonatal seizures related to hypocalcemia
might increase the risk of more severe 40 intellectual deficits in patients with
22q11DS. The metabolic features of hypoparathyroidism include hypocalcemia,
hyperphosphatemia, and reduced or low-range parathyroid hormone levels. The usual
signs and symptoms are muscle cramps and tingling, numbing, seizures, tetany,
positive Chvostek signs, and positive Trousseau signs. Stridor can also be a symptom,
but it must be differentiated from laryngeal web. Hypocalcemia in 22q11DS has a wide
clinical manifestation, ranging from only paresthesia and numbness 3,31,32,41 to
convulsions. The congenital cardiac defects associated with neonatal hypocalcemia are
the most frequent features that lead to diagnosis in the first 2 years of life. The
most common symptoms leading to diagnosis in patients older than 2 years are
neuropsychological manifestations, otorhinolaryngologic 2,3,28,31-33 manifestations,
and typical facial findings. Hypotonia and ligamentous laxity are very common in the
infantile period. An unsteady gait, a lack of coordination, and clumsy hand skills
are also observed commonly. Patients with 22q11DS also have an increased risk of
spinal deformities such as cervical spinal abnormalities and scoliosis, and
idio3,31-33,42 pathic leg pains are seen commonly in childhood. The neurocognitive
profile of 2 2q11DS is also highly variable, both among individuals and throughout
its d evelopment. Almost all individuals with 2 2q11DS cope with the resulting
cognitive deficits. Borderline intellectual function (an IQ of 70-75) is the most
common intellectual disability in these patients. The mathematic ability is usually
weak, but their memory is good. Attention difficulties, visual spatial abnormalities,
and impaired executive function are also common. Most children with 22q11DS achieve
higher scores in verbal tasks than in non-verbal tasks. In addition, learning
difficulties are very common during the preschool and in primary school-aged
children. Psychiatric problems related to 2 2q11DS have also been described in
children and adolescents, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders,
anxiety disorders, depression, and autism spectrum 43-46 disorders. Most 2 2q11DS
patients have speech or language d iff iculties. The most common speech abnormality
is velopharyngeal insufficiency, which manifests typically as hypernasal speech,
increased nasal resonance, and nasal regurgitation. Velopharyngeal insufficiency that
becomes increasingly apparent with age and submucous cleft palate might also be
observed, although overt cleft palate is rare. In addition to immune deficiency,
palatal weakness and Eustachian tube dysfunction lead to recurrent ear infections in
these patients. Hearing loss is a frequent problem in patients 31,32,47,48 with
22q11DS. Immunodeficiency is another key feature of 22q11DS. The observed
immunodeficiencies are secondary to thymic aplasia or hypoplasia with subsequent
impaired thymocyte development. The degree of immunodef iciency seen in patients with
22q11DS is highly variable, and might include defects in T-lymphocyte number and
function, as well as humoral defects. The thymus and the T-cells are absent
completely (complete DGS) in a very small number of patients, but most subjects have
a milder form of immunodeficiency (incomplete DGS). Despite the low-for-age T-cell
counts in most patients in infancy, this usually improves 43,49 during the f irst
year of life. Antibody def iciencies ( hypogammaglobulinemia) have also been
described in a minority of patients, most commonly IgA deficiency. An increased
frequency of infections, mainly respiratory tract infections, is common in children
with 2 2q11DS, but the 43,49,50 frequency commonly diminishes with increasing age. An
increased prevalence of autoimmune conditions was 49 reported in both children and
adults with 22q11DS. Despite the phenotypic variability, most children with 22q11DS
share a combination of features and have a charac36 teristic dysmorphic facial
appearance (Figure 3). The facial characteristics described in individuals with
22q11DS are a long face, malar flattening, hypertelorism, short palpebral fissures,
hooded/swollen eyelids, a wide and prominent nasal root, a wide/broad nasal bridge, a
low nasal bridge, a bulbous nasal tip (becoming evident with age), hypoplastic alae
nasi, micrognathia, a small mouth, asymmetric facial movements, and malformed, small,
low-set ears. Children with 22q11DS usually have a mild pattern of the characteristic
facial features, which might not be recognized easily. However, a physician
experienced in 22q11DS could observe the typical facial features in most patients.
Postaxial poly30,51 dactyly might also occur. Renal problems are frequent in patients
with 22q11DS, including structural renal anomalies such as renal agenesis or
dysplastic kidneys, obstructive abnormalities, and 2,3,30-33 vesicoureteric reflux.
Morphological and functional thyroid alternations have also been reported. Thyroid
hypo52 plasia is common, but hypothyroidism is rare in 22q11DS. G astrointestinal
involvement is observed sometimes in patients, including gastroesophageal reflux,
chronic constipation, abdominal pain, and vomiting. However, intestinal<component

with the presence of congenital heart diseases, particularly severe 64 cardiac

resistance, is a common complication of these anomalies, and was proposed to be an
important 64 contributor to mortality. Surgical treatment is necessary for many of
the cardiac problems in patients with 22q11DS. Nevertheless, individualized surgical

ultrasonography should be per formed after diagnosis. Children with 2 2q11DS should
be screened for scoliosis, and surgical treatment might be necessary to correct this
condition. Symmetric leg pain is seen frequently in 22q11DS patients during
childhood, whereas asymmetric leg pain suggests other pathologies. Patients should
also be screened for thyroid function and if necessary, thyroid m orphology. Vomiting
is common with 22q11DS, and can indicate a problem in the gastro intestinal system
such as reflux or malrotation. If indicated clinically, patients should also be
screened for autoimmune disorders such as Celiac d isease. Subjects should also be
screened for strabismus and refractive errors at 2 years or 31,32 3 years of age.
