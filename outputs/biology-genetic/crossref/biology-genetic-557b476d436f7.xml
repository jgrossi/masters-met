Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common human cancer. Close to
600,000 new patients are diagnosed and approximately 350,000 individuals die of this
disease worldwide each year [1, 2]. Tobacco use and alcohol consumption are the major
risk factors for HNSCC [3]. Lastly, infection with high-risk types of human factor
for a subset of HNSCCs, particularly those of the oropharynx [4]. Recent advances in
HNSCC treatment have improved the quality of life and life expectancy of HNSCC
patients if this disease is diagnosed at early stages [5]. However, the overall
prognosis in HNSCC [6]. Currently, the most common HNSCC therapeutic modalities
include the use of nonselective treatments (surgery, radiation and chemotherapy) with
very high systemic toxicities and associated morbidity and mortality. Complete
understanding of the molecular mechanisms in HNSCC carcinogenesis (identifying
actionable targets of selective cancer treatment options for HNSCC. Head and neck
carcinogenesis is a multistep process driven by an accumulation of several genetic
and epigenetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes leading to the
progression of a normal cell to a cancer cell [7]. HNSCC cells are genetically
unstable and often display extensive and translocations. Recently, next-generation
sequencing (NGS) studies have revealed that the genetic alterations in HNSCC are
mainly in a group of molecular pathways and/or biological processes including p53
pathways (TP53), mitogenic pathways (RAS/PI3K/mTOR pathway, PIK3CA, HRAS), cell cycle
(CDKN2A), Notch pathways (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3), and cell communication and death
(FAT1, CASP8) [8] (Reviewed in [9]). On the other hand, advanced cancer studies
suggest small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) as useful biomarkers of cancer development
and determination of tumor stage. MicroRNAs are a type of sncRNA that regulate
diverse biological processes. Each miRNA can control hundreds of gene targets,
underscoring the potential Recent evidence has shown that miRNA mutations or
mis-expression correlate with various human cancers and indicates that miRNAs can
function as tumor suppressors and/or oncogenes (Reviewed in [10]). There is
increasing number of studies on miRNAs expression in HNSCC (mainly in tumor tissue
samples). However, once the patients undergo surgical intervention and tumor tissue
recurrence or death. The presence of sncRNAs circulating in the blood provides a new
venue for easy access to noninvasive frequent screening of patients. The recent
advent of NGS expedited the known sncRNAs including tRNA, rRNA, and YRNA can undergo
processing into smaller RNA molecules [11-13] that can function in normal biology and
in pathologic conditions [13-19]. In addition to miRNAs, our deep sequencing studies
of serum/plasma have consistently detected two other major classes of extracellular
small RNAs: tRNA-derived RNAs of size 30-33 nt, and YRNAderived RNAs of sizes 27 nt
and 30-33 nt [20, 21]. These new sncRNAs have only recently emerged because early
studies focused on miRNAs and systematically excluded sequencing reads whose length
exceeded the size of mature miRNAs (18-24 nt) or reads that align with tRNAs and
rRNAs since they were considered degradation products. Similarly to miRNAs, these
derivatives of sncRNAs can be released into the extracellular environment and thereby
carry paracrine and even endocrine signaling functions [22]. Accumulating evidence
suggests they may function in cell-to-cell communication both in normal biology and
in disease states [23-26]. We have found that aging changes the circulating levels of
5' tRNA halves induced changes can be mitigated by calorie restriction [21]. This
alleviation of the age-associated changes by it validates the age-associated
alterations in the levels of circulating 5' tRNA halves, and provides further
evidence that circulating 5' tRNA halves are physiologically regulated. More
recently, we have reported that breast cancer and its clinicopathological
characteristics can types of both YRNA- and tRNA-derived small RNAs [27]. The
presence of these new small RNAs in serum/ plasma, as well as their close
associations with relevant pathophysiological processes such as aging and cancer,
should spark strong interest in developing them into noninvasive diagnostic
biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In the present study using NGS, we characterized
for (miRNA, tRNA- and YRNA-derived small RNAs) in serum from HNSCC patients and
healthy donors. Our analysis revealed the presence of circulating novel and known
miRNAs, 5' tRNA halves, and 5' or 3' YRNAthe HNSCC patients as compared to the
healthy controls. RESULTS We used deep sequencing to investigate the changes in
circulating small RNAs associated with oral cancer. The sequenced small RNAs were
extracted from the sera of 7 male patients with oral cancer (Table 1) and 7 adult
males with no known pathologies at the time of blood collection. Sequencing reads
from both normal and cancer samples were pooled to determine the general
characteristics of the reads, i.e., length distribution of the reads, the pattern and
size of peaks, and the types and proportions of small RNAs from which the reads are
derived from. Pooling is used only to examine the characteristics of the reads, and
not to measure the differential expression of small RNAs between control and cancer
groups. A combined total of 79,944,976 pre-processed reads were aligned to

5' tRNA halves We compared serum tRNA-derived small RNAs in datasets from HNSCC and
normal subjects using the differential abundance of 5' tRNA halves derived from a
genes, each of them potentially capable of producing small associated with
alterations - either increase or decrease - in the circulating levels of 5' tRNA
halves derived from of 5' tRNA halves derived from isoacceptors of tRNAAla, -Cys, and
-Tyr, and decreased circulating levels of 5' tRNA halves derived from tRNA-Arg, -Glu,
-Gly, -Lys, -Trp, and -Val. YRNA-derived small RNAs Similarly to 5' tRNA halves, we
analyzed serum levels of YRNA-derived small RNAs and found that their serum levels
are altered - either increase or decrease - in HNSCC subjects (Table 4). Among the 19
types of the decreased YRNA-derived small RNAs, 11 were derived from the 3' end, and
8 were derived from the 5' end of YRNA genes. Only two YRNA-derived small RNAs
increased in abundance, and both of them were derived from the 5' ends of YRNA genes.
We have previously observed that small RNAs derived from the 5' end of YRNAs are more
abundant in serum that those derived from the 3' end [27, 30]. We also, have found
that small RNAs derived from the 3' end of YRNAs are 25-29 nt in size, while those
derived from the 5' end can be 25-29 nt or 30-33 nt [27]. However, in HNSCC subjects
slightly more small RNAs derived from the 3' than the 5' end of YRNAs display altered

YRNA-derived small RNAs. DISCUSSION MicroRNAs are known to be regulators of critical
steps in the pathogenesis of cancer. They have been implicated in all stages of
neoplastic progression including proliferation, apoptosis, initiation, progression,
invasion, chemo/radiotherapy resistance, metastasis, and relapse (reviewed in [31]).
In the present study we found 7 novel and 28 known miRNAs either increasing or
decreasing their circulating levels in the cancer patients as compared to normal
controls. Several circulating miRNAs that we found deregulated in HNSCC patients were
previously reported deregulated (often changing in the same direction) in distinct
types of cancer [32-35]. Remarkably, circulating miRNA is miR-103-3p/107 was (reach)
of the primary tumor (T). Although the number of cancer patients in our study was
small, this result suggests the potential clinical utility of these miRNAs for
noninvasive staging of HNSCC. Future work on independent larger cohorts is guaranteed
to validate and extend these The circulating DA miRNAs in our HNSCC patients appear
to coordinately and non-randomly target a group of genes relevant to cancer
development and miRNA-overtargeted genes (which interact with more DA miRNAs than
expected by chance) that are found mutated in cancer tissue (as reported by the
COSMIC database census [36]), are enriched in biological functions such as regulation
of apoptosis, cell cycle, blood vessel morphogenesis (angiogenesis), immune system
activation, and transcription among others. As evidenced in Figure 4 and 5, the
interaction network approach underscores the key role of let-7a/f, miR-26a/b,
miR-103, miR-107, miR-205, and miR-320a/b among others. Supporting our by our
analysis have been experimentally validated (thick grey edges in the networks) [37]
and several DA circulating miRNAs found deregulated in distinct types of tumor
tissues including HNSCC [38-44]. Chen and colleagues showed that miR-103 and miR-107
target the metastasis suppressors DAPK and KLF4 [45]. Notably, our
over-representation analysis demonstrated that DAPK and KLF4 were overtargeted by
circulating miRNAs increasing expression in the HNSCC serum samples. Importantly,
according to published data, the DAPK gene is one of the more often methylated in
laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma [46] and ablation of Klf4 in mice results in more
severe dysplastic lesions in oral mucosa and higher incidence of squamous cell
carcinoma [47]. Another in vitro study demonstrated the interaction of miR-103 with
GPRC5A, a G-proteincoupled receptor that has been associated with a variety of
cancers (reviewed in [48]). Other authors demonstrated that miR-103 is an oncomiR
that promotes colorectal cancer proliferation and migration through downregulation of
the tumor suppressor genes DICER and PTEN [49]. Relevantly, our interaction network
analysis of miRNA-overtargeted genes underscored the central role of these
interactions (Figure 4). Moreover, NF1 (a negative regulator of the ras signal
transduction pathway) is also overtargeted by miR-103/107 and two other HNSCC
upregulated miRNAs. Loss of NF1 expression in human endothelial cells promotes
autonomous proliferation in human endothelial cells [50]. Furthermore, high
expression of miR-103/107 was found correlated with poor survival in human esophageal
cancer [41]. In contrast to the clear oncogenic role demonstrated for miR-103a and
miR-107, miR-320 has been mainly reported as an anti-angiogenic miRNA in breast
cancer [51] and oral squamous cell carcinoma [43]. This may indicate that miR-320
overexpression in the circulation of our HNSCC patients is part of an adaptive
response against the cancer. Alternatively, miR-320 might perform as an oncomir under
certain conditions (e.g., distinct miRNA partners involved in cooperative gene
targeting could inhibit the activity of distinct subsets of genes). The report by Kim
and Choi [52] supports the oncogenic potential of miR-320. These authors found that
miR-320 stem cells (ESCs) by releasing them from G1 arrest. This is accomplished by
inhibition of the cell cycle inhibitors p57 and p21. Notably, our interaction network
analysis of miRNA-overtargeted genes showed that miR-320 is involved in several
interactions that target important tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A and PTEN
(Figure 4). Mutations in the CDKN2A gene are found in approximately 25% of head and
neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Most of these mutations lead to production of
little or no functional p16(INK4a), a protein that regulate cell growth and division
(reviewed in [53]). Recently, low PTEN expression was found associated with worse
overall survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with
chemotherapy and cetuximab [54]. In addition, we detected increased levels of miR205
in the circulation of HNSCC patients as compared to healthy subjects. Importantly, we
also found increased expression of miR-205 in HNSCC tumor tissue as compared to
healthy tissue from the same patients in a different cohort (unpublished data).
Supporting our between the changes in the expression of a group of endometroid
endometrial carcinoma (EEC)-associated miRNAs (including miR-205) in both tissue and
plasma [42]. These authors proposed that these miRNAs represent potential
non-invasive biomarkers for EEC. Similarly, the in both non-small cell lung carcinoma
tissue (compared with cancer-adjacent paired specimens) and serum (compared with
serum from benign pulmonary condition patients and healthy volunteers) [55]. This
miRNA was also found upregulated in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma [56].
Moreover, miR-205-5p and members of the miR-200 family target epithelial-mesenchymal
transition regulators (ZEB1 and SIP1), apparently being important in tumor
progression [57]. Regarding to miRNAs with reduced levels in the circulation of the
HNSCC patients, our interaction network analysis underscores the key role of let-7a/f
and miR-26a/b, among others. As highlighted in Figure 3, several of these
interactions (i.e., with BCL2, BRAF, BRD3, CCND1, CCND2, EP300, FOXA1, HRAS, KRAS,
NRAS, MAP2K1, NPM1, PBRM1, PDGFRB, SMAD4, SOCS1) have been previously validated [37].
Our results suggest that depletion of these miRNAs in the circulation of HNSCC
patients will allow overexpression Indeed, we demonstrate the overtargeting of
important oncogenes by these miRNAs. Adding support, let7 has been shown to function
as a tumor suppressor by regulating multiple oncogenic signaling pathways, therefore,
its downregulation would promote cancer. Yang and colleagues demonstrated that a
polymorphism in the let-7 binding site in the 3'-UTR of the KRAS gene was associated
with increased oncogenic KRAS expression in an in vitro model [58]. Furthermore, this
polymorphism was found associated with increased cancer risk in nonsmall-cell lung
cancer patients and reduced overall survival in oral cancers [38, 58], suggesting
functional and clinical and neck cancer (HNC) tissues as compared to adjacent normal
cells. These authors showed that let-7a negatively modulates the expression of
stemness genes and plays a role as a tumor suppressor in HNC [59]. Our analysis
revealed that let-7a and let-7f are overtargeting important cell cycle genes with
demonstrated roles in HNC and other types of cancers (Figure 4) [60-62]. In
particular, the expression of CCDN1 was found to be regulated by LIN28A via the
inhibition of let-7 miRNA biogenesis in cancer cells [61]. Similarly, direct
regulation of CCND2 via a let-7/Lin28b mechanism was also validated in an HNC cell
line [60]. MicroRNAs miR-26a and miR-26b have also been found downregulated in
distinct types of cancer tissue, including squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue
[63]. Recently, Lu and colleagues reported that miR-26a is commonly downregulated in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and functions by repressing EZH2 expression [44]. In
addition, the in vitro expression of miR-26 in liver cancer cells induced cell-cycle
arrest associated with direct targeting of cyclin D2 [64]. Similarly, our interaction
network analysis revealed that cyclin D2 is overtargeted by HNSCC DA miRNAs including
miR-26a/b. Remarkably, Kota and colleagues found that systemic administration of
miR-26a in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma resulted in inhibition of cancer
cell proliferation, induction disease progression [64]. Family members of the miR-183
are proposed as promising biomarkers for early cancer detection, prognosis, and as
therapeutic targets in several cancers in cancer tissues are inconsistent and
controversial (Reviewed in [68]). Members of this miRNA family has been mainly
reported as oncomirs that inhibit apoptosis and promote proliferation and invasion in
different types of carcinomas [69, 70]. Our work provides evidence for a potential
tumor suppressor role of miR-183, which we found depleted in HNSCC serum samples.
Another controversial miRNA is miR-93, depleted in the serum of HNSCC patients.
MicroRNA miR-93, has been found deregulated in head and neck cancer and often
reported as an oncomir [71, 72]. However, our results and those of other
investigators suggest a tumor suppressor role for this miRNA [73]. Our analysis
showed that miR-150 (also reduced in the serum of the HNSCC patients) appears to
target several genes involved in the regulation of cell growth and division such as
PIM1 and EP300 (Figure 4). Particularly, the interaction of miR-150 with EP300 was
previously reported in the regulation of high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy [74]. This miRNA functions as a tumor suppressor in different types of
human cancers [2, 75, 76]. Regarding to HNSCC, Persson and colleagues described a new
mechanism of activation of the oncogene MYB in human HNC by deleting conserved target
sites for miR-150 [2]. In addition, a full exome and transcriptome sequencing of a
large set of HNSCC-derived cells revealed that most HNSCC cells harbor multiple
mutations and copy number variations in the 3'-UTR of EP300 that encompases the
miR-150 binding site may contribute to HNSCC initiation and progression [77].
Moreover, the expression of miR-98 (depleted in our HNSCC cell carcinoma tissues as
compared to matched normal tissues [78], and in human samples from squamous cell
carcinomas of the oral cavity [79]. This study highlighted the role of miR-98 in the
regulation of tumor metastasis by inhibiting migration and invasion in a cell line of
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [78]. Remarkably, most of the genes overtargeted
by DA miRNAs and playing central roles in our HNSCC miRNA-mRNA interaction networks
(such as DICER, PTEN, CDKN2A, NOTCH, MDM2, CCND1, HRAS, and SMAD4 among others)
(Figure 4 &amp; 5) were previously reported within a group of genes altered in HNSCC
(reviewed in [9]). Moreover, a comprehensive integrative genomic study of HNSCC just
reported by The Cancer Genome Atlas Network showed that several of these genes (i.e.,
HRAS, PTEN, NOTCH, SMAD4 and CDKN2A and CCND1) are more often altered in HPV(-)
tumors [8]. By conducting miRNA-mRNA interaction network strategy described in
Material and Methods), we demonstrated that the same genes/pathways affected by
somatic mutations in cancer are affected by changes in the abundance of miRNAs that
target the respective relevant genes. Therefore, one important conclusion from our
work is that during cancer development, there seems to be a convergence of oncogenic
processes driven by somatic mutations and/or miRNA regulation affecting key cellular
pathways. In addition to miRNAs, we detected changes in serum abundance of two other
major classes of circulating sncRNAs (i.e., tRNA- and YRNA-derived small RNAs) in
HNSCC patients when compared to healthy donors with no known pathologies. Despite the
small number of cases used in this study, the multi-dimensional scaling analysis of
miRNA, and tRNA- and YRNA-derived small (Figure 2). Consistent with this idea, some
of the functions attributed so far to tRNA- and YRNA-derived small RNAs are involved
in carcinogenesis. Recently, tRNA-derived small RNAs [80] and full length tRNAs
[81-86] have been shown to inhibit apoptosis by sequestering cytochrome c. Also,
blocking the formation of tRNA-derived small RNAs by inhibiting tRNA cleavage slows
tumor development [87]. The tRNA-derived stress-induced small RNAs, which suppress
global protein translation, seem to reprogram protein translation in response to
stress, thereby promoting cell survival when cells are exposed to unfavorable
conditions [88-90]. Promotion of injured cells survival instead of apoptosis allows
damaged cells to persist and acquire abnormalities that alter tissue microenvironment
and promote cancer. YRNAs or their derivatives are linked to processes relevant to
DNA replication and cell proliferation [91-93], stress responses [94], apoptosis
[13], viral infections [95, 96], senescence [97-99], and several types of cancer
[100, 101]. We have types of both YRNA- and tRNA-derived small RNAs are associated
with breast cancer and its clinicopathological characteristics [27]. The association
between cancer and changes in these novel circulating RNA species raises the
possibility of a causal connection between carcinogenesis and the tRNA- and
YRNA-derived small RNAs. Even though it is tempting to speculate that tRNA- and
YRNAderived small RNAs may mediate systemic effects of cancer, it remains to
determine whether they originate from the cancer itself, or from peripheral cells
affected by the cancer. Does cancer itself change the serum composition of tRNA- and
YRNA-derived small RNAs, or is the change caused by some physiological response of
the secretion pathways of extracellular YRNA- and tRNA-derived small RNAs, the cells
that produce and release them in the extracellular environment, their packaging
inside cells, their transport and delivery to their destination, and the functions
they may exert once inside recipient cells to contribute to malignancy. The presence
of tRNA- and YRNA-derived small RNAs in the bloodstream, in addition to miRNAs, and
the alterations of their levels in cancer patients provide strong foundation for
exploring these circulating RNA species as new noninvasive biomarkers. This may lead
to the development of a multi-marker signature optimal for early detection of cancer.
A signature with more than one type of markers (for instance, tRNA- and YRNA-derived
small RNAs in addition to miRNAs) would be more successful in clinical use because it
is likely less sensitive to biological differences than signatures with miRNAs only.
Establishing a reliable signature of circulating sncRNAs in HNSCC will allow for
early detection, prediction of prognosis, and more precise adjustment of the
therapeutic approach for each individual patient, therefore reducing the
complications related to under- or over-treatment of<component x="58.0" y="71.06"

Sequencing reads were analyzed with miRDeep2 [28], a probabilistic algorithm based on
the miRNA biogenesis model and designed to detect miRNAs from nucleotides, before
aligning them to the human hg19 genome. Only reads that map perfectly to the genome
human miRNAs usually map to few genomic locations. For the purpose of analyzing the
sequenced miRNAs, the known miRNA input was from miRBase v.20 [105], and Mus musculus
was designated as the related species. The miRDeep2 algorithm uses a miRNA biogenesis
model to detect known miRNAs and discover novels miRNAs. It aligns reads to potential
hairpin structures in a manner consistent with Dicer processing and assigns scores
that measure the probability that hairpins are true miRNA d. Differential expression

Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common human cancer. Close to
600,000 new patients are diagnosed and approximately 350,000 individuals die of this
disease worldwide each year [1, 2]. Tobacco use and alcohol consumption are the major
risk factors for HNSCC [3]. Lastly, infection with high-risk types of human factor
for a subset of HNSCCs, particularly those of the oropharynx [4]. Recent advances in
HNSCC treatment have improved the quality of life and life expectancy of HNSCC
patients if this disease is diagnosed at early stages [5]. However, the overall
prognosis in HNSCC [6]. Currently, the most common HNSCC therapeutic modalities
include the use of nonselective treatments (surgery, radiation and chemotherapy) with
very high systemic toxicities and associated morbidity and mortality. Complete
understanding of the molecular mechanisms in HNSCC carcinogenesis (identifying
actionable targets of selective cancer treatment options for HNSCC. Head and neck
carcinogenesis is a multistep process driven by an accumulation of several genetic
and epigenetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes leading to the
progression of a normal cell to a cancer cell [7]. HNSCC cells are genetically
unstable and often display extensive and translocations. Recently, next-generation
sequencing (NGS) studies have revealed that the genetic alterations in HNSCC are
mainly in a group of molecular pathways and/or biological processes including p53
pathways (TP53), mitogenic pathways (RAS/PI3K/mTOR pathway, PIK3CA, HRAS), cell cycle
(CDKN2A), Notch pathways (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3), and cell communication and death
(FAT1, CASP8) [8] (Reviewed in [9]). On the other hand, advanced cancer studies
suggest small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) as useful biomarkers of cancer development
and determination of tumor stage. MicroRNAs are a type of sncRNA that regulate
diverse biological processes. Each miRNA can control hundreds of gene targets,
underscoring the potential Recent evidence has shown that miRNA mutations or
mis-expression correlate with various human cancers and indicates that miRNAs can
function as tumor suppressors and/or oncogenes (Reviewed in [10]). There is
increasing number of studies on miRNAs expression in HNSCC (mainly in tumor tissue
samples). However, once the patients undergo surgical intervention and tumor tissue
recurrence or death. The presence of sncRNAs circulating in the blood provides a new
venue for easy access to noninvasive frequent screening of patients. The recent
advent of NGS expedited the known sncRNAs including tRNA, rRNA, and YRNA can undergo
processing into smaller RNA molecules [11-13] that can function in normal biology and
in pathologic conditions [13-19]. In addition to miRNAs, our deep sequencing studies
of serum/plasma have consistently detected two other major classes of extracellular
small RNAs: tRNA-derived RNAs of size 30-33 nt, and YRNAderived RNAs of sizes 27 nt
and 30-33 nt [20, 21]. These new sncRNAs have only recently emerged because early
studies focused on miRNAs and systematically excluded sequencing reads whose length
exceeded the size of mature miRNAs (18-24 nt) or reads that align with tRNAs and
rRNAs since they were considered degradation products. Similarly to miRNAs, these
derivatives of sncRNAs can be released into the extracellular environment and thereby
carry paracrine and even endocrine signaling functions [22]. Accumulating evidence
suggests they may function in cell-to-cell communication both in normal biology and
in disease states [23-26]. We have found that aging changes the circulating levels of
5' tRNA halves induced changes can be mitigated by calorie restriction [21]. This
alleviation of the age-associated changes by it validates the age-associated
alterations in the levels of circulating 5' tRNA halves, and provides further
evidence that circulating 5' tRNA halves are physiologically regulated. More
recently, we have reported that breast cancer and its clinicopathological
characteristics can types of both YRNA- and tRNA-derived small RNAs [27]. The
presence of these new small RNAs in serum/ plasma, as well as their close
associations with relevant pathophysiological processes such as aging and cancer,
should spark strong interest in developing them into noninvasive diagnostic
biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In the present study using NGS, we characterized
for (miRNA, tRNA- and YRNA-derived small RNAs) in serum from HNSCC patients and
healthy donors. Our analysis revealed the presence of circulating novel and known
miRNAs, 5' tRNA halves, and 5' or 3' YRNAthe HNSCC patients as compared to the
healthy controls. RESULTS We used deep sequencing to investigate the changes in
circulating small RNAs associated with oral cancer. The sequenced small RNAs were
extracted from the sera of 7 male patients with oral cancer (Table 1) and 7 adult
males with no known pathologies at the time of blood collection. Sequencing reads
from both normal and cancer samples were pooled to determine the general
characteristics of the reads, i.e., length distribution of the reads, the pattern and
size of peaks, and the types and proportions of small RNAs from which the reads are
derived from. Pooling is used only to examine the characteristics of the reads, and
not to measure the differential expression of small RNAs between control and cancer
groups. A combined total of 79,944,976 pre-processed reads were aligned to

of cancer patients are expected to be upregulated in the respective target tissues.
5' tRNA halves We compared serum tRNA-derived small RNAs in datasets from HNSCC and
normal subjects using the differential abundance of 5' tRNA halves derived from a
genes, each of them potentially capable of producing small associated with
alterations - either increase or decrease - in the circulating levels of 5' tRNA
halves derived from of 5' tRNA halves derived from isoacceptors of tRNAAla, -Cys, and
-Tyr, and decreased circulating levels of 5' tRNA halves derived from tRNA-Arg, -Glu,
-Gly, -Lys, -Trp, and -Val. YRNA-derived small RNAs Similarly to 5' tRNA halves, we
analyzed serum levels of YRNA-derived small RNAs and found that their serum levels
are altered - either increase or decrease - in HNSCC subjects (Table 4). Among the 19
types of the decreased YRNA-derived small RNAs, 11 were derived from the 3' end, and
8 were derived from the 5' end of YRNA genes. Only two YRNA-derived small RNAs
increased in abundance, and both of them were derived from the 5' ends of YRNA genes.
We have previously observed that small RNAs derived from the 5' end of YRNAs are more
abundant in serum that those derived from the 3' end [27, 30]. We also, have found
that small RNAs derived from the 3' end of YRNAs are 25-29 nt in size, while those
derived from the 5' end can be 25-29 nt or 30-33 nt [27]. However, in HNSCC subjects

associated with breast cancer [27]. Thus, there may be of cancer and the minor
population of circulating small RNAs derived from the 3' end of YRNAs. The functional
not clear, especially since there is little known about the biological role of
YRNA-derived small RNAs. DISCUSSION MicroRNAs are known to be regulators of critical
steps in the pathogenesis of cancer. They have been implicated in all stages of
neoplastic progression including proliferation, apoptosis, initiation, progression,
invasion, chemo/radiotherapy resistance, metastasis, and relapse (reviewed in [31]).
In the present study we found 7 novel and 28 known miRNAs either increasing or
decreasing their circulating levels in the cancer patients as compared to normal
controls. Several circulating miRNAs that we found deregulated in HNSCC patients were
previously reported deregulated (often changing in the same direction) in distinct
types of cancer [32-35]. Remarkably, circulating miRNA is miR-103-3p/107 was (reach)
of the primary tumor (T). Although the number of cancer patients in our study was
small, this result suggests the potential clinical utility of these miRNAs for
noninvasive staging of HNSCC. Future work on independent larger cohorts is guaranteed
to validate and extend these The circulating DA miRNAs in our HNSCC patients appear
to coordinately and non-randomly target a group of genes relevant to cancer
development and miRNA-overtargeted genes (which interact with more DA miRNAs than
expected by chance) that are found mutated in cancer tissue (as reported by the
COSMIC database census [36]), are enriched in biological functions such as regulation
of apoptosis, cell cycle, blood vessel morphogenesis (angiogenesis), immune system
activation, and transcription among others. As evidenced in Figure 4 and 5, the
interaction network approach underscores the key role of let-7a/f, miR-26a/b,
miR-103, miR-107, miR-205, and miR-320a/b among others. Supporting our by our
analysis have been experimentally validated (thick grey edges in the networks) [37]
and several DA circulating miRNAs found deregulated in distinct types of tumor
tissues including HNSCC [38-44]. Chen and colleagues showed that miR-103 and miR-107
target the metastasis suppressors DAPK and KLF4 [45]. Notably, our
over-representation analysis demonstrated that DAPK and KLF4 were overtargeted by
circulating miRNAs increasing expression in the HNSCC serum samples. Importantly,
according to published data, the DAPK gene is one of the more often methylated in
laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma [46] and ablation of Klf4 in mice results in more
severe dysplastic lesions in oral mucosa and higher incidence of squamous cell
carcinoma [47]. Another in vitro study demonstrated the interaction of miR-103 with
GPRC5A, a G-proteincoupled receptor that has been associated with a variety of
cancers (reviewed in [48]). Other authors demonstrated that miR-103 is an oncomiR
that promotes colorectal cancer proliferation and migration through downregulation of
the tumor suppressor genes DICER and PTEN [49]. Relevantly, our interaction network
analysis of miRNA-overtargeted genes underscored the central role of these
interactions (Figure 4). Moreover, NF1 (a negative regulator of the ras signal
transduction pathway) is also overtargeted by miR-103/107 and two other HNSCC
upregulated miRNAs. Loss of NF1 expression in human endothelial cells promotes
autonomous proliferation in human endothelial cells [50]. Furthermore, high
expression of miR-103/107 was found correlated with poor survival in human esophageal
cancer [41]. In contrast to the clear oncogenic role demonstrated for miR-103a and
miR-107, miR-320 has been mainly reported as an anti-angiogenic miRNA in breast
cancer [51] and oral squamous cell carcinoma [43]. This may indicate that miR-320
overexpression in the circulation of our HNSCC patients is part of an adaptive
response against the cancer. Alternatively, miR-320 might perform as an oncomir under
certain conditions (e.g., distinct miRNA partners involved in cooperative gene
targeting could inhibit the activity of distinct subsets of genes). The report by Kim
and Choi [52] supports the oncogenic potential of miR-320. These authors found that
miR-320 stem cells (ESCs) by releasing them from G1 arrest. This is accomplished by
inhibition of the cell cycle inhibitors p57 and p21. Notably, our interaction network
analysis of miRNA-overtargeted genes showed that miR-320 is involved in several
interactions that target important tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A and PTEN
(Figure 4). Mutations in the CDKN2A gene are found in approximately 25% of head and
neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Most of these mutations lead to production of
little or no functional p16(INK4a), a protein that regulate cell growth and division
(reviewed in [53]). Recently, low PTEN expression was found associated with worse
overall survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with
chemotherapy and cetuximab [54]. In addition, we detected increased levels of miR205
in the circulation of HNSCC patients as compared to healthy subjects. Importantly, we
also found increased expression of miR-205 in HNSCC tumor tissue as compared to
healthy tissue from the same patients in a different cohort (unpublished data).
Supporting our between the changes in the expression of a group of endometroid
endometrial carcinoma (EEC)-associated miRNAs (including miR-205) in both tissue and
plasma [42]. These authors proposed that these miRNAs represent potential
non-invasive biomarkers for EEC. Similarly, the in both non-small cell lung carcinoma
tissue (compared with cancer-adjacent paired specimens) and serum (compared with
serum from benign pulmonary condition patients and healthy volunteers) [55]. This
miRNA was also found upregulated in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma [56].
Moreover, miR-205-5p and members of the miR-200 family target epithelial-mesenchymal
transition regulators (ZEB1 and SIP1), apparently being important in tumor
progression [57]. Regarding to miRNAs with reduced levels in the circulation of the
HNSCC patients, our interaction network analysis underscores the key role of let-7a/f
and miR-26a/b, among others. As highlighted in Figure 3, several of these
interactions (i.e., with BCL2, BRAF, BRD3, CCND1, CCND2, EP300, FOXA1, HRAS, KRAS,
NRAS, MAP2K1, NPM1, PBRM1, PDGFRB, SMAD4, SOCS1) have been previously validated [37].
Our results suggest that depletion of these miRNAs in the circulation of HNSCC
patients will allow overexpression Indeed, we demonstrate the overtargeting of
important oncogenes by these miRNAs. Adding support, let7 has been shown to function
as a tumor suppressor by regulating multiple oncogenic signaling pathways, therefore,
its downregulation would promote cancer. Yang and colleagues demonstrated that a
polymorphism in the let-7 binding site in the 3'-UTR of the KRAS gene was associated
with increased oncogenic KRAS expression in an in vitro model [58]. Furthermore, this
polymorphism was found associated with increased cancer risk in nonsmall-cell lung
cancer patients and reduced overall survival in oral cancers [38, 58], suggesting
functional and clinical and neck cancer (HNC) tissues as compared to adjacent normal
cells. These authors showed that let-7a negatively modulates the expression of
stemness genes and plays a role as a tumor suppressor in HNC [59]. Our analysis
revealed that let-7a and let-7f are overtargeting important cell cycle genes with
demonstrated roles in HNC and other types of cancers (Figure 4) [60-62]. In
particular, the expression of CCDN1 was found to be regulated by LIN28A via the
inhibition of let-7 miRNA biogenesis in cancer cells [61]. Similarly, direct
regulation of CCND2 via a let-7/Lin28b mechanism was also validated in an HNC cell
line [60]. MicroRNAs miR-26a and miR-26b have also been found downregulated in
distinct types of cancer tissue, including squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue
[63]. Recently, Lu and colleagues reported that miR-26a is commonly downregulated in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and functions by repressing EZH2 expression [44]. In
addition, the in vitro expression of miR-26 in liver cancer cells induced cell-cycle
arrest associated with direct targeting of cyclin D2 [64]. Similarly, our interaction
network analysis revealed that cyclin D2 is overtargeted by HNSCC DA miRNAs including
miR-26a/b. Remarkably, Kota and colleagues found that systemic administration of
miR-26a in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma resulted in inhibition of cancer
cell proliferation, induction disease progression [64]. Family members of the miR-183
are proposed as promising biomarkers for early cancer detection, prognosis, and as
therapeutic targets in several cancers in cancer tissues are inconsistent and
controversial (Reviewed in [68]). Members of this miRNA family has been mainly
reported as oncomirs that inhibit apoptosis and promote proliferation and invasion in
different types of carcinomas [69, 70]. Our work provides evidence for a potential
tumor suppressor role of miR-183, which we found depleted in HNSCC serum samples.
Another controversial miRNA is miR-93, depleted in the serum of HNSCC patients.
MicroRNA miR-93, has been found deregulated in head and neck cancer and often
reported as an oncomir [71, 72]. However, our results and those of other
investigators suggest a tumor suppressor role for this miRNA [73]. Our analysis
showed that miR-150 (also reduced in the serum of the HNSCC patients) appears to
target several genes involved in the regulation of cell growth and division such as
PIM1 and EP300 (Figure 4). Particularly, the interaction of miR-150 with EP300 was
previously reported in the regulation of high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy [74]. This miRNA functions as a tumor suppressor in different types of
human cancers [2, 75, 76]. Regarding to HNSCC, Persson and colleagues described a new
mechanism of activation of the oncogene MYB in human HNC by deleting conserved target
sites for miR-150 [2]. In addition, a full exome and transcriptome sequencing of a
large set of HNSCC-derived cells revealed that most HNSCC cells harbor multiple
mutations and copy number variations in the 3'-UTR of EP300 that encompases the
miR-150 binding site may contribute to HNSCC initiation and progression [77].
Moreover, the expression of miR-98 (depleted in our HNSCC cell carcinoma tissues as
compared to matched normal tissues [78], and in human samples from squamous cell
carcinomas of the oral cavity [79]. This study highlighted the role of miR-98 in the
regulation of tumor metastasis by inhibiting migration and invasion in a cell line of
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [78]. Remarkably, most of the genes overtargeted
by DA miRNAs and playing central roles in our HNSCC miRNA-mRNA interaction networks
(such as DICER, PTEN, CDKN2A, NOTCH, MDM2, CCND1, HRAS, and SMAD4 among others)
(Figure 4 &amp; 5) were previously reported within a group of genes altered in HNSCC
(reviewed in [9]). Moreover, a comprehensive integrative genomic study of HNSCC just
reported by The Cancer Genome Atlas Network showed that several of these genes (i.e.,
HRAS, PTEN, NOTCH, SMAD4 and CDKN2A and CCND1) are more often altered in HPV(-)
tumors [8]. By conducting miRNA-mRNA interaction network strategy described in
Material and Methods), we demonstrated that the same genes/pathways affected by
somatic mutations in cancer are affected by changes in the abundance of miRNAs that
target the respective relevant genes. Therefore, one important conclusion from our
work is that during cancer development, there seems to be a convergence of oncogenic
processes driven by somatic mutations and/or miRNA regulation affecting key cellular
pathways. In addition to miRNAs, we detected changes in serum abundance of two other
major classes of circulating sncRNAs (i.e., tRNA- and YRNA-derived small RNAs) in
HNSCC patients when compared to healthy donors with no known pathologies. Despite the
small number of cases used in this study, the multi-dimensional scaling analysis of
miRNA, and tRNA- and YRNA-derived small (Figure 2). Consistent with this idea, some
of the functions attributed so far to tRNA- and YRNA-derived small RNAs are involved
in carcinogenesis. Recently, tRNA-derived small RNAs [80] and full length tRNAs
[81-86] have been shown to inhibit apoptosis by sequestering cytochrome c. Also,
blocking the formation of tRNA-derived small RNAs by inhibiting tRNA cleavage slows
tumor development [87]. The tRNA-derived stress-induced small RNAs, which suppress
global protein translation, seem to reprogram protein translation in response to
stress, thereby promoting cell survival when cells are exposed to unfavorable
conditions [88-90]. Promotion of injured cells survival instead of apoptosis allows
damaged cells to persist and acquire abnormalities that alter tissue microenvironment
and promote cancer. YRNAs or their derivatives are linked to processes relevant to
DNA replication and cell proliferation [91-93], stress responses [94], apoptosis
[13], viral infections [95, 96], senescence [97-99], and several types of cancer
[100, 101]. We have types of both YRNA- and tRNA-derived small RNAs are associated
with breast cancer and its clinicopathological characteristics [27]. The association
between cancer and changes in these novel circulating RNA species raises the
possibility of a causal connection between carcinogenesis and the tRNA- and
YRNA-derived small RNAs. Even though it is tempting to speculate that tRNA- and
YRNAderived small RNAs may mediate systemic effects of cancer, it remains to
determine whether they originate from the cancer itself, or from peripheral cells
affected by the cancer. Does cancer itself change the serum composition of tRNA- and
YRNA-derived small RNAs, or is the change caused by some physiological response of
the secretion pathways of extracellular YRNA- and tRNA-derived small RNAs, the cells
that produce and release them in the extracellular environment, their packaging
inside cells, their transport and delivery to their destination, and the functions
they may exert once inside recipient cells to contribute to malignancy. The presence
of tRNA- and YRNA-derived small RNAs in the bloodstream, in addition to miRNAs, and
the alterations of their levels in cancer patients provide strong foundation for
exploring these circulating RNA species as new noninvasive biomarkers. This may lead
to the development of a multi-marker signature optimal for early detection of cancer.
A signature with more than one type of markers (for instance, tRNA- and YRNA-derived
small RNAs in addition to miRNAs) would be more successful in clinical use because it
is likely less sensitive to biological differences than signatures with miRNAs only.
Establishing a reliable signature of circulating sncRNAs in HNSCC will allow for
early detection, prediction of prognosis, and more precise adjustment of the
therapeutic approach for each individual patient, therefore reducing the
complications related to under- or over-treatment of<component x="58.0" y="71.06"

human miRNAs usually map to few genomic locations. For the purpose of analyzing the
sequenced miRNAs, the known miRNA input was from miRBase v.20 [105], and Mus musculus
was designated as the related species. The miRDeep2 algorithm uses a miRNA biogenesis
model to detect known miRNAs and discover novels miRNAs. It aligns reads to potential

that measure the probability that hairpins are true miRNA d. Differential expression
