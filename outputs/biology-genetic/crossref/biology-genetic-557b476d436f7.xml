generate a dataset of 67,401,008 mapped reads (84%), ranging in size from 18 to 48
nt. Annotation and length distribution analyses revealed that reads in the 20-24 nt
peak were derived from miRNAs, while the 30-33 nt peak consists of reads mapping to
both YRNA and tRNA genes (Figure 1A). Annotation analysis showed that of the total
reads mapping to known small RNAs, 50% were annotated as miRNAs, 38% as YRNAs, and
10% as tRNAs (Figure 1B). The remaining &lt; 1% of reads mapped to sequences
annotated as rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA. These results are consistent with</title>
  <reference>Total RNA, including small RNA, was isolated using the miRNeasy kit
(Qiagen) from 0.4 mL of serum from each participant. RNA isolated from each serum
sample was used to construct sequencing libraries with the Illumina TruSeq Small RNA
Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). small RNA molecules and the obtained ligation products
were subjected to a reverse transcription reaction to create single stranded cDNA.
To selectively enrich fragments with adapter molecules on both ends, the cDNA was
and a primer containing an index tag to allow sample concentration of the amplicons
on the Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip (#5067-4626, Genomics Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA). The libraries were pooled in equimolar amounts, and sequenced on
an Illumina HiSeq </reference>
