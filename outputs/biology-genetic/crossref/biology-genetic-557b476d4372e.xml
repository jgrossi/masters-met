undergo constant cellular turnover. This process requires a dynamic balance between
cell production and elimination. Stem cells have been shown in many of these tissues
to be the major source of new cells. However, despite the tremendous advances made,
it still remains unclear how stem cell behavior and activity are regulated in vivo.
Furthermore, we lack basic understanding for the mechanisms that coordinate niche/
stem cell interactions to maintain normal tissue homeostasis. Our lab has established
a novel imaging approach in live mice using the skin as a model system to investigate
these fundamental processes in both physiological and pathological settings such as
cancer, with the goal of understanding how tissues successfully orchestrate tissue
regeneration throughout the lifetime of an organism.<component x="53.12" y="396.34"

papilla (DP) niche (Cotsarelis et al., 1990; Ito et al., 2005; Jahoda et al., 1984;
Panteleyev et al., 2001; Rahmani et al., 2014; Sennett and Rendl, 2012; Tumbar et
al., 2004) (Figure 1). While previous data supported a bulge stemcell-centric model
to initiate hair follicle growth, our work and that of others have opened up a new
view that relies on the coexistence of two functionally distinct pools: the activated
hair germcells, which can more quickly respond to the environmental stimuli to engage
in a new growth and the quiescent bulge stem cells. This bicompartmental organization
reconciles the need of the tissue for rapid growth while maintaining a long-term stem
cell pool and has been found to be utilized by other tissues such as the blood and
the brain (Greco and Guo, 2010; Greco et al., 2009; Li and Clevers, 2010). Capturing
Stem Cell Behaviors during Tissue Regeneration In Vivo At the start of a new cycle of
regeneration, the epithelial compartment of the hair follicle begins its downward
growth. We set out to test whether this directional growth was achieved through a
spatial organization of cell divisions or instead by randomized cell divisions
followed by downward migration and reorganization. To capture behaviors such as cell
divisions and migrations within an intact organ, my group developed an intravital
multiphoton imaging system, which allowed us to noninvasively image the skin of live
mice over time. To visualize the hair follicle in vivo, we utilized transgenic mouse
lines that were previously made to label epithelial ( K14-H2BGFP) and mesenchymal ( )
hair follicle populations Lef1-RFP (Rendl et al., 2005; Tumbar et al., 2004) (Figure
1). Using these reporters in combination with our intravital imaging system, we have
performed time-lapse recordings by generating 3D-optical stacks of hair follicles at
regular time intervals throughout the phases of hair follicle regeneration (Figure
1). These approaches allowed us to directly capture hair follicle growth beginning
with spatially confined epithelial cell division, which occurs in the activated hair
germ compartment at the interface with the mesenchymal DP niche. Furthermore, the
axes of these divisions are oriented perpendicular to the mesenchymal DP and parallel
to the long axis of growth of the hair follicles (Rompolas et al., 2012). These
oriented divisions contribute to the newly formed inner differentiated layers, while
the expanding basal epithelium (also called outer root sheath or ORS) is generated by
a spatially restricted proliferation zone (Rompolas et al., 2013; Sequeira and
Nicolas, 2012) (Figure 1). While cell production and loss are often concurrent events
in several tissues, the hair follicle provides the advantage of studying them in
isolation. To understand how cells are eliminated, we focused on the hair follicle
regression phase, which previous work has defined as the destruction phase where the
majority of epithelial cells are eliminated. Our imaging approaches showed that (1)
cell death targets only the undifferentiated basal cells but spares differentiated
inner cells and (2) cell death begins at the bottom of the follicle in contact with
the mesenchymal DP niche and then spreads upward in the remaining basal epithelium.
Strikingly, we found that epithelial cellular debris was not cleared by professional
phagocytes. Rather, basal epithelial cells collectively act as phagocytes to clear
dying epithelial neighbors (Mesa et al., 2015) (Figure 1). These findings in the hair
follicle, along with work in the mammary gland (Monks et al., 2005), support a new
paradigm of physiological epithelial self-clearance. Our work demonstrated that stem
cell behaviors such as proliferation, migrations, cell death, and clearance are
spatially organized within compartments and with respect to their proximity to the
mesenchymal DP niche. However, we still failed to understand the long-term
consequences of these cell behaviors and their spatial regulation toward tissue
function during a regeneration cycle. To address whether the stem cell position with
respect to their niche impacts their fate, we developed an approach to lineage trace
single cells in the stem cell compartment and assess their contribution to the
different epithelial layers that are generated during the hair regeneration cycle ( 3
weeks). To achieve this, we combined inducible genetic ( labeling, through inducible
Cre-recombinases and fluorescent reporter alleles, with our intravital imaging. This
allowed us to revisit hundreds of entire hair follicles (over several millimeters of
skin and to depths of over 200 m m within the skin) to trace the long-term fate of
stem cells during hair follicle regeneration (Rompolas et al., 2013). Our revisits of
labeled cell lineages revealed that stem cell fate is stereotypic and correlates with
initial cell position with respect to the mesenchymal niche at the onset of growth.
Specifically, the degree of commitment to differentiation was directly related to the
proximity with the mesenchymal DP niche. Cells located at the furthest distance from
the DP niche in the upper part of the bulge did not contribute to the next round of
hair follicle growth, whereas cells located in the lower bulge engaged during growth
to expand the undifferentiated basal ORS layer of the hair follicle. In contrast,
cells located in hair germ, therefore in closer proximity to the DP niche at the
onset of growth, were consistently found to contribute to the newly forming
differentiated layers of the hair follicle, which collectively give rise to the new
hair shaft (Rompolas et al., 2013). Conversely, lineage tracing of single basal ORS
cells during regression showed that a spatial gradient of cell death emanates from
the tip of the follicle. Thus, epithelial cells located in higher proximity of the
mesenchymal DP niche have lower chances of surviving than cells located at further
distances (Mesa et al., 2015). Finally, revisits over several rounds of hair
regeneration cycles revealed the stepwise progression of bulge stem cells in their
differentiation path whereby lower bulge stem cells give rise to basal ORS cells and
form the hair germ during a complete regeneration cycle and will eventually make
differentiated cells during the subsequent regeneration cycle (Rompolas et al., 2013)
(Figure 1). These data collectively demonstrate a direct correlation between stem
cell fate and their location with respect to the mesenchymal DP niche and establish a
stepwise progression of bulge stem cell fate, with these cells undergoing an ORS/hair
germ intermediate before contributing to the differentiated layers of the
regenerating hair follicle. Positional correlation with stem cell fate has since been
found in additional tissues such as the intestine (Ritsma et al., 2014) Niche
Regulation of Stem Cell Activity Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are essential in
many developmental processes as well as for the regeneration of several adult tissues
(Cunha and Hom, 1996; Ribatti and Santoiemma, 2014). Previous work has demonstrated
that the mesenchymal niche of the hair follicle provides molecular signals that are
sufficient to induce hair growth (Greco et al., 2009; Jahoda et al., 1984). However,
it remained unclear whether the DP is required for hair regeneration and specifically
to initiate hair follicle growth and/or regression. To test this, we developed a
laser ablation procedure using our multiphoton imaging system to specifically remove
the DP prior to the hair regeneration phase under interrogation. Revisits of hair
follicles in which the DP was ablated prior to growth onset showed that DP-ablated
hair follicles remained stalled in the rest phase while neighboring unablated hair
follicles continued to grow (Figure 2). This finding provides clear evidence that
mesenchymal interactions are required to initiate hair growth and is consistent with
previous work from invertebrate systems (Byrd and Kimble, 2009; Losick et al., 2011).
When similar experiments were performed at the initiation of regression, we found
that DP ablation resulted in a dramatic reduction in cell death in the hair follicle
epithelium, leading to retention of excess basal cells by the end of the regression
phase when compared with neighboring follicles. This suggested that the DP promotes
basal epithelial cell elimination during the regression phase and raised the question
of whether DP-mediated regression serves to eliminate either exhausted basal cells or
functional cells from an expanded stem cell pool. To test the functionality of the
cells eliminated during regression, we devised an experimental setup to transiently
remove the mesenchymal DP (Rahmani et al., 2014) during regression and then track the
fate of retained cells. Upon DP regeneration, hair follicles were able to fuel a new
round of growth from the pool of cells normally targeted for elimination. This work
demonstrates that regression is a regulated process that actively reduces the stem
cell pool following expansion during growth (Figure 2) (Mesa et al., 2015). This
control of stem cell fate led us to ask whether the niche was sufficient to promote
stem cell activity. To test this, we used laser ablation to specifically remove the
stem cell compartment at the onset of growth. Interestingly, we found that epithelial
cells that do not normally contribute to hair follicle regeneration compensated for
bulge stem cell loss and once in contact with the mesenchymal DP niche gave rise to
hair follicles that appear indistinguishable from surrounding unablated follicles.
These data demonstrate that the niche is capable of conferring a stem cell fate upon
injury to neighboring cell populations (Rompolas et al., 2013). Collectively, these
data demonstrate that the niche is critical for stem cell activation, elimination,
and regulating stem cell fate and behavior. Signaling Crosstalk between Stem Cells
and Their Niche during Hair Regeneration Growth and regression phases are
characterized by different epithelial cell behaviors, yet the mesenchymal DP niche
promotes both sets of behaviors. One possible model to account for this regulation is
that the mesenchymal DP niche utilizes different signals in each phase of
regeneration. At the onset of hair growth, transcriptional and expression analysis
have previously identified signaling pathways that are activate in the mesenchymal
DP, including FGF7/ 10 and BMP inhibitors (Greco et al., 2009; Plikus et al., 2008),
as well as in the hair germ, such as activation of Wnt/ -catenin (Choi et al., 2013;
Myung et al., 2013; b Silva-Vargas et al., 2005). The sufficiency and requirement of
several of these pathways for hair growth have been established (Lin and Yang, 2013;
Oshimori and Fuchs, 2012). However, it remains unclear whether ectopic activation of
downstream regulators of these pathways within the stem cells would overcome the
dependence on the endogenous DP for tissue growth. To test this, we combined
DP-ablation experiments with genetic -catenin b activation and showed that -catenin
activated hair stem b cells generated new hair outgrowths in the absence of their
physiological mesenchymal DP niche. This is in contrast with the stall in growth
observed in WT DP-ablated follicles. Intriguingly, surrounding mesenchymal cells were
observed to broadly contact the newly formed hair growths, although they failed to
spatially self-organize like DP clusters. This induction of a new mesenchyme around
the growth is consistent with previous work (Collins et al., 2011; Gat et al., 1998;
Silva-Vargas et al., 2005). Therefore, ectopic stem cell activation independent from
the endogenous niche overrides normal tissue homeostasis signals to promote tissue
growth. These results highlight that signals downstream of DP niche activation can
drive aberrant growth within the stem cells independently of their endogenous
physiological niche and possibly dependent on the induction of a new aberrant niche
(Deschene et al., 2014) (Figure 2). Mesenchymal/epithelial crosstalk has been largely
investigated during tissue growth; however, the signals that trigger tissue
regression remain elusive. To understand the molecular signaling that facilitate
epithelial cell death during regression, we investigated the transforming growth
factor- (TGF- ) signaling pathway, as exogenous b b delivery of TGF- 1 ligand induces
precocious hair follicle b regression (Foitzik et al., 2000). We found that TGFb
ligands are expressed in the DP during regression. Additionally, TGF- signaling was
found to be active in the b hair follicle epithelium located near the DP niche. This
suggested to us that epithelial/mesenchymal crosstalk during regression may be
facilitated by TGF- signaling and b prompted us to functionally test the role of TGF-
signaling b on epithelial cell death. Conditional ablation of TGFb receptor I (TGF-
RI) in the hair follicle epithelium during b regression led to a stall in hair
follicles regression and inhibition of epithelial cell death. This demonstrated that
hair follicle regression is regulated through an extrinsic regulation mediated via
TGF- signaling to induce epitheb lial cell death and spatially restrict the pool of
surviving stem cells (Mesa et al., 2015). All together, these data show that
niche/stem cell interactions and their molecular signals are key to regulate tissue
growth but also to properly maintain tissue morphology and function. Niche and Stem
Cells in Cancer The interplay between stemcells and their niche is not only central
to tissue regeneration but has also been shown to be critical for cancer. Consistent
with this, mutations affecting critical pathways such as Wnt/ -catenin and TGF- have
b b been found to fuel several cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in
the skin (Guasch et al., 2007; Ma lanchi et al., 2008; Massague, 2008). In order to
understand how growth is regulated in a cancer setting, we investigated the effects
of -catenin activation on hair follicle stem cell b behaviors as ectopic hair growths
were forming. Strikingly, our data showed that -catenin-activated stem cells b
recruited WT neighboring follicles into the growths. These WT cells contributed to
fueling the new ectopic growth by actively proliferating. Transcriptional and genetic
approaches demonstrated that -catenin-activated stem cells b created a field of Wnt
activation around themby upregulating Wnt ligand production (Deschene et al., 2014).
This finding expands our understanding of tumoral growth and expands the focus from
the mutated stem cells to the changes in their environment in contribution to this
aberrant growth. The skin regeneration cycle primed us to investigate potential
mechanisms of tumor regression that could overcome tumoral growth. To this end, we
utilized a peculiar skin tumor known to self-regress, called keratoacanthoma (KA)
(Ko, 2010). This tumor has provided us with a powerful platform for understanding
physiological principles of tumor regression. Our parallel approaches of SCC with KA
revealed that while both tumors share Wnt activation during growth, regressing KAs
displayed an upregulation of Wnt inhibitors in their surrounding mesenchyme and an
overall reduction of Wnt signaling in the basal proliferative epithelium.
Transcriptional approaches identified RA upregulation as an early event during KA
regression and prior to Wnt downregulation. To test the function of RA signaling on
tumor regression, we ectopically delivered RA to growing KAs and SCCs, which resulted
in Wnt downregulation and massive regression of both forms of skin cancer (Zito et
al., 2014). Epithelial cancers such as SCC have mutations that dysregulate
epithelial/mesenchymal crosstalk and promote excessive tissue growth through pathways
such as Wnt. This works provides a model where distinct behaviors of mesenchymal and
epithelial components may shed light on therapeutic approaches to combat tumor growth
and re-engage normal tissue regeneration. Conclusions Altogether, our innovative live
imaging combined with genetic and cellular approaches has provided a new platform for
understanding tissue regeneration and cancer in a living mammal. While the emphasis
in the field has been centered on the stem cells, our work has shifted the attention
to a critical role of the niche, which is consistent with pioneering work in several
invertebrate systems. This work has further extended our understanding of tissue
regeneration to reveal novel cellular behaviors that contribute to the process, as
well as a critical role that the niche plays in orchestrating stem cell
activity.<component x="304.16" y="382.61" width="239.18" height="176.18" page="1"

undergo constant cellular turnover. This process requires a dynamic balance between
cell production and elimination. Stem cells have been shown in many of these tissues
to be the major source of new cells. However, despite the tremendous advances made,
it still remains unclear how stem cell behavior and activity are regulated in vivo.
Furthermore, we lack basic understanding for the mechanisms that coordinate niche/
stem cell interactions to maintain normal tissue homeostasis. Our lab has established
a novel imaging approach in live mice using the skin as a model system to investigate
these fundamental processes in both physiological and pathological settings such as
cancer, with the goal of understanding how tissues successfully orchestrate tissue
regeneration throughout the lifetime of an organism.<component x="53.12" y="396.34"

papilla (DP) niche (Cotsarelis et al., 1990; Ito et al., 2005; Jahoda et al., 1984;
Panteleyev et al., 2001; Rahmani et al., 2014; Sennett and Rendl, 2012; Tumbar et
al., 2004) (Figure 1). While previous data supported a bulge stemcell-centric model
to initiate hair follicle growth, our work and that of others have opened up a new
view that relies on the coexistence of two functionally distinct pools: the activated
hair germcells, which can more quickly respond to the environmental stimuli to engage
in a new growth and the quiescent bulge stem cells. This bicompartmental organization
reconciles the need of the tissue for rapid growth while maintaining a long-term stem
cell pool and has been found to be utilized by other tissues such as the blood and
the brain (Greco and Guo, 2010; Greco et al., 2009; Li and Clevers, 2010). Capturing
Stem Cell Behaviors during Tissue Regeneration In Vivo At the start of a new cycle of
regeneration, the epithelial compartment of the hair follicle begins its downward
growth. We set out to test whether this directional growth was achieved through a
spatial organization of cell divisions or instead by randomized cell divisions
followed by downward migration and reorganization. To capture behaviors such as cell
divisions and migrations within an intact organ, my group developed an intravital
multiphoton imaging system, which allowed us to noninvasively image the skin of live
mice over time. To visualize the hair follicle in vivo, we utilized transgenic mouse
lines that were previously made to label epithelial ( K14-H2BGFP) and mesenchymal ( )
hair follicle populations Lef1-RFP (Rendl et al., 2005; Tumbar et al., 2004) (Figure
1). Using these reporters in combination with our intravital imaging system, we have
performed time-lapse recordings by generating 3D-optical stacks of hair follicles at
regular time intervals throughout the phases of hair follicle regeneration (Figure
1). These approaches allowed us to directly capture hair follicle growth beginning
with spatially confined epithelial cell division, which occurs in the activated hair
germ compartment at the interface with the mesenchymal DP niche. Furthermore, the
axes of these divisions are oriented perpendicular to the mesenchymal DP and parallel
to the long axis of growth of the hair follicles (Rompolas et al., 2012). These
oriented divisions contribute to the newly formed inner differentiated layers, while
the expanding basal epithelium (also called outer root sheath or ORS) is generated by
a spatially restricted proliferation zone (Rompolas et al., 2013; Sequeira and
Nicolas, 2012) (Figure 1). While cell production and loss are often concurrent events
in several tissues, the hair follicle provides the advantage of studying them in
isolation. To understand how cells are eliminated, we focused on the hair follicle
regression phase, which previous work has defined as the destruction phase where the
majority of epithelial cells are eliminated. Our imaging approaches showed that (1)
cell death targets only the undifferentiated basal cells but spares differentiated
inner cells and (2) cell death begins at the bottom of the follicle in contact with
the mesenchymal DP niche and then spreads upward in the remaining basal epithelium.
Strikingly, we found that epithelial cellular debris was not cleared by professional
phagocytes. Rather, basal epithelial cells collectively act as phagocytes to clear
dying epithelial neighbors (Mesa et al., 2015) (Figure 1). These findings in the hair
follicle, along with work in the mammary gland (Monks et al., 2005), support a new
paradigm of physiological epithelial self-clearance. Our work demonstrated that stem
cell behaviors such as proliferation, migrations, cell death, and clearance are
spatially organized within compartments and with respect to their proximity to the
mesenchymal DP niche. However, we still failed to understand the long-term
consequences of these cell behaviors and their spatial regulation toward tissue
function during a regeneration cycle. To address whether the stem cell position with
respect to their niche impacts their fate, we developed an approach to lineage trace
single cells in the stem cell compartment and assess their contribution to the
different epithelial layers that are generated during the hair regeneration cycle ( 3
weeks). To achieve this, we combined inducible genetic ( labeling, through inducible
Cre-recombinases and fluorescent reporter alleles, with our intravital imaging. This
allowed us to revisit hundreds of entire hair follicles (over several millimeters of
skin and to depths of over 200 m m within the skin) to trace the long-term fate of
stem cells during hair follicle regeneration (Rompolas et al., 2013). Our revisits of
labeled cell lineages revealed that stem cell fate is stereotypic and correlates with
initial cell position with respect to the mesenchymal niche at the onset of growth.
Specifically, the degree of commitment to differentiation was directly related to the
proximity with the mesenchymal DP niche. Cells located at the furthest distance from
the DP niche in the upper part of the bulge did not contribute to the next round of
hair follicle growth, whereas cells located in the lower bulge engaged during growth
to expand the undifferentiated basal ORS layer of the hair follicle. In contrast,
cells located in hair germ, therefore in closer proximity to the DP niche at the
onset of growth, were consistently found to contribute to the newly forming
differentiated layers of the hair follicle, which collectively give rise to the new
hair shaft (Rompolas et al., 2013). Conversely, lineage tracing of single basal ORS
cells during regression showed that a spatial gradient of cell death emanates from
the tip of the follicle. Thus, epithelial cells located in higher proximity of the
mesenchymal DP niche have lower chances of surviving than cells located at further
distances (Mesa et al., 2015). Finally, revisits over several rounds of hair
regeneration cycles revealed the stepwise progression of bulge stem cells in their
differentiation path whereby lower bulge stem cells give rise to basal ORS cells and
form the hair germ during a complete regeneration cycle and will eventually make
differentiated cells during the subsequent regeneration cycle (Rompolas et al., 2013)
(Figure 1). These data collectively demonstrate a direct correlation between stem
cell fate and their location with respect to the mesenchymal DP niche and establish a
stepwise progression of bulge stem cell fate, with these cells undergoing an ORS/hair
germ intermediate before contributing to the differentiated layers of the
regenerating hair follicle. Positional correlation with stem cell fate has since been
found in additional tissues such as the intestine (Ritsma et al., 2014) Niche
Regulation of Stem Cell Activity Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are essential in
many developmental processes as well as for the regeneration of several adult tissues
(Cunha and Hom, 1996; Ribatti and Santoiemma, 2014). Previous work has demonstrated
that the mesenchymal niche of the hair follicle provides molecular signals that are
sufficient to induce hair growth (Greco et al., 2009; Jahoda et al., 1984). However,
it remained unclear whether the DP is required for hair regeneration and specifically
to initiate hair follicle growth and/or regression. To test this, we developed a
laser ablation procedure using our multiphoton imaging system to specifically remove
the DP prior to the hair regeneration phase under interrogation. Revisits of hair
follicles in which the DP was ablated prior to growth onset showed that DP-ablated
hair follicles remained stalled in the rest phase while neighboring unablated hair
follicles continued to grow (Figure 2). This finding provides clear evidence that
mesenchymal interactions are required to initiate hair growth and is consistent with
previous work from invertebrate systems (Byrd and Kimble, 2009; Losick et al., 2011).
When similar experiments were performed at the initiation of regression, we found
that DP ablation resulted in a dramatic reduction in cell death in the hair follicle
epithelium, leading to retention of excess basal cells by the end of the regression
phase when compared with neighboring follicles. This suggested that the DP promotes
basal epithelial cell elimination during the regression phase and raised the question
of whether DP-mediated regression serves to eliminate either exhausted basal cells or
functional cells from an expanded stem cell pool. To test the functionality of the
cells eliminated during regression, we devised an experimental setup to transiently
remove the mesenchymal DP (Rahmani et al., 2014) during regression and then track the
fate of retained cells. Upon DP regeneration, hair follicles were able to fuel a new
round of growth from the pool of cells normally targeted for elimination. This work
demonstrates that regression is a regulated process that actively reduces the stem
cell pool following expansion during growth (Figure 2) (Mesa et al., 2015). This
control of stem cell fate led us to ask whether the niche was sufficient to promote
stem cell activity. To test this, we used laser ablation to specifically remove the
stem cell compartment at the onset of growth. Interestingly, we found that epithelial
cells that do not normally contribute to hair follicle regeneration compensated for
bulge stem cell loss and once in contact with the mesenchymal DP niche gave rise to
hair follicles that appear indistinguishable from surrounding unablated follicles.
These data demonstrate that the niche is capable of conferring a stem cell fate upon
injury to neighboring cell populations (Rompolas et al., 2013). Collectively, these
data demonstrate that the niche is critical for stem cell activation, elimination,
and regulating stem cell fate and behavior. Signaling Crosstalk between Stem Cells
and Their Niche during Hair Regeneration Growth and regression phases are
characterized by different epithelial cell behaviors, yet the mesenchymal DP niche
promotes both sets of behaviors. One possible model to account for this regulation is
that the mesenchymal DP niche utilizes different signals in each phase of
regeneration. At the onset of hair growth, transcriptional and expression analysis
have previously identified signaling pathways that are activate in the mesenchymal
DP, including FGF7/ 10 and BMP inhibitors (Greco et al., 2009; Plikus et al., 2008),
as well as in the hair germ, such as activation of Wnt/ -catenin (Choi et al., 2013;
Myung et al., 2013; b Silva-Vargas et al., 2005). The sufficiency and requirement of
several of these pathways for hair growth have been established (Lin and Yang, 2013;
Oshimori and Fuchs, 2012). However, it remains unclear whether ectopic activation of
downstream regulators of these pathways within the stem cells would overcome the
dependence on the endogenous DP for tissue growth. To test this, we combined
DP-ablation experiments with genetic -catenin b activation and showed that -catenin
activated hair stem b cells generated new hair outgrowths in the absence of their
physiological mesenchymal DP niche. This is in contrast with the stall in growth
observed in WT DP-ablated follicles. Intriguingly, surrounding mesenchymal cells were
observed to broadly contact the newly formed hair growths, although they failed to
spatially self-organize like DP clusters. This induction of a new mesenchyme around
the growth is consistent with previous work (Collins et al., 2011; Gat et al., 1998;
Silva-Vargas et al., 2005). Therefore, ectopic stem cell activation independent from
the endogenous niche overrides normal tissue homeostasis signals to promote tissue
growth. These results highlight that signals downstream of DP niche activation can
drive aberrant growth within the stem cells independently of their endogenous
physiological niche and possibly dependent on the induction of a new aberrant niche
(Deschene et al., 2014) (Figure 2). Mesenchymal/epithelial crosstalk has been largely
investigated during tissue growth; however, the signals that trigger tissue
regression remain elusive. To understand the molecular signaling that facilitate
epithelial cell death during regression, we investigated the transforming growth
factor- (TGF- ) signaling pathway, as exogenous b b delivery of TGF- 1 ligand induces
precocious hair follicle b regression (Foitzik et al., 2000). We found that TGFb
ligands are expressed in the DP during regression. Additionally, TGF- signaling was
found to be active in the b hair follicle epithelium located near the DP niche. This
suggested to us that epithelial/mesenchymal crosstalk during regression may be
facilitated by TGF- signaling and b prompted us to functionally test the role of TGF-
signaling b on epithelial cell death. Conditional ablation of TGFb receptor I (TGF-
RI) in the hair follicle epithelium during b regression led to a stall in hair
follicles regression and inhibition of epithelial cell death. This demonstrated that
hair follicle regression is regulated through an extrinsic regulation mediated via
TGF- signaling to induce epitheb lial cell death and spatially restrict the pool of
surviving stem cells (Mesa et al., 2015). All together, these data show that
niche/stem cell interactions and their molecular signals are key to regulate tissue
growth but also to properly maintain tissue morphology and function. Niche and Stem
Cells in Cancer The interplay between stemcells and their niche is not only central
to tissue regeneration but has also been shown to be critical for cancer. Consistent
with this, mutations affecting critical pathways such as Wnt/ -catenin and TGF- have
b b been found to fuel several cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in
the skin (Guasch et al., 2007; Ma lanchi et al., 2008; Massague, 2008). In order to
understand how growth is regulated in a cancer setting, we investigated the effects
of -catenin activation on hair follicle stem cell b behaviors as ectopic hair growths
were forming. Strikingly, our data showed that -catenin-activated stem cells b
recruited WT neighboring follicles into the growths. These WT cells contributed to
fueling the new ectopic growth by actively proliferating. Transcriptional and genetic
approaches demonstrated that -catenin-activated stem cells b created a field of Wnt
activation around themby upregulating Wnt ligand production (Deschene et al., 2014).
This finding expands our understanding of tumoral growth and expands the focus from
the mutated stem cells to the changes in their environment in contribution to this
aberrant growth. The skin regeneration cycle primed us to investigate potential
mechanisms of tumor regression that could overcome tumoral growth. To this end, we
utilized a peculiar skin tumor known to self-regress, called keratoacanthoma (KA)
(Ko, 2010). This tumor has provided us with a powerful platform for understanding
physiological principles of tumor regression. Our parallel approaches of SCC with KA
revealed that while both tumors share Wnt activation during growth, regressing KAs
displayed an upregulation of Wnt inhibitors in their surrounding mesenchyme and an
overall reduction of Wnt signaling in the basal proliferative epithelium.
Transcriptional approaches identified RA upregulation as an early event during KA
regression and prior to Wnt downregulation. To test the function of RA signaling on
tumor regression, we ectopically delivered RA to growing KAs and SCCs, which resulted
in Wnt downregulation and massive regression of both forms of skin cancer (Zito et
al., 2014). Epithelial cancers such as SCC have mutations that dysregulate
epithelial/mesenchymal crosstalk and promote excessive tissue growth through pathways
such as Wnt. This works provides a model where distinct behaviors of mesenchymal and
epithelial components may shed light on therapeutic approaches to combat tumor growth
and re-engage normal tissue regeneration. Conclusions Altogether, our innovative live
imaging combined with genetic and cellular approaches has provided a new platform for
understanding tissue regeneration and cancer in a living mammal. While the emphasis
in the field has been centered on the stem cells, our work has shifted the attention
to a critical role of the niche, which is consistent with pioneering work in several
invertebrate systems. This work has further extended our understanding of tissue
regeneration to reveal novel cellular behaviors that contribute to the process, as
well as a critical role that the niche plays in orchestrating stem cell
activity.<component x="304.16" y="382.61" width="239.18" height="176.18" page="1"
