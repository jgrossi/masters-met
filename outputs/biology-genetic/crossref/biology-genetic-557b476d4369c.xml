hyperkinetic movement disorders characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that
result in abnormal torsional movements and postures. Dystonia is often initiated or
exacerbated by 1 voluntary action and associated with excess muscle activation.
Blepharospasm (BSP) and cervical dystonia (CD) are the most common forms of
adult-onset dystonia; the term craniocervical dystonia (CCD) encompasses all of those
forms occurring either in 1-3 isolation or in combination. Diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI) works on the measurement of trends in random motion of water molecules in a
given medium. This technique allows for the visualization of microstructures and
quantifies water diffusion in tissues noninvasively. It is based on the theory that
the water found in the tissues exhibits properties of anisotropic 4 diffusion. DTI
provides information about the random displacement and passive diffusion of water
molecules on the directionality and integrity of fibers. It can demonstrate neuronal
loss through a decrease in diffusion anisotropy, shown by lower values of fractional
anisotropy (FA) and higher values of mean diffusivity (MD). FA quantifies the
preferred direction of diffusion of water molecules through white matter (WM) tracts,
and MD represents the magnitude of the 5-7 diffusion. DTI also allows for the
visualization of neural projections 8 The tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in
the central nervous system. technique performs whole-brain analysis by measuring
changes in water molecules in tissues and enables DTI sequence parameters to be 9,10
compared using statistical analysis. Previous DTI studies in CCD produced conflicting
results. In CD, DTI documented changes mainly in the circuit involving the cortex,
8,11-14 thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. In turn, patients with BSP and
blepharospasm + oromandibular dystonia (BOM) showed alterations in the cerebellum,
parietal lobe, lentiform nucleus, thalamus, 15 and insula. There has never been a
dedicated study of the WM in CCD; hence we performed DTI aiming to analyze the
microstructure of WM in patients with CCD compared to healthy controls
(HC).<component x="43.82" y="74.29" width="254.08" height="171.69" page="1"

of the University Hospital approved the study and all subjects signed an informed
consent prior to participation in any study-related procedure. Patients were
consecutively recruited from March 2010 until November 2013, at the Outpatient
Movement Disorders Clinic, the Dystonia Clinic, and the Neurogenetics Service at the
University of Campinas University Hospital. A total of 108 patients were screened. 40
subjects presented idiopathic CCD were included: 5 subjects with isolated BSP &#xA1;
&#xA1; (61.8 10.3 years old), 9 with BOM (68.5 5.0 years-old), 8 with &#xA1; BOM and
CD (63.1 11.1), and 18 subjects with isolated CD &#xA1; (52.8 12.2). All subjects
underwent a detailed review of their clinical history, family history, and treatment.
A movement disorders specialist performed a neurological examination and assessed
subjects on the 16 Marsden-Fahn Scale. The exclusion criteria were the presence of
neurological abnormalities other than tremor; dystonia located in segments other than
the craniocervical region; presence of significant clinical comorbidities; history of
exposure to medications known to induce dystonia; abnormalities at neuroimaging; and
known etiology<component x="45.81" y="361.21" width="254.09" height="223.59" page="2"

excluded 68 patients with idiopathic or genetic dystonia presenting in sites other
than the craniocervical area, or with secondary dystonia. In addition, all subjects
had a negative molecular test for DYT1and DYT6 mutations. We included 40 age- and
sex-matched HC without a family history of dystonia and with a normal neurological
examination. For each subject the same control was used for the total group analyses
and the subgroup analyses (Table 1). Since previous studies found differences as low
as 0.016 in FA values 17 to be significant, we hypothesized a standard deviation of
the difference of 0.03. For a sample of 40 subjects, the expected Statistical Power
for those parameters would be 90%. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition.
Patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination at the peak of action
of the botulinum toxin (BoNT) to decrease the chance of motion artefacts. The MRI

then performed a subgroup analysis, based on dystonia body distribution. Images were
corrected for eddy currents using the eddycorrect tool from Oxford centre for
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB)'s Diffusion Toolbox (FDT)
(http://www.fmrib.ox. ac.uk/fsl/), which is part of the Functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging of the Brain Software Library (FSL) software, version 4.1.4. We obtained maps
of FA using FDT. Voxelwise statistical analysis of the DTI data was carried out using
TBSS. In summary, FA images were created by fitting a tensor model to the raw
diffusion data using FDT, and then brain-extracted using the Brain Extraction Tool
(BET). All FA data were aligned into a common space with the nonlinear registration
tool (FNIRT), which uses a b-spline representation of the registration warp field.
Following this, the mean FA image was created and thinned to generate a mean FA
skeleton, which represents the center of all tracts common to the group. Each
subject's aligned FA data were then projected into this skeleton and the resulting
data fed 9,18 into the voxelwise cross-subject statistics. We performed a paired
Ttest to compare patients and HC, and the level of significance was set 9 at 0.05. We

tractography as a confirmatory analysis, evaluating the total group only and
extracting the FA/MD values. The tensor calculation of all DTI was carried out with
21 and fiber tractography using a semiautomatic determiExploreDTI nistic methodology,
briefly described below. ROIs to seed each tract were manually drawn on a normalized
template. This template was created with non-diffusion weighted images of 10 local
control subjects 5 5 (mean age 33 years; age range 22-47 years; 50% females) acquired
in the same MRI scanner, with the aim of improving anatomical matching to the study
sample. Sequentially, the method employs the three-dimensional deformation field
matrix of each subject to apply an inverse normalization operation (SPM8-deformation
field algorithm), using the variants between native and standardized space to bring
the normalized ROIs to that subject-specific space. Finally, the adjusted (native
space) ROIs were used for the fiber tracking. Additionally, three ROIs designed to
divide the brain in three heights in the axial plane were also transferred to each
subject space. The resultant fiber tracts were divided into three different regions,
allowing verification of diffusion alterations along the fiber length. We selected
the pyramidal tract, due to previous findings of areas of 22 The tract was divided
into inferior, atrophy in the motor cortex. middle and superior regions, and the DTI
data were acquired bilaterally. We also selected other tracts with automatic
segmentation implemented in the Neuroimaging Laboratory for this analysis: the body
of the corpus callosum, brainstem, uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, fornix, and
inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus. Statistical analysis was performed using a
paired t-test, comparing the whole group of patients to the paired control group.
Results Based on TBSS, there was no significant difference in FA/MD values between
patients and HC, neither in the whole-group analysis nor in the subgroup analysis.
ROI analysis showed no difference between FA values in either case (Table 2).
Tractography also revealed no changes in FA/MD in the total group. However, in the
left inferior pyramidal tract there was a 5 tendency of MD values to differ between
groups (p 0.05) (Tables 3 and 4). Discussion We performed an exploratory study to
evaluate the whole WM in CCD compared to HC. We were aiming to uncover areas that
might be involved but have not yet been studied. We found no significant difference
between FA/MD values in any analysis.<component x="311.81" y="80.9" width="254.09"

algorithms (ExploreDTI) obtain diffusion maps and an SPM8 new segment algorithm to
isolate a WM probabilistic map. Despite both analyses being conceptually equivalent,
the codes behind these techniques are completely independent, strengthening our
findings. Finally, we conducted a tractography study on the whole group only and
extracted FA/MD values for the pyramidal tract, body of corpus callosum, brainstem,
uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, fornix, and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, which
also did not uncover any significant differences in FA and MD values. Only the MD
values in the inferior left pyramidal tract tended to differ. However, considering
the small absolute difference in the values observed between the two groups and the
large number of comparisons made, we did not consider this a valid result. Our
results may sound intriguing, but in light of the current literature, they are not
necessarily controversial. DTI changes have not 11,12 yet been observed in BSP
compared to HC, but a recent study including patients with BOM and BSP revealed FA
reductions in the left anterior lobe of the cerebellum and the right precuneus of the
parietal lobe, and increases in MD were detected in the right lentiform 15 nucleus,

postcentral gyrus, and prefrontal cortex. In an ROI-based approach, the authors
described a WM microstructural abnormality in dystonia patients, which was observed
before, but not after, BoNT treatment. They hypothesized that the dynamic WM
microstructure changes provided preliminary proof of 23 an activity-dependent brain
WM plasticity. As mentioned previously, our image acquisition took place 1-2 weeks
after BoNT injections. The reasons for the discrepancies between our own and previous
8,13,23-25 results are probably the small sample size in some of the studies ;
8,11,13,14,23,24 the use of an ROI-based rather than a whole-brain approach, which
enhances the possibility of finding statistical differences but also increases the
chance of a type II error; and the different software used for imaging processing.
Whole-brain analysis may not provide the appropriate power to detect small
differences, and the lack of difference may just point towards a type II error.
Future studies should concentrate on WMtracts more relevant to dystonia
pathophysiology such as those in the cerebellum-thalamus-cortical circuits. Power
might also have been an issue in our subgroup analysis. Our results suggest that
there is no primary or major involvement of the WM in CCD. Further studies should
address functional abnormalities in these areas, or more relevant pre-selected white
matter tracts.<component x="43.82" y="92.75" width="254.09" height="285.75" page="5"

hyperkinetic movement disorders characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that
result in abnormal torsional movements and postures. Dystonia is often initiated or
exacerbated by 1 voluntary action and associated with excess muscle activation.
Blepharospasm (BSP) and cervical dystonia (CD) are the most common forms of
adult-onset dystonia; the term craniocervical dystonia (CCD) encompasses all of those

(DTI) works on the measurement of trends in random motion of water molecules in a
given medium. This technique allows for the visualization of microstructures and
quantifies water diffusion in tissues noninvasively. It is based on the theory that
the water found in the tissues exhibits properties of anisotropic 4 diffusion. DTI
provides information about the random displacement and passive diffusion of water
molecules on the directionality and integrity of fibers. It can demonstrate neuronal
loss through a decrease in diffusion anisotropy, shown by lower values of fractional
anisotropy (FA) and higher values of mean diffusivity (MD). FA quantifies the
preferred direction of diffusion of water molecules through white matter (WM) tracts,
and MD represents the magnitude of the 5-7 diffusion. DTI also allows for the
visualization of neural projections 8 The tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in
the central nervous system. technique performs whole-brain analysis by measuring
changes in water molecules in tissues and enables DTI sequence parameters to be 9,10
compared using statistical analysis. Previous DTI studies in CCD produced conflicting
results. In CD, DTI documented changes mainly in the circuit involving the cortex,
8,11-14 thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. In turn, patients with BSP and
blepharospasm + oromandibular dystonia (BOM) showed alterations in the cerebellum,
parietal lobe, lentiform nucleus, thalamus, 15 and insula. There has never been a
dedicated study of the WM in CCD; hence we performed DTI aiming to analyze the
microstructure of WM in patients with CCD compared to healthy controls

consecutively recruited from March 2010 until November 2013, at the Outpatient
Movement Disorders Clinic, the Dystonia Clinic, and the Neurogenetics Service at the
University of Campinas University Hospital. A total of 108 patients were screened. 40
subjects presented idiopathic CCD were included: 5 subjects with isolated BSP &#xA1;

CD (63.1 11.1), and 18 subjects with isolated CD &#xA1; (52.8 12.2). All subjects
underwent a detailed review of their clinical history, family history, and treatment.
A movement disorders specialist performed a neurological examination and assessed
subjects on the 16 Marsden-Fahn Scale. The exclusion criteria were the presence of
neurological abnormalities other than tremor; dystonia located in segments other than
the craniocervical region; presence of significant clinical comorbidities; history of
exposure to medications known to induce dystonia; abnormalities at neuroimaging; and

excluded 68 patients with idiopathic or genetic dystonia presenting in sites other

had a negative molecular test for DYT1and DYT6 mutations. We included 40 age- and
sex-matched HC without a family history of dystonia and with a normal neurological
examination. For each subject the same control was used for the total group analyses
and the subgroup analyses (Table 1). Since previous studies found differences as low
as 0.016 in FA values 17 to be significant, we hypothesized a standard deviation of
the difference of 0.03. For a sample of 40 subjects, the expected Statistical Power

then performed a subgroup analysis, based on dystonia body distribution. Images were
corrected for eddy currents using the eddycorrect tool from Oxford centre for

(http://www.fmrib.ox. ac.uk/fsl/), which is part of the Functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging of the Brain Software Library (FSL) software, version 4.1.4. We obtained maps
of FA using FDT. Voxelwise statistical analysis of the DTI data was carried out using
TBSS. In summary, FA images were created by fitting a tensor model to the raw
diffusion data using FDT, and then brain-extracted using the Brain Extraction Tool
(BET). All FA data were aligned into a common space with the nonlinear registration
tool (FNIRT), which uses a b-spline representation of the registration warp field.
Following this, the mean FA image was created and thinned to generate a mean FA
skeleton, which represents the center of all tracts common to the group. Each
subject's aligned FA data were then projected into this skeleton and the resulting
data fed 9,18 into the voxelwise cross-subject statistics. We performed a paired
Ttest to compare patients and HC, and the level of significance was set 9 at 0.05. We

tractography as a confirmatory analysis, evaluating the total group only and
extracting the FA/MD values. The tensor calculation of all DTI was carried out with
21 and fiber tractography using a semiautomatic determiExploreDTI nistic methodology,
briefly described below. ROIs to seed each tract were manually drawn on a normalized
template. This template was created with non-diffusion weighted images of 10 local
control subjects 5 5 (mean age 33 years; age range 22-47 years; 50% females) acquired
in the same MRI scanner, with the aim of improving anatomical matching to the study
sample. Sequentially, the method employs the three-dimensional deformation field
matrix of each subject to apply an inverse normalization operation (SPM8-deformation
field algorithm), using the variants between native and standardized space to bring
the normalized ROIs to that subject-specific space. Finally, the adjusted (native
space) ROIs were used for the fiber tracking. Additionally, three ROIs designed to
divide the brain in three heights in the axial plane were also transferred to each
subject space. The resultant fiber tracts were divided into three different regions,
allowing verification of diffusion alterations along the fiber length. We selected
the pyramidal tract, due to previous findings of areas of 22 The tract was divided
into inferior, atrophy in the motor cortex. middle and superior regions, and the DTI
data were acquired bilaterally. We also selected other tracts with automatic
segmentation implemented in the Neuroimaging Laboratory for this analysis: the body
of the corpus callosum, brainstem, uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, fornix, and
inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus. Statistical analysis was performed using a
paired t-test, comparing the whole group of patients to the paired control group.
Results Based on TBSS, there was no significant difference in FA/MD values between
patients and HC, neither in the whole-group analysis nor in the subgroup analysis.
ROI analysis showed no difference between FA values in either case (Table 2).
Tractography also revealed no changes in FA/MD in the total group. However, in the
left inferior pyramidal tract there was a 5 tendency of MD values to differ between
groups (p 0.05) (Tables 3 and 4). Discussion We performed an exploratory study to
evaluate the whole WM in CCD compared to HC. We were aiming to uncover areas that
might be involved but have not yet been studied. We found no significant difference
between FA/MD values in any analysis.<component x="311.81" y="80.9" width="254.09"

extracted FA/MD values for the pyramidal tract, body of corpus callosum, brainstem,
uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, fornix, and inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, which
also did not uncover any significant differences in FA and MD values. Only the MD
values in the inferior left pyramidal tract tended to differ. However, considering
the small absolute difference in the values observed between the two groups and the
large number of comparisons made, we did not consider this a valid result. Our
results may sound intriguing, but in light of the current literature, they are not
necessarily controversial. DTI changes have not 11,12 yet been observed in BSP

postcentral gyrus, and prefrontal cortex. In an ROI-based approach, the authors
described a WM microstructural abnormality in dystonia patients, which was observed
before, but not after, BoNT treatment. They hypothesized that the dynamic WM
microstructure changes provided preliminary proof of 23 an activity-dependent brain
WM plasticity. As mentioned previously, our image acquisition took place 1-2 weeks
after BoNT injections. The reasons for the discrepancies between our own and previous
8,13,23-25 results are probably the small sample size in some of the studies ;
8,11,13,14,23,24 the use of an ROI-based rather than a whole-brain approach, which
enhances the possibility of finding statistical differences but also increases the
chance of a type II error; and the different software used for imaging processing.
Whole-brain analysis may not provide the appropriate power to detect small
differences, and the lack of difference may just point towards a type II error.
Future studies should concentrate on WMtracts more relevant to dystonia
pathophysiology such as those in the cerebellum-thalamus-cortical circuits. Power
might also have been an issue in our subgroup analysis. Our results suggest that
there is no primary or major involvement of the WM in CCD. Further studies should
address functional abnormalities in these areas, or more relevant pre-selected white
matter tracts.<component x="43.82" y="92.75" width="254.09" height="285.75" page="5"
