School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare cancer
predisposition syndrome classically associated with remarkably early onset of cancer
in families with a typical spectrum of malignancies, including sarcoma, breast
cancer, brain tumors, and adrenocortical carcinoma. Because the risks of cancer
development are strikingly high for Li-Fraumeni syndrome, aggressive cancer
surveillance is often pursued in these individuals. However, optimal screening
methods and intervals for Li-Fraumeni syndrome have yet to be determined. In
addition, there may be a significant psychosocial burden to intensive cancer
surveillance and some prevention modalities. Here, we describe a case of a young
woman with a de novo mutation in TP53 and multiple malignancies, with her most recent
cancers found at early, curable stages due to aggressive cancer screening. The
potential benefits and risks of intensive cancer surveillance in hereditary cancer
syndromes is discussed. Observations of multiple, early-onset cancers in INTRODUCTION

Comprehensive Cancer Network &#x2020; (NCCN ) cancer surveillance consensus
guidelines for LiFraumeni syndrome include consideration of breast and colon cancer
screening starting at age 20 and an annual comprehensive physical exam, as well as
discussion of other screening modalities such as brain MRI and total body MRI. After
discussion of her screening options, our patient desired aggressive surveillance and
is being followed per Villani et al. [12] guidelines as described in Table 3. While
the intent of aggressive cancer screening is to help patients enjoy a prolonged,
healthy life with minimal cancer burden, there may be significant trade-off in
psychosocial burden for some patients related to aggressive surveillance. The common
occurrences of incidental findings on repeated screenings, associated "false
positive" scans leading to biopsy, and the anxiety of a possible cancer diagnosis can
lead to significant psychosocial distress and screening fatigue in some patients with
hereditary cancer syndromes. At the time of the discovery of her deleterious TP53
mutation, this patient expressed a sense of "exhaustion" about her clinical course
thus far and indicated her worry about how many times she would have to go through
cancer diagnosis and treatment before "enough was enough." This patient was
appropriately referred to a therapist by her genetic counselor and later reported
that she found this very helpful in coping with her fears and frustrations. Very
little exists in the literature specifically addressing psychosocial distress in
Li-Fraumeni syndrome, though one small study reported that 36 percent of TP53
carriers report unnecessary worry as a barrier to screening adherence [14]. However,
no significant difference in psychosocial distress was found between those undergoing
aggressive surveillance compared to those who were not [14]. It is essential that all
patients diagnosed with a hereditary cancer syndrome be counseled by their providers
about the potential benefits and the potential burden of cancer surveillance and be
offered support and counseling around potential psychosocial distress. CONCLUSIONS

typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, onset of first cancer has been
reported to be lower as well, some families with Li-Fraumeni cancer phenotypes do at

Comprehensive Cancer Network &#x2020; (NCCN ) cancer surveillance consensus
guidelines for LiFraumeni syndrome include consideration of breast and colon cancer
screening starting at age 20 and an annual comprehensive physical exam, as well as
discussion of other screening modalities such as brain MRI and total body MRI. After
discussion of her screening options, our patient desired aggressive surveillance and
is being followed per Villani et al. [12] guidelines as described in Table 3. While
the intent of aggressive cancer screening is to help patients enjoy a prolonged,
healthy life with minimal cancer burden, there may be significant trade-off in
psychosocial burden for some patients related to aggressive surveillance. The common
occurrences of incidental findings on repeated screenings, associated "false
positive" scans leading to biopsy, and the anxiety of a possible cancer diagnosis can
lead to significant psychosocial distress and screening fatigue in some patients with
hereditary cancer syndromes. At the time of the discovery of her deleterious TP53
mutation, this patient expressed a sense of "exhaustion" about her clinical course
thus far and indicated her worry about how many times she would have to go through
cancer diagnosis and treatment before "enough was enough." This patient was
appropriately referred to a therapist by her genetic counselor and later reported
that she found this very helpful in coping with her fears and frustrations. Very
little exists in the literature specifically addressing psychosocial distress in
Li-Fraumeni syndrome, though one small study reported that 36 percent of TP53
carriers report unnecessary worry as a barrier to screening adherence [14]. However,
no significant difference in psychosocial distress was found between those undergoing
aggressive surveillance compared to those who were not [14]. It is essential that all
patients diagnosed with a hereditary cancer syndrome be counseled by their providers
about the potential benefits and the potential burden of cancer surveillance and be
offered support and counseling around potential psychosocial distress. CONCLUSIONS
