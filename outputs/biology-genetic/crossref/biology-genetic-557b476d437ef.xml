Biological Oscillators The Circadian Clock The Earth's rotation results in
predictable daily variations of environmental conditions (light/dark, food,
temperature). Biological clocks give an unbiased estimation of time and allow
coordination of physiology in anticipation to recurring changes. Circadian clocks are
implicated in normal functioning of numerous systems (digestive, endocrine,
cellular). They control 24-h rhythms, termed as "circadian rhythms" (sleep, body
temperature, cortisol secretion&#xA0; ). &#x2026; An important milestone in the field
was the discovery of the mammalian circadian "conductor": 1, 2). From the molecular
standpoint, the the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN) ( SCN machinery
consists of feedback loops relying on clock genes. A main loop involves CLOCK and
BMAL1, which heterodimerize and activate the transcription of Period (Per1-2-3) and
Cryptochrome (Cry1-2) genes. PER:CRY proteins in turn inhibit their own transcription

essential loop is modulated by the REV-ERB - and ROR - - proteins, which operate a
negative &#x3B1; &#x3B2; &#x3B1; &#x3B2; &#x3B3; and positive feedback, respectively,
on Bmal1 transcription. This genetic network is also extensively regulated via
post-translational processes. The molecular clockwork acts autonomously and, in the
absence of resetting cues, oscillates with a period close to 24&#xA0;h; it is the
basis of circadian rhythmicity and defines the endogenous period of a clock (3). It
is synchronized to a sharp 24-h period by environmental parameters (light/dark,
feeding cycles, hormones). A rhythmic message integrating environmental informations
is then generated by the SCN, and redistributed to the entire organism to synchronize
physiological functions. Circadian rhythmicity and clock genes are not an exclusive
property of the SCN as clock genes are rhythmically expressed in nearly all cells.
Each 4, 5). individual cell can thus be regarded as a circadian clock ( The Cell
Cycle Cell cycle is the process leading to cell division. It consists of two critical
phases: the S phase, in which the cell replicates its DNA, and the M phase where it
divides (mitosis); they are preceded by growth phases G1 and G2, respectively.
Non-dividing (somatic) cells are in a quiescent state (G0). They may resume cell
division, depending on environmental parameters such as growth factors, 6, 7). to
enter G1 phase ( Progression of the cell cycle relies on transient and sequential
activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) forming complexes with cyclins (CCN).
Cell cycle successively depends on CCND/CDK4-6 (G1), CCNE/CDK2 (G1/S transition),
CCNA/ CDK2 (S), CCNA/CDK1 (S/G2 transition), and CCNB/CDK1 8-10)]. Activity of these
enzymatic complexes finely tunes [M - ( cell cycle duration, especially at critical
checkpoints. Association with CDK inhibitors (CKI-P16, P27, P21) or phosphorylation
by the kinase WEE1, inhibit activity of targeted CCN/CDK across the cycle. On the
other hand, they are activated by phosphatases such as CDC25A-B-C (11). These
activators or inhibitors are targets of proteins involved in DNA repair. Indeed, a
double-strand DNA break activates the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and
check-point kinase 2 (CHK2) proteins, while a single-strand break or a replication
error activate ataxia telangiectasia related 12, 13). These (ATR) and check-point
kinase 1 (CHK1) proteins ( complexes cause a cell cycle arrest by indirect induction
of CKI. From a dynamical point of view, the cell cycle can be modeled either as a
series of checkpoints ("domino" model) or as a biochemical oscillator where
successive waves of CCN/CDK activity control its progression (14-16). In the
following parts, we will use this second model as it recapitulates the rhythmic
properties of the cell cycle. Both cell cycle and molecular clocks display periodic
phases of activation and repression from transcriptional to post-translational 17).
Thus, they can be considered as biological oscillators levels ( coexisting in
dividing cells. The Circadian Gating Model In unicellular organisms, circadian
rhythms and cell division are considered as non-independent processes. In particular,
the circadian system controls timing of cell division both in prokaryotic and
eukaryotic species. This is the case in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus
and in the flagellate alga Euglena gracilis, where the molecular clock operates as a
"gating" and only allows cell division at specific circadian phases ( 18-20). Thus,
the circadian oscillator can be viewed as an additional checkpoint for mitosis. It
was tempting to extrapolate this phenomenon to other organisms; although some
research was conducted toward demonstration of circadian gating of the cell cycle in
mammalian cells, results led to controversial evidence. While a study from 2004
reported that the majority of cell divisions occur in three phases of the 4), two
more recent papers describe an absence circadian cycle ( of cell cycle regulation by
the circadian clock (21, 22). Dynamical Coupling Between Clock and Cell Cycle Faced
with these contradictions, we and others have recently investigated the circadian
clock-cell cycle connection by quantifying the dynamics of the two oscillators in
real time, in single live mammalian cells (23, 24). Both studies used the circadian
clock reporter REV-ERB :VENUS ( &#x3B1;4). For cell cycle, Bieler et&#xA0;al. scored
timing of division. We added a cell cycle reporter system [fluorescent
ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator, FUCCI; (25)] probing cell cycle
progression. These fluorescent markers were used to quantitatively determine the
properties of each oscillator in single NIH3T3 cells. Timelapse imaging combined to
extensive statistical analysis and modeling exposed the dynamical properties of these
biological oscillators (Figure&#xA0;1A). In cells where neither clock nor cell cycle
was synchronized by external cues, they appear robustly coupled, with a 1:1 ratio
between their respective periods, over a wide range of durations (18-27&#xA0; h;
Figures&#xA0; 1B,C). A clear shortening of the circadian period occurred in dividing
cells compared to non-dividing cells thus revealing an influence of cell cycle on the
clock. Mathematical analysis and stochastic modeling unambiguously showed that
coupling rather than gating governs cell cycle and circadian interaction in NIH3T3
cells. It also revealed that the clock reporter reproducibly peaked about 5&#xA0;h
after cell division. This feature is termed as phase locking (Figure&#xA0;1C).
Changing cell cycle duration impacted on circadian cycles, but 1:1 locking was
resilient to 23, 24). Additionally, inhibition of the cell cycle at such changes (
the G1/S or G2/M transitions lengthened circadian intervals and delayed division
phase. Bieler et&#xA0;al. looked at the reverse interaction by changing circadian
period. This did not affect cell cycle length but advanced division with respect to
circadian phase. The authors thus proposed a unidirectional coupling from the cell
cycle to the 23). circadian clock ( The above experiments were performed in absence
of external cues. However, in&#xA0;vivo cellular clocks are subjected to
synchronizing messages (e.g., corticosteroids, temperature). We therefore
investigated coupling after a 2&#xA0;h treatment with dexamethasone, which resets the
circadian clock. We observed two distinct dynamical behaviors coexisting within the
cell population. Whereas one sub-population kept a 1:1 phase locking, the ratio of
cell cycle and clock periods was fixed to 3:2 in the other one (i.e., 3 cell cycles
for 2 clock cycles). Moreover, when projecting the timing of mitosis across the whole
experiment, we observed a clear clustering of cell division suggesting that the cell
cycle was synchronized by physiological cues via the circadian clock. We thus
inferred a bidirectional coupling between the two oscillators, supported by
mathematical modeling (24). Although the team of Naef concluded to a unidirectional
coupling whereas we concluded to a bidirectional coupling, both studies led us to
reject the concept of "gating" of the cell cycle by the clock in mammalian cells,
usually put forward without theoretical 23, 24). In the end, it seems that the cell
cycle is capable support ( of impacting on the circadian clock and vice&#xA0;versa,
the dominant influence being dependent on the environment of the cell. Molecular
Coupling Between Clock and Cell Cycle Molecular mechanisms underlying progression of
the clock and cell cycle have been extensively studied. Yet, little is known about
candidates that could underlie coupling between the two oscillators. influence from
the Circadian Clock on the Cell Cycle The molecular clock impacts on the cell cycle,
by transcriptional control or direct protein-protein interactions. For instance, in
G1, the CKI P21 is transcriptionally regulated by REV-ERB and &#x3B1; ROR / (26). At
G1/S transition, NONO regulates the p16-Ink4A &#x3B1; &#x3B3; 27). Transcription
check-point gene in a PER-dependent fashion ( of the WEE1 kinase (G2/M transition) is
tightly controlled by the CLOCK:BMAL1 dimer (28). At the post-translational level,
CRY modulates CHK1/ATR (G1/S transition checkpoint) by interacting with TIMELESS
(TIM) in a time-of-day-dependent manner. PER and TIM also regulate the G2/M
transition via interactions with CHK2-ATM (12, 13, 29, 30). Other clock-controlled
cell cycle regulators include known oncogenes (c-Myc, Mdm2, and -catenin), cyclins
(CCND1, B, &#x3B2; and A), and tumor suppressor p53. Many key cell cycle regulators,
such as Cdk4, Itga6, Wnt3, LHx2, Tcf4, Sox 9, and Smad7 are also 31). This multitude
of interactions gives directly clock-regulated ( a reasonable explanation why loss of
coupling between clock and cell cycle may play a key role in carcinogenesis and
abnormal growth in&#xA0;vivo (see below). influence of the Cell Cycle on the
Circadian Clock Apart from transcription silencing occurring at mitosis (32), which
is bound to influence the circadian feedback loops, molecular evidence of cell
cycle-dependent control of the circadian clock is sparse. Nevertheless, DNA damage
can phase advance cellular and behavioral circadian rhythms in a dose- and
time-dependent manner. The underlying mechanism involves ATM-mediated damage
signaling, possibly through interaction with the PER and 33). TIM proteins ( More
recently, an impact of the tumor suppressors P53 and promyelocytic leukemia (PML)
proteins on circadian function was proposed: Per2 transcription is repressed by P53,
which prevents binding of CLOCK:BMAL1. At the post translational level, PML
physically interacts with PER2, and promotes its nuclear localization. These
molecular connections are translated into altered circadian behavior ( 34, 35). As a
whole, these results point to a global influence of cell cycle regulation on
circadian function. Among these molecular interactions, only p53 has been found to
impact on clock and cell cycle in a bidirectional way. Thus, it may participate in
coupling between the two oscillators, which remains to be confirmed. Cellular
Consequences of Coupling in Healthy Cells A major impact of clock and cell cycle
coupling on cell physiology resides in timed mitoses. For instance, about 1/6th of
human epidermal cells divide daily, mainly at night (36), which is determined by
intrinsic Bmal1 expression (37). Rhythmicity in cell cycle parameters was also found
in the hematopoietic and immune systems (spleen, thymus, bone marrow),
gastro-intestinal tract (colon, liver), skin, and cornea of rodents and/or humans
38). DNA synthesis and mitosis rhythmicity seem impervious ( to ablation of adrenals,
medulla, pituitary, or even SCN, although sometimes displaying altered
characteristics (38-40). Hence, if systemic circadian cues are required to coordinate
cell divisions in the whole organism, local clock/cell cycle coupling likely governs
rhythmic mitosis at the cellular and tissue levels. In line with this hypothesis,
different populations of epidermal stem cells were found to express clock genes in
opposite phases, which results in a differential propensity for activation. Specific
disruption of the circadian clock in these cells led to premature epidermal aging,
which confirms that local coupling is necessary 41). to ensure tissue integrity (
Coupling even manifests itself in a post-mitotic tissue such as the adult brain,
where quiescent neural progenitors in the hippocampus show rhythmic proliferation.
Per2 and Bmal1 play a critical role in this rhythmic neurogenesis, impacting on
cognitive function. Mathematical modeling pointed to clock-driven p21 expression as a
trigger for cell cycle progression through regulation 42). of the CCND/CDK4-6
complexes ( In the adult liver, only 1% of hepatocytes show rhythmic mitoses under
normal conditions. After partial hepatectomy, however, most of the remaining
hepatocytes enter cell cycle synchronously, in a clock-dependent manner, which will
restore liver mass within few days. In arrhythmic Cry deficient mice, liver
regeneration still occurs, 28). A more common although full recovery of liver mass is
delayed ( situation requiring controlled cell division at an adult age is wound
repair: after skin incision, wound healing defects were found in mice lacking NONO, a
possible link between clock and cell cycle. (27). Thus, crosstalk between the clock
and cell cycle oscillators is required for timed and optimal organization of cell
proliferation both in healthy tissue and in times of challenge such as regeneration.

interest of the interplay between the clock and cell cycle is that a dysfunction of

Cycle Deregulation Although mutations in clock genes are frequent in human cancer
cells, it is unclear whether it may be a primary cause of cancer development. Per2
mutant mice display tumor-prone phenotypes and deregulation of various cyclins,
protooncogenes, and tumor suppressors ( 45). On the other hand, Cry1/Cry2 KO mice do
not show increased cancer development after -irradiation (46). Thus, deregulation of
the core clock &#x3B3; cannot fully account for the observed phenotype in Per2 mutant
mice. Additionally, mutation of Bmal1 or Clock does not lead to 47, 48). These
results are subject enhanced cancer development ( &#x2212; &#x2212;/ &#x2212;

&#x2212; &#x2212; &#x2212;/ &#x2212; +/ Cry2 , and Bmal1 mice have increased
spontaneous Cry1 and radiation-induced tumor development ( 49). So it remains unclear
whether a mutation in clock genes is by itself sufficient to trigger cancer
development. These observed cancer-prone phenotypes might be due to a non-circadian
function of these genes. If clock gene mutations do not induce cancer per&#xA0;se,
systemic environmental disruption of the circadian function may impact on cancer
development and cell proliferation. Constant light exposure or ablation of the pineal
gland results in perturbation of endocrine rhythms and increase carcinogenesis in
liver and 50, 51). In line with these results, mammary glands of rodents ( circadian
disruption following SCN lesions or chronic jetlag increases proliferation of
implanted Glasgow osteosarcoma or pancreatic adenocarcinoma (52, 53). Chronic jetlag
also promotes tumor development in the liver of mice exposed to the hepatic
carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (54). The latter finding is of particular interest when
considering cancer development in humans. As already mentioned, circadian alterations
at the molecular level have been found in numerous human cancers. At the
epidemiological level, studies involving shift workers have associated circadian
disruption 31). Since 2007, with an increased risk of cancer development ( the
International Agency for Research on Cancer even listed "shiftwork that involves
circadian disruption" as a "probable carcinogen." Cell Cycle Deregulation and Cancer
Lead to Circadian Disruption Many human cancer cell lines (including breast,
prostate, colon, liver, and lung), which by definition show abnormal cell cycle
progression and proliferation, also display abnormal circadian 31). In the context of
bidirectional interaction gene expression ( between the clock and cell cycle
oscillators, it is tricky to decipher which alteration is the cause or consequence.
If mutations in cell cycle genes are the primary element, it will in turn impact on
the circadian clock. Another possibility is that cell cycle and circadian functions
will be synergistically disrupted as a consequence of their coupling. At the
physiological level, recent studies have explored circadian rhythmicity in metastatic
colorectal or breast cancer patients (rest activity and/or salivary cortisol
rhythms). All studies concluded to large disparities in behavioral and endocrine
rhythmicity in these patients, ranging from robust to absent rhythms. Interestingly,
the outcome of the disease in patients with damped or abnormal circadian rhythmicity
is generally unfavorable, independently of other prognostic 38). factors ( Circadian
Lifestyle and Slowing Down Tumor Progression: Perspectives of Coupling Temporal
restricted feeding (RF), also known as meal timing, powerfully entrains peripheral
clocks ( 55). It is also capable of restoring circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues
of other wise arrhythmic mice ( 56). Tumor cells often show abnormal circadian
rhythms in LD and ad&#xA0; libitum feeding conditions, but they are not blind to
cyclic metabolic cues. Two studies tested the impact of RF on growth rate of
implanted Glasgow osteosarcoma or P03 pancreatic adenocarcinoma in mice 57, 58). At
the physiological level, this treatment increased ( the amplitude of body temperature
rhythms, known to be a powerful circadian synchronizer ( 59, 60). Interestingly,
tumor size was significantly reduced and survival was prolonged in mice submitted to
RF. Thus, reinforcement of host's circadian rhythms may lead to improved
host-mediated tumor control or alteration of the tumor circadian clock, which in the
end slows down tumor progression. Looking at this data with the newly discovered
bidirectional coupling between clock and cell cycle, we would like to put forward the
possibility that the cell cycle may be synchronized/ slowed down through coupling
with the circadian clock. Hence, it would be possible to use a known circadian
synchronizer such as timed feeding or high-amplitude temperature cycles to reentrain
or reinforce the circadian clock in tumor cells. These cells tend to proliferate at a
high rate, with periods shorter than 24&#xA0;h. Entraining the circadian clock in
these cells could slow down cell cycle, through coupling between the two oscillators.
This would, in the end, delay tumor progression. Conclusion and Perspectives In
mammals, the circadian and cell cycle oscillators were long considered as two
completely independent entities, or were at best regarded as a circadian clock gating
cell cycle progression. These views are seriously challenged by the recently
established bidirectionality of clock and cell cycle interactions. At the moment,
only P53 has been identified as capable of impinging on both clock and cell cycle,
but its role in coupling needs to be confirmed. Given the complexity of these
oscillatory circuits, additional candidates likely exist, but remain to be found. In
terms of physiology, the consequences of coupling in healthy cells are obvious. But
coupling becomes critical when considering a pathology such as cancer, where
circadian and cell cycle phenomena are intertwined. The benefits of chrono38). They
therapeutics for cancer treatment is well established ( are a consequence of
circadian fluctuations in toxicity and efficacy of cancer drugs (and drug metabolism
in general). Considering that reinforcing the circadian clock through a change in
lifestyle (e.g., meal timing) is capable of slowing down tumor progression, probably
through coupling with the cell cycle, we may be able to propose individualized life
schedules that will potentiate the effect of chronotherapy, to reduce tumor
progression without additional pharmacological intervention. Not to say that
reinforcing circadian timing will also alleviate dampening of circadian rhythmicity,
which is often a complaint from cancer patients. This long-term perspective may have
a high impact on human health.<component x="45.34" y="73.96" width="245.99"

Biological Oscillators The Circadian Clock The Earth's rotation results in
predictable daily variations of environmental conditions (light/dark, food,
temperature). Biological clocks give an unbiased estimation of time and allow
coordination of physiology in anticipation to recurring changes. Circadian clocks are
implicated in normal functioning of numerous systems (digestive, endocrine,
cellular). They control 24-h rhythms, termed as "circadian rhythms" (sleep, body
temperature, cortisol secretion&#xA0; ). &#x2026; An important milestone in the field
was the discovery of the mammalian circadian "conductor": 1, 2). From the molecular
standpoint, the the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN) ( SCN machinery
consists of feedback loops relying on clock genes. A main loop involves CLOCK and
BMAL1, which heterodimerize and activate the transcription of Period (Per1-2-3) and
Cryptochrome (Cry1-2) genes. PER:CRY proteins in turn inhibit their own transcription
by direct interaction<component x="175.74" y="63.32" width="376.64" height="161.67"

essential loop is modulated by the REV-ERB - and ROR - - proteins, which operate a
negative &#x3B1; &#x3B2; &#x3B1; &#x3B2; &#x3B3; and positive feedback, respectively,
on Bmal1 transcription. This genetic network is also extensively regulated via
post-translational processes. The molecular clockwork acts autonomously and, in the
absence of resetting cues, oscillates with a period close to 24&#xA0;h; it is the
basis of circadian rhythmicity and defines the endogenous period of a clock (3). It
is synchronized to a sharp 24-h period by environmental parameters (light/dark,
feeding cycles, hormones). A rhythmic message integrating environmental informations
is then generated by the SCN, and redistributed to the entire organism to synchronize
physiological functions. Circadian rhythmicity and clock genes are not an exclusive
property of the SCN as clock genes are rhythmically expressed in nearly all cells.
Each 4, 5). individual cell can thus be regarded as a circadian clock ( The Cell
Cycle Cell cycle is the process leading to cell division. It consists of two critical
phases: the S phase, in which the cell replicates its DNA, and the M phase where it
divides (mitosis); they are preceded by growth phases G1 and G2, respectively.
Non-dividing (somatic) cells are in a quiescent state (G0). They may resume cell
division, depending on environmental parameters such as growth factors, 6, 7). to
enter G1 phase ( Progression of the cell cycle relies on transient and sequential
activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) forming complexes with cyclins (CCN).
Cell cycle successively depends on CCND/CDK4-6 (G1), CCNE/CDK2 (G1/S transition),
CCNA/ CDK2 (S), CCNA/CDK1 (S/G2 transition), and CCNB/CDK1 8-10)]. Activity of these
enzymatic complexes finely tunes [M - ( cell cycle duration, especially at critical
checkpoints. Association with CDK inhibitors (CKI-P16, P27, P21) or phosphorylation
by the kinase WEE1, inhibit activity of targeted CCN/CDK across the cycle. On the
other hand, they are activated by phosphatases such as CDC25A-B-C (11). These
activators or inhibitors are targets of proteins involved in DNA repair. Indeed, a
double-strand DNA break activates the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and
check-point kinase 2 (CHK2) proteins, while a single-strand break or a replication
error activate ataxia telangiectasia related 12, 13). These (ATR) and check-point
kinase 1 (CHK1) proteins ( complexes cause a cell cycle arrest by indirect induction
of CKI. From a dynamical point of view, the cell cycle can be modeled either as a
series of checkpoints ("domino" model) or as a biochemical oscillator where
successive waves of CCN/CDK activity control its progression (14-16). In the
following parts, we will use this second model as it recapitulates the rhythmic
properties of the cell cycle. Both cell cycle and molecular clocks display periodic
phases of activation and repression from transcriptional to post-translational 17).
Thus, they can be considered as biological oscillators levels ( coexisting in
dividing cells. The Circadian Gating Model In unicellular organisms, circadian
rhythms and cell division are considered as non-independent processes. In particular,
the circadian system controls timing of cell division both in prokaryotic and
eukaryotic species. This is the case in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus
and in the flagellate alga Euglena gracilis, where the molecular clock operates as a
"gating" and only allows cell division at specific circadian phases ( 18-20). Thus,
the circadian oscillator can be viewed as an additional checkpoint for mitosis. It
was tempting to extrapolate this phenomenon to other organisms; although some
research was conducted toward demonstration of circadian gating of the cell cycle in
mammalian cells, results led to controversial evidence. While a study from 2004
reported that the majority of cell divisions occur in three phases of the 4), two
more recent papers describe an absence circadian cycle ( of cell cycle regulation by
the circadian clock (21, 22). Dynamical Coupling Between Clock and Cell Cycle Faced
with these contradictions, we and others have recently investigated the circadian
clock-cell cycle connection by quantifying the dynamics of the two oscillators in
real time, in single live mammalian cells (23, 24). Both studies used the circadian
clock reporter REV-ERB :VENUS ( &#x3B1;4). For cell cycle, Bieler et&#xA0;al. scored
timing of division. We added a cell cycle reporter system [fluorescent
ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator, FUCCI; (25)] probing cell cycle
progression. These fluorescent markers were used to quantitatively determine the
properties of each oscillator in single NIH3T3 cells. Timelapse imaging combined to
extensive statistical analysis and modeling exposed the dynamical properties of these
biological oscillators (Figure&#xA0;1A). In cells where neither clock nor cell cycle
was synchronized by external cues, they appear robustly coupled, with a 1:1 ratio
between their respective periods, over a wide range of durations (18-27&#xA0; h;
Figures&#xA0; 1B,C). A clear shortening of the circadian period occurred in dividing
cells compared to non-dividing cells thus revealing an influence of cell cycle on the
clock. Mathematical analysis and stochastic modeling unambiguously showed that
coupling rather than gating governs cell cycle and circadian interaction in NIH3T3
cells. It also revealed that the clock reporter reproducibly peaked about 5&#xA0;h
after cell division. This feature is termed as phase locking (Figure&#xA0;1C).
Changing cell cycle duration impacted on circadian cycles, but 1:1 locking was
resilient to 23, 24). Additionally, inhibition of the cell cycle at such changes (
the G1/S or G2/M transitions lengthened circadian intervals and delayed division
phase. Bieler et&#xA0;al. looked at the reverse interaction by changing circadian
period. This did not affect cell cycle length but advanced division with respect to
circadian phase. The authors thus proposed a unidirectional coupling from the cell
cycle to the 23). circadian clock ( The above experiments were performed in absence
of external cues. However, in&#xA0;vivo cellular clocks are subjected to
synchronizing messages (e.g., corticosteroids, temperature). We therefore
investigated coupling after a 2&#xA0;h treatment with dexamethasone, which resets the
circadian clock. We observed two distinct dynamical behaviors coexisting within the
cell population. Whereas one sub-population kept a 1:1 phase locking, the ratio of
cell cycle and clock periods was fixed to 3:2 in the other one (i.e., 3 cell cycles
for 2 clock cycles). Moreover, when projecting the timing of mitosis across the whole
experiment, we observed a clear clustering of cell division suggesting that the cell
cycle was synchronized by physiological cues via the circadian clock. We thus
inferred a bidirectional coupling between the two oscillators, supported by
mathematical modeling (24). Although the team of Naef concluded to a unidirectional
coupling whereas we concluded to a bidirectional coupling, both studies led us to
reject the concept of "gating" of the cell cycle by the clock in mammalian cells,
usually put forward without theoretical 23, 24). In the end, it seems that the cell
cycle is capable support ( of impacting on the circadian clock and vice&#xA0;versa,
the dominant influence being dependent on the environment of the cell. Molecular
Coupling Between Clock and Cell Cycle Molecular mechanisms underlying progression of
the clock and cell cycle have been extensively studied. Yet, little is known about
candidates that could underlie coupling between the two oscillators. influence from
the Circadian Clock on the Cell Cycle The molecular clock impacts on the cell cycle,
by transcriptional control or direct protein-protein interactions. For instance, in
G1, the CKI P21 is transcriptionally regulated by REV-ERB and &#x3B1; ROR / (26). At
G1/S transition, NONO regulates the p16-Ink4A &#x3B1; &#x3B3; 27). Transcription
check-point gene in a PER-dependent fashion ( of the WEE1 kinase (G2/M transition) is
tightly controlled by the CLOCK:BMAL1 dimer (28). At the post-translational level,
CRY modulates CHK1/ATR (G1/S transition checkpoint) by interacting with TIMELESS
(TIM) in a time-of-day-dependent manner. PER and TIM also regulate the G2/M
transition via interactions with CHK2-ATM (12, 13, 29, 30). Other clock-controlled
cell cycle regulators include known oncogenes (c-Myc, Mdm2, and -catenin), cyclins
(CCND1, B, &#x3B2; and A), and tumor suppressor p53. Many key cell cycle regulators,
such as Cdk4, Itga6, Wnt3, LHx2, Tcf4, Sox 9, and Smad7 are also 31). This multitude
of interactions gives directly clock-regulated ( a reasonable explanation why loss of
coupling between clock and cell cycle may play a key role in carcinogenesis and
abnormal growth in&#xA0;vivo (see below). influence of the Cell Cycle on the
Circadian Clock Apart from transcription silencing occurring at mitosis (32), which
is bound to influence the circadian feedback loops, molecular evidence of cell
cycle-dependent control of the circadian clock is sparse. Nevertheless, DNA damage
can phase advance cellular and behavioral circadian rhythms in a dose- and
time-dependent manner. The underlying mechanism involves ATM-mediated damage
signaling, possibly through interaction with the PER and 33). TIM proteins ( More
recently, an impact of the tumor suppressors P53 and promyelocytic leukemia (PML)
proteins on circadian function was proposed: Per2 transcription is repressed by P53,
which prevents binding of CLOCK:BMAL1. At the post translational level, PML
physically interacts with PER2, and promotes its nuclear localization. These
molecular connections are translated into altered circadian behavior ( 34, 35). As a
whole, these results point to a global influence of cell cycle regulation on
circadian function. Among these molecular interactions, only p53 has been found to
impact on clock and cell cycle in a bidirectional way. Thus, it may participate in
coupling between the two oscillators, which remains to be confirmed. Cellular
Consequences of Coupling in Healthy Cells A major impact of clock and cell cycle
coupling on cell physiology resides in timed mitoses. For instance, about 1/6th of
human epidermal cells divide daily, mainly at night (36), which is determined by
intrinsic Bmal1 expression (37). Rhythmicity in cell cycle parameters was also found
in the hematopoietic and immune systems (spleen, thymus, bone marrow),
gastro-intestinal tract (colon, liver), skin, and cornea of rodents and/or humans
38). DNA synthesis and mitosis rhythmicity seem impervious ( to ablation of adrenals,
medulla, pituitary, or even SCN, although sometimes displaying altered
characteristics (38-40). Hence, if systemic circadian cues are required to coordinate
cell divisions in the whole organism, local clock/cell cycle coupling likely governs
rhythmic mitosis at the cellular and tissue levels. In line with this hypothesis,
different populations of epidermal stem cells were found to express clock genes in
opposite phases, which results in a differential propensity for activation. Specific
disruption of the circadian clock in these cells led to premature epidermal aging,
which confirms that local coupling is necessary 41). to ensure tissue integrity (
Coupling even manifests itself in a post-mitotic tissue such as the adult brain,
where quiescent neural progenitors in the hippocampus show rhythmic proliferation.
Per2 and Bmal1 play a critical role in this rhythmic neurogenesis, impacting on
cognitive function. Mathematical modeling pointed to clock-driven p21 expression as a
trigger for cell cycle progression through regulation 42). of the CCND/CDK4-6
complexes ( In the adult liver, only 1% of hepatocytes show rhythmic mitoses under
normal conditions. After partial hepatectomy, however, most of the remaining
hepatocytes enter cell cycle synchronously, in a clock-dependent manner, which will
restore liver mass within few days. In arrhythmic Cry deficient mice, liver
regeneration still occurs, 28). A more common although full recovery of liver mass is
delayed ( situation requiring controlled cell division at an adult age is wound
repair: after skin incision, wound healing defects were found in mice lacking NONO, a
possible link between clock and cell cycle. (27). Thus, crosstalk between the clock
and cell cycle oscillators is required for timed and optimal organization of cell
proliferation both in healthy tissue and in times of challenge such as regeneration.
importance of Coupling in Times of Challenge: From Healthy Cells to Pathology A major
interest of the interplay between the clock and cell cycle is that a dysfunction of
either system can lead to diseases such as<component x="45.34" y="130.96"

Cycle Deregulation Although mutations in clock genes are frequent in human cancer
cells, it is unclear whether it may be a primary cause of cancer development. Per2
mutant mice display tumor-prone phenotypes and deregulation of various cyclins,
protooncogenes, and tumor suppressors ( 45). On the other hand, Cry1/Cry2 KO mice do
not show increased cancer development after -irradiation (46). Thus, deregulation of
the core clock &#x3B3; cannot fully account for the observed phenotype in Per2 mutant
mice. Additionally, mutation of Bmal1 or Clock does not lead to 47, 48). These
results are subject enhanced cancer development ( &#x2212; &#x2212;/ &#x2212;

&#x2212; &#x2212; &#x2212;/ &#x2212; +/ Cry2 , and Bmal1 mice have increased
spontaneous Cry1 and radiation-induced tumor development ( 49). So it remains unclear
whether a mutation in clock genes is by itself sufficient to trigger cancer
development. These observed cancer-prone phenotypes might be due to a non-circadian
function of these genes. If clock gene mutations do not induce cancer per&#xA0;se,
systemic environmental disruption of the circadian function may impact on cancer
development and cell proliferation. Constant light exposure or ablation of the pineal
gland results in perturbation of endocrine rhythms and increase carcinogenesis in
liver and 50, 51). In line with these results, mammary glands of rodents ( circadian
disruption following SCN lesions or chronic jetlag increases proliferation of
implanted Glasgow osteosarcoma or pancreatic adenocarcinoma (52, 53). Chronic jetlag
also promotes tumor development in the liver of mice exposed to the hepatic
carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (54). The latter finding is of particular interest when
considering cancer development in humans. As already mentioned, circadian alterations
at the molecular level have been found in numerous human cancers. At the
epidemiological level, studies involving shift workers have associated circadian
disruption 31). Since 2007, with an increased risk of cancer development ( the
International Agency for Research on Cancer even listed "shiftwork that involves
circadian disruption" as a "probable carcinogen." Cell Cycle Deregulation and Cancer
Lead to Circadian Disruption Many human cancer cell lines (including breast,
prostate, colon, liver, and lung), which by definition show abnormal cell cycle
progression and proliferation, also display abnormal circadian 31). In the context of
bidirectional interaction gene expression ( between the clock and cell cycle
oscillators, it is tricky to decipher which alteration is the cause or consequence.
If mutations in cell cycle genes are the primary element, it will in turn impact on
the circadian clock. Another possibility is that cell cycle and circadian functions
will be synergistically disrupted as a consequence of their coupling. At the
physiological level, recent studies have explored circadian rhythmicity in metastatic
colorectal or breast cancer patients (rest activity and/or salivary cortisol
rhythms). All studies concluded to large disparities in behavioral and endocrine
rhythmicity in these patients, ranging from robust to absent rhythms. Interestingly,
the outcome of the disease in patients with damped or abnormal circadian rhythmicity
is generally unfavorable, independently of other prognostic 38). factors ( Circadian
Lifestyle and Slowing Down Tumor Progression: Perspectives of Coupling Temporal
restricted feeding (RF), also known as meal timing, powerfully entrains peripheral
clocks ( 55). It is also capable of restoring circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues
of other wise arrhythmic mice ( 56). Tumor cells often show abnormal circadian
rhythms in LD and ad&#xA0; libitum feeding conditions, but they are not blind to
cyclic metabolic cues. Two studies tested the impact of RF on growth rate of
implanted Glasgow osteosarcoma or P03 pancreatic adenocarcinoma in mice 57, 58). At
the physiological level, this treatment increased ( the amplitude of body temperature
rhythms, known to be a powerful circadian synchronizer ( 59, 60). Interestingly,
tumor size was significantly reduced and survival was prolonged in mice submitted to
RF. Thus, reinforcement of host's circadian rhythms may lead to improved
host-mediated tumor control or alteration of the tumor circadian clock, which in the
end slows down tumor progression. Looking at this data with the newly discovered
bidirectional coupling between clock and cell cycle, we would like to put forward the
possibility that the cell cycle may be synchronized/ slowed down through coupling
with the circadian clock. Hence, it would be possible to use a known circadian
synchronizer such as timed feeding or high-amplitude temperature cycles to reentrain
or reinforce the circadian clock in tumor cells. These cells tend to proliferate at a
high rate, with periods shorter than 24&#xA0;h. Entraining the circadian clock in
these cells could slow down cell cycle, through coupling between the two oscillators.
This would, in the end, delay tumor progression. Conclusion and Perspectives In
mammals, the circadian and cell cycle oscillators were long considered as two
completely independent entities, or were at best regarded as a circadian clock gating
cell cycle progression. These views are seriously challenged by the recently
established bidirectionality of clock and cell cycle interactions. At the moment,
only P53 has been identified as capable of impinging on both clock and cell cycle,
but its role in coupling needs to be confirmed. Given the complexity of these
oscillatory circuits, additional candidates likely exist, but remain to be found. In
terms of physiology, the consequences of coupling in healthy cells are obvious. But
coupling becomes critical when considering a pathology such as cancer, where
circadian and cell cycle phenomena are intertwined. The benefits of chrono38). They
therapeutics for cancer treatment is well established ( are a consequence of
circadian fluctuations in toxicity and efficacy of cancer drugs (and drug metabolism
in general). Considering that reinforcing the circadian clock through a change in
lifestyle (e.g., meal timing) is capable of slowing down tumor progression, probably
through coupling with the cell cycle, we may be able to propose individualized life
schedules that will potentiate the effect of chronotherapy, to reduce tumor
progression without additional pharmacological intervention. Not to say that
reinforcing circadian timing will also alleviate dampening of circadian rhythmicity,
which is often a complaint from cancer patients. This long-term perspective may have
a high impact on human health.<component x="45.34" y="73.96" width="245.99"
