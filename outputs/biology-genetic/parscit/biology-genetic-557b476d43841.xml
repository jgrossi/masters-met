High rates of extra-pair paternity (EPP) can be relatively common in passerines whereas low rates or absence of EPP are
often associated with taxa that are long-lived and exhibit obligatory paternal care. We examined EPP in an underrepresented category: passerine species with relatively long life spans (or low annual mortality rates). Specifically, we
studied EPP in New Zealand saddlebacks Philesturnus carunculatus and robins Petroica australis, two species with
unusually low annual mortality rates (6.5Á11% and 10Á20% respectively). No EPP (0%) was detected in saddlebacks (39
pairs, 202 offspring) and only one case of EPP (1.9%) was detected in robins (54 pairs, 198 offspring). Genetic
monogamy in these passerine species supports the hypothesis that low annual mortality rates play an important role in
explaining variation in rates of EPP across species.
The detection and frequency of extra-pair paternity (EPP)
in avian species is so widespread (e.g. 86% of all socially
monogamous passerine species are not genetically monogamous; Griffith et al. 2002) and its benefits so varied (e.g.
Petrie and Kempenaers 1998, Tregenza and Wedell 2000,
Griffith et al. 2002, Foerster et al. 2003), that recent
research has tried to identify factors explaining its absence
in some species (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al.
2002). More than 50% of inter-specific variation in EPP
can be explained by phylogeny, making the identification of
particular traits difficult (Owens and Bennett 1995, Arnold
and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). Nevertheless, the
degree of paternal care required and low annual mortality
rates (i.e. long life spans) appear to be key predictors of
genetic monogamy (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al.
2002). The need for paternal care to successfully raise
offspring affects whether a female will seek EPP and risk
reduced effort or even desertion by her social mate. Females
that can rear offspring with little or no paternal care (e.g.
many passerines), should be likely to seek EPP (Griffith
et al. 2002). If paternal care is essential (e.g. seabirds), rates
of EPP should be low. These theoretical predictions are
borne out by comparative analyses that have controlled for
the effect of phylogeny (Arnold and Owens 2002).
Similarly, phylogeny-based methods using evolutionarily
independent contrasts show that longevity explains 25% of
the variation in rates of EPP across species (Arnold and
Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). Males of short-lived
species should stay with their mate, even when paternity is
uncertain, because the probability of finding a new mate
and breeding again is low. In contrast, males of long-lived
species should never tolerate EPP because they have many
future opportunities in which to find new mates. Indeed,
inter-specific analyses demonstrate that species with annual
mortality rates below 30% usually have EPP rates below
20% (Mauck et al. 1999).
Phylogeny-based analyses have been constrained by
limited data for species with low annual mortality rates.
Most documented EPP for long-lived species exists for nonpasserines, especially species in which longevity and
obligatory paternal care co-occur (Appendix A in Arnold
and Owens 2002). Therefore correlations between longevity
and genetic monogamy are biased by certain taxonomic
groups and relatively little information is available for
passerines, a group that is usually short-lived. In their
dataset, Arnold and Owens (Appendix A, 2002) listed only
three passerine species with mortality rates below 20%,
while the remaining 39 species had values well above this
level.
In New Zealand, saddlebacks Philesturnus carunculatus
and robins Petroica australis are relatively long-lived
passerines when introduced predators are absent. Saddlebacks are known to live for 17Á21 years (Higgins et al.
2006) with estimated annual adult mortality ranging
between 6.5Á11% (Armstrong et al. 2005, I. Jamieson
unpubl. data). Robins can live up to 14 years (D.
Armstrong unpubl. data) with annual adult mortality rates
between 10Á20% (Dimond and Armstrong 2007, I.
Jamieson unpubl. data). We examined the frequency of
EPP in saddlebacks and robins over several seasons and for
robins, across several populations. We predict that low
annual mortality rates in both passerine species should
result in genetic monogamy.

Saddlebacks (80 g; Callaeidae), and robins (30 g; Petroicidae) are non-migratory, remain resident on their breeding
territories all year and become sexually mature in their first
year, although saddlebacks do not normally breed until
their second year. Each has a modal clutch size of two eggs
(range 1Á3) and normally lays 1Á2 clutches per season
(Higgins and Peter 2002, Higgins et al. 2006, I. Jamieson
unpubl. data). Both are socially monogamous with high
mate retention from one season to the next. Males provide
care by feeding females during incubation as well as the
nestlings and fledglings after hatch (Higgins and Peter
2002, Higgins et al. 2006). It is unknown whether paternal
care is required to successfully raise young in these species.
Study areas
Data on EPP were collected for saddlebacks from Ulva
Island and for robins from Ulva Island, the Doubtful
Islands, and the Eglinton Valley (a mainland site). Ulva
Island is a 270 ha reserve located near Stewart Island, where
saddlebacks (n 030) and robins (n 020) were reintroduced
in 2000 and 2001 after Norway rats Rattus norvegicus had
been eradicated in 1996. The three Doubtful Islands (130
ha, 25 ha and 137 ha) are located in Lake Te Anau and
similarly had 36 reintroduced robins in 2002 and 2003.
The Eglinton Valley is a mainland site located in Fiordland
National Park with one of the largest populations of robins
on the South Island (Heather and Robertson 1996).
Field methods
With few exceptions, all saddlebacks on Ulva Island and all
robins on Ulva and the Doubtful Islands were banded and
sampled for blood (Table 1). In the Eglinton Valley, a
subset of 30 pairs was captured for sampling (Table 1).
Each bird was banded with a numbered metal band and a
unique combination of colour bands for individual identification. Blood samples (100 ml) were taken from the
brachial vein and stored in lysis buffer (Seutin et al. 1991).
Birds were captured in mist-nets (saddlebacks and robins),
handnets, cage traps, and claptraps (robins only) or at the
nest (nestlings). All nests were monitored every 2Á4 d and
nestlings were banded and sampled approximately 4 d
before fledging. Where nests were too high to access,
offspring were caught once they had fledged but were still
being fed by their parents.
Lab methods
DNA was extracted using proteinase K (10 mg/ml) in a
Chelex 100 Resin solution (50 mg/ml). PCR reactions
were 10 ml and contained 1 ml DNA, 0.5 mM of each
primer, 0.8 mM dNTP, 1 ml buffer, 0.5 U Taq DNA
polymerase (AB Gene), an optimized concentration of
MgCl2, and for primers that produced shadow bands,
2.2 ml betaine (5.0 M) and 0.2 ml DMSO. The PCR profile
consisted of denaturation at 928 C for 3 min, followed by
35 cycles at annealing temperature for 30 s, 728 C for
1 min, and 928 C for 1 min followed by one final annealing
step for 30 s and extension at 728 C for 4 min. DNA
fragments were examined on 6Á10% vertical, non-denaturing
or 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. For denaturing gels,
10 pmols of reverse primers were radioactively end-labelled
in 10 ml reaction volumes containing 5 mCi of [g33P-ATP],
2.5 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (Bioline), and 1X kinase
buffer (Bioline). Individuals expressing all known alleles
were run on every gel as size standards and on nondenaturing gels, molecular rulers (10 or 20 bp ladders) were
used as additional size standards. Saddlebacks and robins
were genotyped at 12 and 10 microsatellite loci respectively,
each with 2 to 9 alleles (Table 2). Further details on genetic
analyses are in Taylor et al. (2007) and Boessenkool et al.
(2007).

breeding adults. To examine rates of EPP, individuals were
organized into family groups consisting of parents and all
offspring produced by the pair across all years. EPP was
considered to have occurred if offspring had alleles not
present in their parents at two or more loci. To account for
null alleles/mutations and prevent overestimation of EPP,
EPP was not counted if discrepancies between parent and
offspring genotypes occurred at a single locus (Ulva Island
robins: n 04; saddlebacks: n 01; Pemberton et al. 1995).
All mismatches were checked by re-amplifying DNA from
the parents and chick(s) and running the samples in
adjacent lanes. For each species, EPP rates were calculated
by dividing the number of pairs in which EPP occurred by
all pairs.

There were no significant deviations from HWE (P B0.05)
for either saddlebacks or robins. Significant LD occurred
for one saddleback locus pair (CK5A4B and Pcc26; P 0
0.001). Total exclusionary power for saddlebacks was 0.934
(12 loci) and 0.921 (11 loci; CK5A4B excluded), for robins
it was 0.980 (10 loci).
In saddlebacks, no EPP was detected using 1-6 years of
data for 39 pairs and a total of 202 offspring (Table 1). In
robins, there were two instances of EPP in one brood
(rate 01.9%) across three populations, 54 pairs, 198
offspring and 1Á4 years of data (Table 1). EPP occurred
in the Eglinton population (2004/05) for both chicks in the
same clutch with mismatches at five loci (none of the
sampled neighbouring males were more compatible than
the social male). No EPP was detected for robins on Ulva or
the Doubtful Islands.
Low levels of genetic variation in saddlebacks (Taylor
et al. 2007, Taylor and Jamieson 2008) have resulted in
microsatellite markers with low polymorphism. Consequently, saddleback exclusionary power is lower than
optimal and the one offspring with a single locus mismatch
could be an extra-pair young. Robin microsatellite markers
had much higher exclusionary power than saddleback
markers, nevertheless, the four single locus mismatch robin
young could be extra-pair young. Nonetheless, our results
indicate that EPP is very rare in saddlebacks and robins
regardless of whether single locus mismatch young are
included or not.

Discussion

<bodyText confidence="0.9977402">
Although both polyandry and polygyny have been reported
on rare occasions in New Zealand robins and in one
instance a male robin paired with and fed the offspring of a
female that had lost her mate (Higgins and Peters 2002),
social monogamy is the norm and, according to our results,
strict genetic monogamy appears to be the rule for both
saddlebacks and robins. A previous study on robins using
minisatellite DNA also found no evidence of EPP (Ardern
et al. 1997), although sample sizes were small and no data
on adult mortality rates were given.
Information on EPP is important for on-going field
studies of saddlebacks and robins. Both species are
threatened endemics in New Zealand and part of longterm studies examining translocation success and inbreeding
depression in wild populations. With known genetic
monogamy, field observations of breeding pairs at the
nest site can be used to accurately construct pedigrees and
estimate reproductive success.
Our results are also important for inter-specific analyses
investigating the prevalence and potential causes of
avian EPP. At present, little data exist for rates of EPP in

long-lived passerine species. Previous research indicated that
species with annual mortality rates below 30% should also
show low levels of EPP (Mauck et al. 1999). Both
saddlebacks and robins have mortality rates well below
30% and have correspondingly low levels of EPP (0% and
1.9%). These results expand the range of passerine species
with low annual mortality and known rates of EPP and
should help to reduce the taxonomic bias evident in earlier
inter-specific analyses. Although alternative explanations
may exist for the occurrence of genetic monogamy in our
study species (e.g. Petrie et al. 1998, Griffith 2000) our data
are consistent with the hypothesis that low annual mortality
rates play an important role in explaining low rates of EPP
across species.
Publication of a large number of studies that could be
incorporated into cross-species analyses has done much to
clarify the causes of inter-specific variation in rates of EPP
(Owens and Bennett 1995, Mauck et al. 1999, Arnold and
Owens 2002). Cross-species studies have shown that two of
the most important life history traits are longevity and
paternal care (Griffith et al. 2002). Unfortunately, these
traits appear to be closely correlated in many species
(Westneat and Stewart 2003). In addition to seabirds
(Arnold and Owens 2002), long life spans occur jointly
with obligatory paternal care in owls (Arsenault et al. 2002,
Saladin et al. 2007), parrots (Masello et al. 2002), vultures
(Decker et al. 1993), and corvids (Henderson et al. 2000).
Determining the importance of low mortality rate versus
obligatory paternal care will depend on future studies in
species where these traits do not co-occur or where their
effect can be distinguished.

Discussion Although both polyandry and polygyny have been reported on rare occasions in New Zealand robins and in one instance a male robin paired with and fed the offspring of a female that had lost her mate (Higgins and Peters 2002), social monogamy is the norm and, according to our results, strict genetic monogamy appears to be the rule for both saddlebacks and robins. A previous study on robins using minisatellite DNA also found no evidence of EPP (Ardern et al. 1997), although sample sizes were small and no data on adult mortality rates were given. Information on EPP is important for on-going field studies of saddlebacks and robins. Both species are threatened endemics in New Zealand and part of longterm studies examining translocation success and inbreeding depression in wild populations. With known genetic monogamy, field observations of breeding pairs at the nest site can be used to accurately construct pedigrees and estimate reproductive success. Our results are also important for inter-specific analyses investigating the prevalence and potential caus</context>

In their dataset, Arnold and Owens (Appendix A, 2002) listed only three passerine species with mortality rates below 20%, while the remaining 39 species had values well above this level. In New Zealand, saddlebacks Philesturnus carunculatus and robins Petroica australis are relatively long-lived passerines when introduced predators are absent. Saddlebacks are known to live for 17Á21 years (Higgins et al. 2006) with estimated annual adult mortality ranging between 6.5Á11% (Armstrong et al. 2005, I. Jamieson unpubl. data).

The detection and frequency of extra-pair paternity (EPP) in avian species is so widespread (e.g. 86% of all socially monogamous passerine species are not genetically monogamous; Griffith et al. 2002) and its benefits so varied (e.g. Petrie and Kempenaers 1998, Tregenza and Wedell 2000, Griffith et al. 2002, Foerster et al. 2003), that recent research has tried to identify factors explaining its absence in some species (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). More than 50% of inter-specific variation in EPP can be explained by phylogeny, making the identification of particular traits difficult (Owens and Bennett 1995, Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). Nevertheless, the degree of paternal care required and low annual mortality rates (i.e. long life spans) appear to be key predictors of genetic monogamy (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). The need for paternal care to successfully raise offspring affects whether a female will seek EPP and risk reduced effort or even desertion by her social mate. Females</context>

In contrast, males of long-lived species should never tolerate EPP because they have many future opportunities in which to find new mates. Indeed, inter-specific analyses demonstrate that species with annual mortality rates below 30% usually have EPP rates below 20% (Mauck et al. 1999). Phylogeny-based analyses have been constrained by limited data for species with low annual mortality rates. Most documented EPP for long-lived species exists for nonpasserines, especially species in which longevity and obligatory paternal care co-occur (Appendix A in Arnold and Owens 2002). Therefore correlations between longevity and genetic monogamy are biased by certain taxonomic groups and relatively little information is available for passerines, a group that is usually short-lived. In their dataset, Arnold and Owens (Appendix A, 2002) listed only three passerine species with mortality rates below 20%, while the remaining 39 species had values well above this level.

Although alternative explanations may exist for the occurrence of genetic monogamy in our study species (e.g. Petrie et al. 1998, Griffith 2000) our data are consistent with the hypothesis that low annual mortality rates play an important role in explaining low rates of EPP across species. Publication of a large number of studies that could be incorporated into cross-species analyses has done much to clarify the causes of inter-specific variation in rates of EPP (Owens and Bennett 1995, Mauck et al. 1999, Arnold and Owens 2002). Cross-species studies have shown that two of the most important life history traits are longevity and paternal care (Griffith et al. 2002). Unfortunately, these traits appear to be closely correlated in many species (Westneat and Stewart 2003). In addition to seabirds (Arnold and Owens 2002), long life spans occur jointly with obligatory paternal care in owls (Arsenault et al. 2002, Saladin et al. 2007), parrots (Masello et al. 2002), vultures (Decker et al. 1993), and corvids (Henderson et al. 2000).

Genetic monogamy in these passerine species supports the hypothesis that low annual mortality rates play an important role in explaining variation in rates of EPP across species. The detection and frequency of extra-pair paternity (EPP) in avian species is so widespread (e.g. 86% of all socially monogamous passerine species are not genetically monogamous; Griffith et al. 2002) and its benefits so varied (e.g. Petrie and Kempenaers 1998, Tregenza and Wedell 2000, Griffith et al. 2002, Foerster et al. 2003), that recent research has tried to identify factors explaining its absence in some species (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). More than 50% of inter-specific variation in EPP can be explained by phylogeny, making the identification of particular traits difficult (Owens and Bennett 1995, Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002).

Previous research indicated that species with annual mortality rates below 30% should also show low levels of EPP (Mauck et al. 1999). Both saddlebacks and robins have mortality rates well below 30% and have correspondingly low levels of EPP (0% and 1.9%). These results expand the range of passerine species with low annual mortality and known rates of EPP and should help to reduce the taxonomic bias evident in earlier inter-specific analyses. Although alternative explanations may exist for the occurrence of genetic monogamy in our study species (e.g. Petrie et al. 1998, Griffith 2000) our data are consistent with the hypothesis that low annual mortality rates play an important role in explaining low rates of EPP across species. Publication of a large number of studies that could be incorporated into cross-species analyses has done much to clarify the causes of inter-specific variation in rates of EPP (Owens and Bennett 1995, Mauck et al. 1999, Arnold and Owens 2002).

Females that can rear offspring with little or no paternal care (e.g. many passerines), should be likely to seek EPP (Griffith et al. 2002). If paternal care is essential (e.g. seabirds), rates of EPP should be low. These theoretical predictions are borne out by comparative analyses that have controlled for the effect of phylogeny (Arnold and Owens 2002). Similarly, phylogeny-based methods using evolutionarily independent contrasts show that longevity explains 25% of the variation in rates of EPP across species (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). Males of short-lived species should stay with their mate, even when paternity is uncertain, because the probability of finding a new mate and breeding again is low. In contrast, males of long-lived species should never tolerate EPP because they have many future opportunities in which to find new mates. Indeed, inter-specific analyses demonstrate that species with annual mortality rates below 30% usually have EPP rates below 20% (Mauck et al. 1999). Phylogeny-based analyses have been constrained by limited data for species with low annual mortality rates. Most documented EPP for long-lived sp</context>

In addition to seabirds (Arnold and Owens 2002), long life spans occur jointly with obligatory paternal care in owls (Arsenault et al. 2002, Saladin et al. 2007), parrots (Masello et al. 2002), vultures (Decker et al. 1993), and corvids (Henderson et al. 2000). Determining the importance of low mortality rate versus obligatory paternal care will depend on future studies in species where these traits do not co-occur or where their effect can be distinguished.

Ulva Island is a 270 ha reserve located near Stewart Island, where saddlebacks (n 030) and robins (n 020) were reintroduced in 2000 and 2001 after Norway rats Rattus norvegicus had been eradicated in 1996. The three Doubtful Islands (130 ha, 25 ha and 137 ha) are located in Lake Te Anau and similarly had 36 reintroduced robins in 2002 and 2003. The Eglinton Valley is a mainland site located in Fiordland National Park with one of the largest populations of robins on the South Island (Heather and Robertson 1996). Field methods With few exceptions, all saddlebacks on Ulva Island and all robins on Ulva and the Doubtful Islands were banded and sampled for blood (Table 1). In the Eglinton Valley, a subset of 30 pairs was captured for sampling (Table 1). Each bird was banded with a numbered metal band and a unique combination of colour bands for individual identification. Blood samples (100 ml) were taken from the brachial vein and stored in lysis buffer (Seutin et al. 1991).

We predict that low annual mortality rates in both passerine species should result in genetic monogamy. 579 Methods Study species Saddlebacks (80 g; Callaeidae), and robins (30 g; Petroicidae) are non-migratory, remain resident on their breeding territories all year and become sexually mature in their first year, although saddlebacks do not normally breed until their second year. Each has a modal clutch size of two eggs (range 1Á3) and normally lays 1Á2 clutches per season (Higgins and Peter 2002, Higgins et al. 2006, I. Jamieson unpubl. data). Both are socially monogamous with high mate retention from one season to the next. Males provide care by feeding females during incubation as well as the nestlings and fledglings after hatch (Higgins and Peter 2002, Higgins et al. 2006). It is unknown whether paternal care is required to successfully raise young in these species.

Therefore correlations between longevity and genetic monogamy are biased by certain taxonomic groups and relatively little information is available for passerines, a group that is usually short-lived. In their dataset, Arnold and Owens (Appendix A, 2002) listed only three passerine species with mortality rates below 20%, while the remaining 39 species had values well above this level. In New Zealand, saddlebacks Philesturnus carunculatus and robins Petroica australis are relatively long-lived passerines when introduced predators are absent. Saddlebacks are known to live for 17Á21 years (Higgins et al. 2006) with estimated annual adult mortality ranging between 6.5Á11% (Armstrong et al. 2005, I. Jamieson unpubl. data). Robins can live up to 14 years (D. Armstrong unpubl. data) with annual adult mortality rates between 10Á20% (Dimond and Armstrong 2007, I. Jamieson unpubl. data).

In addition to seabirds (Arnold and Owens 2002), long life spans occur jointly with obligatory paternal care in owls (Arsenault et al. 2002, Saladin et al. 2007), parrots (Masello et al. 2002), vultures (Decker et al. 1993), and corvids (Henderson et al. 2000). Determining the importance of low mortality rate versus obligatory paternal care will depend on future studies in species where these traits do not co-occur or where their effect can be distinguished.

Males of short-lived species should stay with their mate, even when paternity is uncertain, because the probability of finding a new mate and breeding again is low. In contrast, males of long-lived species should never tolerate EPP because they have many future opportunities in which to find new mates. Indeed, inter-specific analyses demonstrate that species with annual mortality rates below 30% usually have EPP rates below 20% (Mauck et al. 1999). Phylogeny-based analyses have been constrained by limited data for species with low annual mortality rates. Most documented EPP for long-lived species exists for nonpasserines, especially species in which longevity and obligatory paternal care co-occur (Appendix A in Arnold and Owens 2002). Therefore correlations between longevity and genetic monogamy are biased by certain taxonomic groups and relatively little information is available for passerines, a group that is usually short-lived. In their dataset, Arnold and Owens (Appendix A, 2002) listed only three passerine species with mortality </context>

With known genetic monogamy, field observations of breeding pairs at the nest site can be used to accurately construct pedigrees and estimate reproductive success. Our results are also important for inter-specific analyses investigating the prevalence and potential causes of avian EPP. At present, little data exist for rates of EPP in 581 long-lived passerine species. Previous research indicated that species with annual mortality rates below 30% should also show low levels of EPP (Mauck et al. 1999). Both saddlebacks and robins have mortality rates well below 30% and have correspondingly low levels of EPP (0% and 1.9%). These results expand the range of passerine species with low annual mortality and known rates of EPP and should help to reduce the taxonomic bias evident in earlier inter-specific analyses. Although alternative explanations may exist for the occurrence of genetic monogamy in our study species (e.g. Petrie et al. 1998, Griffith 2000) our data are consistent with the hypothesis that low annual mortality rates play an important role in explaining low rates of EPP across spec</context>

More than 50% of inter-specific variation in EPP can be explained by phylogeny, making the identification of particular traits difficult (Owens and Bennett 1995, Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). Nevertheless, the degree of paternal care required and low annual mortality rates (i.e. long life spans) appear to be key predictors of genetic monogamy (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). The need for paternal care to successfully raise offspring affects whether a female will seek EPP and risk reduced effort or even desertion by her social mate. Females that can rear offspring with little or no paternal care (e.g. many passerines), should be likely to seek EPP (Griffith et al. 2002).

EPP was considered to have occurred if offspring had alleles not present in their parents at two or more loci. To account for null alleles/mutations and prevent overestimation of EPP, EPP was not counted if discrepancies between parent and offspring genotypes occurred at a single locus (Ulva Island robins: n 04; saddlebacks: n 01; Pemberton et al. 1995).

Field methods With few exceptions, all saddlebacks on Ulva Island and all robins on Ulva and the Doubtful Islands were banded and sampled for blood (Table 1). In the Eglinton Valley, a subset of 30 pairs was captured for sampling (Table 1). Each bird was banded with a numbered metal band and a unique combination of colour bands for individual identification. Blood samples (100 ml) were taken from the brachial vein and stored in lysis buffer (Seutin et al. 1991). Birds were captured in mist-nets (saddlebacks and robins), handnets, cage traps, and claptraps (robins only) or at the nest (nestlings). All nests were monitored every 2Á4 d and nestlings were banded and sampled approximately 4 d before fledging. Where nests were too high to access, offspring were caught once they had fledged but were still being fed by their parents. Lab methods DNA was extracted using proteinase K (10 mg/ml) in a Chelex 100 Resin solution (50 mg/ml). PCR reactions were 10 ml and contained 1 ml DNA, 0.5 mM of each primer, 0.8 mM dNTP, 1 ml buffer, 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (</context>

In saddlebacks, no EPP was detected using 1-6 years of data for 39 pairs and a total of 202 offspring (Table 1). In robins, there were two instances of EPP in one brood (rate 01.9%) across three populations, 54 pairs, 198 offspring and 1Á4 years of data (Table 1). EPP occurred in the Eglinton population (2004/05) for both chicks in the same clutch with mismatches at five loci (none of the sampled neighbouring males were more compatible than the social male). No EPP was detected for robins on Ulva or the Doubtful Islands. Low levels of genetic variation in saddlebacks (Taylor et al. 2007, Taylor and Jamieson 2008) have resulted in microsatellite markers with low polymorphism. Consequently, saddleback exclusionary power is lower than optimal and the one offspring with a single locus mismatch could be an extra-pair young. Robin microsatellite markers had much higher exclusionary power than saddleback markers, nevertheless, the four single locus mismatch robin young could be extra-pair young. Nonetheless, our results indicate that EPP is very rare in saddlebacks and robins regardless of whether single locus mismatch young are included or not.

For denaturing gels, 10 pmols of reverse primers were radioactively end-labelled in 10 ml reaction volumes containing 5 mCi of [g33P-ATP], 2.5 units T4 polynucleotide kinase (Bioline), and 1X kinase buffer (Bioline). Individuals expressing all known alleles were run on every gel as size standards and on nondenaturing gels, molecular rulers (10 or 20 bp ladders) were used as additional size standards. Saddlebacks and robins were genotyped at 12 and 10 microsatellite loci respectively, each with 2 to 9 alleles (Table 2). Further details on genetic analyses are in Taylor et al.

No EPP (0%) was detected in saddlebacks (39 pairs, 202 offspring) and only one case of EPP (1.9%) was detected in robins (54 pairs, 198 offspring). Genetic monogamy in these passerine species supports the hypothesis that low annual mortality rates play an important role in explaining variation in rates of EPP across species. The detection and frequency of extra-pair paternity (EPP) in avian species is so widespread (e.g. 86% of all socially monogamous passerine species are not genetically monogamous; Griffith et al. 2002) and its benefits so varied (e.g. Petrie and Kempenaers 1998, Tregenza and Wedell 2000, Griffith et al. 2002, Foerster et al. 2003), that recent research has tried to identify factors explaining its absence in some species (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). More than 50% of inter-specific variation in EPP can be explained by phylogeny, making the identification of particular traits difficult (Owens and Bennett 1995, Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). Nevertheless, the degree of paternal care required and low annual mortality rates (i.e. long life spans) appear to be key predictors of genetic monogamy (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002).

Publication of a large number of studies that could be incorporated into cross-species analyses has done much to clarify the causes of inter-specific variation in rates of EPP (Owens and Bennett 1995, Mauck et al. 1999, Arnold and Owens 2002). Cross-species studies have shown that two of the most important life history traits are longevity and paternal care (Griffith et al. 2002). Unfortunately, these traits appear to be closely correlated in many species (Westneat and Stewart 2003). In addition to seabirds (Arnold and Owens 2002), long life spans occur jointly with obligatory paternal care in owls (Arsenault et al. 2002, Saladin et al. 2007), parrots (Masello et al. 2002), vultures (Decker et al. 1993), and corvids (Henderson et al. 2000). Determining the importance of low mortality rate versus obligatory paternal care will depend on future studies in species where these traits do not co-occur or where their effect can be distinguished.
