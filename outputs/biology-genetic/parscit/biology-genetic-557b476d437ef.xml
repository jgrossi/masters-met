Uncontrolled cell proliferation is one of the key features leading to cancer. Seminal works
in chronobiology have revealed that disruption of the circadian timing system in mice,
either by surgical, genetic, or environmental manipulation, increased tumor development.
In humans, shift work is a risk factor for cancer. Based on these observations, the link
between the circadian clock and cell cycle has become intuitive. But despite identification
of molecular connections between the two processes, the influence of the clock on
the dynamics of the cell cycle has never been formally observed. Recently, two studies
combining single live cell imaging with computational methods have shed light on robust
coupling between clock and cell cycle oscillators. We recapitulate here these novel findings
and integrate them with earlier results in both healthy and cancerous cells. Moreover, we
propose that the cell cycle may be synchronized or slowed down through coupling with
the circadian clock, which results in reduced tumor growth. More than ever, systems
biology has become instrumental to understand the dynamic interaction between the
circadian clock and cell cycle, which is critical in cellular coordination and for diseases
such as cancer.

Clock and Cell Cycle, 2 Biological Oscillators
The Circadian Clock
The Earth’s rotation results in predictable daily variations of environmental conditions (light/dark,
food, temperature). Biological clocks give an unbiased estimation of time and allow coordination of
physiology in anticipation to recurring changes.
Circadian clocks are implicated in normal functioning of numerous systems (digestive, endocrine,
cellular). They control 24-h rhythms, termed as “circadian rhythms” (sleep, body temperature, cortisol
secretion …).
An important milestone in the field was the discovery of the mammalian circadian “conductor”:
the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus (SCN) (1, 2). From the molecular standpoint, the

SCN machinery consists of feedback loops relying on clock genes. A main loop involves CLOCK and
BMAL1, which heterodimerize and activate the transcription of Period (Per1–2–3) and Cryptochrome
(Cry1–2) genes. PER:CRY proteins in turn inhibit their own transcription by direct interaction

Clock and cell cycle coupling
with CLOCK:BMAL1. This essential loop is modulated by the
REV-ERBα–β and RORα–β–γ proteins, which operate a negative
and positive feedback, respectively, on Bmal1 transcription. This
genetic network is also extensively regulated via post-translational
processes. The molecular clockwork acts autonomously and, in
the absence of resetting cues, oscillates with a period close to 24 h;
it is the basis of circadian rhythmicity and defines the endogenous
period of a clock (3). It is synchronized to a sharp 24-h period by
environmental parameters (light/dark, feeding cycles, hormones).
A rhythmic message integrating environmental informations is
then generated by the SCN, and redistributed to the entire organism to synchronize physiological functions. Circadian rhythmicity and clock genes are not an exclusive property of the SCN as
clock genes are rhythmically expressed in nearly all cells. Each
individual cell can thus be regarded as a circadian clock (4, 5).
circadian system controls timing of cell division both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. This is the case in the cyanobacterium
Synechococcus elongatus and in the flagellate alga Euglena gracilis,
where the molecular clock operates as a “gating” and only allows cell
division at specific circadian phases (18–20). Thus, the circadian
oscillator can be viewed as an additional checkpoint for mitosis.
It was tempting to extrapolate this phenomenon to other organisms; although some research was conducted toward demonstration of circadian gating of the cell cycle in mammalian cells, results
led to controversial evidence. While a study from 2004 reported
that the majority of cell divisions occur in three phases of the
circadian cycle (4), two more recent papers describe an absence
of cell cycle regulation by the circadian clock (21, 22).

Dynamical Coupling Between Clock and

The Cell Cycle

Cell cycle is the process leading to cell division. It consists of two
critical phases: the S phase, in which the cell replicates its DNA,
and the M phase where it divides (mitosis); they are preceded by
growth phases G1 and G2, respectively. Non-dividing (somatic)
cells are in a quiescent state (G0). They may resume cell division,
depending on environmental parameters such as growth factors,
to enter G1 phase (6, 7).
Progression of the cell cycle relies on transient and sequential
activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) forming complexes with cyclins (CCN). Cell cycle successively depends on

[M – (8–10)]. Activity of these enzymatic complexes finely tunes
cell cycle duration, especially at critical checkpoints. Association
with CDK inhibitors (CKI–P16, P27, P21) or phosphorylation by
the kinase WEE1, inhibit activity of targeted CCN/CDK across
the cycle. On the other hand, they are activated by phosphatases
such as CDC25A–B–C (11). These activators or inhibitors are targets of proteins involved in DNA repair. Indeed, a double-strand
DNA break activates the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
and check-point kinase 2 (CHK2) proteins, while a single-strand
break or a replication error activate ataxia telangiectasia related
(ATR) and check-point kinase 1 (CHK1) proteins (12, 13). These
complexes cause a cell cycle arrest by indirect induction of CKI.
From a dynamical point of view, the cell cycle can be modeled
either as a series of checkpoints (“domino” model) or as a biochemical oscillator where successive waves of CCN/CDK activity
control its progression (14–16). In the following parts, we will
use this second model as it recapitulates the rhythmic properties
of the cell cycle.
Both cell cycle and molecular clocks display periodic phases of
activation and repression from transcriptional to post-translational
levels (17). Thus, they can be considered as biological oscillators
coexisting in dividing cells.
Faced with these contradictions, we and others have recently
investigated the circadian clock-cell cycle connection by quantifying the dynamics of the two oscillators in real time, in single live
mammalian cells (23, 24). Both studies used the circadian clock
reporter REV-ERBα:VENUS (4). For cell cycle, Bieler et al. scored
timing of division. We added a cell cycle reporter system [fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator, FUCCI; (25)]
probing cell cycle progression. These fluorescent markers were
used to quantitatively determine the properties of each oscillator
in single NIH3T3 cells. Timelapse imaging combined to extensive
statistical analysis and modeling exposed the dynamical properties
of these biological oscillators (Figure 1A).
In cells where neither clock nor cell cycle was synchronized
by external cues, they appear robustly coupled, with a 1:1 ratio
between their respective periods, over a wide range of durations
(18–27 h; Figures 1B,C). A clear shortening of the circadian
period occurred in dividing cells compared to non-dividing cells
thus revealing an influence of cell cycle on the clock. Mathematical
analysis and stochastic modeling unambiguously showed that
coupling rather than gating governs cell cycle and circadian
interaction in NIH3T3 cells. It also revealed that the clock reporter
reproducibly peaked about 5 h after cell division. This feature is
termed as phase locking (Figure 1C). Changing cell cycle duration impacted on circadian cycles, but 1:1 locking was resilient to
such changes (23, 24). Additionally, inhibition of the cell cycle at
the G1/S or G2/M transitions lengthened circadian intervals and
delayed division phase. Bieler et al. looked at the reverse interaction
by changing circadian period. This did not affect cell cycle length
but advanced division with respect to circadian phase. The authors
thus proposed a unidirectional coupling from the cell cycle to the
circadian clock (23).
The above experiments were performed in absence of external
cues. However, in vivo cellular clocks are subjected to synchronizing messages (e.g., corticosteroids, temperature). We therefore
investigated coupling after a 2 h treatment with dexamethasone,
which resets the circadian clock. We observed two distinct dynamical behaviors coexisting within the cell population. Whereas one
sub-population kept a 1:1 phase locking, the ratio of cell cycle
and clock periods was fixed to 3:2 in the other one (i.e., 3 cell

cycles for 2 clock cycles). Moreover, when projecting the timing of
mitosis across the whole experiment, we observed a clear clustering
of cell division suggesting that the cell cycle was synchronized
by physiological cues via the circadian clock. We thus inferred a
bidirectional coupling between the two oscillators, supported by
mathematical modeling (24).
Although the team of Naef concluded to a unidirectional
coupling whereas we concluded to a bidirectional coupling, both
studies led us to reject the concept of “gating” of the cell cycle by the
clock in mammalian cells, usually put forward without theoretical
support (23, 24). In the end, it seems that the cell cycle is capable
of impacting on the circadian clock and vice versa, the dominant
influence being dependent on the environment of the cell.
binding of CLOCK:BMAL1. At the post translational level, PML
physically interacts with PER2, and promotes its nuclear localization. These molecular connections are translated into altered
circadian behavior (34, 35). As a whole, these results point to a
global influence of cell cycle regulation on circadian function.
Among these molecular interactions, only p53 has been found
to impact on clock and cell cycle in a bidirectional way. Thus, it
may participate in coupling between the two oscillators, which
remains to be confirmed.

Cellular Consequences of Coupling in

A major impact of clock and cell cycle coupling on cell physiology resides in timed mitoses. For instance, about 1/6th of human
epidermal cells divide daily, mainly at night (36), which is
determined by intrinsic Bmal1 expression (37). Rhythmicity in
cell cycle parameters was also found in the hematopoietic and
immune systems (spleen, thymus, bone marrow), gastro-intestinal
tract (colon, liver), skin, and cornea of rodents and/or humans
(38). DNA synthesis and mitosis rhythmicity seem impervious
to ablation of adrenals, medulla, pituitary, or even SCN, although
sometimes displaying altered characteristics (38–40). Hence, if
systemic circadian cues are required to coordinate cell divisions in
the whole organism, local clock/cell cycle coupling likely governs
rhythmic mitosis at the cellular and tissue levels.
In line with this hypothesis, different populations of epidermal
stem cells were found to express clock genes in opposite phases,
which results in a differential propensity for activation. Specific
disruption of the circadian clock in these cells led to premature
epidermal aging, which confirms that local coupling is necessary
to ensure tissue integrity (41).
Coupling even manifests itself in a post-mitotic tissue such as
the adult brain, where quiescent neural progenitors in the hippocampus show rhythmic proliferation. Per2 and Bmal1 play a
critical role in this rhythmic neurogenesis, impacting on cognitive
function. Mathematical modeling pointed to clock-driven p21
expression as a trigger for cell cycle progression through regulation
of the CCND/CDK4–6 complexes (42).
In the adult liver, only 1% of hepatocytes show rhythmic mitoses
under normal conditions. After partial hepatectomy, however, most
of the remaining hepatocytes enter cell cycle synchronously, in a
clock-dependent manner, which will restore liver mass within few
days. In arrhythmic Cry deficient mice, liver regeneration still occurs,
although full recovery of liver mass is delayed (28). A more common
situation requiring controlled cell division at an adult age is wound
repair: after skin incision, wound healing defects were found in mice
lacking NONO, a possible link between clock and cell cycle. (27).
Thus, crosstalk between the clock and cell cycle oscillators is
required for timed and optimal organization of cell proliferation
both in healthy tissue and in times of challenge such as regeneration.

Molecular mechanisms underlying progression of the clock and
cell cycle have been extensively studied. Yet, little is known about
candidates that could underlie coupling between the two oscillators.
Influence from the Circadian Clock on
the Cell Cycle
The molecular clock impacts on the cell cycle, by transcriptional
control or direct protein–protein interactions. For instance, in
G1, the CKI P21 is transcriptionally regulated by REV-ERBα and
RORα/γ (26). At G1/S transition, NONO regulates the p16-Ink4A
check-point gene in a PER-dependent fashion (27). Transcription
of the WEE1 kinase (G2/M transition) is tightly controlled by the
CLOCK:BMAL1 dimer (28).
At the post-translational level, CRY modulates CHK1/ATR
(G1/S transition checkpoint) by interacting with TIMELESS (TIM)
in a time-of-day-dependent manner. PER and TIM also regulate the
G2/M transition via interactions with CHK2-ATM (12, 13, 29, 30).
Other clock-controlled cell cycle regulators include known
oncogenes (c-Myc, Mdm2, and β-catenin), cyclins (CCND1, B,
and A), and tumor suppressor p53. Many key cell cycle regulators,
such as Cdk4, Itga6, Wnt3, LHx2, Tcf4, Sox 9, and Smad7 are also
directly clock-regulated (31). This multitude of interactions gives
a reasonable explanation why loss of coupling between clock and
cell cycle may play a key role in carcinogenesis and abnormal
growth in vivo (see below).
Influence of the Cell Cycle on the Circadian
Clock
Apart from transcription silencing occurring at mitosis (32), which
is bound to influence the circadian feedback loops, molecular
evidence of cell cycle-dependent control of the circadian clock
is sparse. Nevertheless, DNA damage can phase advance cellular
and behavioral circadian rhythms in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. The underlying mechanism involves ATM-mediated
damage signaling, possibly through interaction with the PER and
TIM proteins (33).
More recently, an impact of the tumor suppressors P53 and
promyelocytic leukemia (PML) proteins on circadian function was
proposed: Per2 transcription is repressed by P53, which prevents

endocrine rhythmicity in these patients, ranging from robust
to absent rhythms. Interestingly, the outcome of the disease
in patients with damped or abnormal circadian rhythmicity
is generally unfavorable, independently of other prognostic
factors (38).
Although mutations in clock genes are frequent in human
cancer cells, it is unclear whether it may be a primary cause of
cancer development. Per2 mutant mice display tumor-prone
phenotypes and deregulation of various cyclins, protooncogenes, and tumor suppressors (45). On the other hand,
Cry1/Cry2 KO mice do not show increased cancer development
after γ-irradiation (46). Thus, deregulation of the core clock
cannot fully account for the observed phenotype in Per2 mutant
mice. Additionally, mutation of Bmal1 or Clock does not lead to
enhanced cancer development (47, 48). These results are subject
to debate, as a more recent study showed that Per1−/−Per2−/−,
Cry1−/−Cry2−/−, and Bmal1−/+ mice have increased spontaneous
and radiation-induced tumor development (49). So it remains
unclear whether a mutation in clock genes is by itself sufficient
to trigger cancer development. These observed cancer-prone
phenotypes might be due to a non-circadian function of
these genes.
If clock gene mutations do not induce cancer per se, systemic
environmental disruption of the circadian function may impact
on cancer development and cell proliferation. Constant light
exposure or ablation of the pineal gland results in perturbation
of endocrine rhythms and increase carcinogenesis in liver and
mammary glands of rodents (50, 51). In line with these results,
circadian disruption following SCN lesions or chronic jetlag
increases proliferation of implanted Glasgow osteosarcoma or
pancreatic adenocarcinoma (52, 53). Chronic jetlag also promotes
tumor development in the liver of mice exposed to the hepatic
carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (54).
The latter finding is of particular interest when considering cancer development in humans. As already mentioned,
circadian alterations at the molecular level have been found in
numerous human cancers. At the epidemiological level, studies
involving shift workers have associated circadian disruption
with an increased risk of cancer development (31). Since 2007,
the International Agency for Research on Cancer even listed
“shiftwork that involves circadian disruption” as a “probable
carcinogen.”
Circadian Lifestyle and Slowing Down Tumor
Progression: Perspectives of Coupling
Temporal restricted feeding (RF), also known as meal timing,
powerfully entrains peripheral clocks (55). It is also capable
of restoring circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues of otherwise arrhythmic mice (56). Tumor cells often show abnormal
circadian rhythms in LD and ad libitum feeding conditions,
but they are not blind to cyclic metabolic cues. Two studies
tested the impact of RF on growth rate of implanted Glasgow
osteosarcoma or P03 pancreatic adenocarcinoma in mice
(57, 58). At the physiological level, this treatment increased
the amplitude of body temperature rhythms, known to be a
powerful circadian synchronizer (59, 60). Interestingly, tumor
size was significantly reduced and survival was prolonged in
mice submitted to RF. Thus, reinforcement of host’s circadian
rhythms may lead to improved host-mediated tumor control or
alteration of the tumor circadian clock, which in the end slows
down tumor progression.
Looking at this data with the newly discovered bidirectional
coupling between clock and cell cycle, we would like to put
forward the possibility that the cell cycle may be synchronized/
slowed down through coupling with the circadian clock. Hence,
it would be possible to use a known circadian synchronizer such
as timed feeding or high-amplitude temperature cycles to reentrain or reinforce the circadian clock in tumor cells. These cells
tend to proliferate at a high rate, with periods shorter than 24 h.
Entraining the circadian clock in these cells could slow down cell
cycle, through coupling between the two oscillators. This would,
in the end, delay tumor progression.

In mammals, the circadian and cell cycle oscillators were
long considered as two completely independent entities, or
were at best regarded as a circadian clock gating cell cycle
progression. These views are seriously challenged by the
recently established bidirectionality of clock and cell cycle
interactions. At the moment, only P53 has been identified as
capable of impinging on both clock and cell cycle, but its role
in coupling needs to be confirmed. Given the complexity of
these oscillatory circuits, additional candidates likely exist,
but remain to be found.
In terms of physiology, the consequences of coupling in
healthy cells are obvious. But coupling becomes critical when
considering a pathology such as cancer, where circadian and
cell cycle phenomena are intertwined. The benefits of chronotherapeutics for cancer treatment is well established (38). They
are a consequence of circadian fluctuations in toxicity and
efficacy of cancer drugs (and drug metabolism in general).

Many human cancer cell lines (including breast, prostate, colon,
liver, and lung), which by definition show abnormal cell cycle
progression and proliferation, also display abnormal circadian
gene expression (31). In the context of bidirectional interaction
between the clock and cell cycle oscillators, it is tricky to decipher
which alteration is the cause or consequence. If mutations in cell
cycle genes are the primary element, it will in turn impact on the
circadian clock. Another possibility is that cell cycle and circadian
functions will be synergistically disrupted as a consequence of
their coupling.
At the physiological level, recent studies have explored
circadian rhythmicity in metastatic colorectal or breast cancer patients (rest activity and/or salivary cortisol rhythms).

schedules that will potentiate the effect of chronotherapy, to
reduce tumor progression without additional pharmacological intervention. Not to say that reinforcing circadian timing
will also alleviate dampening of circadian rhythmicity, which
is often a complaint from cancer patients. This long-term
perspective may have a high impact on human health.

Cellular Consequences of Coupling in Healthy Cells A major impact of clock and cell cycle coupling on cell physiology resides in timed mitoses. For instance, about 1/6th of human epidermal cells divide daily, mainly at night (36), which is determined by intrinsic Bmal1 expression (37). Rhythmicity in cell cycle parameters was also found in the hematopoietic and immune systems (spleen, thymus, bone marrow), gastro-intestinal tract (colon, liver), skin, and cornea of rodents and/or humans (38). DNA synthesis and mitosis rhythmicity seem impervious to ablation of adrenals, medulla, pituitary, or even SCN, although sometimes displaying altered characteristics (38–40). Hence, if systemic circadian cues are required to coordinate cell divisions in the whole organism, local clock/cell cycle coupling likely governs rhythmic mitosis at the cellular and tissue levels. In line with this hypothesis, different populations of epidermal stem cells were found to express clock genes in opposite phases, which results in a differential propensity for activation.

Clock and cell cycle coupling Circadian Disruption and Cell Cycle Deregulation endocrine rhythmicity in these patients, ranging from robust to absent rhythms. Interestingly, the outcome of the disease in patients with damped or abnormal circadian rhythmicity is generally unfavorable, independently of other prognostic factors (38). Although mutations in clock genes are frequent in human cancer cells, it is unclear whether it may be a primary cause of cancer development. Per2 mutant mice display tumor-prone phenotypes and deregulation of various cyclins, protooncogenes, and tumor suppressors (45). On the other hand, Cry1/Cry2 KO mice do not show increased cancer development after γ-irradiation (46). Thus, deregulation of the core clock cannot fully account for the observed phenotype in Per2 mutant mice. Additionally, mutation of Bmal1 or Clock does not lead to enhanced cancer development (47, 48). These results are subj</context>

At the moment, only P53 has been identified as capable of impinging on both clock and cell cycle, but its role in coupling needs to be confirmed. Given the complexity of these oscillatory circuits, additional candidates likely exist, but remain to be found. In terms of physiology, the consequences of coupling in healthy cells are obvious. But coupling becomes critical when considering a pathology such as cancer, where circadian and cell cycle phenomena are intertwined. The benefits of chronotherapeutics for cancer treatment is well established (38). They are a consequence of circadian fluctuations in toxicity and efficacy of cancer drugs (and drug metabolism in general). Considering that reinforcing the circadian clock through a Cell Cycle Deregulation and Cancer Lead to Circadian Disruption Many human cancer cell lines (including breast, prostate, colon, liver, and lung), which by definition show abnormal cell cycle progression and proliferation, also display abnormal circadian gene expression (31). In the context of bidirectional interaction between the clock and cell cycle oscillators, it is tricky to decipher which alteration is the</context>

This genetic network is also extensively regulated via post-translational processes. The molecular clockwork acts autonomously and, in the absence of resetting cues, oscillates with a period close to 24 h; it is the basis of circadian rhythmicity and defines the endogenous period of a clock (3). It is synchronized to a sharp 24-h period by environmental parameters (light/dark, feeding cycles, hormones). A rhythmic message integrating environmental informations is then generated by the SCN, and redistributed to the entire organism to synchronize physiological functions. Circadian rhythmicity and clock genes are not an exclusive property of the SCN as clock genes are rhythmically expressed in nearly all cells. Each individual cell can thus be regarded as a circadian clock (4, 5). circadian system controls timing of cell division both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. This is the </context>

Hence, if systemic circadian cues are required to coordinate cell divisions in the whole organism, local clock/cell cycle coupling likely governs rhythmic mitosis at the cellular and tissue levels. In line with this hypothesis, different populations of epidermal stem cells were found to express clock genes in opposite phases, which results in a differential propensity for activation. Specific disruption of the circadian clock in these cells led to premature epidermal aging, which confirms that local coupling is necessary to ensure tissue integrity (41). Coupling even manifests itself in a post-mitotic tissue such as the adult brain, where quiescent neural progenitors in the hippocampus show rhythmic proliferation. Per2 and Bmal1 play a critical role in this rhythmic neurogenesis, impacting on cognitive function. Mathematical modeling pointed to clock-driven p21 expression as a trigger for cell cycle progression through regulation of the CCND/CDK4–6 complexes (42). In the adult liver, only 1% of hepatocytes show rhythmic mitoses under normal conditions. After partial hepatectomy, however, most of the remaining hepatocytes enter cell cycle sy</context>

Mathematical modeling pointed to clock-driven p21 expression as a trigger for cell cycle progression through regulation of the CCND/CDK4–6 complexes (42). In the adult liver, only 1% of hepatocytes show rhythmic mitoses under normal conditions. After partial hepatectomy, however, most of the remaining hepatocytes enter cell cycle synchronously, in a clock-dependent manner, which will restore liver mass within few days. In arrhythmic Cry deficient mice, liver regeneration still occurs, although full recovery of liver mass is delayed (28). A more common situation requiring controlled cell division at an adult age is wound repair: after skin incision, wound healing defects were found in mice lacking NONO, a possible link between clock and cell cy</context>
