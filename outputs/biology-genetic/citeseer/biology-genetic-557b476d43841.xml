				<p>High rates of extra-pair paternity (EPP) can be relatively common in passerines whereas low rates or absence of EPP are often associated with taxa that are long-lived and exhibit obligatory paternal care. We examined EPP in an under-represented category: passerine species with relatively long life spans (or low annual mortality rates). Specifically, we studied EPP in New Zealand saddlebacks Philesturnus carunculatus and robins Petroica australis, two species with unusually low annual mortality rates (6.5Á11% and 10Á20% respectively). No EPP (0%) was detected in saddlebacks (39 pairs, 202 offspring) and only one case of EPP (1.9%) was detected in robins (54 pairs, 198 offspring). Genetic monogamy in these passerine species supports the hypothesis that low annual mortality rates play an important role in explaining variation in rates of EPP across species.</p>

In New Zealand, saddlebacks Philesturnus carunculatus and robins Petroica australis are relatively long-lived passerines when introduced predators are absent. Saddlebacks are known to live for 1721 years (Higgins et al. 2006) with estimated annual adult mortality ranging between 6.511% (Armstrong et al. 2005, I. Jamieson unpubl. data). Robins can live up to 14 years (D. Armstrong unpubl. data) with annual adult mortality rates between 1020% (Dimond and Armstrong 2007, I. Jamieson unpubl. data). We examined the frequency of EPP in saddlebacks and robins over several seasons and for robins, across several populations. We predict that low annual mortality rates in both passerine species should result in genetic monogamy. 579 Methods Study species Saddlebacks (80 g; Callaeidae), and robins (30 g; Petroicidae) are non-migratory, remain resident on their breeding territories all year and become sexually mature in their first year, although saddlebacks do not normally breed until their second year.

Genetic monogamy in these passerine species supports the hypothesis that low annual mortality rates play an important role in explaining variation in rates of EPP across species. The detection and frequency of extra-pair paternity (EPP) in avian species is so widespread (e.g.86% of all socially monogamous passerine species are not genetically monogamous; Griffith et al. 2002) and its benefits so varied (e.g. Petrie and Kempenaers 1998, Tregenza and Wedell 2000, Griffith et al. 2002, Foerster et al. 2003), that recent research has tried to identify factors explaining its absence in some species (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). More than 50% of inter-specific variation in EPP can be explained by phylogeny, making the identification of particular traits difficult (Owens and Bennett 1995, Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002).

Previous research indicated that species with annual mortality rates below 30% should also show low levels of EPP (Mauck et al. 1999). Both saddlebacks and robins have mortality rates well below 30% and have correspondingly low levels of EPP (0% and 1.9%). These results expand the range of passerine species with low annual mortality and known rates of EPP and should help to reduce the taxonomic bias evident in earlier inter-specific analyses. Although alternative explanations may exist for the occurrence of genetic monogamy in our study species (e.g. Petrie et al. 1998, Griffith 2000) our data are consistent with the hypothesis that low annual mortality rates play an important role in explaining low rates of EPP across species.

Females that can rear offspring with little or no paternal care (e.g. many passerines), should be likely to seek EPP (Griffith et al. 2002). If paternal care is essential (e.g. seabirds), rates of EPP should be low. These theoretical predictions are borne out by comparative analyses that have controlled for the effect of phylogeny (Arnold and Owens 2002). Similarly, phylogeny-based methods using evolutionarily independent contrasts show that longevity explains 25% of the variation in rates of EPP across species (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). Males of short-lived species should stay with their mate, even when paternity is uncertain, because the probability of finding a new mate and breeding again is low. In contrast, males of long-lived species should never tolerate EPP because they have many future opportunities in which to find new mates. Indeed, inter-specific analyses demonstrate that species with annual mortality rates below 30% usually have EPP rates below 20% (Mauck et al. 1999). Phylogeny-based analyses have been constrained by limited data for species with low annual mortality rates. Most documented EPP for long-lived sp</context>

We predict that low annual mortality rates in both passerine species should result in genetic monogamy. 579 Methods Study species Saddlebacks (80 g; Callaeidae), and robins (30 g; Petroicidae) are non-migratory, remain resident on their breeding territories all year and become sexually mature in their first year, although saddlebacks do not normally breed until their second year. Each has a modal clutch size of two eggs (range 13) and normally lays 12 clutches per season (Higgins and Peter 2002, Higgins et al. 2006, I. Jamieson unpubl. data). Both are socially monogamous with high mate retention from one season to the next. Males provide care by feeding females during incubation as well as the nestlings and fledglings after hatch (Higgins and Peter 2002, Higgins et al. 2006). It is unknown whether paternal care is required to successfully raise young in these species. Study areas Data on EPP were collected for saddlebacks from Ulva Island and for robins from Ulva Island, the Doubtful Islands, and the Eglinton Valley (a mainland site).

Therefore correlations between longevity and genetic monogamy are biased by certain taxonomic groups and relatively little information is available for passerines, a group that is usually short-lived. In their dataset, Arnold and Owens (Appendix A, 2002) listed only three passerine species with mortality rates below 20%, while the remaining 39 species had values well above this level. In New Zealand, saddlebacks Philesturnus carunculatus and robins Petroica australis are relatively long-lived passerines when introduced predators are absent. Saddlebacks are known to live for 1721 years (Higgins et al. 2006) with estimated annual adult mortality ranging between 6.511% (Armstrong et al. 2005, I. Jamieson unpubl. data). Robins can live up to 14 years (D. Armstrong unpubl. data) with annual adult mortality rates between 1020% (Dimond and Armstrong 2007, I. Jamieson unpubl. data). We examined the frequency of EPP in saddlebacks and robins over several seasons and for robins, across several populations.

Cross-species studies have shown that two of the most important life history traits are longevity and paternal care (Griffith et al. 2002). Unfortunately, these traits appear to be closely correlated in many species (Westneat and Stewart 2003). In addition to seabirds (Arnold and Owens 2002), long life spans occur jointly with obligatory paternal care in owls (Arsenault et al. 2002, Saladin et al. 2007), parrots (Masello et al. 2002), vultures (Decker et al. 1993), and corvids (Henderson et al. 2000). Determining the importance of low mortality rate versus obligatory paternal care will depend on future studies in species where these traits do not co-occur or where their effect can be distinguished.

Males of short-lived species should stay with their mate, even when paternity is uncertain, because the probability of finding a new mate and breeding again is low. In contrast, males of long-lived species should never tolerate EPP because they have many future opportunities in which to find new mates. Indeed, inter-specific analyses demonstrate that species with annual mortality rates below 30% usually have EPP rates below 20% (Mauck et al. 1999). Phylogeny-based analyses have been constrained by limited data for species with low annual mortality rates. Most documented EPP for long-lived species exists for nonpasserines, especially species in which longevity and obligatory paternal care co-occur (Appendix A in Arnold and Owens 2002). Therefore correlations between longevity and genetic monogamy are biased by certain taxonomic groups and relatively little information is available for passerines, a group that is usually short-lived.

Nevertheless, the degree of paternal care required and low annual mortality rates (i.e. long life spans) appear to be key predictors of genetic monogamy (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). The need for paternal care to successfully raise offspring affects whether a female will seek EPP and risk reduced effort or even desertion by her social mate.

Total exclusion probabilities for combined loci were calculated using CERVUS V. 2.0 (Marshall et al. 1998) based on genotypes of the breeding adults. To examine rates of EPP, individuals were organized into family groups consisting of parents and all offspring produced by the pair across all years. EPP was considered to have occurred if offspring had alleles not present in their parents at two or more loci. To account for null alleles/mutations and prevent overestimation of EPP, EPP was not counted if discrepancies between parent and offspring genotypes occurred at a single locus (Ulva Islan</context>

Cross-species studies have shown that two of the most important life history traits are longevity and paternal care (Griffith et al. 2002). Unfortunately, these traits appear to be closely correlated in many species (Westneat and Stewart 2003). In addition to seabirds (Arnold and Owens 2002), long life spans occur jointly with obligatory paternal care in owls (Arsenault et al. 2002, Saladin et al. 2007), parrots (Masello et al. 2002), vultures (Decker et al. 1993), and corvids (Henderson et al. 2000). Determining the importance of low mortality rate versus obligatory paternal care will depend on future studies in species where these traits do not co-occur or where their effect can be distinguished.

Field methods With few exceptions, all saddlebacks on Ulva Island and all robins on Ulva and the Doubtful Islands were banded and sampled for blood (Table 1). In the Eglinton Valley, a subset of 30 pairs was captured for sampling (Table 1). Each bird was banded with a numbered metal band and a unique combination of colour bands for individual identification. Blood samples (100 ml) were taken from the brachial vein and stored in lysis buffer (Seutin et al. 1991). Birds were captured in mist-nets (saddlebacks and robins), handnets, cage traps, and claptraps (robins only) or at the nest (nestlings). All nests were monitored every 24 d and nestlings were banded and sampled approximately 4 d before fledging. Where nests were too high to access, offspring were caught once they had fledged but were still being fed by their parents. Lab methods DNA was extracted using proteinase K (10 mg/ml) in a Chelex 100 Resin solution (50 mg/ml).

No EPP (0%) was detected in saddlebacks (39 pairs, 202 offspring) and only one case of EPP (1.9%) was detected in robins (54 pairs, 198 offspring). Genetic monogamy in these passerine species supports the hypothesis that low annual mortality rates play an important role in explaining variation in rates of EPP across species. The detection and frequency of extra-pair paternity (EPP) in avian species is so widespread (e.g.86% of all socially monogamous passerine species are not genetically monogamous; Griffith et al. 2002) and its benefits so varied (e.g. Petrie and Kempenaers 1998, Tregenza and Wedell 2000, Griffith et al. 2002, Foerster et al. 2003), that recent research has tried to identify factors explaining its absence in some species (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). More than 50% of inter-specific variation in EPP can be explained by phylogeny, making the identification of particular traits difficult (Owens and Bennett 1995, Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002). Nevertheless, the degree of paternal care required and low annual mortality rates (i.e. long life spans) appear to be key predictors of genetic monogamy (Arnold and Owens 2002, Griffith et al. 2002).

Publication of a large number of studies that could be incorporated into cross-species analyses has done much to clarify the causes of inter-specific variation in rates of EPP (Owens and Bennett 1995, Mauck et al. 1999, Arnold and Owens 2002). Cross-species studies have shown that two of the most important life history traits are longevity and paternal care (Griffith et al. 2002). Unfortunately, these traits appear to be closely correlated in many species (Westneat and Stewart 2003). In addition to seabirds (Arnold and Owens 2002), long life spans occur jointly with obligatory paternal care in owls (Arsenault et al. 2002, Saladin et al. 2007), parrots (Masello et al. 2002), vultures (Decker et al. 1993), and corvids (Henderson et al. 2000). Determining the importance of low mortality rate versus obligatory paternal care will depend on future studies in species where these traits do not co-occur or where their effect can be distinguished.
