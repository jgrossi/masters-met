To test this, we combined DP-ablation experiments with genetic b-catenin activation and showed that b-catenin activated hair stem cells generated new hair outgrowths in the absence of their physiological mesenchymal DP niche. This is in contrast with the stall in growth observed in WT DP-ablated follicles. Intriguingly, surrounding mesenchymal cells were observed to broadly contact the newly formed hair growths, although they failed to spatially self-organize like DP clusters. This induction of a new mesenchyme around the growth is consistent with previous work (Collins et al., 2011; Gat et al., 1998; Silva-Vargas et al., 2005). Therefore, ectopic stem cell activation independent from the endogenous niche overrides normal tissue homeostasis signals to promote tissue growth. These results highlight that signals downstream of DP niche activation can drive aberrant growth within the stem cells independently of their endogenous physiological niche and possibly dependent on the induction of a new aberrant niche (Deschene et al., 2014) (Figure 2). Mesenchymal/epithelial crosstalk has been largely investigated during tissue growth; however, the signals that trigger tissue regre</context>

Conversely, growing tissues can be inducing to regress by niche factors such as retinoic acid (RA) or TGF-b1.Niche Regulation of Stem Cell Activity Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are essential in many developmental processes as well as for the regeneration of several adult tissues (Cunha and Hom, 1996; Ribatti and Santoiemma, 2014). Previous work has demonstrated that the mesenchymal niche of the hair follicle provides molecular signals that are sufficient to induce hair growth (Greco et al., 2009; Jahoda et al., 1984). However, it remained unclear whether the DP is required for hair regeneration and specifically to initiate hair follicle growth and/or regression. To test this, we developed a laser ablation procedure using our multiphoton imaging system to specifically remove the DP prior to the hair regeneration phase under interrogation.

This finding expands our understanding of tumoral growth and expands the focus from the mutated stem cells to the changes in their environment in contribution to this aberrant growth. The skin regeneration cycle primed us to investigate potential mechanisms of tumor regression that could overcome tumoral growth. To this end, we utilized a peculiar skin tumor known to self-regress, called keratoacanthoma (KA) (Ko, 2010). This tumor has provided us with a powerful platform for understanding physiological principles of tumor regression. Our parallel approaches of SCC with KA revealed that while both tumors share Wnt activation during growth, regressing KAs displayed an upregulation of Wnt inhibitors in their surrounding mesenchyme and an overall reduction of Wnt signaling in the basal proliferative epithelium. Transcriptional approaches identified RA upregulation as an early event during KA regression and prior to Wnt downregulation.

In order to understand how growth is regulated in a cancer setting, we investigated the effects of b-catenin activation on hair follicle stem cell behaviors as ectopic hair growths were forming. Strikingly, our data showed that b-catenin-activated stem cells recruited WT neighboring follicles into the growths. These WT cells contributed to fueling the new ectopic growth by actively proliferating.

In contrast, cells located in hair germ, therefore in closer proximity to the DP niche at the onset of growth, were consistently found to contribute to the newly forming differentiated layers of the hair follicle, which collectively give rise to the newhair shaft (Rompolas et al., 2013). Conversely, lineage tracing of single basal ORS cells during regression showed that a spatial gradient of cell death emanates from the tip of the follicle. Thus, epithelial cells located in higher proximity of the mesenchymal DP niche have lower chances of surviving than cells located at further distances (Mesa et al., 2015). Finally, revisits over several rounds of hair regeneration cycles revealed the stepwise progression of bulge stem cells in their differentiation path whereby lower bulge stem cells give rise to basal ORS cells and form the hair germ during a complete regeneration cycle and will eventually make differentiated cells during the subsequent regeneration cycle (Rompolas et al., 2013) (Figure 1).

To test the functionality of the cells eliminated during regression, we devised an experimental setup to transiently remove the mesenchymal DP (Rahmani et al., 2014) during regression and then track the fate of retained cells. Upon DP regeneration, hair follicles were able to fuel a new round of growth from the pool of cells normally targeted for elimination. This work demonstrates that regression is a regulated process that actively reduces the stem cell pool following expansion during growth (Figure 2) (Mesa et al., 2015). This control of stem cell fate led us to ask whether the niche was sufficient to promote stem cell activity. To test this, we used laser ablation to specifically remove the stem cell compartment at the onset of growth.

Conditional ablation of TGF-b receptor I (TGF-bRI) in the hair follicle epithelium during regression led to a stall in hair follicles regression and inhibition of epithelial cell death. This demonstrated that hair follicle regression is regulated through an extrinsic regulation mediated via TGF-b signaling to induce epithelial cell death and spatially restrict the pool of surviving stem cells (Mesa et al., 2015).

To achieve this, we combined inducible genetic labeling, through inducible Cre-recombinases and fluorescent reporter alleles, with our intravital imaging. This allowed us to revisit hundreds of entire hair follicles (over several millimeters of skin and to depths of over 200 mm regulated fate of epithelial stem cells with relation to the mesenchymal DP niche. Scale bar, 25mm. s Stem Cell Reportswithin the skin) to trace the long-term fate of stem cells during hair follicle regeneration (Rompolas et al., 2013). Our revisits of labeled cell lineages revealed that stem cell fate is stereotypic and correlates with initial cell position with respect to the mesenchymal niche at the onset of growth. Specifically, the degree of commitment to differentiation was directly related to the proximity with the Perspectivemesenchymal DP niche. Cells located at the furthest distance from the DP niche in the upper part of the bulge did not contribute to the next round of hair follicle growth, whereas cells located in the lower bulge engaged during growth to expand the undifferentiated basal ORS layer of the hair fo</context>

Thus, epithelial cells located in higher proximity of the mesenchymal DP niche have lower chances of surviving than cells located at further distances (Mesa et al., 2015). Finally, revisits over several rounds of hair regeneration cycles revealed the stepwise progression of bulge stem cells in their differentiation path whereby lower bulge stem cells give rise to basal ORS cells and form the hair germ during a complete regeneration cycle and will eventually make differentiated cells during the subsequent regeneration cycle (Rompolas et al., 2013) (Figure 1). These data collectively demonstrate a direct correlation between stem cell fate and their location with respect to Stethe mesenchymal DP niche and establish a stepwise progression of bulge stem cell fate, with these cells undergoing an ORS/hair germ intermediate before contributing to the differentiated layers of the regenerating hair follicle. Positional correlation with stem cell fate has since been found in additional tissues such as the intestine (Ritsma et al., 2014) Figure 2.

To test this, we used laser ablation to specifically remove the stem cell compartment at the onset of growth. Interestingly, we found that epithelial cells that do not normally contribute to hair follicle regeneration compensated for bulge stem cell loss and once in contact with the mesenchymal DP niche gave rise to hair follicles that appear indistinguishable from surrounding unablated follicles. These data demonstrate that the niche is capable of conferring a stem cell fate upon injury to neighboring cell populations (Rompolas et al., 2013). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the niche is critical for stem cell activation, elimination, and regulating stem cell fate and behavior. Signaling Crosstalk between Stem Cells and Their Niche during Hair Regeneration Growth and regression phases are characterized by different epithelial cell behaviors, yet the mesenchymal DP niche promotes both sets of behaviors. One possible model to account for this regulation is that the mesenchymal DP niche utilizes different signals in each phase of regeneration.

These key features enable the field to use this model system to study the regulation of stem cell quiescence and activation in the context of a complete mini-organ. Additionally, the epithelial component of the follicle is highly compartmentalized, which allows us to distinguish different cell types, such as distinct stem cell populations as well as their differentiated progeny, on the basis of their location, morphology, as well as molecular markers (Kretzschmar andWatt, 2014; Rogers, 2004; Schepeler et al., 2014).

One possible model to account for this regulation is that the mesenchymal DP niche utilizes different signals in each phase of regeneration. At the onset of hair growth, transcriptional and expression analysis have previously identified signaling pathways that are activate in the mesenchymal DP, including FGF7/ 10 and BMP inhibitors (Greco et al., 2009; Plikus et al., 2008), as well as in the hair germ, such as activation of Wnt/b-catenin (Choi et al., 2013; Myung et al., 2013; Silva-Vargas et al., 2005). The sufficiency and requirement of several of these pathways for hair growth have beenestablished (Lin and Yang, 2013; Oshimori and Fuchs, 2012).

Transcriptional approaches identified RA upregulation as an early event during KA regression and prior to Wnt downregulation. To test the function of RA signaling on tumor regression, we ectopically delivered RA to growing KAs and SCCs, which resulted inWnt downregulation and massive regression of both forms of skin cancer (Zito et al., 2014). Epithelial cancers such as SCC have mutations that dysregulate epithelial/mesenchymal crosstalk and promote excessive tissue growth through pathways such as Wnt. This works provides a model where distinct behaviors of mesenchymal and epithelial components may shed light on therapeutic approaches to combat tumor growth and re-engage normal tissue regeneration.
