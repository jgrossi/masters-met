      <p>Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
(HNSCC) is the sixth most common human cancer.
Close to 600,000 new patients are diagnosed and
approximately 350,000 individuals die of this disease
worldwide each year [1, 2]. Tobacco use and alcohol
consumption are the major risk factors for HNSCC
[3]. Lastly, infection with high-risk types of human
papillomavirus (HPV) has been identified as a novel risk
factor for a subset of HNSCCs, particularly those of the
oropharynx [4]. Recent advances in HNSCC treatment
have improved the quality of life and life expectancy
of HNSCC patients if this disease is diagnosed at early
stages [5]. However, the overall prognosis in HNSCC
patients has not significantly changed for the last decade
[6]. Currently, the most common HNSCC therapeutic
modalities include the use of nonselective treatments
(surgery, radiation and chemotherapy) with very high
systemic toxicities and associated morbidity and mortality.
Complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms in
HNSCC carcinogenesis (identifying actionable targets of
therapeutic value) will benefit the development of more
selective cancer treatment options for HNSCC. Head and
neck carcinogenesis is a multistep process driven by an
accumulation of several genetic and epigenetic alterations
in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes leading to the
progression of a normal cell to a cancer cell [7]. HNSCC
cells are genetically unstable and often display extensive
chromosomal changes, including amplifications, deletions,
and translocations. Recently, next-generation sequencing
(NGS) studies have revealed that the genetic alterations
in HNSCC are mainly in a group of molecular pathways
and/or biological processes including p53 pathways
(TP53), mitogenic pathways (RAS/PI3K/mTOR pathway,
PIK3CA, HRAS), cell cycle (CDKN2A), Notch pathways
(NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3), and cell communication
and death (FAT1, CASP8) [8] (Reviewed in [9]).</p>
      <p>On the other hand, advanced cancer studies suggest
small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) as useful biomarkers
of cancer development and determination of tumor
stage. MicroRNAs are a type of sncRNA that regulate
diverse biological processes. Each miRNA can control
hundreds of gene targets, underscoring the potential
influence of miRNAs on almost every genetic pathway.
Recent evidence has shown that miRNA mutations or
mis-expression correlate with various human cancers and
indicates that miRNAs can function as tumor suppressors
and/or oncogenes (Reviewed in [10]). There is increasing
number of studies on miRNAs expression in HNSCC
(mainly in tumor tissue samples). However, once the
patients undergo surgical intervention and tumor tissue
is removed, it is difficult to determine the risk of disease
recurrence or death. The presence of sncRNAs circulating
in the blood provides a new venue for easy access to
noninvasive frequent screening of patients.</p>
      <p>The recent advent of NGS expedited the
identification of new types of small RNAs; specifically,
known sncRNAs including tRNA, rRNA, and YRNA can
undergo processing into smaller RNA molecules [11-13]
that can function in normal biology and in pathologic
conditions [13-19]. In addition to miRNAs, our deep
sequencing studies of serum/plasma have consistently
detected two other major classes of extracellular small
RNAs: tRNA-derived RNAs of size 30-33 nt, and
YRNAderived RNAs of sizes 27 nt and 30-33 nt [20, 21]. These
new sncRNAs have only recently emerged because early
studies focused on miRNAs and systematically excluded
sequencing reads whose length exceeded the size of mature
miRNAs (18-24 nt) or reads that align with tRNAs and
rRNAs since they were considered degradation products.
Similarly to miRNAs, these derivatives of sncRNAs
can be released into the extracellular environment and
thereby carry paracrine and even endocrine signaling
functions [22]. Accumulating evidence suggests they may
function in cell-to-cell communication both in normal
biology and in disease states [23-26]. We have found that
aging changes the circulating levels of 5‚Äô tRNA halves
derived from specific tRNA isoacceptors and the
ageinduced changes can be mitigated by calorie restriction
[21]. This alleviation of the age-associated changes by
calorie restriction reveals functional significance because
it validates the age-associated alterations in the levels of
circulating 5‚Äô tRNA halves, and provides further evidence
that circulating 5‚Äô tRNA halves are physiologically
regulated. More recently, we have reported that breast
cancer and its clinicopathological characteristics can
be associated with changes in serum levels of specific
types of both YRNA- and tRNA-derived small RNAs
[27]. The presence of these new small RNAs in serum/
plasma, as well as their close associations with relevant
pathophysiological processes such as aging and cancer,
should spark strong interest in developing them into
noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.</p>
      <p>In the present study using NGS, we characterized for
the first time three major classes of circulating sncRNAs
(miRNA, tRNA- and YRNA-derived small RNAs) in
serum from HNSCC patients and healthy donors. Our
analysis revealed the presence of circulating novel and
known miRNAs, 5‚Äô tRNA halves, and 5‚Äô or 3‚Äô
YRNAderived small RNAs that were significantly deregulated in
the HNSCC patients as compared to the healthy controls.</p>

      <title>RESULTS</title>
      <p>Characterization of small RNAs circulating in
serum of normal subjects and oral cancer patients</p>
      <p>We used deep sequencing to investigate the changes
in circulating small RNAs associated with oral cancer. The
sequenced small RNAs were extracted from the sera of 7
male patients with oral cancer (Table 1) and 7 adult males
with no known pathologies at the time of blood collection.</p>
      <p>Sequencing reads from both normal and cancer samples
were pooled to determine the general characteristics of
the reads, i.e., length distribution of the reads, the pattern
and size of peaks, and the types and proportions of small
RNAs from which the reads are derived from. Pooling is
used only to examine the characteristics of the reads, and
not to measure the differential expression of small RNAs
between control and cancer groups. A combined total
of 79,944,976 pre-processed reads were aligned to the
hg19 human genome to generate a dataset of 67,401,008
mapped reads (84%), ranging in size from 18 to 48 nt.</p>
      <p>Annotation and length distribution analyses revealed that
reads in the 20-24 nt peak were derived from miRNAs,
while the 30-33 nt peak consists of reads mapping to
both YRNA and tRNA genes (Figure 1A). Annotation
analysis showed that of the total reads mapping to known
small RNAs, 50% were annotated as miRNAs, 38% as
YRNAs, and 10% as tRNAs (Figure 1B). The remaining
&lt; 1% of reads mapped to sequences annotated as rRNA,
snRNA and snoRNA. These results are consistent with
our previous findings [20, 21]. Interestingly, we detected
an extremely statistically significant difference in the
distribution of small RNA reads in the HNSCC group as
compared to the normal group (Chi-square P &lt; 0.0001,
Supplementary Figure S1 and S2). The proportion of
miRNA reads significantly increased in HNSCC patients
and accounted for 66.4% of total reads as compared to
39.6% in the normal group. Correspondingly, HNSCC
tRNAs and YRNAs dramatically decreased their
proportions and accounted for 3% and 30.2% respectively,
as compared to 15.6% and 44.2% in normal subjects. This
suggests a remodeling of the small non-coding RNA
networks in HNSCC. We did not find age as a determining
factor in the observed changes in the levels of small RNAs
as evidence by the lack of significant correlation between
the subjects‚Äô age and the normalized expression levels of
differentially abundant small RNAs.
Multi-dimensional scaling analysis</p>
      <p>Before proceeding to the statistical analysis of the
differential abundance (DA) of circulating small RNAs
between normal and cancer cases, we used the plotMDS
function of edgeR to examine the samples quality. The
multi-dimensional scaling function displays pairwise
similarity of each sample in two automatically determined
dimensions; the plot separates the samples according to
the expression levels and homogeneity of the replicates.</p>
      <p>The analysis shows clear separation between tumor and
normal conditions, revealing distinct effects of cancer on
the abundance of all 3 types of circulating small RNAs
(Figure 2A-2C). However, the homogeneity of the
replicates is more marked in the normal than in the tumor
samples.</p>
      <p>Analysis of differential expression of circulating
small RNAs between normal subjects and oral
cancer patients</p>
      <p>To measure the DA of circulating miRNAs between
normal subjects and cancer patients, the sequencing
reads from each serum sample were pre-processed and
analyzed with miRDeep2 [28], which detects known and
novel miRNAs and reports their expression levels. Our
study revealed significant differences in the levels of 7
novel (P &lt; 0.05, FDR &lt; 0.10) and 28 known (P &lt; 0.05,
FDR &lt; 0.15) miRNAs in serum from HNSCC patients
as compare with healthy donors. Among the novel DA
miRNAs, 3 were significantly downregulated while 4
were significantly upregulated (Table 2). Among the
known DA miRNAs, 13 were significantly upregulated
and 15 were significantly downregulated in serum from
HNSCC patients as compared to healthy controls (Table
2). Importantly, upregulated circulating miR-103a-3p/107
demonstrated significant positive correlation with the size
and/or extent (reach) of the primary tumor (r = 0.86, P =
0.0127, Figure 3).</p>
      <p>To determine the functional relevance of the DA
miRNAs, we identified putative targets for each miRNA as
described in the Materials and Methods section. Because
prediction software identify a large number of putative
miRNA targets that are not all biologically relevant, we
implemented a triple-filtering approach that included:
first, the over-representation analysis of all deregulated
HNSCC miRNA targeting events on each predicted and
validated target; second, the selection of overtargeted
genes found to contain somatic mutations in cancer
tissues (as reported by the COSMIC database); and third,
the functional enrichment for KEGG pathways and GO
annotations. This triple-filtering approach (accounting for
miRNA overtargeting, somatic mutations in cancer, and
pathway/GO category enrichment) allowed us to identify
a relatively small subset of highly biologically relevant
miRNA-mRNA interactions including 48 COSMIC
genes overtargeted by upregulated miRNAs and 76
COSMIC genes overtargeted by downregulated miRNAs
(Supplementary Table S1). The functional annotation
analysis performed on this overtargeted COSMIC gene
set identified several clusters of cancer-related biological
processes such as regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle, blood
vessel morphogenesis, immune system activation, and
transcription among others that are key to development of
HNSCC (Supplementary Table S2 and S3). In Figure 3 and
4, we highlight these important HNSCC miRNA-mRNA
interaction subnetworks. Genes overtargeted by miRNAs
that are upregulated in the circulation of cancer patients
are expected to be downregulated in the respective target
tissues. On the contrary, genes overtargeted by miRNAs
that are downregulated in the circulation of cancer patients
are expected to be upregulated in the respective target
tissues.</p>
      <p>We compared serum tRNA-derived small RNAs
in datasets from HNSCC and normal subjects using the
Bioconductor package edgeR [29] and found significant
differential abundance of 5‚Äô tRNA halves derived from a
small number of tRNA genes; there are 625 human tRNA
genes, each of them potentially capable of producing small
RNAs. Our findings suggest that an HNSCC diagnosis is
associated with alterations ‚Äì either increase or decrease ‚Äì
in the circulating levels of 5‚Äô tRNA halves derived from
specific tRNA isoacceptors (Table 3). Individuals with
HNSCC had significantly increased circulating levels
of 5‚Äô tRNA halves derived from isoacceptors of
tRNAAla, -Cys, and -Tyr, and decreased circulating levels of 5‚Äô
tRNA halves derived from tRNA-Arg, -Glu, -Gly, -Lys,
-Trp, and -Val.</p>
      <p>YRNA-derived small RNAs</p>
      <p>Similarly to 5‚Äô tRNA halves, we analyzed serum
levels of YRNA-derived small RNAs and found that their
serum levels are altered ‚Äì either increase or decrease ‚Äì in
HNSCC subjects (Table 4). Among the 19 types of the
decreased YRNA-derived small RNAs, 11 were derived
from the 3‚Äô end, and 8 were derived from the 5‚Äô end of
YRNA genes. Only two YRNA-derived small RNAs
increased in abundance, and both of them were derived
from the 5‚Äô ends of YRNA genes. We have previously
observed that small RNAs derived from the 5‚Äô end of
YRNAs are more abundant in serum that those derived
from the 3‚Äô end [27, 30]. We also, have found that small
RNAs derived from the 3‚Äô end of YRNAs are 25-29 nt in
size, while those derived from the 5‚Äô end can be 25-29 nt
or 30-33 nt [27]. However, in HNSCC subjects slightly
more small RNAs derived from the 3‚Äô than the 5‚Äô end of
YRNAs display altered serum levels. This observation
is consistent with our previous finding that, despite the
Figure 3: Association between differentially abundant circulating miR-103a-3p/miR-107 and HNSCC T stage.

preponderance of the 5‚Äô YRNA fragments, many more 3‚Äô
than 5‚Äô YRNA fragments displayed altered serum levels
associated with breast cancer [27]. Thus, there may be
a specific association between at least these two types
of cancer and the minor population of circulating small
RNAs derived from the 3‚Äô end of YRNAs. The functional
significance of this specificity in size and YRNA end is
not clear, especially since there is little known about the
biological role of YRNA-derived small RNAs.</p>
      <p>MicroRNAs are known to be regulators of
critical steps in the pathogenesis of cancer. They have
been implicated in all stages of neoplastic progression
including proliferation, apoptosis, initiation, progression,
invasion, chemo/radiotherapy resistance, metastasis,
and relapse (reviewed in [31]). In the present study we
found 7 novel and 28 known miRNAs either increasing
or decreasing their circulating levels in the cancer patients
as compared to normal controls. Several circulating
miRNAs that we found deregulated in HNSCC patients
were previously reported deregulated (often changing in
the same direction) in distinct types of cancer [32-35].</p>
      <p>Remarkably, circulating miRNA is miR-103-3p/107 was
found significantly associated with the size and/or extent
(reach) of the primary tumor (T). Although the number of
cancer patients in our study was small, this result suggests
the potential clinical utility of these miRNAs for
noninvasive staging of HNSCC. Future work on independent
larger cohorts is guaranteed to validate and extend these
findings.</p>
      <p>The circulating DA miRNAs in our HNSCC
patients appear to coordinately and non-randomly target
a group of genes relevant to cancer development and
progression. These genes, identified by selecting DA
miRNA-overtargeted genes (which interact with more
DA miRNAs than expected by chance) that are found
mutated in cancer tissue (as reported by the COSMIC
database census [36]), are enriched in biological functions
such as regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle, blood vessel
morphogenesis (angiogenesis), immune system activation,
and transcription among others. As evidenced in Figure
4 and 5, the interaction network approach underscores
the key role of let-7a/f, miR-26a/b, miR-103, miR-107,
miR-205, and miR-320a/b among others. Supporting our
findings, multiple miRNA-mRNA interactions identified
by our analysis have been experimentally validated
(thick grey edges in the networks) [37] and several DA
circulating miRNAs found deregulated in distinct types of
tumor tissues including HNSCC [38-44].</p>
      <p>Chen and colleagues showed that miR-103 and
miR-107 target the metastasis suppressors DAPK and
KLF4 [45]. Notably, our over-representation analysis
demonstrated that DAPK and KLF4 were overtargeted by
circulating miRNAs increasing expression in the HNSCC
serum samples. Importantly, according to published data,
the DAPK gene is one of the more often methylated in
laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma [46] and ablation of
Klf4 in mice results in more severe dysplastic lesions
in oral mucosa and higher incidence of squamous cell
carcinoma [47]. Another in vitro study demonstrated
the interaction of miR-103 with GPRC5A, a
G-proteincoupled receptor that has been associated with a variety
of cancers (reviewed in [48]). Other authors demonstrated
that miR-103 is an oncomiR that promotes colorectal
cancer proliferation and migration through
downregulation of the tumor suppressor genes DICER and
PTEN [49]. Relevantly, our interaction network analysis of
miRNA-overtargeted genes underscored the central role of
these interactions (Figure 4). Moreover, NF1 (a negative
regulator of the ras signal transduction pathway) is also
overtargeted by miR-103/107 and two other HNSCC
upregulated miRNAs. Loss of NF1 expression in human
endothelial cells promotes autonomous proliferation
in human endothelial cells [50]. Furthermore, high
expression of miR-103/107 was found correlated with
poor survival in human esophageal cancer [41].</p>
      <p>In contrast to the clear oncogenic role demonstrated
for miR-103a and miR-107, miR-320 has been mainly
reported as an anti-angiogenic miRNA in breast cancer
[51] and oral squamous cell carcinoma [43]. This may
indicate that miR-320 overexpression in the circulation
of our HNSCC patients is part of an adaptive response
against the cancer. Alternatively, miR-320 might perform
as an oncomir under certain conditions (e.g., distinct
miRNA partners involved in cooperative gene targeting
could inhibit the activity of distinct subsets of genes).</p>
      <p>The report by Kim and Choi [52] supports the oncogenic
potential of miR-320. These authors found that miR-320
promotes proliferation of Dgcr8-deficient embryonic
stem cells (ESCs) by releasing them from G1 arrest. This
is accomplished by inhibition of the cell cycle inhibitors
p57 and p21. Notably, our interaction network analysis
of miRNA-overtargeted genes showed that miR-320
is involved in several interactions that target important
tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A and PTEN
(Figure 4). Mutations in the CDKN2A gene are found
in approximately 25% of head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNSCC). Most of these mutations lead to
production of little or no functional p16(INK4a), a protein
that regulate cell growth and division (reviewed in [53]).</p>
      <p>Recently, low PTEN expression was found associated
with worse overall survival in head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma patients treated with chemotherapy and
cetuximab [54].</p>
      <p>In addition, we detected increased levels of
miR205 in the circulation of HNSCC patients as compared
to healthy subjects. Importantly, we also found increased
expression of miR-205 in HNSCC tumor tissue as
compared to healthy tissue from the same patients in a
different cohort (unpublished data). Supporting our
findings, Tsukamoto and colleagues found correlation
between the changes in the expression of a group of
endometroid endometrial carcinoma (EEC)-associated
miRNAs (including miR-205) in both tissue and plasma
[42]. These authors proposed that these miRNAs represent
potential non-invasive biomarkers for EEC. Similarly, the
relative expression of miR-205-5p was significantly higher
in both non-small cell lung carcinoma tissue (compared
with cancer-adjacent paired specimens) and serum
(compared with serum from benign pulmonary condition
patients and healthy volunteers) [55]. This miRNA was
also found upregulated in high-grade serous ovarian
carcinoma [56]. Moreover, miR-205-5p and members
of the miR-200 family target epithelial-mesenchymal
transition regulators (ZEB1 and SIP1), apparently being
important in tumor progression [57].</p>
      <p>Regarding to miRNAs with reduced levels in
the circulation of the HNSCC patients, our interaction
network analysis underscores the key role of let-7a/f
and miR-26a/b, among others. As highlighted in Figure
3, several of these interactions (i.e., with BCL2, BRAF,
BRD3, CCND1, CCND2, EP300, FOXA1, HRAS,
KRAS, NRAS, MAP2K1, NPM1, PBRM1, PDGFRB,
SMAD4, SOCS1) have been previously validated [37].</p>
      <p>Our results suggest that depletion of these miRNAs in the
circulation of HNSCC patients will allow overexpression
of the respective target genes in specific target tissues.</p>
      <p>Indeed, we demonstrate the overtargeting of important
oncogenes by these miRNAs. Adding support,
let7 has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor
by regulating multiple oncogenic signaling pathways,
therefore, its downregulation would promote cancer. Yang
and colleagues demonstrated that a polymorphism in the
let-7 binding site in the 3‚Äô-UTR of the KRAS gene was
associated with increased oncogenic KRAS expression in
an in vitro model [58]. Furthermore, this polymorphism
was found associated with increased cancer risk in
nonsmall-cell lung cancer patients and reduced overall survival
in oral cancers [38, 58], suggesting functional and clinical
significance. In addition, Yu and colleagues demonstrated
that let-7a expression was significantly reduced in head
and neck cancer (HNC) tissues as compared to adjacent
normal cells. These authors showed that let-7a negatively
modulates the expression of stemness genes and plays
a role as a tumor suppressor in HNC [59]. Our analysis
revealed that let-7a and let-7f are overtargeting important
cell cycle genes with demonstrated roles in HNC and
other types of cancers (Figure 4) [60-62]. In particular,
the expression of CCDN1 was found to be regulated by
LIN28A via the inhibition of let-7 miRNA biogenesis in
cancer cells [61]. Similarly, direct regulation of CCND2
via a let-7/Lin28b mechanism was also validated in an
HNC cell line [60].</p>
      <p>MicroRNAs miR-26a and miR-26b have also been
found downregulated in distinct types of cancer tissue,
including squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue [63].</p>
      <p>Recently, Lu and colleagues reported that miR-26a is
commonly downregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(NPC) and functions by repressing EZH2 expression [44].</p>
      <p>In addition, the in vitro expression of miR-26 in liver
cancer cells induced cell-cycle arrest associated with direct
targeting of cyclin D2 [64]. Similarly, our interaction
network analysis revealed that cyclin D2 is overtargeted by
HNSCC DA miRNAs including miR-26a/b. Remarkably,
Kota and colleagues found that systemic administration of
miR-26a in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma
resulted in inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, induction
of tumor-specific apoptosis, and dramatic protection from
disease progression [64].</p>
      <p>Family members of the miR-183 are proposed
as promising biomarkers for early cancer detection,
prognosis, and as therapeutic targets in several cancers
[65-67]. However, the results of their expression profiling
in cancer tissues are inconsistent and controversial
(Reviewed in [68]). Members of this miRNA family has
been mainly reported as oncomirs that inhibit apoptosis
and promote proliferation and invasion in different types
of carcinomas [69, 70]. Our work provides evidence for
a potential tumor suppressor role of miR-183, which
we found depleted in HNSCC serum samples. Another
controversial miRNA is miR-93, depleted in the serum
of HNSCC patients. MicroRNA miR-93, has been found
deregulated in head and neck cancer and often reported
as an oncomir [71, 72]. However, our results and those of
other investigators suggest a tumor suppressor role for this
miRNA [73].</p>
      <p>Our analysis showed that miR-150 (also reduced
in the serum of the HNSCC patients) appears to target
several genes involved in the regulation of cell growth and
division such as PIM1 and EP300 (Figure 4). Particularly,
the interaction of miR-150 with EP300 was previously
reported in the regulation of high glucose-induced
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy [74]. This miRNA functions
as a tumor suppressor in different types of human cancers
[2, 75, 76]. Regarding to HNSCC, Persson and colleagues
described a new mechanism of activation of the oncogene
MYB in human HNC by deleting conserved target sites for
miR-150 [2]. In addition, a full exome and transcriptome
sequencing of a large set of HNSCC-derived cells revealed
that most HNSCC cells harbor multiple mutations and
copy number variations in the 3‚Äô-UTR of EP300 that
encompases the miR-150 binding site may contribute
to HNSCC initiation and progression [77]. Moreover,
the expression of miR-98 (depleted in our HNSCC
samples) was significantly lower in esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma tissues as compared to matched normal
tissues [78], and in human samples from squamous cell
carcinomas of the oral cavity [79]. This study highlighted
the role of miR-98 in the regulation of tumor metastasis
by inhibiting migration and invasion in a cell line of
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [78].</p>
      <p>Remarkably, most of the genes overtargeted by
DA miRNAs and playing central roles in our HNSCC
miRNA-mRNA interaction networks (such as DICER,
PTEN, CDKN2A, NOTCH, MDM2, CCND1, HRAS, and
SMAD4 among others) (Figure 4 &amp; 5) were previously
reported within a group of genes altered in HNSCC
(reviewed in [9]). Moreover, a comprehensive integrative
genomic study of HNSCC just reported by The Cancer
Genome Atlas Network showed that several of these genes
(i.e., HRAS, PTEN, NOTCH, SMAD4 and CDKN2A and
CCND1) are more often altered in HPV(-) tumors [8].</p>
      <p>By conducting miRNA-mRNA interaction network
analysis of overtargeted COSMIC genes (triple-filtering
strategy described in Material and Methods), we
demonstrated that the same genes/pathways affected by
somatic mutations in cancer are affected by changes in the
abundance of miRNAs that target the respective relevant
genes. Therefore, one important conclusion from our
work is that during cancer development, there seems to be
a convergence of oncogenic processes driven by somatic
mutations and/or miRNA regulation affecting key cellular
pathways.</p>
      <p>In addition to miRNAs, we detected changes in
serum abundance of two other major classes of circulating
sncRNAs (i.e., tRNA- and YRNA-derived small RNAs)
in HNSCC patients when compared to healthy donors
with no known pathologies. Despite the small number
of cases used in this study, the multi-dimensional scaling
analysis of miRNA, and tRNA- and YRNA-derived small
RNAs showed a significant separation between cancer
and normal samples indicating low biological coefficient
of variation (Figure 2). This result also reflects a strong
association between the cancer diagnosis and the changes
in the circulating levels of the small RNAs, which
suggests important mechanistic role in cancer biology
(Figure 2). Consistent with this idea, some of the functions
attributed so far to tRNA- and YRNA-derived small RNAs
are involved in carcinogenesis. Recently, tRNA-derived
small RNAs [80] and full length tRNAs [81-86] have been
shown to inhibit apoptosis by sequestering cytochrome
c. Also, blocking the formation of tRNA-derived
small RNAs by inhibiting tRNA cleavage slows tumor
development [87]. The tRNA-derived stress-induced
small RNAs, which suppress global protein translation,
seem to reprogram protein translation in response to
stress, thereby promoting cell survival when cells are
exposed to unfavorable conditions [88-90]. Promotion of
injured cells survival instead of apoptosis allows damaged
cells to persist and acquire abnormalities that alter tissue
microenvironment and promote cancer. YRNAs or their
derivatives are linked to processes relevant to DNA
replication and cell proliferation [91-93], stress responses
[94], apoptosis [13], viral infections [95, 96], senescence
[97-99], and several types of cancer [100, 101]. We have
recently found that changes in serum levels of specific
types of both YRNA- and tRNA-derived small RNAs are
associated with breast cancer and its clinicopathological
characteristics [27]. The association between cancer and
changes in these novel circulating RNA species raises the
possibility of a causal connection between carcinogenesis
and the tRNA- and YRNA-derived small RNAs. Even
though it is tempting to speculate that tRNA- and
YRNAderived small RNAs may mediate systemic effects of
cancer, it remains to determine whether they originate
from the cancer itself, or from peripheral cells affected
by the cancer. Does cancer itself change the serum
composition of tRNA- and YRNA-derived small RNAs,
or is the change caused by some physiological response
to the cancer? A more definite answer requires elucidation
of the secretion pathways of extracellular YRNA- and
tRNA-derived small RNAs, the cells that produce and
release them in the extracellular environment, their
packaging inside cells, their transport and delivery to their
destination, and the functions they may exert once inside
recipient cells to contribute to malignancy.</p>
      <p>The presence of tRNA- and YRNA-derived small
RNAs in the bloodstream, in addition to miRNAs, and the
alterations of their levels in cancer patients provide strong
foundation for exploring these circulating RNA species
as new noninvasive biomarkers. This may lead to the
development of a multi-marker signature optimal for early
detection of cancer. A signature with more than one type
of markers (for instance, tRNA- and YRNA-derived small
RNAs in addition to miRNAs) would be more successful
in clinical use because it is likely less sensitive to
biological differences than signatures with miRNAs only.</p>
      <p>Establishing a reliable signature of circulating sncRNAs
in HNSCC will allow for early detection, prediction of
prognosis, and more precise adjustment of the therapeutic
approach for each individual patient, therefore reducing
the complications related to under- or over-treatment of
the patients affected by HNSCC.</p>
      <p>MATERIALS AND METHODS
Blood collection and serum preparation</p>
      <p>Serum was prepared in the Department of Head
and Neck Surgery, Greater Poland Cancer Center before
surgical treatment from 7 males (Mean age = 56.3 years
and STDEV = 7.6) diagnosed with HNSCC (Table 1)
and in the health clinic at the University of
CaliforniaRiverside from 7 healthy control males (Mean age =
65.4 years and STDEV = 2.7). The Institutional Review
Board of University of Medical Sciences in Poznan
approved the study, and informed consents were obtained
from all patients. The University of California-Riverside
Institutional Review Board approved the collection of
blood from volunteers who served as the control group in
this study. Blood samples were collected in BD Vacutainer
Serum Separation Tubes, incubated for 15 minutes at room
temperature to allow coagulation, and centrifuged at 1300
g for 10 minutes. The serum supernatant was transferred
to new tubes, centrifuged at 16,000 g for 15 minutes to
remove any residual cells and debris, and stored at -80¬∞C.</p>
      <p>Following the study protocol, patients with local
recurrences, second primary tumor and HPV positive
were excluded from experimental groups. Patients with
a previous history of chemo- or radiotherapy were also
excluded.</p>
      <p>RNA isolation and small RNA library construction</p>
      <p>Total RNA, including small RNA, was isolated
using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) from 0.4 mL of serum
from each participant. RNA isolated from each serum
sample was used to construct sequencing libraries with the
Illumina TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina).</p>
      <p>Briefly, 3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤ adapters were sequentially ligated to
small RNA molecules and the obtained ligation products
were subjected to a reverse transcription reaction to create
single stranded cDNA. To selectively enrich fragments
with adapter molecules on both ends, the cDNA was
amplified with 15 PCR cycles using a common primer
and a primer containing an index tag to allow sample
multiplexing. The amplified cDNA constructs were gel
purified, and validated by checking the size, purity, and
concentration of the amplicons on the Agilent Bioanalyzer
High Sensitivity DNA chip (#5067-4626, Genomics
Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The libraries were pooled in
equimolar amounts, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq</p>
      <p>Bioinformatics and statistics analyses
circulating small RNA sequencing reads
a. Alignment and annotation of sequencing reads</p>
      <p>Sequencing reads were pre-processed and mapped
to the human (hg19) genome with Bowtie version 0.12.8
[102] using the ‚Äúend-to-end k-difference (-v)‚Äù alignment
mode and allowing up to 2 mismatches. In addition, this
mode of alignment was combined with options (-k 1 ‚Äìbest)
that instructed Bowtie to report only the best alignment if
more than one valid alignment exists. Annotation of the
mapped sequencing reads was performed with BEDTools
[103] using non-coding RNAs from Ensembl GRCh37
release 70, miRNAs from miRBase 20 (mirbase.org), and
tRNAs from Genomic tRNA Database [104].
b. Generation of the expression values of circulating
tRNA- and YRNA-derived small RNAs</p>
      <p>The Bowtie alignment files described above were
analyzed with BEDTools [103] to count the reads that
align to tRNA genes in the Genomic tRNA Database
[104] and YRNA genes and pseudogenes in the noncoding
RNAs of Ensembl GRCh37 release 70.
c. Detection of miRNAs and generation of their
expression values with miRDeep2</p>
      <p>Sequencing reads were analyzed with miRDeep2
[28], a probabilistic algorithm based on the miRNA
biogenesis model and designed to detect miRNAs from
deep sequencing reads. Briefly, miRDeep2 removes the
3‚Ä≤ adapter sequence and discards reads shorter than 18
nucleotides, before aligning them to the human hg19
genome. Only reads that map perfectly to the genome
five or less times are used for miRNA detection, since
human miRNAs usually map to few genomic locations.</p>
      <p>For the purpose of analyzing the sequenced miRNAs, the
known miRNA input was from miRBase v.20 [105], and
Mus musculus was designated as the related species. The
miRDeep2 algorithm uses a miRNA biogenesis model to
detect known miRNAs and discover novels miRNAs. It
aligns reads to potential hairpin structures in a manner
consistent with Dicer processing and assigns scores that
measure the probability that hairpins are true miRNA
precursors; it also estimates the expression levels of the
identified miRNAs.</p>
      <p>Expression values of miRNAs and tRNA- and
YRNA-derived small RNAs obtained as described above
were analyzed with the Bioconductor package edgeR [29]
to detect statistical differences in the levels of circulating
small RNAs between HNSCC and control groups. The
algorithm of edgeR uses the negative binomial model to
measure differential gene expression. Expression values
were normalized for the libraries size with the trimmed
mean of M-values (TMM) method. The overall degree of
inter-library variability in the data and the coefficient of
biological variation (BCV) were measured by estimating
first the common then the tagwise dispersions as
recommended for experiments with a single factor. The
differential expression is determined by the exact test
which is only applicable to experiments with a single
factor. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using
the Benjamini and Hochberg method to control the false
discovery rate (FDR). Differences in expression were
considered significant below an FDR of 15%.
e. Correlation analysis</p>
      <p>Circulating miRNA levels were tested for normal
distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test and
subjected to correlation analysis with tumor staging.</p>
      <p>Pearson correlation for normally distributed data and
Nonparametric Spearman correlation for non-normal data)
in GraphPad Prism 6.05.
f. Prediction of peripheral genes potentially targeted by
differentially abundant circulating miRNAs</p>
      <p>The databases miRBase [105] and TargetScan [106]
from the R packages microRNA [107] targetscan.Hs.eg.
db [108] were used to predict the genes that are potentially
targeted by the differentially abundant miRNAs. Lists of
putative targets are generated by the intersection of the
targets predicted from TargetScan and miRBase.
g. Over-representation analysis of miRNA-targeting
events on predicted targets and miRNA-mRNA
interaction network construction</p>
      <p>Statistical hypergeometric tests were implemented in
the R environment for comparison of observed proportions
of differentially abundant (DA) miRNA interaction
events on each predicted target mRNA versus expected
proportions in the predicted miRNA-mRNA interaction
universe. Validated interactions from miRTarBase 4.5 were
added to the interaction universe. The overtargeted genes
(P &lt; 0.01, FDR &lt; 0.05) were then additionally filtered
by selecting those included in the list of cancer genes
reported by the COSMIC database (genes containing
somatic mutations in cancer tissue) [36] and analyzed
with the Functional Annotation Clustering tool from the
DAVID Bioinformatics Database [109] to determine
which pathways and GO categories are enriched in the
gene list. The subset of overtargeted COSMIC genes that
are found functionally enriched were then used to filter
the list of interactions between DA miRNAs and putative
overtargeted mRNAs. The subset of relevant interactions
was then used to build miRNA-mRNA interaction
networks using the Cytoscape 3.0.2 software [110].
