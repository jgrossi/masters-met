      <p>Most tissues in our bodies undergo constant cellular turnover.
This process requires a dynamic balance between cell production
and elimination. Stem cells have been shown in many of these
tissues to be the major source of new cells. However, despite the
tremendous advances made, it still remains unclear how stem cell
behavior and activity are regulated in vivo. Furthermore, we lack
basic understanding for the mechanisms that coordinate niche/
stem cell interactions to maintain normal tissue homeostasis. Our
lab has established a novel imaging approach in live mice using
the skin as a model system to investigate these fundamental
processes in both physiological and pathological settings such as
cancer, with the goal of understanding how tissues successfully
orchestrate tissue regeneration throughout the lifetime of an organism.
The Hair Follicle as an Ideal Model System to Study
Stem Cells and Their Niche
The hair follicle stands up as a paradigm for stem cell biology
given that several of its diverse cellular components, such as
mesenchymal and epithelial cell types, as well as utilized
signaling pathways are conserved in many other tissues
(Cunha and Hom, 1996; Ribatti and Santoiemma, 2014). The
advantage of the hair follicle over other tissues lies both in
its unique accessibility for investigation as well as its
stereotypic and continuous pattern of regeneration. This process
relies on a stem cell pool that is maintained through the
sequential phases of growth (Anagen), regression (Catagen),
and rest (Telogen) of hair regeneration (Figure 1). These key
features enable the field to use this model system to study
the regulation of stem cell quiescence and activation in
the context of a complete mini-organ. Additionally, the
epithelial component of the follicle is highly
compartmentalized, which allows us to distinguish different cell types,
such as distinct stem cell populations as well as their
differentiated progeny, on the basis of their location,
morphology, as well as molecular markers (Kretzschmar
and Watt, 2014; Rogers, 2004; Schepeler et al., 2014).
Specifically, within the hair follicle, the stem cell compartment is
comprised of two spatially distinct epithelial populations:
the bulge, which surrounds the base of the hair proper
(called hair shaft), and the hair germ, which is located
directly below the bulge stem cells and in direct contact
with the mesenchymal dermal papilla (DP) niche (Cotsarelis
et al., 1990; Ito et al., 2005; Jahoda et al., 1984; Panteleyev
et al., 2001; Rahmani et al., 2014; Sennett and Rendl,
2012; Tumbar et al., 2004) (Figure 1). While previous data
supported a bulge stem cell-centric model to initiate hair
follicle growth, our work and that of others have opened up a
new view that relies on the coexistence of two functionally
distinct pools: the activated hair germ cells, which can more
quickly respond to the environmental stimuli to engage in a
new growth and the quiescent bulge stem cells. This
bicompartmental organization reconciles the need of the
tissue for rapid growth while maintaining a long-term stem
cell pool and has been found to be utilized by other tissues
such as the blood and the brain (Greco and Guo, 2010;
Greco et al., 2009; Li and Clevers, 2010).</p>
      <p>Capturing Stem Cell Behaviors during Tissue
Regeneration In Vivo
At the start of a new cycle of regeneration, the epithelial
compartment of the hair follicle begins its downward
growth. We set out to test whether this directional growth
was achieved through a spatial organization of cell
divisions or instead by randomized cell divisions followed by
downward migration and reorganization. To capture
behaviors such as cell divisions and migrations within an
intact organ, my group developed an intravital
multiphoton imaging system, which allowed us to
noninvasively image the skin of live mice over time. To visualize
the hair follicle in vivo, we utilized transgenic mouse lines
that were previously made to label epithelial (K14-H2BGFP)
and mesenchymal (Lef1-RFP) hair follicle populations
(Rendl et al., 2005; Tumbar et al., 2004) (Figure 1). Using
these reporters in combination with our intravital imaging
system, we have performed time-lapse recordings by
generating 3D-optical stacks of hair follicles at regular time
intervals throughout the phases of hair follicle regeneration
(Figure 1). These approaches allowed us to directly capture
hair follicle growth beginning with spatially confined
epithelial cell division, which occurs in the activated hair
germ compartment at the interface with the mesenchymal
DP niche. Furthermore, the axes of these divisions are
oriented perpendicular to the mesenchymal DP and parallel
to the long axis of growth of the hair follicles (Rompolas
et al., 2012). These oriented divisions contribute to the
newly formed inner differentiated layers, while the
expanding basal epithelium (also called outer root sheath or
ORS) is generated by a spatially restricted proliferation
zone (Rompolas et al., 2013; Sequeira and Nicolas, 2012)
(Figure 1). While cell production and loss are often
concurrent events in several tissues, the hair follicle provides the
advantage of studying them in isolation. To understand
how cells are eliminated, we focused on the hair follicle
regression phase, which previous work has defined as the
destruction phase where the majority of epithelial cells
are eliminated. Our imaging approaches showed that (1)
cell death targets only the undifferentiated basal cells
but spares differentiated inner cells and (2) cell death
begins at the bottom of the follicle in contact with the
mesenchymal DP niche and then spreads upward in the
remaining basal epithelium. Strikingly, we found that
epithelial cellular debris was not cleared by professional
phagocytes. Rather, basal epithelial cells collectively act
as phagocytes to clear dying epithelial neighbors (Mesa
et al., 2015) (Figure 1). These findings in the hair follicle,
along with work in the mammary gland (Monks et al.,
2005), support a new paradigm of physiological epithelial
self-clearance.</p>
      <p>Our work demonstrated that stem cell behaviors such as
proliferation, migrations, cell death, and clearance are
spatially organized within compartments and with respect
to their proximity to the mesenchymal DP niche. However,
we still failed to understand the long-term consequences
of these cell behaviors and their spatial regulation toward
tissue function during a regeneration cycle. To address
whether the stem cell position with respect to their niche
impacts their fate, we developed an approach to lineage
trace single cells in the stem cell compartment and
assess their contribution to the different epithelial layers
that are generated during the hair regeneration cycle
( 3 weeks). To achieve this, we combined inducible genetic
labeling, through inducible Cre-recombinases and
fluorescent reporter alleles, with our intravital imaging. This
allowed us to revisit hundreds of entire hair follicles (over
several millimeters of skin and to depths of over 200 mm
within the skin) to trace the long-term fate of stem cells
during hair follicle regeneration (Rompolas et al., 2013).
Our revisits of labeled cell lineages revealed that stem cell
fate is stereotypic and correlates with initial cell position
with respect to the mesenchymal niche at the onset of
growth. Specifically, the degree of commitment to
differentiation was directly related to the proximity with the
mesenchymal DP niche. Cells located at the furthest
distance from the DP niche in the upper part of the bulge
did not contribute to the next round of hair follicle growth,
whereas cells located in the lower bulge engaged during
growth to expand the undifferentiated basal ORS layer of
the hair follicle. In contrast, cells located in hair germ,
therefore in closer proximity to the DP niche at the onset
of growth, were consistently found to contribute to the
newly forming differentiated layers of the hair follicle,
which collectively give rise to the new hair shaft (Rompolas
et al., 2013). Conversely, lineage tracing of single basal ORS
cells during regression showed that a spatial gradient of cell
death emanates from the tip of the follicle. Thus, epithelial
cells located in higher proximity of the mesenchymal DP
niche have lower chances of surviving than cells located
at further distances (Mesa et al., 2015). Finally, revisits
over several rounds of hair regeneration cycles revealed
the stepwise progression of bulge stem cells in their
differentiation path whereby lower bulge stem cells give rise to
basal ORS cells and form the hair germ during a complete
regeneration cycle and will eventually make differentiated
cells during the subsequent regeneration cycle (Rompolas
et al., 2013) (Figure 1).</p>
      <p>These data collectively demonstrate a direct correlation
between stem cell fate and their location with respect to
the mesenchymal DP niche and establish a stepwise
progression of bulge stem cell fate, with these cells undergoing
an ORS/hair germ intermediate before contributing to
the differentiated layers of the regenerating hair follicle.
Positional correlation with stem cell fate has since been
found in additional tissues such as the intestine (Ritsma
et al., 2014)
Niche Regulation of Stem Cell Activity
Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are essential in many
developmental processes as well as for the regeneration of
several adult tissues (Cunha and Hom, 1996; Ribatti and
Santoiemma, 2014). Previous work has demonstrated that
the mesenchymal niche of the hair follicle provides
molecular signals that are sufficient to induce hair growth (Greco
et al., 2009; Jahoda et al., 1984). However, it remained
unclear whether the DP is required for hair regeneration
and specifically to initiate hair follicle growth and/or
regression. To test this, we developed a laser ablation
procedure using our multiphoton imaging system to specifically
remove the DP prior to the hair regeneration phase under
interrogation.</p>
      <p>Revisits of hair follicles in which the DP was ablated prior
to growth onset showed that DP-ablated hair follicles
remained stalled in the rest phase while neighboring
unablated hair follicles continued to grow (Figure 2). This
finding provides clear evidence that mesenchymal
interactions are required to initiate hair growth and is consistent
with previous work from invertebrate systems (Byrd and
Kimble, 2009; Losick et al., 2011).</p>
      <p>When similar experiments were performed at the
initiation of regression, we found that DP ablation resulted in a
dramatic reduction in cell death in the hair follicle
epithelium, leading to retention of excess basal cells by the end
of the regression phase when compared with neighboring
follicles. This suggested that the DP promotes basal
epithelial cell elimination during the regression phase
and raised the question of whether DP-mediated
regression serves to eliminate either exhausted basal cells or
functional cells from an expanded stem cell pool. To
test the functionality of the cells eliminated during
regression, we devised an experimental setup to transiently
remove the mesenchymal DP (Rahmani et al., 2014) during
regression and then track the fate of retained cells. Upon
DP regeneration, hair follicles were able to fuel a new
round of growth from the pool of cells normally targeted
for elimination. This work demonstrates that regression is
a regulated process that actively reduces the stem cell pool
following expansion during growth (Figure 2) (Mesa et al.,
2015). This control of stem cell fate led us to ask whether
the niche was sufficient to promote stem cell activity.
To test this, we used laser ablation to specifically remove
the stem cell compartment at the onset of growth.
Interestingly, we found that epithelial cells that do not
normally contribute to hair follicle regeneration
compensated for bulge stem cell loss and once in contact with the
mesenchymal DP niche gave rise to hair follicles that
appear indistinguishable from surrounding unablated
follicles. These data demonstrate that the niche is capable
of conferring a stem cell fate upon injury to neighboring
cell populations (Rompolas et al., 2013). Collectively,
these data demonstrate that the niche is critical for stem
cell activation, elimination, and regulating stem cell fate
and behavior.</p>
      <p>Signaling Crosstalk between Stem Cells and Their
Niche during Hair Regeneration
Growth and regression phases are characterized by
different epithelial cell behaviors, yet the mesenchymal
DP niche promotes both sets of behaviors. One possible
model to account for this regulation is that the
mesenchymal DP niche utilizes different signals in each phase
of regeneration.</p>
      <p>At the onset of hair growth, transcriptional and
expression analysis have previously identified signaling pathways
that are activate in the mesenchymal DP, including FGF7/
10 and BMP inhibitors (Greco et al., 2009; Plikus et al.,
2008), as well as in the hair germ, such as activation of
Wnt/b-catenin (Choi et al., 2013; Myung et al., 2013;
Silva-Vargas et al., 2005). The sufficiency and requirement
of several of these pathways for hair growth have been
established (Lin and Yang, 2013; Oshimori and Fuchs,
2012). However, it remains unclear whether ectopic
activation of downstream regulators of these pathways within
the stem cells would overcome the dependence on the
endogenous DP for tissue growth. To test this, we
combined DP-ablation experiments with genetic b-catenin
activation and showed that b-catenin activated hair stem
cells generated new hair outgrowths in the absence of
their physiological mesenchymal DP niche. This is in
contrast with the stall in growth observed in WT
DP-ablated follicles. Intriguingly, surrounding mesenchymal cells
were observed to broadly contact the newly formed hair
growths, although they failed to spatially self-organize
like DP clusters. This induction of a new mesenchyme
around the growth is consistent with previous work
(Collins et al., 2011; Gat et al., 1998; Silva-Vargas et al.,
2005). Therefore, ectopic stem cell activation independent
from the endogenous niche overrides normal tissue
homeostasis signals to promote tissue growth. These results
highlight that signals downstream of DP niche activation
can drive aberrant growth within the stem cells
independently of their endogenous physiological niche and
possibly dependent on the induction of a new aberrant
niche (Deschene et al., 2014) (Figure 2).</p>
      <p>Mesenchymal/epithelial crosstalk has been largely
investigated during tissue growth; however, the signals that
trigger tissue regression remain elusive. To understand
the molecular signaling that facilitate epithelial cell death
during regression, we investigated the transforming
growth factor-b (TGF-b) signaling pathway, as exogenous
delivery of TGF-b1 ligand induces precocious hair follicle
regression (Foitzik et al., 2000). We found that TGF-b
ligands are expressed in the DP during regression.
Additionally, TGF-b signaling was found to be active in the
hair follicle epithelium located near the DP niche. This
suggested to us that epithelial/mesenchymal crosstalk
during regression may be facilitated by TGF-b signaling and
prompted us to functionally test the role of TGF-b signaling
on epithelial cell death. Conditional ablation of TGF-b
receptor I (TGF-bRI) in the hair follicle epithelium during
regression led to a stall in hair follicles regression and
inhibition of epithelial cell death. This demonstrated that
hair follicle regression is regulated through an extrinsic
regulation mediated via TGF-b signaling to induce
epithelial cell death and spatially restrict the pool of surviving
stem cells (Mesa et al., 2015).</p>
      <p>All together, these data show that niche/stem cell
interactions and their molecular signals are key to regulate tissue
growth but also to properly maintain tissue morphology
and function.</p>
      <p>Niche and Stem Cells in Cancer
The interplay between stem cells and their niche is not only
central to tissue regeneration but has also been shown to be
critical for cancer. Consistent with this, mutations affecting
critical pathways such as Wnt/b-catenin and TGF-b have
been found to fuel several cancers, including squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) in the skin (Guasch et al., 2007;
Malanchi et al., 2008; Massague´, 2008). In order to understand
how growth is regulated in a cancer setting, we investigated
the effects of b-catenin activation on hair follicle stem cell
behaviors as ectopic hair growths were forming. Strikingly,
our data showed that b-catenin-activated stem cells
recruited WT neighboring follicles into the growths. These
WT cells contributed to fueling the new ectopic growth
by actively proliferating. Transcriptional and genetic
approaches demonstrated that b-catenin-activated stem cells
created a field of Wnt activation around them by
upregulating Wnt ligand production (Deschene et al., 2014). This
finding expands our understanding of tumoral growth
and expands the focus from the mutated stem cells to
the changes in their environment in contribution to this
aberrant growth.</p>
      <p>The skin regeneration cycle primed us to investigate
potential mechanisms of tumor regression that could
overcome tumoral growth. To this end, we utilized a peculiar
skin tumor known to self-regress, called keratoacanthoma
(KA) (Ko, 2010). This tumor has provided us with a
powerful platform for understanding physiological principles of
tumor regression. Our parallel approaches of SCC with
KA revealed that while both tumors share Wnt activation
during growth, regressing KAs displayed an upregulation
of Wnt inhibitors in their surrounding mesenchyme and
an overall reduction of Wnt signaling in the basal
proliferative epithelium. Transcriptional approaches identified RA
upregulation as an early event during KA regression and
prior to Wnt downregulation. To test the function of RA
signaling on tumor regression, we ectopically delivered
RA to growing KAs and SCCs, which resulted in Wnt
downregulation and massive regression of both forms of skin
cancer (Zito et al., 2014).</p>
      <p>Epithelial cancers such as SCC have mutations that
dysregulate epithelial/mesenchymal crosstalk and promote
excessive tissue growth through pathways such as Wnt.
This works provides a model where distinct behaviors of
mesenchymal and epithelial components may shed light
on therapeutic approaches to combat tumor growth and
re-engage normal tissue regeneration.</p>
      <p>Conclusions
Altogether, our innovative live imaging combined with
genetic and cellular approaches has provided a new
platform for understanding tissue regeneration and
cancer in a living mammal. While the emphasis in the
field has been centered on the stem cells, our work
has shifted the attention to a critical role of the niche,
which is consistent with pioneering work in several
invertebrate systems. This work has further extended
our understanding of tissue regeneration to reveal novel
cellular behaviors that contribute to the process, as well
