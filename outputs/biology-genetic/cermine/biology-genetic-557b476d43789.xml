      <p>Introduction
Congenital absence of a thymus and parathyroid gland was reported by Dr Angelo
M DiGeorge in 1965. Later, cardiac anomalies were added to the phenotype, and the
syndrome was named DiGeorge syndrome (DGS; Mendelian Inheritance in Man
[MIM] number 188400).1 Most patients with DGS have monosomic deletions on the
long arm of chromosome 22. This deletion might present with a variety of phenotypes,
including DGS and velocardiofacial syndrome. 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS)
is an umbrella term that describes various clinical phenotypes.2,3 22q11DS is the most
common microdeletion syndrome in humans, although it is likely to be more prevalent
than reported and underrecognized because of its inherent clinical variability and
heterogeneity. 22q11DS can affect many organs and systems.4,5 An increasing amount
of information has been reported regarding the pathogenesis, clinical phenotypes, and
management of this syndrome in recent years. This review summarizes the current
clinical and genetic status of 22q11DS.</p>
      <p>Nomenclature
A long-arm deletion of chromosome 22 might present with a variety of phenotypes,
including DGS, velocardiofacial syndrome (MIM number 192430), conotruncal
anomaly face syndrome (MIM number 217095) (or Takao syndrome), and isolated
outflow tract (OFT) defects of the heart.2 CATCH22 (Cardiac Abnormality/abnormal

Hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism resulting from
22q11 deletion) was proposed as a collective acronym for
these differing presentations of a common genetic etiology.2,3
Many clinicians believe that 22q11.2 deletion is a single
syndrome rather than several distinct syndromes.2 Therefore,
the term 22q11DS is an umbrella term used to describe
all deletion-associated phenotypes. The term 22q11DS is
used in this review to cover all of the phenotypic variations
described before.</p>
      <p>Pathogenesis
Human chromosome 22 is acrocentric, and is the
secondsmallest human chromosome. It spans ∼51 million DNA
building blocks (base pairs) and represents 1.6% of the
human genome in cells. Recurrent acquired and somatic
rearrangements of chromosome 22 are associated with
multiple diseases and developmental abnormalities. Most
of these recurrent rearrangements occur within 22q11,
suggesting genomic instability of this region of chromosome 22.</p>
      <p>Deletions of 22q are associated with 22q11DS.6 The
deletion occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location
designated q11.2, and results in a 1.5–3 Mb microdeletion
on the long arm of chromosome 22. Although different-sized
lesions have been identified, ∼90% of patients have a
common ∼3 Mb deletion, which is defined the typically deleted
region (TDR), whereas most other (∼7%) patients have a
smaller ∼1.5 Mb deletion. A small percentage of affected
individuals have shorter deletions in the same region.2
Mechanism of the deletion
at 22q11.2
Complex low-copy repeats (LCRs, also termed segmental
duplications), which are composed of multiple repeat
elements, provide the structural basis for a diverse range of
genomic variations and combinations of variations. These
regions of chromosomes are susceptible to
translocations, inversions, deletions, and duplications. LCRs are
region-specific DNA blocks usually sized .5–10 kb that
share .95%–97% similarity with each other. Nonallelic
homologous recombination (NAHR) is a form of homologous
recombination that occurs between two lengths of DNA that
share high sequence similarity but are not alleles. NAHR is
one of the major genomic rearrangements, and most
recurrent genomic rearrangements are caused by NAHR between
two LCRs. Due to their high sequence identity, nonallelic
copies of LCRs, instead of copies at the usual allelic
positions, can sometimes be aligned during meiosis or mitosis.
This so-called misalignment and the subsequent crossover
between them can result in genomic rearrangements in
progeny cells. Thus, the nonallelic copies act as mediators
of homologous recombination and are responsible for the
observed breakpoint clustering. NAHR between LCRs causes
duplication and/or deletions. The misalignment of LCRs
during NAHR is an important mechanism underlying
chromosomal microdeletion disorders, including 22q11DS.7–10</p>
      <p>The proximal region of 22q11.2 is enriched with LCRs.</p>
      <p>This region contains eight chromosome 22-specific LCRs
(LCR22s; LCR22-A to LCR22-H). There is a relationship
between four LCR22s (LCR22-A, -B, -C, and -D) and
22q11DS (Figure 1). These proximal LCRs are larger than
the distal ones, and have a complex modular structure. The
typical 3 Mb deletion occurs between the most proximal
(LCR22-A) and most distal (LCR22-D) units, whereas a</p>
      <sec id="1-1">
        <title>1.5 Mb deletion could be an A–B or an A–C deletion.2,7</title>
        <p>The LCR22s comprise 11% of the 22q11.2 region and
contain both genes and unprocessed pseudogene copies. The
BCR pseudogene is present once in LCR22-A, and twice in
LCR22-D. The sequences that correspond to the BCR-like
module within the LCRs were suggested as a potential
rearrangement hotspot.11,12</p>

          <p>It was demonstrated that deletions in individuals with
22q11DS had more frequently maternal origin than paternal
origins (56% versus 44%). But maternal age does not act
as an etiologic factor for the finding of enhanced maternal
origin of the deletion. Also, there is no association between
the paternal age and the frequency of the deletion.13
Results of 22q11.2 deletion and its
contribution to clinical phenotypes
The diminished gene expression on 22q11.2 is
responsible for the clinical findings associated with 22q11DS;
however, little is known about how such changes lead
to the phenotypes of 22q11DS. The 3 Mb chromosomal
region contains .35 genes, many of which have not been
well characterized (Figure 2). The diminished dose of these
genes, or their haploinsufficiency, likely compromises early
morphogenesis in the pharyngeal arches, heart, skeleton, and
brain. However, there is no correlation between the size or
type of deletion and the resulting phenotype.2,7,8</p>
          <p>Numerous candidate genes have been linked with the
22q11DS phenotype. In 1999, murine models identified TBX1
as a candidate gene for this syndrome. TBX1, which encodes
a T-box-containing transcription factor that belongs to a large
family of transcription factors, has distinct roles in a wide
range of embryonic differentiation or response pathways.
TBX1 is the most important gene for 22q11DS.14</p>
          <p>The pharyngeal apparatus is an embryonic structure that
becomes remodeled to form the face, neck, and cardiac OFT.
The transcription factors expressed in pharyngeal mesoderm
progenitors form a regulatory network that coordinates
normal heart and craniofacial development. TBX1 is expressed
in the endoderm and mesoderm of pharyngeal arches, and
the ectoderm of the distal pharyngeal apparatus. Animal
models have shown that the haploinsufficiency of TBX1
causes abnormal growth and remodeling in the pharyngeal
apparatus and related structures. This information might
explain many of the clinical findings of the syndrome,
including facial dysmorphia, palatal defects, hypoplasia of
the parathyroid glands and thymus, and dental, feeding, and
swallowing problems.14,15</p>
          <p>New data are available in the literature about
molecular mechanism of dental anomalies in 22q11DS. It was
shown that TBX1 regulates the proliferation of dental
progenitor cells and craniofacial development through
microRNA-96-5p.16</p>
          <p>Neuroepithelium-derived cardiac neural crest cells
(cNCCs) are needed for the proper septation of the OFT into
the aorta and pulmonary trunk, as well as for the
development of the cardiac valves. TBX1 regulates the
differentiation and migration of cNCCs. Cardiac progenitor cells from
the second heart field (SHF) contribute to the rapid growth
of the embryonic heart, giving rise to the right ventricle and
OFT, the myocardium at the arterial pole of the heart, and
the atrial myocardium at the venous pole. TBX1 is required
for both inflow tract and OFT morphogenesis because it
regulates the segregation and deployment of progenitor cells
in the posterior SHF. The primary heart field gives rise to
the primitive linear tube, and is not dependent on TBX1.
TBX1 knockout animal models supported the importance
of this gene in cardiac development. In summary, TBX1
haploinsuff iciency contributes to the conotruncal and
cardiac OFT anomalies that are observed commonly in
22q11DS.17–19</p>
          <p>WNT5A is an important gene for embryogenesis and
is critically required for SHF deployment. Recent study
showed that TBX1 is likely to be promoting SHF
development through activating WNT5A transcription, and
disruption of WNT5A-mediated SHF deployment may contribute
significantly to the pathogenesis of OFT malformations in
22q11DS.20</p>
          <p>Various pathways downstream of TBX1 and modifiers of
TBX1 activity seem to play an important role in the
pathogenesis of 22q11DS. TBX1 regulates the expression of several
growth factors and transcription factors, including FGF8,</p>

Otog-MyoD.18,19 Disruption of the expression of these genes
by the loss of function of TBX1 contributes to the
pathogenesis of 22q11DS. TBX1 expression is regulated negatively
by retinoic acid, and positively by SHH via FOXA2.17–19 The
manipulation of these pathways might be a cornerstone of
future advances in 22q11DS.</p>
          <p>TBX1 is the best-known and most studied gene on
22q11.2. The current literature suggests that TBX1 is largely
responsible for the clinical findings in patients with 22q11DS,
particularly the physical malformations. However, TBX1
haploinsufficiency cannot explain all the clinic phenotypes
of 22q11DS. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, the TDR
that causes 22q11DS contains many genes.7,19</p>
          <p>Recently, it was shown that haploid 22q11 gene
insufficiency, including but not limited to TBX1, disrupts
orofacial and cranial nerve development by modifying retinoic
acid-modulated anterior–posterior hindbrain differentiation.</p>
          <p>These disruptions likely contribute to dysphagia in infants
and young children with 22q11DS.21</p>
          <p>Recent studies showed that reduced doses of 22q11 genes
could modify the initial forebrain patterning, subsequent
cortical neurogenesis and migration, and the mitochondrial
support of activity-dependent synapse formation and
elimination in the early postnatal brain. Nevertheless, it remains
unclear which genes have a cause-and-effect relationship
with these processes.22</p>
          <p>Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) degrades
catecholamines such as dopamine and epinephrine; its gene is
located on chromosome 22q11.2. The proline dehydrogenase
(oxidase) 1 (PRODH) gene is also located in the same region,
which encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that degrades proline.</p>
          <p>The deficiency of this enzyme results in hyperprolinemia.</p>
          <p>COMT and PRODH haploinsufficiency was implicated by
some studies in the behavioral and psychiatric disturbances
associated with 22q11DS.23 SMARCB1 is a tumor
suppressor gene that is also located on 22q11.2 distal of the TDR
for 22q11DS. The haploid deficiency of this gene might be
associated with head-and-neck tumors such as rhabdoid
tumors in some 22q11DS patients.24 In addition, the
haploinsufficiency of glycoprotein Ib β (GP1BB) might contribute
to the mild thrombocytopenia observed in patients with
22q11DS. GP1BB is also located on chromosome 22q11.2.</p>
          <p>Bernard–Soulier syndrome, which is characterized by giant
platelets, thrombocytopenia, and a prolonged bleeding time,
was also described in patients with 22q11DS.25 Several other
genes in the 22q11 region, such as histone cell cycle
regulator gene (HIRA), ubiquitin fusion degradation 1-like gene
(UFD1L), and Crk-like protein gene (CRKL), have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of 22q11DS.7,19
Epidemiology
22q11DS is the most common microdeletion syndrome
in humans. However, population-based estimates of the
incidence and prevalence of 22q11DS differ. Most studies
reported a prevalence of one in every 4,000 newborns;
however, reports range from one in 2,000 to one in 6,395.3,26,27
Nevertheless, many researchers believe that this number is
artificially low due to under-diagnosis. Consistent with this,
familial occurrence is the most frequent cause of diagnosis
in adults at some genetic centers.28</p>
          <p>Male and female sexes are affected equally by 22q11DS.</p>
          <p>In addition, the deletion of 22q11.2 is more prevalent within
certain ethnic groups. Specifically, 22q11DS occurs more
frequently among Hispanics compared with Whites, African
Americans, and Asians.26</p>
          <p>Generally, .90% of DGS cases are de novo or novel
deletions caused by a random occurrence during fetal development.</p>
          <p>An unaffected parent might then carry the deletion in his or her
eggs or sperm, and the risk of recurrence is ∼1%. However, it
can also be inherited, and familial autosomal dominant
recurrence is reported in ∼8%–28% of patients in various series.29
Some cases appear to have a vigorous diagnosis but no deletion;
35%–90% of patients with DGS and 80%–100% of
velocardiofacial syndrome patients have the 22q deletion.2,30
Clinical presentation
22q11DS presents with a very wide phenotypic spectrum,
including the following: facial dysmorphisms; congenital
cardiac defects; velopharyngeal insufficiency with or
without cleft palate; thymic hypoplasia; immune deficiency;
parathyroid hypoplasia; developmental delay; learning
disabilities; psychiatric disorders; renal, ocular, and skeletal
malformations; hearing loss; and laryngeal abnormalities.</p>
          <p>The phenotypes associated with the syndrome might be
recognized during the prenatal period, or in newborns,
children, and even adults.31–33 Clinical phenotypes of 22q11DS
are summarized in Table 1.</p>
          <p>Fetal phenotype
Congenital heart defects are the major prenatal
sonographical feature of 22q11 deletions. Among these, conotruncal
defects are the most common cardiac anomalies, although
vascular abnormalities and hypoplastic left hearts were also
reported.34 Thymus abnormalities are also an important prenatal
sonographic feature of this syndrome. Urinary tract defects,
Table 1 Clinical phenotypes of 22q11 deletion syndrome
neurological problems such as neural tube defects, cerebral
anomalies, and polyhydramnios have also been reported.35
However, facial anomalies in fetuses are difficult to diagnose.</p>

      <title>Neonatal and childhood phenotype</title>
      <p>The clinical presentation of 22q11DS in pediatric patients
and neonates is highly variable. The manifestations involve
multiple organ systems and vary in severity and from patient
to patient; the symptoms also vary depending on the age of the
patient. Nevertheless, they commonly include the following
classic findings: behavioral problems, developmental and/or
learning disabilities, conotruncal cardiac anomalies, palatal
defects, hypernasal speech, immunodeficiency,
hypocalcemia, and characteristic facial features.2,3,31,32</p>
      <p>Congenital heart disease is present in ∼80% of patients
with 22q11DS, and conotruncal and aortic arch defects are
the most typical cardiac malformations associated with
22q11DS. The conotruncal defects include tetralogy of Fallot,
pulmonary atresia, truncus arteriosus, an interrupted aortic
arch, and a double outlet right ventricle. Nonconotruncal
defects such as ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects,
and atrioventricular septal defects have also been reported.
Tetralogy of Fallot is the most prevalent cardiac defect in
22q11DS, but interrupted aortic arch type B (distal to the
left common carotid artery) is the most specific defect.
Cardiopathies might appear shortly after birth with cyanosis
or cardiovascular collapse, or could be defined in adulthood.
An aberrant subclavian artery might present with feeding
difficulties or respiratory symptoms.31,32,35</p>
      <p>Although hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine
disorder in pediatric-aged patients, the hypocalcemia caused
by hypoparathyroidism is one of the classic symptoms
of 22q11DS, and is present in 16%–70% of patients.2
Hypoparathyroidism can be diagnosed in children of all ages
with 22q11DS; diagnosis occurs commonly in the newborn
period but can also occur during the late adolescent period.36
Mild hypocalcemia without symptoms might last for several
years.37 Hypoparathyroidism is often transient and resolves
after the neonatal period, but it may manifest later in life as
episodes of hypocalcemia during stresses such as infectious
diseases, surgery, or pregnancy. Patients develop permanent
hypoparathyroidism only rarely. Neonatal hypocalcemia is not
associated with the later development of permanent
hypoparathyroidism.38 However, the early onset of hypoparathyroidism
is associated with a high risk of later recurrence.39 A recent
study concluded that the occurrence of neonatal seizures
related to hypocalcemia might increase the risk of more severe
intellectual deficits in patients with 22q11DS.40</p>
      <p>The metabolic features of hypoparathyroidism include
hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and reduced or low-range
parathyroid hormone levels. The usual signs and symptoms
are muscle cramps and tingling, numbing, seizures, tetany,
positive Chvostek signs, and positive Trousseau signs. Stridor
can also be a symptom, but it must be differentiated from
laryngeal web. Hypocalcemia in 22q11DS has a wide clinical
manifestation, ranging from only paresthesia and numbness
to convulsions.3,31,32,41</p>
      <p>The congenital cardiac defects associated with
neonatal hypocalcemia are the most frequent features that lead
to diagnosis in the first 2 years of life. The most common
symptoms leading to diagnosis in patients older than 2 years
are neuropsychological manifestations, otorhinolaryngologic
manifestations, and typical facial findings.2,3,28,31–33</p>
      <p>Hypotonia and ligamentous laxity are very common in the
infantile period. An unsteady gait, a lack of coordination, and
clumsy hand skills are also observed commonly. Patients with
22q11DS also have an increased risk of spinal deformities
such as cervical spinal abnormalities and scoliosis, and
idiopathic leg pains are seen commonly in childhood.3,31–33,42</p>
      <p>The neurocognitive profile of 22q11DS is also highly
variable, both among individuals and throughout its
development. Almost all individuals with 22q11DS cope
with the resulting cognitive deficits. Borderline intellectual
function (an IQ of 70–75) is the most common intellectual
disability in these patients. The mathematic ability is usually
weak, but their memory is good. Attention difficulties, visual
spatial abnormalities, and impaired executive function are
also common. Most children with 22q11DS achieve higher
scores in verbal tasks than in non-verbal tasks. In addition,
learning difficulties are very common during the preschool
and in primary school-aged children. Psychiatric problems
related to 22q11DS have also been described in children
and adolescents, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorders, anxiety disorders, depression, and autism spectrum
disorders.43–46</p>
      <p>Most 22q11DS patients have speech or language
diff iculties. The most common speech abnormality is
velopharyngeal insufficiency, which manifests typically as
hypernasal speech, increased nasal resonance, and nasal
regurgitation. Velopharyngeal insufficiency that becomes
increasingly apparent with age and submucous cleft palate
might also be observed, although overt cleft palate is rare. In
addition to immune deficiency, palatal weakness and
Eustachian tube dysfunction lead to recurrent ear infections in
these patients. Hearing loss is a frequent problem in patients
with 22q11DS.31,32,47,48</p>
      <p>Immunodeficiency is another key feature of 22q11DS.
The observed immunodeficiencies are secondary to thymic
aplasia or hypoplasia with subsequent impaired thymocyte
development. The degree of immunodeficiency seen in
patients with 22q11DS is highly variable, and might include
defects in T-lymphocyte number and function, as well as
humoral defects. The thymus and the T-cells are absent
completely (complete DGS) in a very small number of
patients, but most subjects have a milder form of
immunodeficiency (incomplete DGS). Despite the low-for-age T-cell
counts in most patients in infancy, this usually improves
during the f irst year of life.43,49 Antibody def iciencies
(hypogammaglobulinemia) have also been described in a
minority of patients, most commonly IgA deficiency. An
increased frequency of infections, mainly respiratory tract
infections, is common in children with 22q11DS, but the
frequency commonly diminishes with increasing age.43,49,50
An increased prevalence of autoimmune conditions was
reported in both children and adults with 22q11DS.49</p>
      <p>Despite the phenotypic variability, most children with
22q11DS share a combination of features and have a
characteristic dysmorphic facial appearance (Figure 3).36 The facial
characteristics described in individuals with 22q11DS are a
long face, malar flattening, hypertelorism, short palpebral
fissures, hooded/swollen eyelids, a wide and prominent
nasal root, a wide/broad nasal bridge, a low nasal bridge, a
bulbous nasal tip (becoming evident with age), hypoplastic
alae nasi, micrognathia, a small mouth, asymmetric facial
movements, and malformed, small, low-set ears. Children
with 22q11DS usually have a mild pattern of the
characteristic facial features, which might not be recognized easily.
However, a physician experienced in 22q11DS could observe
the typical facial features in most patients. Postaxial
polydactyly might also occur.30,51</p>
      <p>Renal problems are frequent in patients with 22q11DS,
including structural renal anomalies such as renal
agenesis or dysplastic kidneys, obstructive abnormalities, and
vesicoureteric reflux.2,3,30–33 Morphological and functional
thyroid alternations have also been reported. Thyroid
hypoplasia is common, but hypothyroidism is rare in 22q11DS.52
Gastrointestinal involvement is observed sometimes in
patients, including gastroesophageal reflux, chronic
constipation, abdominal pain, and vomiting. However, intestinal

malrotation is rare. Refractive errors, strabismus, amblyopia,
and structural ocular abnormalities are encountered
frequently in children with 22q11DS.2,3,30–33 Growth deficiencies
are common in patients, particularly during infancy and early
childhood. Nevertheless, growth hormone deficiency has
been described only rarely.53
Adult phenotype
Due to variation in the phenotypic features and their severity,
the diagnosis of 22q11DS could be missed in children, and the
syndrome might be diagnosed during adulthood instead. The
main presenting symptoms in adults are developmental delays
with psychiatric disorders and cardiac anomalies.54 A recent
study showed that 22q11DS might increase the risk of
earlyonset Parkinson’s disease.55 Hypoparathyroidism might be
the main reason for diagnosis during adulthood. It was
reported that familial inheritance is the most frequent reason
for adults with 22q11DS to be referred to the genetic clinic.
If concomitant findings such as the typical facial features
and voice abnormalities (such as hypernasality) associated
with 22q11 deletions are observed in patients evaluated at
psychiatry and cardiology clinics, the diagnosis of 22q11DS
should be considered.28,54
Diagnosis
The decision to test for 22q11DS is easy if multiple defects
and/or symptoms associated with the syndrome are present
simultaneously. However, physicians should note that the
signs and symptoms might be subtle; therefore, clinical clues
could be overlooked easily. As mentioned above, patients
with this syndrome usually have mild facial features. As
such, careful physical examinations using anthropometric
measures are very important for suspected cases of 22q11DS.
It should be noted that the diagnosis of 22q11DS, particularly
in adolescents and adults, often requires an enhanced index
of suspicion.30–32 Detailed suggestions for clinicians have
been published elsewhere.56</p>
      <p>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the current
method of choice for detecting 22q11.2 microdeletions. FISH
is a highly accurate and reliable test that can also be used for
prenatal diagnosis. However, it is limited to a single target
sequence within the proximal 22q11.2 deletion region, and
some atypical deletions do not include the region analyzed
using FISH with commonly used probes (such as TUPLE1).
A polymerase chain reaction-based assay (multiplex
liganddependent probe amplification) is used widely in Europe,
and is becoming accepted increasingly in the US because
it has a rapid turnaround time, it is more cost-effective, and
can detect the smaller deletions missed by FISH. This novel
technique is capable of detecting atypical 22q11.2 deletions
that are not routinely tested or detected using routine FISH.5,57
Advanced molecular methods that identify the deletion or
duplication of genomic sequences at high resolution, such
as microarrays, can also be used. The detection capacity of
microarrays depends on the density of the probes used. This
is particularly important when patients present with classical
features of the syndrome but no evidence of gene deletions
using FISH; diagnosis is challenging in these patients. For
example, point mutations in TBX1 have been described in a
small number of patients.58</p>
      <p>There is a need for a rapid, cost-effective, and easy
laboratory method for screening and diagnosis of 22q11DS.
A recent study shows promise in this regard. A multiplex
droplet digital polymerase chain reaction is sensitive and
specific for the detection of 22q11DS.59
Management
22q11DS is a multisystem syndrome with remarkable
variability and expression among individuals. Moreover, the
presence of one feature does not predict the presence of any
other feature. As such, the management of 22q11DS patients
is highly dependent on age and phenotype; therefore,
treatment is individualized according to the underlying lesion
and severity.31,32</p>
      <p>In infants and young children with feeding problems,
recurrent infections, hypocalcemia, and structural cardiac and
palatal anomalies might be accompanied by speech, learning,
and/or developmental difficulties. The combination of poor
suck reflexes, palatal weakness, and dysfunctional
swallowing often means that formula rests in abnormal anatomic
locations or regurgitates into the Eustachian tube or sinuses.
Gastroesophageal reflux is also common in these patients.
The management of feeding difficulties includes thickeners,
anti-reflux medications, and nasogastric or gastrostomic
feeding tubes when necessary.2,3,31,32</p>
      <p>Hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism is a common
problem during the neonatal period, but it could occur at any
age, including adulthood. The standard treatment for
hypoparathyroidism is to correct hypocalcemia using oral vitamin D
analogs and calcium. However, physicians should be careful to
avoid overtreatment, which results in hypercalciuria,
hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and renal failure.60
Teriparatide recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1–34)
is a promising novel treatment for chronic hypocalcemia in
hypoparathyroid syndromic children, and it might solve this
problem in the future.41 A recent study demonstrated the
efficacy of parental parathyroid transplantation combined
with allogeneic thymus transplantation in a patient.61 Daily
vitamin D is advised for 22q11DS patients of all ages with
hypocalcemia; the dose should be the recommended daily
allowance or as indicated therapeutically.32</p>
      <p>Recurrent infections, particularly otitis media, might
be an important problem during this period, and hearing
loss might occur. Children should be treated appropriately
for infections and followed carefully for potential hearing
problems. Unrecognized hearing loss might contribute to
delayed speech and cognitive development.31,32,43,49</p>
      <p>Reconstituting the immune system is essential for patients
with complete DGS, which can be accomplished by two
methods: thymus tissue transplantation and a fully matched
peripheral blood T-cell transplantation. Patients with complete
DGS need to be protected from infections and blood products.
Antifungal, antiviral, and antipneumocystis prophylaxis, and
immunoglobulin replacement therapy should be commenced
in these patients. Blood products could induce
graft-versushost disease when T-cells are absent. If necessary, patients
should receive cytomegalovirus-negative and irradiated blood
products. In addition, live viral vaccines should be avoided
in patients with severe immunodeficiency.43,49 Adverse events
following live immunizations are typically minor and
selflimited, suggesting that live vaccines could be considered
in patients with mild-to-moderate immunosuppression.62 As
mentioned above, hypogammaglobulinemia might develop
in patients with 22q11DS. For example, severe antibody
deficiencies that are associated with lower respiratory tract
infections and autoimmune conditions might occur.
Therefore, patients should be screened for potential antibody
deficiency.49 Importantly, the degree of immunodeficiency
cannot be predicted based on other phenotypic features
and must be assessed individually in each patient with
22q11DS.63</p>
      <p>Patients with 22q11DS have high death rates. Most deaths
occur during the first year of life, and are associated with the
presence of congenital heart diseases, particularly severe
cardiac defects.64 Right-sided heart failure, which is related
to pulmonary vascular resistance, is a common complication
of these anomalies, and was proposed to be an important
contributor to mortality.64 Surgical treatment is necessary
for many of the cardiac problems in patients with 22q11DS.
Nevertheless, individualized surgical approaches are needed
according to the underlying cardiac lesion in each patient.65
Laryngeal abnormalities are not rare and are important
to recognize, particularly if cardiac surgery is planned.
Therefore, complete ear, nose, and throat examinations and
airway evaluations should be performed before any surgical
procedure.66</p>
      <p>Speech during childhood should be given careful
attention, and speech therapy might be necessary in 22q11DS
patients. Submucosal cleft palate can be detected easily using
careful physical examinations, and can be corrected using
surgery. Patients with velopharyngeal insufficiency should
be followed up and treated by an experienced team. Surgery
is often necessary and useful to correct velopharyngeal
insufficiency with or without palatal defect. Adenoidectomy
might worsen speech articulation; therefore, it should be
avoided as much as possible. In addition, head-and-neck
vascular anomalies are common in patients with 22q11DS,
and there is an increased risk of carotid artery injury because
of medical displacement during pharyngeal surgery. This
possibility should be considered before and during relevant
operations.19,67,68 Finally, the risk of obstructive sleep apnea
is increased in patients with 22q11DS after velopharyngeal
insufficiency surgery.69</p>
      <p>Preschool and school-aged children with 22q11DS should
be screened for neurocognitive and psychiatric problems.
These patients should be followed carefully because early
support and treatment are vital in these individuals. Adjusting
the child’s school environment might also maximize learning.
Behavioral issues and psychiatric illnesses are likely to
become more problematic with increasing age. Although
psychotic disorders are chronic in most cases, they can also
be transient. Anxiety disorders are a major risk factor for
psychosis in patients with 22q11DS. As such, accurate
psychiatric management should start in childhood and continue
throughout adulthood in these individuals.45,46</p>
      <p>As mentioned above, 22q11DS might affect many
systems, and urinary ultrasonography should be
performed after diagnosis. Children with 22q11DS should
be screened for scoliosis, and surgical treatment might be
necessary to correct this condition. Symmetric leg pain
is seen frequently in 22q11DS patients during childhood,
whereas asymmetric leg pain suggests other pathologies.
Patients should also be screened for thyroid function and
if necessary, thyroid morphology. Vomiting is common
with 22q11DS, and can indicate a problem in the
gastrointestinal system such as reflux or malrotation. If indicated
clinically, patients should also be screened for autoimmune
disorders such as Celiac disease. Subjects should also be
screened for strabismus and refractive errors at 2 years or
3 years of age.31,32</p>
      <p>Children with 22q11DS should be followed up using
the specialized growth charts available for this syndrome.
If growth problems are detected, an endocrinologist could
be consulted.53,70</p>
      <p>The optimal management of patients with 22q11DS
requires a comprehensive team approach, including
specialists in genetics, pediatrics, endocrinology, plastic surgeons,
immunologists, otolaryngologists, and speech therapists.
22q11DS is not a rare syndrome, and there is a need to form
a local specialist team to ensure optimal management of
affected patients. Appropriate guidelines for the
management of patients are available in the literature, which contain
useful information for physicians interested in 22q11DS
syndrome.31,32,71 22q11DS might be difficult to recognize
and diagnose in some patients, although the clinical findings
for early diagnosis are known. Early diagnosis provides the
best opportunity for modifying the course of the illness and
optimizing patient outcome.
