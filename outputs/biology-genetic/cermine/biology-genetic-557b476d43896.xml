        <p>Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare cancer predisposition syndrome classically associated with remarkably early onset of cancer in families with a typical spectrum of malignancies, including sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, and adrenocortical carcinoma. Because the risks of cancer development are strikingly high for Li-Fraumeni syndrome, aggressive cancer surveillance is often pursued in these individuals. However, optimal screening methods and intervals for Li-Fraumeni syndrome have yet to be determined. In addition, there may be a significant psychosocial burden to intensive cancer surveillance and some prevention modalities. Here, we describe a case of a young woman with a de novo mutation in TP53 and multiple malignancies, with her most recent cancers found at early, curable stages due to aggressive cancer screening. The potential benefits and risks of intensive cancer surveillance in hereditary cancer syndromes is discussed.</p>

      <p>Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare cancer
predisposition disorder that dramatically increases the risk of
developing cancer, especially at an early age. The cancers
most often associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome
include sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, and
adrenocortical carcinoma, although the spectrum of associated
cancers can be quite broad. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is
known to be linked to germline mutations of the TP53
tumor suppression gene, located on chromosome 17p13.</p>
      <p>P53 is a transcription factor that normally regulates the
cell cycle and prevents genomic mutations. When
individuals harbor a defective copy of the TP53 gene, they
become prone to cancer development if the cell can no
longer utilize a functional p53 protein to repair DNA or
initiate normal apoptosis. While mutations in TP53 are
typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner,
some families with Li-Fraumeni cancer phenotypes do
not harbor an identifiable mutation or, on other occasions,
TP53 mutations can arise de novo in an individual
without a remarkable family history.</p>
      <p>Observations of multiple, early-onset cancers in
families led to the description of Li-Fraumeni syndrome
in 1969 [1,2]. In 2009, DNA sequencing of 525 patients
with clinical suspicion of Li-Fraumeni syndrome found
mutations in 91 patients. All families with a TP53
mutation had at least one family member with a sarcoma,
breast, brain, or adrenocortical carcinoma, and these were
identified as “core cancers” in this syndrome [3].</p>
      <p>Melanoma, gastric cancer, lymphoma, Wilms tumor,
leukemia, and colorectal carcinoma are also associated
with this syndrome [4].</p>
      <p>Risks of cancer development in individuals with
LiFraumeni syndrome are strikingly high. For female
carriers of a TP53 mutation, lifetime risk of cancer by age 60
approaches 90 percent, with average age of first cancer
diagnosis reported to be 28 [3,5]. Male carriers face a
slightly lower lifetime risk of 73 percent, though age of
onset of first cancer has been reported to be lower as well,
at age 21 [3,6]. Risks of developing a second malignancy
are high as well, described to be as high as 60 percent in
the 30 years following initial cancer diagnosis [7].
Despite these risks, precise cancer screening guidelines for

those with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have yet to be defined.</p>
      <p>Individuals affected by Li-Fraumeni syndrome may be
offered a battery of screening tests, which can include
frequent physical exams, blood tests, breast MRI,
colonoscopy, and body imaging with CT, ultrasound,
and/or body MRI starting as young as age 20 — or even
earlier in some cases.</p>
      <p>Here, we report a case of a young woman with de
novo Li-Fraumeni syndrome who initially presented with
sarcoma at age 11 and has gone on to develop a total of
five different malignancies by the age of 28. We present
her case as a noteworthy example of Li-Fraumeni
syndrome, illustrating both the potential benefit and the
potential burden of cancer screening and subsequent
management for these patients.
CDH1, PALB2, TP53, SMAD4, STK11, CHEK2, SDHB,
SDHC, FH, VHL, MET, TSC1, PTEN, SDHD, TSC2, and
FLCN. Testing revealed a heterozygous splice site
mutation in TP53, IVS6-2A&gt;G, and no other mutations in
cancer-related genes. Both parents tested negative for the
mutation, indicating that it either arose de novo in a sperm
or egg cell or that one parent was a gonadal mosaic.
Genetic testing in the patient’s brother was recommended
because of the possibility of gonadal mosaicism in a parent.</p>
      <p>The patient has no children of her own at this time, but
she was counseled that as a confirmed TP53 germline
mutation carrier, she has a 50 percent chance of passing the
mutation on to her future children.</p>
      <p>Shortly following her formal diagnosis of
Li-Fraumeni syndrome, she underwent her first routine screening
breast MRI at the age of 27. The breast MRI revealed a 5
mm abnormality in the left breast. Biopsy of this area
revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma, ER positive, PR
positive, HER2 positive (3+ on immunohistochemistry). She
initially underwent lumpectomy, with pathology
revealing a Stage I invasive ductal carcinoma measuring 4 mm,
grade 3, negative margins with no lymph node
involvement. She was treated with adjuvant paclitaxel and
trastuzumab, followed by trastuzumab alone to complete
1 year of therapy. She underwent bilateral prophylactic
mastectomies and was subsequently started on endocrine
therapy with a 5- to 10-year course of tamoxifen planned.</p>
      <p>She is currently undergoing aggressive ongoing
cancer surveillance as per published guidelines, comprised of
annual brain MRI, annual total body MRI, colonoscopy
every 2 years, annual dermatologic exam, and complete
blood counts and LDH screening every 3 months. She no
longer requires breast imaging due to her choice of
bilateral mastectomies. She soon will undergo an additional
3month short interval chest MRI based on a new, small rib
abnormality seen on total body MRI.</p>
      <p>An 11-year-old girl presented in 1998 with a “bump”
on her left calf that gradually increased in size. A biopsy
was performed, which revealed a rhabdomyosarcoma. The
patient was treated with combination chemotherapy that
included cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, doxorubicin,
actinomycin D, vincristine, and carboplatin along with
radiation therapy to the left calf. She initially did well, but
developed a local recurrence 1 year later, which ultimately
required a below-the-knee limb amputation at the age of
12. Later that year, she developed a palpable “bump” on
one of her right lower ribs. This was resected and found to
be a chondrosarcoma. She had a local recurrence at the rib
surgical bed within 18 months, requiring wider surgical
resection of the rib and adjacent lung. At the age of 18,
she developed what appeared to be a cyst on one of her
vulva. This was resected and found to be a small Stage I
leiomyosarcoma.</p>
      <p>Because of her history of three separate, early-onset
sarcomas, she started annual surveillance MRI of chest,
abdomen, and pelvis at the age of 18. She did well until the
age of 22, at which time she was found to have a new, DISCUSSION

cancer history is unusually strong with five separate
cancers diagnosed by the age of 27. As a comparison, in a
case series of 200 individuals diagnosed with cancer from
24 different Li-Fraumeni kindreds, 15 percent of
individuals developed a second cancer, 4 percent had a third
cancer, and 2 percent had a fourth cancer [7]. Her specific
germline TP53 mutation, namely IVS6-2A&gt;G, might be
predicted to yield a mild phenotype. In general, splice site
mutations and other mutations that completely inactivate
the gene are felt to produce a milder phenotype than
missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain [8], but
clearly the genotype-phenotype correlation in this disease
is not precise. The specific mutation found in this patient
was previously reported in a patient with milder features
[9]. It should be noted, however, that the daughter of the
reported patient had two sarcomas diagnosed before age
18. Our patient’s genetic testing included whole exome
analysis, and no additional oncogenic mutations or
alterations were found; thus, we reason that her aggressive
cancer phenotype is attributed primarily to the single splice
site mutation identified in TP53.</p>
      <p>This patient has been fortunate to have all of her
cancers diagnosed at early stages. This has allowed for the
benefit of long-term, disease-free survival intervals, but
also has provided the opportunity for new cancers to
develop during those times. Indeed, as the recognition of
hereditary cancer syndromes improves in parallel with
enhanced cancer diagnosis and treatment, there may be an
increasing number of Li-Fraumeni patients who go on to
develop high numbers of serial primary malignancies.</p>
      <p>Though this patient’s case was unusual in some ways
for Li-Fraumeni syndrome, the fact that this patient
developed multiple cancers of any kind, especially starting
at a young age, would be important red flags for the
clinician to recognize and should prompt referral for genetic
counseling. The differential diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni
syndrome includes other inherited cancer syndromes,
including hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome,
typically characterized by mutations in BRCA 1 and 2, and

hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma (Lynch)
syndrome. Both syndromes can overlap with Li-Fraumeni
syndrome in terms of cancer types and age of onset and,
in fact, are more prevalent in the general population than
Li-Fraumeni syndrome. As such, these syndromes should
also be considered in any patient with a strong personal
and/or family history of cancer. General criteria for
referral for cancer genetic counseling are listed in Table 1.</p>
      <p>If mutations in BRCA 1/2 and/or Lynch
syndrome-associated genes have been considered and not found,
screening for Li-Fraumeni syndrome may be appropriate.</p>
      <p>Table 2 lists guidelines regarding whom to test
specifically for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. In general, the Classic
and Chompret criteria can help identify families at risk for
germline p53 mutation, though it is important to
remember that negative results do not rule out a diagnosis of
LiFraumeni syndrome if the personal or family history is
suggestive of the syndrome [2,10]. While most guidelines
generally suggest testing for TP53 mutations in families
with classic tumor types (sarcoma, breast, adrenocortical
carcinoma, and brain tumors) and with cancer onset &lt; age
45, an important independent testing criteria for clinicians
to recognize is that all women with early-onset breast
cancer (age of diagnosis &lt; 35), regardless of family history,
should also be considered for TP53 mutation testing,
particularly if the breast tumor is Her2-positive [3,11]. Thus,
our patient would still have qualified for TP53 testing even
if her only cancer diagnosis had been her breast cancer at
age 27. Before genetic testing is performed, risk
assessment and counseling should be performed by a certified
genetic counselor and informed consent should be
obtained [12]. Reproductive options and counseling
regarding possible inherited cancer risk to relatives should also
be addressed [13].</p>
      <p>A major goal in recognition and prompt diagnosis of
a hereditary cancer syndrome is to provide the
opportunity for patients and families to undergo aggressive cancer
screening and pursue cancer prevention strategies so that
the impact of a cancer diagnosis can be minimized or
avoided altogether. In our patient, aggressive cancer
screening specifically led to early diagnoses of her renal
cell carcinoma and her breast cancer. Though both
diseases are ultimately fatal when found at advanced stages,
the prognosis for Stage I disease in both renal cell
carcinoma and breast cancer is excellent, with cure rates
exceeding 90 percent. Early cancer detection also can help
minimize the need for aggressive treatment. For example,
in our patient, her renal cell carcinoma was treated with
curative intent with surgery alone, and her breast cancer
chemotherapy regimen was less rigorous than would have
been needed for a larger tumor. Knowing she carried a
TP53 mutation, she then opted to pursue bilateral
mastectomies, not only to avoid radiation treatment but
primarily to prevent future breast cancers from developing.</p>
      <p>Despite these seemingly clear benefits, optimal
screening methods and intervals for Li-Fraumeni syndrome have
yet to be determined. Though periodic surveillance and
riskreducing interventions have been shown in more common
hereditary syndromes such as BRCA 1/2 and Lynch
syndrome to reduce morbidity and mortality [14], similar
medical benefits from screening and aggressive cancer
prevention modalities remain unclear and unproven. There
has been only one small observational study regarding
screening for patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. In 33
asymptomatic TP53 mutation carriers, Villani et al.
described aggressive cancer screening, including whole-body
MRI and other biochemical tests such as complete blood
counts and blood chemistries, to be feasible [15].
Meanwhile, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN†) cancer surveillance consensus guidelines for
LiFraumeni syndrome include consideration of breast and
colon cancer screening starting at age 20 and an annual
comprehensive physical exam, as well as discussion of
other screening modalities such as brain MRI and total body
MRI. After discussion of her screening options, our patient
desired aggressive surveillance and is being followed per
Villani et al. [12] guidelines as described in Table 3.</p>
      <p>While the intent of aggressive cancer screening is to help
patients enjoy a prolonged, healthy life with minimal cancer
burden, there may be significant trade-off in psychosocial
burden for some patients related to aggressive surveillance.</p>
      <p>The common occurrences of incidental findings on repeated
screenings, associated “false positive” scans leading to
biopsy, and the anxiety of a possible cancer diagnosis can
lead to significant psychosocial distress and screening fatigue
in some patients with hereditary cancer syndromes. At the
time of the discovery of her deleterious TP53 mutation, this
patient expressed a sense of “exhaustion” about her clinical
course thus far and indicated her worry about how many
times she would have to go through cancer diagnosis and
treatment before “enough was enough.” This patient was
appropriately referred to a therapist by her genetic counselor
and later reported that she found this very helpful in coping
with her fears and frustrations. Very little exists in the
literature specifically addressing psychosocial distress in
Li-Fraumeni syndrome, though one small study reported that 36
percent of TP53 carriers report unnecessary worry as a
barrier to screening adherence [14]. However, no significant
difference in psychosocial distress was found between those
undergoing aggressive surveillance compared to those who
were not [14]. It is essential that all patients diagnosed with
a hereditary cancer syndrome be counseled by their providers
about the potential benefits and the potential burden of
cancer surveillance and be offered support and counseling
around potential psychosocial distress.</p>
      <p>Here, we present a case of de novo Li-Fraumeni
syndrome in a young woman with multiple malignancies and
her subsequent management. Though rare, a diagnosis of
Li-Fraumeni syndrome has significant implications for
cancer screening and prevention. Clinicians must be
vigilant about recognizing potential hereditary cancer
syndromes and refer for appropriate genetic counseling.</p>
      <p>Individualized risks and benefits and specific attention to
the potential for psychosocial distress must be taken into
account when managing such patients.</p>
