practice With over half of Australia's information educators looking to retire in the
next 10 years, the information profession (practitioners, employers, educators,
professional associations) must actively carry out succession planning for future
information educators. The connection between Australia's information industry and
education is strong and should be encouraged and maintained so that educators are
well informed to produce information graduates for the rapidly changing digital
landscape. The Australian information sector must continue to build its research
profile nationally and internationally by establishing strategies that will encourage
both individual and collaborative research endeavours within and across industry and
the academy. Introduction Whilst research exploring the nature, characteristics,
issues and challenges of information professionals abounds, both in Australia and
elsewhere, very little is known about the<component x="67.29" y="136.4"

information education. Indeed, many in the profession have suggested that information
professionals and information educators inhabit two different worlds and that very
rarely do these worlds collide. Moran (2001, 54) notes that 'many librarians have
little firsthand experience with library education after they graduate'. Similarly,
Feather (2003, 40) contends that the vast majority of information practitioners 'have
not stepped foot into an LIS [library and information science] department since the
day [they] left'. Given that the future of Australia's information industry hinges in
large measure on the quality of new graduates entering the profession, and that
information educators are the key people responsible for educating and training these
graduates, it is time to bring these two worlds closer together. This paper develops
our understanding of the nation's information educators by presenting key findings
from a recent study that explored the characteristics and experiences of information
educators in Australia. The study reported in this paper was undertaken as part of a
national research project funded by the Australian Learning and Reconceptualising and
Repositioning Australian Library and Teaching Council, Information Science Education
for the Twenty-first Century . This project was undertaken with a team of 12
university and vocational information educators from 11 institutions around Australia
between November 2009 and December 2010. The purpose of the project was to establish
a consolidated and holistic picture of Australian information profession and to
identify how the profession's future education and training could be mediated in a
cohesive and sustainable manner (Partridge and Yates 2012; Partridge et al. 2011).
Recognising three major stakeholders in the education process, the project was framed
around three areas of consideration: students, industry and educators. This paper
reports on one of the three areas considered - the educators. The data for the study
was collected in 2010 so the findings reported here represent a snapshot in time. The
Australian information sector and its subsequent education is not static, but is
evolving and growing in response to various national and international stimuli.
Nonetheless, the findings presented in the paper provide, for the first time, a
unique insight into the characteristics and experiences of Australia's information
educators. The paper begins with a brief review of relevant literature before
providing an overview of the research design and outlining key findings from the
study. It concludes by discussing the key implications of the study and identifying
areas of further research. Literature review The Australian Library and Information
Association (ALIA) gathers information on the education programmes in Australia
recognised by the association at both university and vocational education and
training (VET) institutions. ALIA also gathers data on those individuals involved in
teaching within those programmes in its Annual Course Return. This data has been
collected annually since 1996 and is one of the few formal data collection mechanisms
available, but is not publicly available. Hallam (2007) provides a brief analysis of
the data gathered by ALIA in 2006 and concludes that there were too many information
programmes, staffed by too few academics, competing for too few students. Other
professional associations within the information sector, such as the Records and
Information Management Professionals Australasia and the Australian Society of
Archivists, do not have a formal process for gathering data on the education
programmes they accredit. At the time that this study was conducted there was only
anecdotal information available about the educators of these programmes. It should be
noted, however, that many of the programmes accredited by these associations are also
taught alongside the programmes accredited by ALIA; consequently, they are also
taught by many of the same educators. Over the years, a number of studies have
investigated information educators both in Australia and around the world. Since
1980, the Association for Library and Information Education (ALISE) has provided an
annual report that seeks to understand the 'activities of the academic programs that
provide the underpinnings for education for the library and information professions'
(Wallace and Naidoo 2010, xxvii). The report provides valuable insight into the
changing nature of education within the schools of library and information science in
the United States and Canada. The ALISE annual report provides a basic level of
description of the North American information educators but does not explore areas
such as workload, research productivity, teaching activities and job satisfaction. A
2005 project funded by the European Association for Library and Information Education
and Research and the SOCRATES Accompanying Measures Scheme provides insight into
European information education. Two hundred information schools were invited to
participate in an online questionnaire exploring school size, programmes offered,
entrance requirements and nature of the curricula (Borup Larsen 2005). Fifty schools
completed the questionnaire. The majority of European information schools are
relatively small in size with less than 200 students enrolled. Nearly two-thirds of
the schools have fewer than 20 academic staff and just over a quarter of the schools
operate with ten or less full time staff members. The Borup Larsen study focused on
describing the European information schools and departments and provides only a
limited understanding of the European information educators themselves. It does not
explore qualifications, experience, age, gender and workload. In Australia, Smith
(2006) explored the educational qualifications and professional development
activities of members of the Information Studies Educators' Forum. More recently,
Wilson et al. (2010) provide a historical insight into the nature of Australian
information academics by analysing data obtained from sources such as institutional
academic handbooks, information programme brochures and news items in information
journals. These studies focussed on the university context. Information education in
Australia occurs at two levels, the professional via university programmes at the
undergraduate and postgraduate level and the paraprofessional via VET programmes at
the diploma and advanced diploma level. Consequently, any study seeking to establish
greater understanding of Australia's information educators must include both
educational domains. Very little is currently known about the information educators
within the VET sector. In 2009 ALIA, as part of its programme recognition process,
conducted site visits to all 17 institutions offering the Diploma/Advanced Diploma of
Library/Information Services. ALIA produced a 'state of the nation' report providing
an overview of these site visits and key issues impacting on library technician
programmes in Australia, including curriculum design and content, resourcing,
infrastructure and staffing (ALIA 2010). In terms of staffing, concerns were noted
about workload, succession planning and the difficulties in attracting new staff. The
report does not provide any specific details on the library technician educators
(i.e., age, gender, number, qualifications). As with Smith (2006) and Wilson et al.
(2010), it must be noted that the report does not include institutions offering
degrees within the information field not recognised by ALIA (e.g., records
management, archival studies). The information profession is not alone in its
interest in establishing greater understanding of its educators. Studies profiling
Australian academics have also been conducted in the fields of science (Edwards and
Smith 2010), health (KPMG 2009), engineering (Engineers Australia 2008) and education
(Cumming 2010). Many of these studies have emerged in response to Hugo's argument
(Hugo 2005, 2008; Hugo and Morriss 2010) that demographic issues facing Australian
universities in the 2010s and 2020s will result in the need for regeneration within
the academic workforce as the baby boomer generation reaches retirement age. The
growing importance in developing a better understanding of the current academic
workforce is also evidenced by the Changing Academic Profession (CAP) Project
(Research Institute for Higher Education, Hiroshima University 2008). Twenty-two
countries conducted a survey of their nation's academic workforce. By using the same
online questionnaire, the project was able to establish individual national profiles
as well as provide international comparisons, and a number of similarities and
differences were noted between nations. A vast majority of the participating
countries reported a growing number of academic staff with higher degrees, especially
doctorates, higher job satisfaction, increased pressure on faculty in the research
arena and a feminisation of the workforce (Huang 2008). From the small, but growing,
body of knowledge exploring information educators within Australia, two observations
can be made. First, studies to date have focussed on library educators and not
information educators (educators involved in education in all aspects of the
information profession including library, records management, archives, teacher
librarianship, information management). Second, no studies have explored information
educators at both the university and VET sector. The current study will fill these
gaps and its results will contribute to the workforce planning of Australia's
information educators. Research design The study reported in this paper is one part
of a larger project funded by the Australian Reconceptualising and Repositioning
Library and Learning and Teaching Council: Information Science Education for the
Twenty-first Century . Eleven institutions representing university and vocational
information education in Australia undertook the 12-month project, which was designed
to establish a consolidated and holistic picture of the Australian information
profession and identify how its future education could be mediated in a cohesive and
sustainable manner. The project was framed around three areas: information students,
the information workforce and information educators. This paper reports key findings
from the information educators area, which sought to establish greater understanding
of the key nature and characteristics of Australian information educators. The key
findings of all three considerations areas are available in the project's final
report (Partridge et al. 2011). The questionnaire used in the CAP Project (Research
Institute for Higher Education, Hiroshima University 2008) informed the design of the
questionnaire for this study. Drawing upon the CAP Project's instrument allowed for
easier comparison with national and international data on the world's academic
workforce. Although the CAP instrument informed the study, questions were modified
and added to accommodate the VET context and the specific needs and interests of the
information sector in Australia. The questionnaire was pilot tested using a subset of
the target population with the aim of testing clarity of wording, interpretation and
acceptance of the questions, and completing the online instrument using a range of
Web browsers. The questionnaire used for final data collection consisted of 53
questions that provided both quantitative and qualitative data. The instrument was
divided into five sections: demographics, teaching and learning; publications,
projects and research; service; perceived issues and challenges; and the future of
education for the information professions. The population for the current study was
information educators based in tertiary educational institutions - universities,
Technical and Further Education (TAFE) and VET. Information was defined broadly to
include areas such as library studies, archive studies, records management,
information and knowledge management and teacher librarianship. The questionnaire was
available online in August and September 2010. A purposive sampling approach was
used. Participants were recruited via educator elists, emails to heads of schools and
departments and emails to course, programme or degree coordinators. Descriptive
analysis was undertaken using Microsoft Excel. Prior to analysis, the data was
examined for accuracy of data entry. Whilst 110 responses were obtained, after data
cleaning, 69 valid responses were identified and used for analysis. The other
responses were excluded from analysis for their lack of completeness. Of the valid
responses obtained, 45 respondents (65%) considered themselves to be educators within
the university sector, and 24 (35%) in the TAFE/VET sector. Findings This section
outlines the key findings in five areas: age, gender and rank, qualifications, work
activities and job satisfaction. Age The ages of respondents ranged from 27 to 64
years with an average age of 50 (Figure 1). Just over 63% of the participants were
aged 50 years or older. For almost a decade, the Australian demographer Graeme Hugo
has been warning about the 'lost generation' of academics (2005, 340). According to
Hugo (cited in Cervini 2010), 'generation X are pretty thin in universities compared
to baby boomers, who are strongly represented'. The findings in this study provide
strong support for Hugo's observations. Of the university academics who participated
in the study, almost 56% were n 50 years or older (baby boomers) and less than 5% (
2) were 30 years of age or &#xBC; younger. Removing casual or sessional academics
(e.g., the tutors and markers) from consideration and focussing only on the full-time
and part-time ongoing or contract staff, n over 61% of the study's participants were
aged 50 years and older and just over 3% ( 1) &#xBC; were 30 years of age or younger.
These results suggest that the information academic workforce is considerably older
than the total Australian academic workface, where only 40.3% are aged 50 (Hugo and
Morriss 2010). Whilst studies profiling the Australian &#xFE; VET sector are
relatively new, a recent study indicates that the ageing VET workforce is a pressing
issue, with 48% of the TAFE workforce (the largest subset of the VET
sector)<component x="67.29" y="260.61" width="358.66" height="379.56" page="2"

(Guthrie 2010). The findings of this study are therefore very striking: almost 79% of
the VET educators who participated in the study were aged 50 &#xFE; and only one VET
educator was younger than 40 years of age. It is therefore not surprising that the
study revealed that over half of the participants, regardless of institutional
context, were looking to retire within the next 10 years. With over two-thirds of
information educators approaching retirement age in the next 10 -15 years, and over
half indicating that they are indeed looking to retire in the next 10 years, the
succession planning of Australian information educators is an important issue to be
addressed. Hallam (2007) points to challenges in the recruitment of educators in the
university context: currently, the PhD is an essential selection criterion for
academic appointments, yet a PhD remains a relatively scarce commodity in the
Australian information profession (Macauley, Evans, and Pearson 2010). A 2009 study
by Macauley, Evans, and Pearson which analysed Australian PhD records between 1987
and 2006 revealed that the research fields, courses and discipline (RFCD) of
Librarianship (one of 139 disciplines in the RFCD schema) remained static for the
number of its PhD completions between the 5-year brackets 1987- 1991 and 2002 -2006.
In contrast Nursing, which had similar PhD completions to LIS for the 1987 - 1991
period, had the second highest growth rate (behind Tourism) in 2002 -2006. As a
further comparison, during the 1987 -1991 and 2002- 2006 periods, the total number of
PhD graduations in Australia trebled. Only Veterinary Sciences had a lower growth
rate than LIS from the 139 disciplines nationwide. Consequently, while opportunities
exist to recruit information educators from overseas, there is also a pressing need
to entice Australian information practitioners into doctoral studies. Gender and rank
The majority of the study's respondents (79%) were female. The high proportion of
females mirrors the preponderance of women in the information professions, at least
in terms of the narrower library definition. Whilst the female dominance within
information education may not at first glance appear to be a significant issue, a
number of interesting points are worth noting. Recent studies, both in Australia and
overseas, have shown that male academics are more likely to occupy the higher
academic ranks (Level D Associate Professor and Level E Professor) than female
academics (Coates et al. 2008a). The current study supports this observation. Just
over two-thirds of the participants held junior-level positions (Level B Lecturer and
below). Of the information academics who participated in the study, there were no
Level E appointments and only five Level D appointments, of which only one was
female. In 2010, nearly 20% of the 46,969 Australian university teaching and research
staff were Level D and E (DEEWR 2010). Figure 2 compares the university academic
rankings of the respondents of the current study with the Australian academic
workforce (DEEWR 2010). The information profession has roughly the same number of
junior academic staff (Associate Lecturer and Lecturer) but fewer senior staff
(Associate Professor and Professor) than the general Australian academic population.
Just over 15% of the study's participants responded 'other'. The issue of academic
rank is important; it is the senior academics who are best placed to influence
university and higher education policy and who ensure that the discipline, even one
as small as the information field, is positively regarded (Smith 2006). Studies have
also suggested that females tend to hold more casual, contract or parttime positions
both in the university and VET context. Employment in this capacity makes obtaining
tenure a difficult task for females. Almost 38% of the participants were<component

or part-time capacity, and of this, total 97% were female. This is slightly higher
than the academic workforce in general where 27.7% of the full time equivalent are
employed on a fractional or casual basis (DEEWR 2010). Coates et al. (2009) note that
the move to greater casualisation in academia is indicative of the broader trend in
the Australian workforce. They also note that casualisation may not be problematic
and that very little is known about casual staff. Qualifications All but one of the
45 university academics in the current study had a postgraduate qualification, over
half had a PhD, and 15% were currently completing their doctoral studies. This is
similar to the findings by Smith (2006) who surveyed members of the Information
Studies Educators' Forum and noted that 52% of information academics had a PhD with
another 26% completing one. The figures in both studies contrast significantly with
the Australian academic workforce where almost 67% have a doctorate (DEEWR 2010).
They are also in contrast to the US context where 90% of information faculty during
the 1990s had a PhD (Durrance 2003). Three-quarters of the VET educators in the
current study had a postgraduate qualification, with only one educator possessing a
PhD. This is striking when considered against the 2008 figures that showed only
one-quarter of teachers within the TAFE workforce had a postgraduate qualification
(Guthrie 2010). Australia's information educators in the VET sector are more
qualified than their teaching peers. As the VET educators in the current study are
considerably older than the overall VET workforce, it may be that they have had more
time to acquire their postgraduate qualifications. Onethird of the VET educators
indicated that they were currently studying, at a variety of levels including
Diploma, coursework Masters, research Masters and PhD. The range of fields in which
respondents, both university and VET, studied for their highest academic
qualification was quite diverse, although library studies and education accounted for
over 45% of the qualifications. Other areas of study included information and
knowledge management, information systems, business, archival studies, history,
politics and internet studies. A variety of reasons were given by respondents for
choosing to engage with ongoing studies: only a minority were doing a programme
because they 'had' to, many were 'life-long learners', some were looking to change
careers and others were studying primarily out of interest. What this study reveals
is that Australia's information educators have embraced the importance of being
'learning professionals' (Darling-Hammond and Sykes 1999). Work activities The
respondents were asked to estimate the percentage of their work time spent on various
types of activity, both in and out of teaching sessions. Activities included research
(e.g., writing grants, conducting research, writing publications), teaching (e.g.,
preparing class materials, teaching, consulting with students) and service (e.g.,
'internal' service including committee work and undertaking leadership roles within
the work institution, and 'external' service including membership of and
participation in professional and industry bodies). Figure 3 provides details of
participants' work activities when classes were in session and out of session. As
expected, more time is spent on teaching when classes are in session, although even
then it accounts for less than half of respondents' estimated work hours. A
significant amount of time, about a quarter, is spent on administration. Even when
classes are not in session, less than a third of time is spent on research or project
work. The information educators are quite active within their own institutions and
within the information profession. Although the figures presented here relate to both
VET and higher education educators, it is interesting to compare the data to findings
from the recent national survey of Australian academics (similar data is not
available for the VET sector). Information educators are undertaking the same
relative amount of teaching, research and administration as their national peers;
however, they appear to be engaging in more service activities, almost 17% when
classes are in session and over 21% when classes are out of session (Coates et al.
2008b). In contrast, Australia's academics generally engage in less than 5% of
service activities regardless of teaching commitments. This draws attention to
information educators' strong involvement in their industry and their broader
institutional context. When asked to identify the top three challenges faced in
undertaking teaching, research and service activities, lack of time was
overwhelmingly viewed as the major obstacle in all three areas. In teaching the
quality of students, the administrative load and the breadth of the curriculum are
other leading challenges. In research another major issue is the lack of funding. For
service activities lack of recognition or appreciation was noted as a barrier.
Teaching was the most valued activity amongst respondents, with over 94% rating it as
very important or important. Figure 4 reveals activities rating as very important

respondents made considerable efforts to disseminate their project work widely,
reporting outputs such as books, journal articles, conferences and professional
publication outlets. However, like their national peers, information educators mainly
write academic articles, with newspaper and magazine publications featuring less but
still appearing as part of their academic writing portfolio. Respondents were keen
conference presenters, averaging more than one a year. They also conducted a large
number of seminars and workshops, again over one and a half a year. The information
educators who participated in the study had a strong attachment to their profession,
with 77% rating their professional affiliation as very important. The participants
rated affiliation to the profession as more important than affiliations to their
faculty (46%), school (49%) and institution (52%). Participants also indicated that
they perceived their work as being valued most by the information profession (32%)
and valued least by the institution (13%). Engagement with industry Hallam (2007,
323) suggests that information educators can 'be totally out of touch with current
industry practice'. The findings of this study clearly reveal that Australia's
information educators actively seek to connect with the industry they support. Less
than 3% have never worked within the information profession and over 30% of
information educators are, in addition to their work as an educator, also currently
employed within the information sector. It should also be noted that over 45% have
not been actively employed within the profession for more than 5 years, and 25% had
not been so for more than 10 years (see Figure 6). The respondents' engagement with
the information profession is also borne out by the number of professional
memberships, an average of one and a half subscriptions per respondent. Almost
three-quarters of respondents were members of ALIA, by far the most strongly
supported professional body. Respondents were members of 28 associations including
the Records and Information Management Professionals Australasia (15%), the
Australian School Library Association (10%) and the Australian Computer Society (7%).

member of a committee or other group connected to an external organization, and
almost half had served as a peer reviewer. Over 40% had delivered professional
development courses to industry, and over a quarter had undertaken paid
consultancies. The important connection that information educators have with their
profession can also be seen in the reasons why they embarked on a career as an
information educator to begin with. Many respondents chose to become educators within
the information profession because of a strong desire to teach and because of the
attractiveness of the perceived autonomy and flexibility the role offered, but they
also had a strong wish to contribute to the profession through their role as
educators. Whilst not rated highly by all, being able to engage in research was also
indicated as a reason for becoming an educator. It is not surprising, therefore, that
when asked to comment on their strongest affiliations, information educators
indicated that they valued their links to the professions more than their
institutional ties. Respondents' attachment to their profession is also suggested by
the value they perceive their profession places on their work overall (32%) as
compared to students (28%), their colleagues (26%) and their institution (12%).
Figure 7 provides a breakdown of the educators' perceptions on how their
contributions are valued by colleagues, institutions, profession and students. Job
satisfaction Figure 8 shows the breakdown of job satisfaction. Australia's
information educators appear to be rather satisfied with their educator's life, over
80% indicating they were satisfied or very satisfied with their job and less than 20%
indicating that they were not satisfied or very unsatisfied. Educators in the VET
sector are more likely to be very satisfied (60.87%) when compared to those in the
university context (27.27%). When compared to the findings from the CAP project, it
is suggested that the Australian information academic is more satisfied (77.27%) than
Australian academics generally (55%) (Coates et al. 2008b). A recent study suggests
the information VET educators are not as satisfied as their vocational teaching peers
(69%) (Simons et al. 2009). The vast majority of respondents indicated that teaching
and/or working with students was the most satisfying aspect of their job, whilst the
least satisfying aspect related to workload and having to deal with too much
administration (it was noted earlier that<component x="67.29" y="233.97"

almost a quarter of their time on administration). Further support for a high degree
of job satisfaction is evidenced by the fact that most respondents were not looking
for another job, as Figure 9 shows, though about 10% were looking for a similar
position at another institution, and another 10% were looking for a job outside of
information studies education. Discussion and conclusions This study presents key
findings on the characteristics and experiences of information educators in
Australia. It has shown that the ageing of Australia's information educators is an
issue of profound importance for the profession. With over two-thirds of information
educators approaching retirement age in the next 10- 15 years, and over half
indicating that they are intending to retire in the next 10 years, the Australian
information sector (practitioners, employers, professional associations and
academics) must start to actively manage succession planning for future information
educators. Strategies to address this should include alternative recruitment options
(e.g., appointments from overseas), developing clearer pathways from practice to
academe and making doctoral study a more attractive option for Australia's
information practitioners. Australia's information educators invest considerable time
into all three aspects of their work: teaching, research<component x="67.29"

lateness="0.7777777777777778" reference_score="7.93">and service. Notably, they spend
more time on service than other disciplines within Australia's education system,
indicating that they have a strong focus towards engaging with and supporting the
industry they serve with educational programmes. Information educators indicated that
they placed strong importance on teaching over research. For the university educator,
this is a significant observation. With the federal government's growing interest in
research performance and in establishing the nation's universities as leaders within
the research arena internationally, information educators need to become more active
and proactive in building a stronger research profile. The Australian government
believes that universities and research are crucial to the nation's future. Based on
this belief, Australia's first national research assessment was conducted in 2010
(the same year this study's data collection took place) for research outputs in the
period 2003- 2008. Undertaken by the Australian Research Council (ARC), the
Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) scheme seeks to assess the quality of
research in Australia in an international context. Research quality is determined via
a number of mechanisms including citation analysis, peer review, ranking of
publications and research income. Of the 11 universities involved in information
education, only two were able to provide enough evidence of research output to be
included within the assessment scheme: Queensland University of Technology ('above
world standard') and Charles Sturt University ('below world standard').
Interestingly, the University of New South Wales (UNSW) also received a ranking
('above world standard'). Although UNSW stopped offering programmes in the
information discipline in 2006, it still continues to engage in active research
within the field. The second assessment exercise in 2012, for research outputs in the
period 2005- 2010, saw three more universities added to the mix providing a total of
six universities with Monash, University of Tasmania and RMIT also receiving
rankings. No university received a ranking higher than 'at world standard'. ERA will
have significant implications for niche or boutique disciplines such as information
(Svantesson and White 2009). The 2008 Consultation paper issued by the ARC states
that 'ERA will provide a framework that gives government, industry, business and the
wide community, assurance of the quality of research in Australia's higher education
institutions and guide future investment in that research effort' (Australian
Research Council 2008, 5). When ranking determines the level of funding a university
receives, it is inevitable that institutions will adjust their actions to obtain the
best ranking possible (Svantesson and White 2009). Using strategies such as promotion
criteria, universities will steer the activities of their academic staff in the
direction emphasised in the ranking process (Svantesson and White 2009; Yates 2010).
One of the aims of ERA is to define 'areas of strength' (Arup 2008, 32) and
universities might therefore feel the need to invest their limited resources in
supporting the discipline in which they are strongest, thus allowing them to continue
to excel and rate highly under ERA and thereby attract government research funding.
Academics working outside the scope of these disciplines may be encouraged to abandon
their discipline areas in favour of the dominant disciplines. It is also quite
possible that disciplines that are not perceived by the university to be of high
priority (e.g., not allowing the institution to be competitive within the ERA
programme) may be abandoned entirely (Svantesson and White 2009). Disciplines that
have limited research output as well as small student numbers within their coursework
programmes may be at risk of disappearing. The data available suggests that whilst
information educators are genuinely interested in research and are starting to have
some success in obtaining research funding, they still have some way to go. Genoni
(2005, 18) notes 'if LIS [library and information science] departments are to survive
- and hopefully thrive - in these circumstances they are under immediate pressure to
be as research active as possible'. The results of this study contribute to our
understanding of Australian information educators and provide new perspectives into
information education. This study will help to develop strategies to respond to the
unique needs of Australia's information educators. The current study, however,
presents a snap shot in time (data was collected in 2010), and the information sector
and its subsequent education is not static, but is evolving and growing in response
to various national and international stimuli. Consequently, longitudinal data would
provide a richer picture and help to identify trends relevant to Australia's
information educators and to information education.<component x="67.29" y="65.99"

practice With over half of Australia's information educators looking to retire in the
next 10 years, the information profession (practitioners, employers, educators,
professional associations) must actively carry out succession planning for future
information educators. The connection between Australia's information industry and
education is strong and should be encouraged and maintained so that educators are
well informed to produce information graduates for the rapidly changing digital
landscape. The Australian information sector must continue to build its research
profile nationally and internationally by establishing strategies that will encourage
both individual and collaborative research endeavours within and across industry and
the academy. Introduction Whilst research exploring the nature, characteristics,
issues and challenges of information professionals abounds, both in Australia and
elsewhere, very little is known about the<component x="67.29" y="136.4"

information education. Indeed, many in the profession have suggested that information
professionals and information educators inhabit two different worlds and that very
rarely do these worlds collide. Moran (2001, 54) notes that 'many librarians have
little firsthand experience with library education after they graduate'. Similarly,
Feather (2003, 40) contends that the vast majority of information practitioners 'have
not stepped foot into an LIS [library and information science] department since the
day [they] left'. Given that the future of Australia's information industry hinges in
large measure on the quality of new graduates entering the profession, and that
information educators are the key people responsible for educating and training these
graduates, it is time to bring these two worlds closer together. This paper develops
our understanding of the nation's information educators by presenting key findings
from a recent study that explored the characteristics and experiences of information
educators in Australia. The study reported in this paper was undertaken as part of a
national research project funded by the Australian Learning and Reconceptualising and
Repositioning Australian Library and Teaching Council, Information Science Education
for the Twenty-first Century . This project was undertaken with a team of 12
university and vocational information educators from 11 institutions around Australia
between November 2009 and December 2010. The purpose of the project was to establish
a consolidated and holistic picture of Australian information profession and to
identify how the profession's future education and training could be mediated in a
cohesive and sustainable manner (Partridge and Yates 2012; Partridge et al. 2011).
Recognising three major stakeholders in the education process, the project was framed
around three areas of consideration: students, industry and educators. This paper
reports on one of the three areas considered - the educators. The data for the study
was collected in 2010 so the findings reported here represent a snapshot in time. The
Australian information sector and its subsequent education is not static, but is
evolving and growing in response to various national and international stimuli.
Nonetheless, the findings presented in the paper provide, for the first time, a
unique insight into the characteristics and experiences of Australia's information
educators. The paper begins with a brief review of relevant literature before
providing an overview of the research design and outlining key findings from the
study. It concludes by discussing the key implications of the study and identifying
areas of further research. Literature review The Australian Library and Information
Association (ALIA) gathers information on the education programmes in Australia
recognised by the association at both university and vocational education and
training (VET) institutions. ALIA also gathers data on those individuals involved in
teaching within those programmes in its Annual Course Return. This data has been
collected annually since 1996 and is one of the few formal data collection mechanisms
available, but is not publicly available. Hallam (2007) provides a brief analysis of
the data gathered by ALIA in 2006 and concludes that there were too many information
programmes, staffed by too few academics, competing for too few students. Other
professional associations within the information sector, such as the Records and
Information Management Professionals Australasia and the Australian Society of
Archivists, do not have a formal process for gathering data on the education
programmes they accredit. At the time that this study was conducted there was only
anecdotal information available about the educators of these programmes. It should be
noted, however, that many of the programmes accredited by these associations are also
taught alongside the programmes accredited by ALIA; consequently, they are also
taught by many of the same educators. Over the years, a number of studies have
investigated information educators both in Australia and around the world. Since
1980, the Association for Library and Information Education (ALISE) has provided an
annual report that seeks to understand the 'activities of the academic programs that
provide the underpinnings for education for the library and information professions'
(Wallace and Naidoo 2010, xxvii). The report provides valuable insight into the
changing nature of education within the schools of library and information science in
the United States and Canada. The ALISE annual report provides a basic level of
description of the North American information educators but does not explore areas
such as workload, research productivity, teaching activities and job satisfaction. A
2005 project funded by the European Association for Library and Information Education
and Research and the SOCRATES Accompanying Measures Scheme provides insight into
European information education. Two hundred information schools were invited to
participate in an online questionnaire exploring school size, programmes offered,
entrance requirements and nature of the curricula (Borup Larsen 2005). Fifty schools
completed the questionnaire. The majority of European information schools are
relatively small in size with less than 200 students enrolled. Nearly two-thirds of
the schools have fewer than 20 academic staff and just over a quarter of the schools
operate with ten or less full time staff members. The Borup Larsen study focused on
describing the European information schools and departments and provides only a
limited understanding of the European information educators themselves. It does not
explore qualifications, experience, age, gender and workload. In Australia, Smith
(2006) explored the educational qualifications and professional development
activities of members of the Information Studies Educators' Forum. More recently,
Wilson et al. (2010) provide a historical insight into the nature of Australian
information academics by analysing data obtained from sources such as institutional
academic handbooks, information programme brochures and news items in information
journals. These studies focussed on the university context. Information education in
Australia occurs at two levels, the professional via university programmes at the
undergraduate and postgraduate level and the paraprofessional via VET programmes at
the diploma and advanced diploma level. Consequently, any study seeking to establish
greater understanding of Australia's information educators must include both
educational domains. Very little is currently known about the information educators
within the VET sector. In 2009 ALIA, as part of its programme recognition process,
conducted site visits to all 17 institutions offering the Diploma/Advanced Diploma of
Library/Information Services. ALIA produced a 'state of the nation' report providing
an overview of these site visits and key issues impacting on library technician
programmes in Australia, including curriculum design and content, resourcing,
infrastructure and staffing (ALIA 2010). In terms of staffing, concerns were noted
about workload, succession planning and the difficulties in attracting new staff. The
report does not provide any specific details on the library technician educators
(i.e., age, gender, number, qualifications). As with Smith (2006) and Wilson et al.
(2010), it must be noted that the report does not include institutions offering
degrees within the information field not recognised by ALIA (e.g., records
management, archival studies). The information profession is not alone in its
interest in establishing greater understanding of its educators. Studies profiling
Australian academics have also been conducted in the fields of science (Edwards and
Smith 2010), health (KPMG 2009), engineering (Engineers Australia 2008) and education
(Cumming 2010). Many of these studies have emerged in response to Hugo's argument
(Hugo 2005, 2008; Hugo and Morriss 2010) that demographic issues facing Australian
universities in the 2010s and 2020s will result in the need for regeneration within
the academic workforce as the baby boomer generation reaches retirement age. The
growing importance in developing a better understanding of the current academic
workforce is also evidenced by the Changing Academic Profession (CAP) Project
(Research Institute for Higher Education, Hiroshima University 2008). Twenty-two
countries conducted a survey of their nation's academic workforce. By using the same
online questionnaire, the project was able to establish individual national profiles
as well as provide international comparisons, and a number of similarities and
differences were noted between nations. A vast majority of the participating
countries reported a growing number of academic staff with higher degrees, especially
doctorates, higher job satisfaction, increased pressure on faculty in the research
arena and a feminisation of the workforce (Huang 2008). From the small, but growing,
body of knowledge exploring information educators within Australia, two observations
can be made. First, studies to date have focussed on library educators and not
information educators (educators involved in education in all aspects of the
information profession including library, records management, archives, teacher
librarianship, information management). Second, no studies have explored information
educators at both the university and VET sector. The current study will fill these
gaps and its results will contribute to the workforce planning of Australia's
information educators. Research design The study reported in this paper is one part
of a larger project funded by the Australian Reconceptualising and Repositioning
Library and Learning and Teaching Council: Information Science Education for the
Twenty-first Century . Eleven institutions representing university and vocational
information education in Australia undertook the 12-month project, which was designed
to establish a consolidated and holistic picture of the Australian information
profession and identify how its future education could be mediated in a cohesive and
sustainable manner. The project was framed around three areas: information students,
the information workforce and information educators. This paper reports key findings
from the information educators area, which sought to establish greater understanding
of the key nature and characteristics of Australian information educators. The key
findings of all three considerations areas are available in the project's final
report (Partridge et al. 2011). The questionnaire used in the CAP Project (Research
Institute for Higher Education, Hiroshima University 2008) informed the design of the
questionnaire for this study. Drawing upon the CAP Project's instrument allowed for
easier comparison with national and international data on the world's academic
workforce. Although the CAP instrument informed the study, questions were modified
and added to accommodate the VET context and the specific needs and interests of the
information sector in Australia. The questionnaire was pilot tested using a subset of
the target population with the aim of testing clarity of wording, interpretation and
acceptance of the questions, and completing the online instrument using a range of
Web browsers. The questionnaire used for final data collection consisted of 53
questions that provided both quantitative and qualitative data. The instrument was
divided into five sections: demographics, teaching and learning; publications,
projects and research; service; perceived issues and challenges; and the future of
education for the information professions. The population for the current study was
information educators based in tertiary educational institutions - universities,
Technical and Further Education (TAFE) and VET. Information was defined broadly to
include areas such as library studies, archive studies, records management,
information and knowledge management and teacher librarianship. The questionnaire was
available online in August and September 2010. A purposive sampling approach was
used. Participants were recruited via educator elists, emails to heads of schools and
departments and emails to course, programme or degree coordinators. Descriptive
analysis was undertaken using Microsoft Excel. Prior to analysis, the data was
examined for accuracy of data entry. Whilst 110 responses were obtained, after data
cleaning, 69 valid responses were identified and used for analysis. The other
responses were excluded from analysis for their lack of completeness. Of the valid
responses obtained, 45 respondents (65%) considered themselves to be educators within
the university sector, and 24 (35%) in the TAFE/VET sector. Findings This section
outlines the key findings in five areas: age, gender and rank, qualifications, work
activities and job satisfaction. Age The ages of respondents ranged from 27 to 64
years with an average age of 50 (Figure 1). Just over 63% of the participants were
aged 50 years or older. For almost a decade, the Australian demographer Graeme Hugo
has been warning about the 'lost generation' of academics (2005, 340). According to
Hugo (cited in Cervini 2010), 'generation X are pretty thin in universities compared
to baby boomers, who are strongly represented'. The findings in this study provide
strong support for Hugo's observations. Of the university academics who participated
in the study, almost 56% were n 50 years or older (baby boomers) and less than 5% (
2) were 30 years of age or &#xBC; younger. Removing casual or sessional academics
(e.g., the tutors and markers) from consideration and focussing only on the full-time
and part-time ongoing or contract staff, n over 61% of the study's participants were
aged 50 years and older and just over 3% ( 1) &#xBC; were 30 years of age or younger.
These results suggest that the information academic workforce is considerably older
than the total Australian academic workface, where only 40.3% are aged 50 (Hugo and
Morriss 2010). Whilst studies profiling the Australian &#xFE; VET sector are
relatively new, a recent study indicates that the ageing VET workforce is a pressing
issue, with 48% of the TAFE workforce (the largest subset of the VET
sector)<component x="67.29" y="260.61" width="358.66" height="379.56" page="2"

(Guthrie 2010). The findings of this study are therefore very striking: almost 79% of
the VET educators who participated in the study were aged 50 &#xFE; and only one VET
educator was younger than 40 years of age. It is therefore not surprising that the
study revealed that over half of the participants, regardless of institutional
context, were looking to retire within the next 10 years. With over two-thirds of
information educators approaching retirement age in the next 10 -15 years, and over
half indicating that they are indeed looking to retire in the next 10 years, the
succession planning of Australian information educators is an important issue to be
addressed. Hallam (2007) points to challenges in the recruitment of educators in the
university context: currently, the PhD is an essential selection criterion for
academic appointments, yet a PhD remains a relatively scarce commodity in the
Australian information profession (Macauley, Evans, and Pearson 2010). A 2009 study
by Macauley, Evans, and Pearson which analysed Australian PhD records between 1987
and 2006 revealed that the research fields, courses and discipline (RFCD) of
Librarianship (one of 139 disciplines in the RFCD schema) remained static for the
number of its PhD completions between the 5-year brackets 1987- 1991 and 2002 -2006.
In contrast Nursing, which had similar PhD completions to LIS for the 1987 - 1991
period, had the second highest growth rate (behind Tourism) in 2002 -2006. As a
further comparison, during the 1987 -1991 and 2002- 2006 periods, the total number of
PhD graduations in Australia trebled. Only Veterinary Sciences had a lower growth
rate than LIS from the 139 disciplines nationwide. Consequently, while opportunities
exist to recruit information educators from overseas, there is also a pressing need
to entice Australian information practitioners into doctoral studies. Gender and rank
The majority of the study's respondents (79%) were female. The high proportion of
females mirrors the preponderance of women in the information professions, at least
in terms of the narrower library definition. Whilst the female dominance within
information education may not at first glance appear to be a significant issue, a
number of interesting points are worth noting. Recent studies, both in Australia and
overseas, have shown that male academics are more likely to occupy the higher
academic ranks (Level D Associate Professor and Level E Professor) than female
academics (Coates et al. 2008a). The current study supports this observation. Just
over two-thirds of the participants held junior-level positions (Level B Lecturer and
below). Of the information academics who participated in the study, there were no
Level E appointments and only five Level D appointments, of which only one was
female. In 2010, nearly 20% of the 46,969 Australian university teaching and research
staff were Level D and E (DEEWR 2010). Figure 2 compares the university academic
rankings of the respondents of the current study with the Australian academic
workforce (DEEWR 2010). The information profession has roughly the same number of
junior academic staff (Associate Lecturer and Lecturer) but fewer senior staff
(Associate Professor and Professor) than the general Australian academic population.
Just over 15% of the study's participants responded 'other'. The issue of academic
rank is important; it is the senior academics who are best placed to influence
university and higher education policy and who ensure that the discipline, even one
as small as the information field, is positively regarded (Smith 2006). Studies have
also suggested that females tend to hold more casual, contract or parttime positions
both in the university and VET context. Employment in this capacity makes obtaining
tenure a difficult task for females. Almost 38% of the participants were<component

or part-time capacity, and of this, total 97% were female. This is slightly higher
than the academic workforce in general where 27.7% of the full time equivalent are
employed on a fractional or casual basis (DEEWR 2010). Coates et al. (2009) note that
the move to greater casualisation in academia is indicative of the broader trend in
the Australian workforce. They also note that casualisation may not be problematic
and that very little is known about casual staff. Qualifications All but one of the
45 university academics in the current study had a postgraduate qualification, over
half had a PhD, and 15% were currently completing their doctoral studies. This is
similar to the findings by Smith (2006) who surveyed members of the Information
Studies Educators' Forum and noted that 52% of information academics had a PhD with
another 26% completing one. The figures in both studies contrast significantly with
the Australian academic workforce where almost 67% have a doctorate (DEEWR 2010).
They are also in contrast to the US context where 90% of information faculty during
the 1990s had a PhD (Durrance 2003). Three-quarters of the VET educators in the
current study had a postgraduate qualification, with only one educator possessing a
PhD. This is striking when considered against the 2008 figures that showed only
one-quarter of teachers within the TAFE workforce had a postgraduate qualification
(Guthrie 2010). Australia's information educators in the VET sector are more
qualified than their teaching peers. As the VET educators in the current study are
considerably older than the overall VET workforce, it may be that they have had more
time to acquire their postgraduate qualifications. Onethird of the VET educators
indicated that they were currently studying, at a variety of levels including
Diploma, coursework Masters, research Masters and PhD. The range of fields in which
respondents, both university and VET, studied for their highest academic
qualification was quite diverse, although library studies and education accounted for
over 45% of the qualifications. Other areas of study included information and
knowledge management, information systems, business, archival studies, history,
politics and internet studies. A variety of reasons were given by respondents for
choosing to engage with ongoing studies: only a minority were doing a programme
because they 'had' to, many were 'life-long learners', some were looking to change
careers and others were studying primarily out of interest. What this study reveals
is that Australia's information educators have embraced the importance of being
'learning professionals' (Darling-Hammond and Sykes 1999). Work activities The
respondents were asked to estimate the percentage of their work time spent on various
types of activity, both in and out of teaching sessions. Activities included research
(e.g., writing grants, conducting research, writing publications), teaching (e.g.,
preparing class materials, teaching, consulting with students) and service (e.g.,
'internal' service including committee work and undertaking leadership roles within
the work institution, and 'external' service including membership of and
participation in professional and industry bodies). Figure 3 provides details of
participants' work activities when classes were in session and out of session. As
expected, more time is spent on teaching when classes are in session, although even
then it accounts for less than half of respondents' estimated work hours. A
significant amount of time, about a quarter, is spent on administration. Even when
classes are not in session, less than a third of time is spent on research or project
work. The information educators are quite active within their own institutions and
within the information profession. Although the figures presented here relate to both
VET and higher education educators, it is interesting to compare the data to findings
from the recent national survey of Australian academics (similar data is not
available for the VET sector). Information educators are undertaking the same
relative amount of teaching, research and administration as their national peers;
however, they appear to be engaging in more service activities, almost 17% when
classes are in session and over 21% when classes are out of session (Coates et al.
2008b). In contrast, Australia's academics generally engage in less than 5% of
service activities regardless of teaching commitments. This draws attention to
information educators' strong involvement in their industry and their broader
institutional context. When asked to identify the top three challenges faced in
undertaking teaching, research and service activities, lack of time was
overwhelmingly viewed as the major obstacle in all three areas. In teaching the
quality of students, the administrative load and the breadth of the curriculum are
other leading challenges. In research another major issue is the lack of funding. For
service activities lack of recognition or appreciation was noted as a barrier.
Teaching was the most valued activity amongst respondents, with over 94% rating it as
very important or important. Figure 4 reveals activities rating as very important

respondents made considerable efforts to disseminate their project work widely,
reporting outputs such as books, journal articles, conferences and professional
publication outlets. However, like their national peers, information educators mainly
write academic articles, with newspaper and magazine publications featuring less but
still appearing as part of their academic writing portfolio. Respondents were keen
conference presenters, averaging more than one a year. They also conducted a large
number of seminars and workshops, again over one and a half a year. The information
educators who participated in the study had a strong attachment to their profession,
with 77% rating their professional affiliation as very important. The participants
rated affiliation to the profession as more important than affiliations to their
faculty (46%), school (49%) and institution (52%). Participants also indicated that
they perceived their work as being valued most by the information profession (32%)
and valued least by the institution (13%). Engagement with industry Hallam (2007,
323) suggests that information educators can 'be totally out of touch with current
industry practice'. The findings of this study clearly reveal that Australia's
information educators actively seek to connect with the industry they support. Less
than 3% have never worked within the information profession and over 30% of
information educators are, in addition to their work as an educator, also currently
employed within the information sector. It should also be noted that over 45% have
not been actively employed within the profession for more than 5 years, and 25% had
not been so for more than 10 years (see Figure 6). The respondents' engagement with
the information profession is also borne out by the number of professional
memberships, an average of one and a half subscriptions per respondent. Almost
three-quarters of respondents were members of ALIA, by far the most strongly
supported professional body. Respondents were members of 28 associations including
the Records and Information Management Professionals Australasia (15%), the
Australian School Library Association (10%) and the Australian Computer Society (7%).
Respondents also participated in a wide range of service activities in the past 3
years. Over<component x="67.29" y="269.8" width="358.64" height="152.4" page="10"

member of a committee or other group connected to an external organization, and
almost half had served as a peer reviewer. Over 40% had delivered professional
development courses to industry, and over a quarter had undertaken paid
consultancies. The important connection that information educators have with their
profession can also be seen in the reasons why they embarked on a career as an
information educator to begin with. Many respondents chose to become educators within
the information profession because of a strong desire to teach and because of the
attractiveness of the perceived autonomy and flexibility the role offered, but they
also had a strong wish to contribute to the profession through their role as
educators. Whilst not rated highly by all, being able to engage in research was also
indicated as a reason for becoming an educator. It is not surprising, therefore, that
when asked to comment on their strongest affiliations, information educators
indicated that they valued their links to the professions more than their
institutional ties. Respondents' attachment to their profession is also suggested by
the value they perceive their profession places on their work overall (32%) as
compared to students (28%), their colleagues (26%) and their institution (12%).
Figure 7 provides a breakdown of the educators' perceptions on how their
contributions are valued by colleagues, institutions, profession and students. Job
satisfaction Figure 8 shows the breakdown of job satisfaction. Australia's
information educators appear to be rather satisfied with their educator's life, over
80% indicating they were satisfied or very satisfied with their job and less than 20%
indicating that they were not satisfied or very unsatisfied. Educators in the VET
sector are more likely to be very satisfied (60.87%) when compared to those in the
university context (27.27%). When compared to the findings from the CAP project, it
is suggested that the Australian information academic is more satisfied (77.27%) than
Australian academics generally (55%) (Coates et al. 2008b). A recent study suggests
the information VET educators are not as satisfied as their vocational teaching peers
(69%) (Simons et al. 2009). The vast majority of respondents indicated that teaching
and/or working with students was the most satisfying aspect of their job, whilst the
least satisfying aspect related to workload and having to deal with too much
administration (it was noted earlier that<component x="67.29" y="233.97"

almost a quarter of their time on administration). Further support for a high degree
of job satisfaction is evidenced by the fact that most respondents were not looking
for another job, as Figure 9 shows, though about 10% were looking for a similar
position at another institution, and another 10% were looking for a job outside of
information studies education. Discussion and conclusions This study presents key
findings on the characteristics and experiences of information educators in
Australia. It has shown that the ageing of Australia's information educators is an
issue of profound importance for the profession. With over two-thirds of information
educators approaching retirement age in the next 10- 15 years, and over half
indicating that they are intending to retire in the next 10 years, the Australian
information sector (practitioners, employers, professional associations and
academics) must start to actively manage succession planning for future information
educators. Strategies to address this should include alternative recruitment options
(e.g., appointments from overseas), developing clearer pathways from practice to
academe and making doctoral study a more attractive option for Australia's
information practitioners. Australia's information educators invest considerable time
into all three aspects of their work: teaching, research<component x="67.29"

more time on service than other disciplines within Australia's education system,
indicating that they have a strong focus towards engaging with and supporting the
industry they serve with educational programmes. Information educators indicated that
they placed strong importance on teaching over research. For the university educator,
this is a significant observation. With the federal government's growing interest in
research performance and in establishing the nation's universities as leaders within
the research arena internationally, information educators need to become more active
and proactive in building a stronger research profile. The Australian government
believes that universities and research are crucial to the nation's future. Based on
this belief, Australia's first national research assessment was conducted in 2010
(the same year this study's data collection took place) for research outputs in the
period 2003- 2008. Undertaken by the Australian Research Council (ARC), the
Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) scheme seeks to assess the quality of
research in Australia in an international context. Research quality is determined via
a number of mechanisms including citation analysis, peer review, ranking of
publications and research income. Of the 11 universities involved in information
education, only two were able to provide enough evidence of research output to be
included within the assessment scheme: Queensland University of Technology ('above
world standard') and Charles Sturt University ('below world standard').
Interestingly, the University of New South Wales (UNSW) also received a ranking
('above world standard'). Although UNSW stopped offering programmes in the
information discipline in 2006, it still continues to engage in active research
within the field. The second assessment exercise in 2012, for research outputs in the
period 2005- 2010, saw three more universities added to the mix providing a total of
six universities with Monash, University of Tasmania and RMIT also receiving
rankings. No university received a ranking higher than 'at world standard'. ERA will
have significant implications for niche or boutique disciplines such as information
(Svantesson and White 2009). The 2008 Consultation paper issued by the ARC states
that 'ERA will provide a framework that gives government, industry, business and the
wide community, assurance of the quality of research in Australia's higher education
institutions and guide future investment in that research effort' (Australian
Research Council 2008, 5). When ranking determines the level of funding a university
receives, it is inevitable that institutions will adjust their actions to obtain the
best ranking possible (Svantesson and White 2009). Using strategies such as promotion
criteria, universities will steer the activities of their academic staff in the
direction emphasised in the ranking process (Svantesson and White 2009; Yates 2010).
One of the aims of ERA is to define 'areas of strength' (Arup 2008, 32) and
universities might therefore feel the need to invest their limited resources in
supporting the discipline in which they are strongest, thus allowing them to continue
to excel and rate highly under ERA and thereby attract government research funding.
Academics working outside the scope of these disciplines may be encouraged to abandon
their discipline areas in favour of the dominant disciplines. It is also quite
possible that disciplines that are not perceived by the university to be of high
priority (e.g., not allowing the institution to be competitive within the ERA
programme) may be abandoned entirely (Svantesson and White 2009). Disciplines that
have limited research output as well as small student numbers within their coursework
programmes may be at risk of disappearing. The data available suggests that whilst
information educators are genuinely interested in research and are starting to have
some success in obtaining research funding, they still have some way to go. Genoni
(2005, 18) notes 'if LIS [library and information science] departments are to survive
- and hopefully thrive - in these circumstances they are under immediate pressure to
be as research active as possible'. The results of this study contribute to our
understanding of Australian information educators and provide new perspectives into
information education. This study will help to develop strategies to respond to the
unique needs of Australia's information educators. The current study, however,
presents a snap shot in time (data was collected in 2010), and the information sector
and its subsequent education is not static, but is evolving and growing in response
to various national and international stimuli. Consequently, longitudinal data would
provide a richer picture and help to identify trends relevant to Australia's
information educators and to information education.<component x="67.29" y="65.99"
