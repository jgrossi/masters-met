creation, the 2 other concepts being emotion and cognition. We have the inner world
(emotion); we have the outer world (information); and cognition mediates between the
two. We analyze the 3 elements in relation to communication and discuss the
semeiotics-inspired communication model, the Dynacom; then, we discuss our semeiotic
perspective on the meaning-creation process and communication with regard to a few,
but central, elements in library and information science, namely, the systemsoriented

connected with a brain. It appears in the work of bees, of crystals, and throughout
the purely physical world; and one can no more deny that it is really there, than
that the colors, the shapes, etc., of objects are really there. Consistently adhere
to that unwarrantable denial, and you will be driven to some form of idealistic
nominalism akin to Fichte's. Not only is thought in the organic world, but it
develops there. But as there cannot be a General without Instances embodying it, so
there cannot be thought without Signs. (Charles S. Peirce . CP 4.551, Prolegomena to

information and knowledge lie at the root of library and information science (LIS),
both historically and analytically. In particular, the academic community of LIS,
concerned with the organization and retrieval of information, has spent years
discussing and clarifying the concepts of information and knowledge and the possible
relationship between them (Taylor, 1968; Belkin, Oddy, &amp; Brooks, 1982; Buckland,
1991; Brier, 1996, 2004; Hj&#xF8;rland, 1997, 2004, 2007, 2009; Capurro &amp;
Hj&#xF8;rland, 2003; Cornelius, 2004). Variations emerge in the definitions because
of the background of the authors and the specific aims that they pursue; we seem to
be facing a labyrinth on theoretical, methodological, and terminological grounds.
Generally, the concept of information is approached through three general families of
concepts: a systemsoriented view, a user-oriented view, and a domain-oriented view
(see Ingwersen &amp; J&#xE4;rvelin, 2005, for an excellent review regarding the
systems-oriented and user-oriented views and Hj&#xF8;rland, 2004, regarding the
domain-oriented view). Thus, we may approach information as objective entities
handled by information systems, as objective entities that relate to work tasks, or
as objective entities related to domains. The notion of information as something
independently observable is shared among LIS scholars; but how information may be
related to the complex processes of interpretation, meaning making, and information
need (in short "knowledge"), is another matter. At the risk of contributing further
to the expansion of the labyrinth, we will present a Peircean account of the concepts
of information and knowledge, which we believe can be useful within the field of LIS.
We believe that information science, in particular the fields concerned with
organization and retrieval of information, struggle with a fragmented view of the
information processes connected to the areas of the information system itself, the
human agents interacting with the system, and the community that frames the
information behavior of individual users. We furthermore believe that the processes
of knowledge organization and information retrieval are synonymous with a complex
meaning-creation process in which emotional, informational, and cognitional signs
blend together. Or, formulated differently, information relates to an emotional level
of cognition and to deliberate, articulate knowledge structures. We will try to
demonstrate that the concepts of emotion, information, and knowledge can be
understood within the semeiotic and phenomenological framework of the American
polymath C. S. Peirce (1839-1914). Inspired by Peirce, we see three elements make up
the meaningcreation process: emotion, information, and cognition (in accordance with
Peirce, we use cognitionsynonymously knowledge with ; CP 6.605). To elaborate on this
claim, we define here what we believe to be the emotional sign, the informational
sign, and the cognitional sign seen from a Peircean perspective. We show how they
interact and how they depend on each other. We discuss how emotion enters into
information and how emotion and information enter into cognition. However, different
kinds of emotions, information, and knowledge affect us differently, so we will also
look at the concepts of emotion, information, and knowledge within the context of
communication and address the general conditions for communication and the
interpretational effect caused by any sign. The overall focus and purpose of this
article may therefore be condensed and formulated as follows. We demonstrate that,
within a phenosemeiotic framework, the concept of information is intricate, that it
is related to emotion and cognition, and that should be analyzed in terms of sign
systems within a process of communication. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
concept of information is relative to the perspective of inquiry, this being a
systems view, a user-oriented view, and a social view. We demonstrate how information
relates to emotion and knowledge and vice versa, and finally, we demonstrate how this
semeiotically based analysis is relevant for information science, especially the
relation among the the systems-oriented perspective, the user-oriented perspective,
and a domain-oriented perspective. Our present work follows the line of thought
already set by Brier (1996, 2004, 2006, 2008) and Thellefsen, Brier, and Thellefsen
(2003); however, the important contribution is the phenosemiotical understanding of
information. The article is structured in the following way: First, we outline
emotion, information, and knowledge as understood within Peirce's framework of a
scientific phenomenology, this phenomenology being a fundamental conceptual
condition. Second, we look at the Peircean semeiotic and give an account of the
concept of emotion in terms of the sign trichotomy qualisign, sinsign, and legisign.
Third, we propose a semeiotically-inspired definition of information in terms of the
sign trichotomy of icon, index, and symbol and at the same time we touch upon
Peirce's understanding of cognition as knowledge involving the sign trichotomy
consisting of rheme, dicent sign, and argument. Fourth, we place the emotional,
informational, and cognitional sign inside our model of communication (called the
Dynacom), which is a semeiotically-inspired communication model. Fifth, we look at
the communication effect caused by the signifiutterer upon an interpreter; we call
this effect the cance effect . Sixth, we put forth a few conceivable consequences of
our phenosemeiotic thoughts and concepts of emotion, information, and knowledge for
the field of LIS, by approaching the information system, the information need, and
the social context determining the information need. Hopefully, our efforts will
point toward a more unified perspective that can accommodate different aspects of
information, the cognition of the users, and the structuring power of a social
environment. Emotion, Information and Knowledge To understand the nature of the
important concepts of emotion, information, and knowledge; how they are related; and
what role they play in the meaning-creation process, we define them in accordance
with Peirce's three categories of consciousness found within his science of
phenomenology: Feeling or Primisense, Altersense, and Medisense, because A guess
Peirce believed that human consciousness exemplifies all at the riddle three
categories. As he wrote in a draft to the book (c. 1890):<component x="314.54"

lateness="0.17647058823529413" reference_score="6.94">However, before we begin
defining the emotional, informational, and cognitional sign, we must clarify that we
do not deal with Peircean metaphysics here. We define the cognitional sign or,
plainly, the knowledge sign without, for example, discussing the relation between
truth and reality, and we do not take into account Peirce's concept concerning the
fallibility of knowledge. We do not address Peirce's Journal of Speculative famous
papers on cognition from the Philosophy (1868-1869; CP 5.213-63; 5.264-317; 5.318-
57), nor do we focus on Peirce's objective idealism or his philosophy of
mind-brain-body-world interaction, in which there is mind within nature and nature
within mind (cf. CP 6.25; 1.316). Our interest is the structural relationship among
emotion, information, and knowledge. However, placing emotion as Firstness, the first
of Peirce's three categories (see definition in the following text) in a
meaning-creation process does entail some metaphysics, namely, that " . . . an
emotion of the mind is real, in the sense that it exists in the mind whether we are
distinctly conscious of it or not. But it is not external because although it does
not depend on what we think about it, it does depend upon our state of our thought
about something." (CP 7.339). Information is real too and being placed in Secondness
(see definition in the following text); information is facts. Consequently,
information is both real and external. Let us give an example: A given book is full
of information independent of what you and I may feel or think about it. It may just
sit on the bookshelf not being read by anyone; still, it is full of information.
Imagine a twig broken in two by the wind; even though no one hears the sound, the
sound is still information. Information at this level in cognition does not entail
interpretation. Now, this must imply that emotion is internal and information is
external, and it is only cognition that can bridge the internal-external gap, and
this inferential process is the meaning-creation process. Let us now look at the
emotional, informational, and cognitional sign. The Emotional Sign The emotional sign
(involving qualisign, sinsign, and legisign) is related to Primisense and Firstness:
it involves characteristics of primisense; it is an experience of the monadic quality
of an immediate feeling; it is a simple and noncompound quality; it is what it is in
itself, by itself. It has no relation to the possibility of something else; it has no
parts; it has no beginning, middle, or end. In "The list of categories: A second
essay" (c. 1894), Peirce asked his reader to imagine the following example:<component

ceases when the screech has been going on for any considerable fraction of a minute;
and at the instant it stops there is a second sensation. Between them there is a

listening to a piece of music composed by Bach. The sensation begins the moment the
music begins and stops when the music stops; what is in between is feeling (conveyed
by the qualisign); the particular and dominant kind of feeling (conveyed by the
sinsign) being one of, for example, happiness, sadness, nostalgia, etc. (conveyed by
the legisign), the whole process being subsumed by the emotional sign. This is the
first part of any process of meaning creation. However, for an emotion to come into
being requires information of some sort. Let us therefore look at the informational
sign. The Informational Sign The informational sign is related to Secondness and
altersense (consisting of icon, index, and symbol), which means that it involves
characteristics of them. Secondness or altersense is the two-sided consciousness
concerning force and resistance; it is the clash between ego and nonego; it is
experience including the experience of resistance from the object world, where we get
to know facts, and facts are information simply and solely. The fact that a door is
hard and heavy occurs to us only when we put our shoulder against the door trying to
force it open. Peirce noted in "Pragmatism, fragment 2" (c. 1910), how:<component

concerning emotions and feelings performed by Kuhlthau (see, e.g., Kuhlthau, 1991) in
relation to the informationseeking process (ISP). However, the concept of emotion
that we try to put to use in our theory of the meaning-creation process follows the
metaphysical conditions given by Peirce. Hence, this concept of emotion is understood
within the realm of evolution; therefore, it is dynamic, like the meaning-creation
process into which it enters. As Peirce writes: " . . . an emotion of the mind is
real, in the sense that it exists in the mind whether we are distinctly conscious of
it or not. But it is not external because although it does not depend on what we
think about it, it does depend upon our state of our thought about something" (CP
7.339). We believe Kuhlthau's ISP model follows an unclear common-sense discourse
both in relation to the development of ISP itself, and in particular in relation to
the interdependencies of the concepts "feelings," "thoughts," and
"actions."<component x="314.54" y="64.0" width="238.99" height="137.93" page="3"

important to note that information, when being defined as nonego and iconic,
indexical, or symbolic, represents a relation between a representamen, which is a
sign, and its dynamical object, which is reality. As such, there is no human
interpretation taking place at this level. Information just is, and it is emotion
that gives information its particular quality, its tinge, tone, or flavor, if you
will. We are constantly being bombarded with information. However, only a small
fraction of that information carries any significance to us. Peirce used a splendid
metaphor to illustrate this point. He imagines consciousness as a bottomless lake,
the surface of which (understood as selfconsciousness) is constantly bombarded with
percepts (information):<component x="57.15" y="484.63" width="239.01" height="224.66"

bottomless lake in which ideas are suspended at different depths. Indeed, these ideas
themselves constitute the very medium of consciousness itself. Percepts alone are
uncovered by the medium. We must imagine that there is a continual fall of rain upon
the lake; which images the constant inflow of percepts in experience. All ideas other
than percepts are more or less deep, and we may conceive that there is a force of
gravitation, so that the deeper ideas are, the more work will be required to bring
them to the surface. (CP 7.553)<component x="69.13" y="373.85" width="227.05"

back in his memory. The informational sign gives direction and form to the

is an experience that is not mediated by the sign itself but is an experience
parallel to the sign; an experience that precedes the sign. Collateral experience can
be found at all levels in the communication process, and it is a necessary condition
at all levels. Collateral experience is closely related to a universe of discourse,
but, where the universe of discourse determines the possible organization of objects,
and thus modes of interpretation, collateral experience is the actual knowledge
shared by the utterer and interpreter about concepts or phenomena in a communication
process. It is important to stress that a universe of discourse is understood in
broad and general terms, and as such addresses the contextual circumstances
surrounding the communication process, which in some cases could be a scientific
community, in other cases activities taking places in a more loosely defined and ad
hoc context. In principle, a universe of discourse could be defined by the
communication process itself taking place between the utterer and interpreter and
thus be unique and temporary. Let us elaborate on this using an example. We are
standing and looking into the horizon, when suddently we see a spot moving. We cannot
see what the spot is, but we can see that it is something. We are wondering what the
spot can be. The spot comes closer and we can see that it is a dog. Now we are
talking about what the dog might do, if it is happy or bad-tempered; what kind of dog
it is, etc. The dog comes closer and now we see that it is the neighbor's dog, Jake,
and we know Jake to be a nice and playful dog. There are two important elements in
this example: (a) a process of meaning creation and (b) a process of communication.
Let us take a closer look at both processes starting with the meaning-creation
process. As a spot on the horizon, the dog is information (we do not yet know that it
is a dog); it makes us attentive. Here the information already has caused emotions,
but we need more information in order to know what the spot is; however, we are
forming several hypotheses, and we know that it is something; even to recognize the
spot as a spot calls for some kind of interpretation. At this phase in the
meaning-creation process, we can make many hypotheses about the spot in the horizon;
it could be almost anything, so we cannot attach many characteristics to the spot.
Consequently, the information level of the spot is broad in terms of possible things
to which the spot can refer. Here, the emotional level is the dominant one. As the
spot moves closer, it begins to manifest itself into something we can begin to
recognize. We can now see that it is a dog, but not what kind of dog it is. In this
phase of recognition, we have given up a series of hypotheses and identified so many
characteristics that we can identify the information as a dog. Hence, hypotheses have
been tested, as several characteristics have been added. The information level is the
dominant one. With the dog coming closer, we can identify the dog as the neighbor's
dog, Jake, a nice and friendly dog. At this level, the many possible hypotheses we
had about the spot have been removed and several characteristics have been added. The
information refers to the particular dog, so the cognitional level is now the
dominant level; the information has been transformed into knowledge. The relation
between Jake and our hypotheses (our interpretations of Jake) is true. The
meaning-creation process is shown in Table 2. As Table 2 suggests, the
meaning-creation process runs through different stages. However, it is important to
stress that it is always information that causes emotion and knowledge to arise. It
is also important to stress that when the emotional level is dominant knowledge is
also involved; we know that the spot is something, but we do not know what it is; of
course, the lack of precise knowledge about the spot makes us uneasy. As we gradually
attach more characteristics to the object, the knowledge level becomes dominant, but
it still contains emotions; also, different kinds of emotions, for example, stress
and anxiety (the dog might bite me) have been replaced with relief and other positive
emotions. Consequently, the meaning-creation process is a continuous process
consisting of adding characteristics to the signs and removing hypotheses from the
signs based on prior experience with the given sign. Even though the universe of
discourse and collateral experience are dialogical conditions, a train of thoughts as
described above is a dialog between a self and the future self; therefore, we can
apply the concepts of collateral experience and universe of<component x="314.54"

The universe of discourse is what an utterer and interpreter must share for
communication to result (see Liszka, 1996). Liszka renames the universe of discourse
to a discourse of community. "In order for genuine communication to take place the
sign which is the utterer must be part of a sense common to the interpreter, and,
conversely; it requires a sensibility gained from a common community" (Liszka, 1996,
p. 92). It seems clear that the prior knowledge about the dog enables the interpreter
to recognize the dog as a dog, and it is this prior knowledge that creates the
universe of discourse, namely, that it is a spot moving, that it is a dog, and that
it is Jake. The second element in this example is the communicative element. Two
persons are taking a walk in the countryside; they decide to cross a field when they
see a spot moving on the horizon; the spot is moving toward them. Person 1 says to
person 2: "Hey, can you see something is moving in the horizon?" Person 2 replies:
"Yes, is it a dog or what is it?" Person 1 says, "I think it is a dog but I cannot
see what kind it is!" Person 2 replies, "You're right, I think it is a dog too. I
wonder if it might be aggressive?!" Pause. "Aah, it's Jake. Jake, come here boy. I've
got a treat for you. Good doggie!" The communication process runs through the same
phases as the meaning-creation process. We are discussing what the dog is; we apply
collateral experience, because we can agree that the spot is something, but not what
it is. In our discussion of the spot, we form several hypotheses of what the spot
could be; these hypotheses involve and cause emotions because we do not know what the
spot is; we are curious (Figure 3). When the spot comes closer, we can see that it is
a dog; it possesses the characteristics of a dog. At this level, we have enough
information to interpret it as a dog-not a specific dog, but a dog. To do this, we
must have collateral experience, we must both know what characteristics a dog has in
order for it to be a dog. This is shown in Figure 4. At this level, when we can see
that it is a dog, but not a specific dog, the number of hypotheses is decreasing as
the information is increasing. At this level, the amount of collateral experience is
growing. Now, the dog is so close that we can see what dog it is. Based on our prior
knowledge about the dog, we know that it does not bite; we know that it likes treats;
we know that it is playful, etc. This is shown in Figure 5.<component x="313.97"

dog is Jake, the neighbor's dog. We have special knowledge about it, which we can
obtain only by knowing this particular dog. This knowledge is primarily subjective.
This also points in the direction that the knowledge level entails some subjective
element influencing interpretion; however, this is not to be confused with private
knowledge. Knowledge is general and can be communicated; there is no such thing as
private personal knowledge that only oneself can understand. As humans, we have the
same cognitive apparatus, so our cognition follows the same pattern. It may be worth
mentioning that emotions can change during recognition. Starting with an unconscious
feeling of uneasiness when looking at the spot in the horizon, the feeling may evolve
into a state of joy when we explicitely come to think about Jake. Consequently, there
is an intrinsic relation among the three elements in cognition and they make up a
continuum. Information is able to cause emotions both at a subconscious level and at
a conscious level. Both levels require collateral experience in order to arise, but
the cognitive level calls for explicit knowledge about Jake in order to interpret the
intentions of the dog. In this example, collateral experience exsists between two
individuals who can communicate about the object (the spot) perceived and share
experience. Collateral experience in this example is thus an understanding or
agreement about the object perceived. This also creates a discourse community between
the two individuals wherein the discussion takes place. The two examples illustrate
that information may trigger perceptions that ultimately are measured in relation to
collateral experience, and that the process of cognition follows similar paths
whether we speak of individual perceptions or negotiated perceptions. In the first
example, the perceiver is in dialogue with himself in order understand the objects
percieved. The second example adds the element of dialogue betweeen two individuals.
In this example, the object is perceived by separate minds that through dialogue may
share experiences about the object. Even though the object (the dog) is known by only
one of the perceivers, this knowledge can be communicated to the other. The example
with Jake the dog demonstrates how the knowledge creation process involves subjective
as well as intersubjective knowledge. Let us now turn our attention to an example
related specifically to LIS. Let us replace Jake the dog with a number, 61.642. A
person is looking at a shelf in a library where he sees the number 61.642. Let us
imagine that the person has only vague knowledge about classification systems. The
number being information may cause some emotions in the person, for example,
curiosity. The person can identify the number as a number, he is in a library, and
may recognize the number as some sort of library code. Consequently, the person has
some collateral knowledge number in question. Then, he looks at the shelf with the
number, all the books standing there seem to have psychology as a theme. This makes
him conclude that 61.642 has something to do with psychology. This process the person
undergoes is a meaning-creating process analogous to the example with Jake the dog.
Now let us imagine a librarian looking at the same shelf with the number 61.642. He
is so familiar with the classification system that the process of recognizing and
interpretating happens almost simultaniously. Here, the librarian possesses so much
collateral knowledge about the number that he instantly recognizes and interprets it.
Consequently, as we saw with the example with Jake, the spot or the number cause
emotions to arise, but, based on collateral knowledge, the information turns into
knowledge. As a twist, we can say that, whereas we possessed subjective knowledge
about Jake (we knew he was playful, etc.), the librarian possesses professional
knowledge concerning the classification system, and it is the professional knowledge
that comes into play, not only his subjective knowledge. Let us use now return to the
Dynacom as an analytical tool. A Bach scholar searches a database for a particular
score by Johan Sebastian Bach. This score is important to him, in that he needs it to
be able to prove a scientific point. He is used to searching the particular database,
and is capable of identifying the relevant findings. He performs the search using the
search phrase "J.S. Bach &amp; suites for harpsichord." This results in, say, 100
relevant matches, of which 2 are highly relevant. Let us try to analyze this example
by using the Dynacom. The Bach scholar writes a query; this makes him the utterer. He
endows the query with an intentional interpretant. The system receives the query and
reacts to the query; this makes the system a quasi-interpreter. It is affected by the
intention of the query and therefore represents an effectual interpretant. However,
it is quasi, because the system is not able to react in ways other than the way in
which it is programmed, but still it is an interpreter insofar as it translates the
query into a given search result. The real interpreter is the Bach scholar; he uses
the user interface as a medium in his dialog. Thus, the Bach scholar is both the
utterer and the interpreter. This seems analogous to someone writing on a piece of
paper; this is also a dialog between the writer and his future self but in this case
he has more control over what he writes; his thoughts are more identifical to his
writings on the paper. The difference between the writing into the computer and the
writing on the paper is that the paper does not interpret that which is written in a
way hidden to the writer, whereas the text written into the query field is definitely
altered when processed by the computer, so the meaning becomes altered. This is also
the case when communicating to another person or a group of persons. The utterance
embedded with a certain intentionality may be completely misinterpreted by the
interpreter. The more collateral experience between the utterer and the interpreter,
the greater the chance for a correct interpretation. In the case with the Bach
scholar, it is a dialog between himself and his future self mediated by the algoritm
in the database, but, when he sends the query, he looses control of it; he does not
know how his query is being processed. However, this may occur to him when he gets
the results of the search, which causes an effectual interpretant in the utterer. For
the Bach scholar to have a succesful experience, the database must find the document
for which he searches; there has to be a query match. However, it is based only on
the collateral experience the Bach scholar possesses about the match that he is able
to determine whether or not the particular match is the right one. The more
collateral knowledge the Bach scholar possesses about a given match, the more capable
he is of determining the relevance of the match. This is shown in Figure 6. The
discussion about relevance between query and match becomes very intricate, because
the match for a given query can be judged only by the interpretation of an
utterer/interpreter (relevance confirms the utterers hypothesis). If we return to the
communication model and say that the utterer is able to cause an effect in the
interpreter, that being an emotional, informational, or cognitional effect based

effects are placed alongside each other to make some similarities and dissimilarities
clear. This is elaborated further in Table 4. If we focus on the last two columns in
Table 4, we can see that the more predicates a given sign has, the fewer objects it
refers to and therefore the more precise the significance effect is, and the more
objects a sign refers to, the fewer predicates it has. This means that, if an
interpreter recognizes a given sign communicated to him in the way in which the
communication was intended by the utterer, the fewer objects the sign will refer to,
and the more predicates it possesses. So, we have a case where precise communication
is a condition for the release of a certain significance effect, be that of
emotional, informational, or cognitional character. The Meaning-Creation Process
Three elements seem to make up the meaning-creation process: emotion, information,
and cognition. So far we have tried to outline the relationship among these elements.
They are understandable within Peirce's framework of consciousness consisting of
primisense (emotion), altersense (information), and cognition (medisense), and
semeiotics involving three-sign trichotomies. Consequently, the bringing of
subconsciousness to self-consciousness is similar to the process of meaning creation
or semeiosis, or we can say that the process of meaning creation begins with feeling
and emotion and passes through experience of the world (the imagined or the physical
world), and then enters into thought and concepts, the process being underscored by a
degree of collateral experience. We have tried to outline the element of collateral
experience as a necessary condition for the transformation of information into
knowledge. In any process of meaning creation, both at an individual and at a
superindividual level, the recognition of collateral experience is essential and
necessary to interpret information. Collateral experience is, however, not a
situation of "either or," but rather a graded phenomenon. The more collateral
experience one possesses about a sign, the more determinate the sign processes are,
and the fewer objects the sign denotes. This means that the significance effect
depends on collateral experience, whether the effect is emotional, informational, or
cognitional.<component x="57.15" y="423.63" width="239.0" height="164.8" page="10"

aforementioned statement in mind, look at a few perspectives for information science
concerning the information system, the information need, and the social context
determing the need for information. Perspectives for Information Science Information
science, in particular the fields concerned with organization and retrieval of
information, struggle with a fragmented view of the information processes connected
to the areas of the information system itself, the human agents interacting with the
system, and the community that frames information behavior of the individual users.
We believe that the phenosemeiotic perspective presented earlier demonstrates how
information relates both to an emotional level of cognition and to deliberate,
articulate knowledge structures. The strength of the phenosemeiotic perspective is
that is connects the three fundamental kinds of significance into a whole. Thus, we
argue in favor of a semeiotic view of information science that can accommodate the
different aspects/ levels of information, the cognition of users, and the structuring
power of a social environment, and as such provide us with a stronger, unified,
theoretical foundation for information science. We are fully aware that the three
kinds of significance effects as suggested here rest upon a theoretical analysis and,
as such, require further empirical investigation. Testing the nature of significance
effects in an information system interaction environment is, however, outside the
scope of this article. Nevertheless, the significance effects have by no means come
out of thin air; we know, from studies in terminology and lexicography (Cabr&#xE9;,
2003; Felber, 1984; Myking, 2001; Sager, 1990; Thellefsen, 2004) that knowledge
domain members are more familiar with the specialities of their knowledge domain, its
concepts, and terminology than nonmembers of the domain. We also know that domain
specialists are more attentive and cautious about their use of technical terms,
simply because the meanings of technical terms are sanctioned by the community of the
knowledge domain, and addressing a community of peers at, for example, a conference,
necessitates a deliberate use of shared, specialized terminology. Many information
specialists may consider this to be a commonsense fact, which may explain why
research within LIS is so far only piecemeal and has sporadically included research
conducted within the fields of terminology and lexicography. Consequently, LIS
suffers from a common-sense approach to LIS core concepts such as concept formation
and concept delimitation (logic), categorization (similarity/dissimilarity, semantic
relations), terminology (representation/signification), knowledge (cognition and
distributed cognition), community (paradigms, universe of discourse), and
communication (language/languaging and pragmatics), which, when addressed in terms of
aboutness, information need, relevance, anomalous state of knowledge (ASK [Belkin et
al., 1982]) hypothesis, information systems interaction/behavior, etc., neglect vital
knowledge about the fundamental nature and implicit functions of information,
knowledge, and social structures. We consider it likely that signs develop through
the stages of the emotional, informational, and cognitional significance effects. The
emotional (significance) effect has been studied within, for example, marketing
research, showing that framing signs, that is, placing products in suggestive
environments, causes emotional effects in relation to consumer perception of
products, successively affecting their behavior. This we consider to support the
hypothesis of the emotional and informational significance effects, but also the
cognitional significance effect, because, the greater the knowledge about the
product, its function, its purpose, its quality, etc., the greater the effect. The
semeiotic line of thought, however, is not a bird's-eye and neutral perspective. It
is, rather, as formulated in this particular context, a method for reasoning about
the information processes connected to the information system and the conduct of
human agents and the community. Consequently, the point of view from which we
consider the functions and processes of information systems interaction is essential.
The next sections touch upon the difference in approaching the processes of
information interaction from the perspective of the information systems, from the
perspective of the user, and from the perspective of the community. Understanding the
Information System Information systems are generally systems of representation, whose
purpose is to support information activity performed by users. Within the context of
LIS, information systems are defined as knowledge-organization systems (KOS), whose
purpose is to support information retrieval in bibliographic databases. Already here
we encounter a terminological problem, in that no system, in our phenosemeiotic view,
organizes knowledge, because no cognition is taking place; it can only be information
that the system organizes. Hence it must be an information organization system (IOS).
In the phenosemeiotic perspective, cognition takes place only insofaras information
is being interpreted; the system does not interpret anything, and, if it does, this
can only be considered a quasi-interpretation. KOS may be divided into different
kinds of representation systems, (a) term lists, (b) classification and
categorization systems, and (c) systems with particular focus on relationships
(Hodge, 2000), which may be elaborated even further by kind and granularity (Friedman
&amp; Thellefsen, 2011). As such, the basic functions of KOS are to facilitate
information retrival, provide information about documents, and provide shelf
arrangements (ordering function; Broughton et al., 2005). However, understanding KOS
as systems of representation nessecitates some explanatory comments on the concept
"representation." Basically, we agree with Davis et al. (1993), who define
representation within the context of information systems as knowledge representation
(KR), and succesively as a mode of thinking rather than acting. Consequently, Davis
et al. argue that knowledge representation is a surrogate, whose function is to
represent, or model, a part of reality by means of rationally structured sign systems
in terms of information. These structured sign systems imply a set of ontological
commitments, which determine how we may think about the world. This means that
basically our understanding of the model becomes our understanding of the world. As
such, the information system becomes a medium for efficient computation that
recommends particular lines of inferences. A KR is thus a system that defines the
fundamental informational structure of concepts, that sanctions a line of thought,
and that recommends particular inferences. Furthermore, KR is considered a medium of
human expression, a language that enables us to say things about the world. Although
there are some important nuances in relation to KOS, we consider KOS types of KR;
however, KOS may be highly structured and universal, such as the Colon system
(Ranganathan, 1960), or they may be based on ad hoc categorization that meets the
needs of a particular group of users (e.g., folksonomies). However, although highly
structured and formal systems are well-suited for computer processes, they tend to be
less informative for humans. Consequently, when approaching an information system
from the perspective of the system (the systems view), three types of sign systems
emerge: (a) the sign system of the system itself, that is, the grammar of the system
(syntax), the formal system of representation; (b) the sign system of meaning, the
intended meaning of the information system's system of representation; and (c) the
cognitive effect motivated by the system in a perceiving/interpreting mind. The first
type of system constitutes the structural, semantic layer of the information system.
Thus, the system is formally organized and structured based on the rules of the
system, binary coding at the lowest level and metadata structures at the highest
level. Consequently, we may argue that this first type of system constitutes the
fundamental grammar of the system. The second type of system establishes, based on
the first level, a semantic structure that implicates an intended meaning suggested
to a user of the system, such as the organization of concepts based on a variety of
semantic relations. At this level, we may argue that the information system
communicates a particular meaning and motivates, at least intentionally, a certain
user behavior. The third type of system is beyond the control of the system. The
cognitive effect, which is the result of the sign perception and interpretation,
relies on the particular user's ability actually to understand the function and
meaning of the information system. Traditionally, the research conducted from the
information systems perspective (the systems-oriented view) prioritizes the structure
and performance of the system, optimizing search algorithms, thus focusing on
relevance, recall, and precision. Fundamentally, the systems-oriented view promotes a
rationalistic epistemology and probabilistic methodology and operates at the sign
levels of syntax and semantics, which conform to altersense, the level of the
informational significance effect. We recall that the informational sign can be
iconic, indexical, or symbolic. Approaching information retrieval based exclusively
at the level of the informational significance effect has the advantage of a
controlled environment, objectivity, performance measures of such as search
algorithms, predictability, and clear results. However, signification at the
informational level is related to the objective or explicit side of information and
ignores the emotional as well as the cognitional sign levels. We may, therefore,
criticize the systems-oriented view for suboptimizing at the systems level, at the
expense of neglecting that information is always information to someone.
Hj&#xF8;rland (2010) argues that even the systems-oriented view, despite being
perceived as objective, involves relevance criteria that implicate users' (expert
users) relevance assessment, so systems performance cannot be evaluated by itself but
is evaluated in relation to how well it performs for potential users of the system.
Consequently, the systems view implies criteria for evaluation of systems performance
that cannot in themselves be objective. However, an important difference in relation
to the user-oriented view is that, even though information systems continuously are
to be evaluated and improved by user feedback, the search algorithm performs without
reasoning about what, how, or why particular documents are matched. Simply put, the
threshold for assessing relevance is in principle generalized and as objective as any
artefact. The systems-oriented view is ultimately limited to the informational
significance effect, the outer world, establishing the grammar and syntax of KOS.
User interaction with an information system takes the form of a quasi-dialogue; in
principle, the user is communicating with himself, by selecting between relevant and
nonrelevant documents (cf. the Bach scholar example). We may argue from this
perspective that the users ASK can be clarified by interacting with an information
system. This, however, calls for some speculations about how information systems may
support users in this process of clarification. Understanding the Information Need
The concept of information need is more intricate, simply because the phenomenon
resides within the cognititive space of the user. Within LIS, in particular, the
concept of ASK has been promoted in order to address the user's state of uncertainty
and, thus, motivation for seeking information. Seen from the perspective of the user,
the first and second types of sign systems are identical. However, decoding the
intended meaning of the information system also depends on the third type of sign
system, namely, the particular users' expertise with information systems interaction
and knowledge level (collateral experience). Significance effects, whether emotional,
informational, or cognitional, thus become an integral part of information systems
interaction. However, whereas the former perspective tends to prioritize the system's
information architecture and formal representation of language, in principle ignoring
the user, the latter tends to focus on the user's perception and sense making.
Consequently, the successful systems interaction is considered a trade off between
how well-focused an information system's design is, and if information architecture
actually addresses the needs and demands of users, and how well knowledge possessed
by users actually is stimulated by system interaction. In other words, how well the
system in fact reflects the emotional and cognitional structures of the user.
However, the emotional and cognitional significance effects are brain waves, so user
needs, knowledge structures, and ASK are understood in terms of information. Even
though the user-oriented view explicitly addresses the concept of knowledge, and even
the emotional state of the user (ASK in principle should be considered an emotional
state), knowledge is conflated into the realm of information. The consequence is that
ASK and information need are conceived as a state of mind that develops from a
mental, inarticulate stage to an explicit stage that, with the right tools, can be
expressed in the terms of the information system (Taylor, 1968). Whereas the systems
view gives priority to systems optimization, the user perspective gives priority to
user information-seeking behavior, user tasks, and user interaction. The user is the
priority; therefore, user information behavior is observed and evaluated. Whereas the
information-seeking process in the systems view is considered in terms of objective
relevance criteria as recall and precision, the information-seeking process in the
user perspective is evaluated in terms of user satisfaction. However, as one might
imagine, user satisfaction is inherently problematic, because the quality or
correctness of the retrieved documents is not evaluated. Bad or wrong documents may
also cause user satisfaction. Furthermore, users are different; some users are
experts within the search domain, and others are novices, which means that knowledge
about the work task and context of the information need is relative to different
users. As pointed out by Hj&#xF8;rland (2010, p. 228), there is a paradox in that,
"on the one hand, a user's relevance is considered purely individual, while on the
other hand the researchers try to uncover general tendencies." The question is then
whether individual users, at some cognitive level, exhibit a general
information-retrieval behavior, which remains to be uncovered. However, the paradox
pointed out is similar to the problem of induction, how to discover generality from
instances, a point made by Popper in his critique of logical positivism. Theories may
be falsified, never verified, because of the problem of induction (Popper, 1968). In
relation to our theoretical framework of the significance effect, the emotional
significance effect is subcognitive. However, as suggested, the emotional effect
motivated by a given work task situation depends on experience, intuition, or what
may be described as some kind of subcognitive recognition. The cognitional
significance effect relates to the knowledge that the user possesses about the work
task situation, and the user reflects his knowledge or expertise in the process of
systems interaction. The system itself provides the informational level of
significance, but how can we address the nature of knowledge possessed by the
individual user without giving in to total subjective relativism? There seems to be
only one answer to this question, that is, the social context determining the
information need that frames the work task situation, the context of systems
interaction, and the character of the problem that motivates the information-seeking
process. This is, in short, the universe of discourse. Understanding the Universe of
Discourse The universe of discourse is defined as the socially framed or situated
context in which the information-seeking activity takes place. The user's problem
space or work task situation is anchored in a certain context that provides meaning,
scope, and purpose to the information-seeking behavior. Deliberate information
seeking is never random but purposeful and goal directed. Understanding the context
of deliberate reasoning that gives rise to the formulation of a particular
information need is thus imperative. The communication model (see Figure 7)
consequently implies different layers of communication activity, that of
communication itself (signs are communicated to a perceiver, an interpreter), a
second level that implicates a relative<component x="313.97" y="543.37"

communicated information is perceived as meaningful and relates to knowledge already
possessed by the perceiver), and a third level of agreement, or, as Peirce (1977)
would state it, "minds fused together" (pp. 196-197), an idea of conceptual
alignment; the utterer and perceiver are in agreement about what is communicated, in
sense of meaning, but not necessarily in agreement about the substance or
concequences or even fundamental premises of the argument. This is represented in
Figure 7. Let us return to the library example used earlier, with the user not being
familiar with the library system. The library system represented by the number on the
bookshelf communicates the number to the user. The classification system becomes an
utterer, and it contains an indirect intention, namely, to communicate that "if you
are looking for a book concerning psychological topics you must look under 61.642."
The system is indeed able to create an intentional interpretant, but only insofar as
it is related to the system. We can call it a quasi-intentional interpretant. The
sign communicated is 61.642. The interpreter is the person not familiar with the
library system. He is wondering about the meaning of the number on the shelf. He can
recognize the number as a number and he makes the hypothesis that it is some sort of
code. Given the fact that all the books on the shelf have the same number, he makes
the hypothesis that the 61.642 is a code for books concerning psychological topics.
The success of his line of reasoning depends on his amount of collateral experience
and his ability to create hypotheses based on his collateral experience, and that the
universe of discourse is well defined. In this case, we can say that the systems
view, the users view, and the universe of discourse are melded together in a
meaning-creating process. Consequently, we maintain that any information-seeking
theory must have all three perspectives in mind when creating information systems.
Ingwersen (1996), and Ingwersen and J&#xE4;rvelin (2005) argue that any act of
communication involves a generator, a message, and a recipient. Accordingly, when the
generator communicates a message to a recipient, the message carrying the
intentionality, meaning, implicit context, and potential informativeness of the
generator becomes stripped from intentionality, meaning, implicit context, and
potential informativeness and falls into a linguistic surface level (Figure 8).
However, we argue that, even at the fundamental level of communication (Figure 7),
where signs are uttered from a generator (utterer) to a recipient (interpreter), the
recipient must interpret (or at least recognize) the communicated signs as signs of
communication, even though he has not yet understood the intended meaning of the
communication, which takes place successively at the next, more developed level of
cognition. The communication model illustrated in Figure 6 conforms to the
traditional transmission model of communication, originally formulated by Shannon and
Weaver (1949). This model also considers the process of communication as a
transference of a message from a generator to a recipient, in terms of signals or
codes through a channel; and, at the receivers end, the process of reconstructing the
signals received starts in principle from a morphosyntactic-semantic level and is
completed when the original message transmitted by the generator is reconstructed by
the recipient. However, the transference model (which includes the idea of cognitive
free fall) neglects some important aspects of the communication process.
Communication always takes place in a context (a universe of discourse). Furthermore,
any communicator and interpreter (generator and receiver, if human) exhibits
collateral experience, and therefore provides the communication process with
intentionality (denotation and connotation at emotional, informational, and cognitive
levels). In terms of interpretation, an interpreter at the lowest level of
significance establishes an immediate interpretation of the communication process,
thus perceiving the communicated signs as signs of meaning, not just signs of
semantic structure, which at a subcognitive (emotional recognition) level involves
collateral experience and knowledge about the universe of dis<component x="314.54"

Ingwersen's concept of cognitive free fall is that it assumes that communication
fundamentally builds upon decontextualized morphosyntactic semantic codes and
structures (as formulated by Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949) that must be reconstructed
and contextualized from a syntactical surface level by a perceiving mind before any
meaning is established (Figure 9). We believe that the process of communication
should be understood the other way around. Meaning emanates before syntax.
Consequently, any process of communication involving human minds is perceived from a
pragmatic level. Any acts of communication, even signs generated by computer screens,
are perceived as signs of meaning before signs of syntax, and the cognitive process
of meaning making thus precedes syntactical speculations. Of course, the process
considered from the machine is stripped from meaning, intentionality, etc. The
computer is no more than a sign generator; consequently, the idea of a cognitive free
fall does not even apply to a strictly decontextualized data transmission context,
such as computer systems transmitting data, because no cognition is taking place. It
certainly does not apply to human agents, not even if the cognitive processes within
the human brain are considered similar to "computing." This false assumption connects
the cognitive view to cognitive science. The semeiotic approach to communication is
skeptical of the notion of cognitive free fall, simply because the idea of
communication stripped from intentionality, meaning, and context seems to be absurd.
We consider the socially determined context a prerequisite condition if communication
has to take place. Consequently, we also consider communication an activity that
occurs only between minds, and the success of the communicative process is determined
by the collateral experience shared by the communicators and the universe of
discourse that delimits and determines the precise meaning of concepts. Conclusions
We have introduced our phenosemeiotically-inspired concepts of emotion, information,
and knowledge and have tried to argue for their role and function in the
meaningcreation process as well as in communication. Furthermore, we have discussed
how our phenosemeiotic perspective relates to and influences our understanding of the
systems view, the cognitive view, and a view based in a universe of discourse. We
have, through our analysis of significance effects, related to the process of
information retrieval, argued in favor of a phenosemeiotic view that takes into
account the fundamental layer of signification, the grammar of the system that
provides for the structuring and representation of information (the KOS).
Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the phenosemiotical view takes into account
that signs are signs of meaning and that users interpret signs and use signs in their
information-seeking activity, simply because the signs carry meaning to the user.
However, the meaning of signs and the ability of users to interpret signs are related
to the individual's level of collateral experience, which concerns both the user's
experience with a particular KOS, and the user's knowledge about what is sought.
Finally, the phenosemeiotic view implies that, in addition to signs being signs
(grammar) and signs being signs of meaning (semantics), signs are also interpreted
from a perspective more general than the individual user's collateral experience
(pragmatics). We argue that the universe of discourse expresses the overall frame for
how signs are signs of meaning and frames the discourse of meaning. Consequently, we
have to consider all three perspectives: the systems perspective, the user
perspective, and the perspective of the universe of discourse in order to account for
the intricate meaning-creation process that takes place when seeking information. We
believe that our phenosemiotic view establishes a comprehensive, theoretical
foundation for addressing the processes of information, communication, and knowledge,
which we consider philosophically sound and practically relevant for the field of
LIS.<component x="313.97" y="315.01" width="239.0" height="428.22" page="14"

information and knowledge lie at the root of library and information science (LIS),
both historically and analytically. In particular, the academic community of LIS,
concerned with the organization and retrieval of information, has spent years
discussing and clarifying the concepts of information and knowledge and the possible
relationship between them (Taylor, 1968; Belkin, Oddy, &amp; Brooks, 1982; Buckland,
1991; Brier, 1996, 2004; Hj&#xF8;rland, 1997, 2004, 2007, 2009; Capurro &amp;
Hj&#xF8;rland, 2003; Cornelius, 2004). Variations emerge in the definitions because
of the background of the authors and the specific aims that they pursue; we seem to
be facing a labyrinth on theoretical, methodological, and terminological grounds.
Generally, the concept of information is approached through three general families of
concepts: a systemsoriented view, a user-oriented view, and a domain-oriented view
(see Ingwersen &amp; J&#xE4;rvelin, 2005, for an excellent review regarding the
systems-oriented and user-oriented views and Hj&#xF8;rland, 2004, regarding the
domain-oriented view). Thus, we may approach information as objective entities
handled by information systems, as objective entities that relate to work tasks, or
as objective entities related to domains. The notion of information as something
independently observable is shared among LIS scholars; but how information may be
related to the complex processes of interpretation, meaning making, and information
need (in short "knowledge"), is another matter. At the risk of contributing further
to the expansion of the labyrinth, we will present a Peircean account of the concepts
of information and knowledge, which we believe can be useful within the field of LIS.
We believe that information science, in particular the fields concerned with
organization and retrieval of information, struggle with a fragmented view of the
information processes connected to the areas of the information system itself, the
human agents interacting with the system, and the community that frames the
information behavior of individual users. We furthermore believe that the processes
of knowledge organization and information retrieval are synonymous with a complex
meaning-creation process in which emotional, informational, and cognitional signs
blend together. Or, formulated differently, information relates to an emotional level
of cognition and to deliberate, articulate knowledge structures. We will try to
demonstrate that the concepts of emotion, information, and knowledge can be
understood within the semeiotic and phenomenological framework of the American
polymath C. S. Peirce (1839-1914). Inspired by Peirce, we see three elements make up
the meaningcreation process: emotion, information, and cognition (in accordance with
Peirce, we use cognitionsynonymously knowledge with ; CP 6.605). To elaborate on this
claim, we define here what we believe to be the emotional sign, the informational
sign, and the cognitional sign seen from a Peircean perspective. We show how they
interact and how they depend on each other. We discuss how emotion enters into
information and how emotion and information enter into cognition. However, different
kinds of emotions, information, and knowledge affect us differently, so we will also
look at the concepts of emotion, information, and knowledge within the context of
communication and address the general conditions for communication and the
interpretational effect caused by any sign. The overall focus and purpose of this
article may therefore be condensed and formulated as follows. We demonstrate that,
within a phenosemeiotic framework, the concept of information is intricate, that it
is related to emotion and cognition, and that should be analyzed in terms of sign
systems within a process of communication. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
concept of information is relative to the perspective of inquiry, this being a
systems view, a user-oriented view, and a social view. We demonstrate how information
relates to emotion and knowledge and vice versa, and finally, we demonstrate how this
semeiotically based analysis is relevant for information science, especially the
relation among the the systems-oriented perspective, the user-oriented perspective,
and a domain-oriented perspective. Our present work follows the line of thought
already set by Brier (1996, 2004, 2006, 2008) and Thellefsen, Brier, and Thellefsen
(2003); however, the important contribution is the phenosemiotical understanding of
information. The article is structured in the following way: First, we outline
emotion, information, and knowledge as understood within Peirce's framework of a
scientific phenomenology, this phenomenology being a fundamental conceptual
condition. Second, we look at the Peircean semeiotic and give an account of the
concept of emotion in terms of the sign trichotomy qualisign, sinsign, and legisign.
Third, we propose a semeiotically-inspired definition of information in terms of the
sign trichotomy of icon, index, and symbol and at the same time we touch upon
Peirce's understanding of cognition as knowledge involving the sign trichotomy
consisting of rheme, dicent sign, and argument. Fourth, we place the emotional,
informational, and cognitional sign inside our model of communication (called the
Dynacom), which is a semeiotically-inspired communication model. Fifth, we look at
the communication effect caused by the signifiutterer upon an interpreter; we call
this effect the cance effect . Sixth, we put forth a few conceivable consequences of
our phenosemeiotic thoughts and concepts of emotion, information, and knowledge for
the field of LIS, by approaching the information system, the information need, and
the social context determining the information need. Hopefully, our efforts will
point toward a more unified perspective that can accommodate different aspects of
information, the cognition of the users, and the structuring power of a social
environment. Emotion, Information and Knowledge To understand the nature of the
important concepts of emotion, information, and knowledge; how they are related; and
what role they play in the meaning-creation process, we define them in accordance
with Peirce's three categories of consciousness found within his science of
phenomenology: Feeling or Primisense, Altersense, and Medisense, because A guess
Peirce believed that human consciousness exemplifies all at the riddle three
categories. As he wrote in a draft to the book (c. 1890):<component x="314.54"

lateness="0.17647058823529413" reference_score="6.94">However, before we begin
defining the emotional, informational, and cognitional sign, we must clarify that we
do not deal with Peircean metaphysics here. We define the cognitional sign or,
plainly, the knowledge sign without, for example, discussing the relation between
truth and reality, and we do not take into account Peirce's concept concerning the
fallibility of knowledge. We do not address Peirce's Journal of Speculative famous
papers on cognition from the Philosophy (1868-1869; CP 5.213-63; 5.264-317; 5.318-
57), nor do we focus on Peirce's objective idealism or his philosophy of
mind-brain-body-world interaction, in which there is mind within nature and nature
within mind (cf. CP 6.25; 1.316). Our interest is the structural relationship among
emotion, information, and knowledge. However, placing emotion as Firstness, the first
of Peirce's three categories (see definition in the following text) in a
meaning-creation process does entail some metaphysics, namely, that " . . . an
emotion of the mind is real, in the sense that it exists in the mind whether we are
distinctly conscious of it or not. But it is not external because although it does
not depend on what we think about it, it does depend upon our state of our thought
about something." (CP 7.339). Information is real too and being placed in Secondness
(see definition in the following text); information is facts. Consequently,
information is both real and external. Let us give an example: A given book is full
of information independent of what you and I may feel or think about it. It may just
sit on the bookshelf not being read by anyone; still, it is full of information.
Imagine a twig broken in two by the wind; even though no one hears the sound, the
sound is still information. Information at this level in cognition does not entail
interpretation. Now, this must imply that emotion is internal and information is
external, and it is only cognition that can bridge the internal-external gap, and
this inferential process is the meaning-creation process. Let us now look at the
emotional, informational, and cognitional sign. The Emotional Sign The emotional sign
(involving qualisign, sinsign, and legisign) is related to Primisense and Firstness:
it involves characteristics of primisense; it is an experience of the monadic quality
of an immediate feeling; it is a simple and noncompound quality; it is what it is in
itself, by itself. It has no relation to the possibility of something else; it has no
parts; it has no beginning, middle, or end. In "The list of categories: A second
essay" (c. 1894), Peirce asked his reader to imagine the following example:<component

ceases when the screech has been going on for any considerable fraction of a minute;

listening to a piece of music composed by Bach. The sensation begins the moment the
music begins and stops when the music stops; what is in between is feeling (conveyed
by the qualisign); the particular and dominant kind of feeling (conveyed by the
sinsign) being one of, for example, happiness, sadness, nostalgia, etc. (conveyed by
the legisign), the whole process being subsumed by the emotional sign. This is the
first part of any process of meaning creation. However, for an emotion to come into
being requires information of some sort. Let us therefore look at the informational
sign. The Informational Sign The informational sign is related to Secondness and
altersense (consisting of icon, index, and symbol), which means that it involves
characteristics of them. Secondness or altersense is the two-sided consciousness
concerning force and resistance; it is the clash between ego and nonego; it is
experience including the experience of resistance from the object world, where we get
to know facts, and facts are information simply and solely. The fact that a door is
hard and heavy occurs to us only when we put our shoulder against the door trying to
force it open. Peirce noted in "Pragmatism, fragment 2" (c. 1910), how:<component

concerning emotions and feelings performed by Kuhlthau (see, e.g., Kuhlthau, 1991) in
relation to the informationseeking process (ISP). However, the concept of emotion
that we try to put to use in our theory of the meaning-creation process follows the
metaphysical conditions given by Peirce. Hence, this concept of emotion is understood
within the realm of evolution; therefore, it is dynamic, like the meaning-creation
process into which it enters. As Peirce writes: " . . . an emotion of the mind is
real, in the sense that it exists in the mind whether we are distinctly conscious of
it or not. But it is not external because although it does not depend on what we
think about it, it does depend upon our state of our thought about something" (CP
7.339). We believe Kuhlthau's ISP model follows an unclear common-sense discourse
both in relation to the development of ISP itself, and in particular in relation to
the interdependencies of the concepts "feelings," "thoughts," and
"actions."<component x="314.54" y="64.0" width="238.99" height="137.93" page="3"

important to note that information, when being defined as nonego and iconic,
indexical, or symbolic, represents a relation between a representamen, which is a
sign, and its dynamical object, which is reality. As such, there is no human
interpretation taking place at this level. Information just is, and it is emotion
that gives information its particular quality, its tinge, tone, or flavor, if you
will. We are constantly being bombarded with information. However, only a small
fraction of that information carries any significance to us. Peirce used a splendid
metaphor to illustrate this point. He imagines consciousness as a bottomless lake,
the surface of which (understood as selfconsciousness) is constantly bombarded with
percepts (information):<component x="57.15" y="484.63" width="239.01" height="224.66"

is an experience that is not mediated by the sign itself but is an experience
parallel to the sign; an experience that precedes the sign. Collateral experience can
be found at all levels in the communication process, and it is a necessary condition
at all levels. Collateral experience is closely related to a universe of discourse,
but, where the universe of discourse determines the possible organization of objects,
and thus modes of interpretation, collateral experience is the actual knowledge
shared by the utterer and interpreter about concepts or phenomena in a communication
process. It is important to stress that a universe of discourse is understood in
broad and general terms, and as such addresses the contextual circumstances
surrounding the communication process, which in some cases could be a scientific
community, in other cases activities taking places in a more loosely defined and ad
hoc context. In principle, a universe of discourse could be defined by the
communication process itself taking place between the utterer and interpreter and
thus be unique and temporary. Let us elaborate on this using an example. We are
standing and looking into the horizon, when suddently we see a spot moving. We cannot
see what the spot is, but we can see that it is something. We are wondering what the
spot can be. The spot comes closer and we can see that it is a dog. Now we are
talking about what the dog might do, if it is happy or bad-tempered; what kind of dog
it is, etc. The dog comes closer and now we see that it is the neighbor's dog, Jake,
and we know Jake to be a nice and playful dog. There are two important elements in
this example: (a) a process of meaning creation and (b) a process of communication.
Let us take a closer look at both processes starting with the meaning-creation
process. As a spot on the horizon, the dog is information (we do not yet know that it
is a dog); it makes us attentive. Here the information already has caused emotions,
but we need more information in order to know what the spot is; however, we are
forming several hypotheses, and we know that it is something; even to recognize the
spot as a spot calls for some kind of interpretation. At this phase in the
meaning-creation process, we can make many hypotheses about the spot in the horizon;
it could be almost anything, so we cannot attach many characteristics to the spot.
Consequently, the information level of the spot is broad in terms of possible things
to which the spot can refer. Here, the emotional level is the dominant one. As the
spot moves closer, it begins to manifest itself into something we can begin to
recognize. We can now see that it is a dog, but not what kind of dog it is. In this
phase of recognition, we have given up a series of hypotheses and identified so many
characteristics that we can identify the information as a dog. Hence, hypotheses have
been tested, as several characteristics have been added. The information level is the
dominant one. With the dog coming closer, we can identify the dog as the neighbor's
dog, Jake, a nice and friendly dog. At this level, the many possible hypotheses we
had about the spot have been removed and several characteristics have been added. The
information refers to the particular dog, so the cognitional level is now the
dominant level; the information has been transformed into knowledge. The relation
between Jake and our hypotheses (our interpretations of Jake) is true. The
meaning-creation process is shown in Table 2. As Table 2 suggests, the
meaning-creation process runs through different stages. However, it is important to
stress that it is always information that causes emotion and knowledge to arise. It
is also important to stress that when the emotional level is dominant knowledge is
also involved; we know that the spot is something, but we do not know what it is; of
course, the lack of precise knowledge about the spot makes us uneasy. As we gradually
attach more characteristics to the object, the knowledge level becomes dominant, but
it still contains emotions; also, different kinds of emotions, for example, stress
and anxiety (the dog might bite me) have been replaced with relief and other positive
emotions. Consequently, the meaning-creation process is a continuous process
consisting of adding characteristics to the signs and removing hypotheses from the
signs based on prior experience with the given sign. Even though the universe of
discourse and collateral experience are dialogical conditions, a train of thoughts as
described above is a dialog between a self and the future self; therefore, we can
apply the concepts of collateral experience and universe of<component x="314.54"

The universe of discourse is what an utterer and interpreter must share for
communication to result (see Liszka, 1996). Liszka renames the universe of discourse
to a discourse of community. "In order for genuine communication to take place the
sign which is the utterer must be part of a sense common to the interpreter, and,
conversely; it requires a sensibility gained from a common community" (Liszka, 1996,
p. 92). It seems clear that the prior knowledge about the dog enables the interpreter
to recognize the dog as a dog, and it is this prior knowledge that creates the
universe of discourse, namely, that it is a spot moving, that it is a dog, and that
it is Jake. The second element in this example is the communicative element. Two
persons are taking a walk in the countryside; they decide to cross a field when they
see a spot moving on the horizon; the spot is moving toward them. Person 1 says to
person 2: "Hey, can you see something is moving in the horizon?" Person 2 replies:
"Yes, is it a dog or what is it?" Person 1 says, "I think it is a dog but I cannot
see what kind it is!" Person 2 replies, "You're right, I think it is a dog too. I
wonder if it might be aggressive?!" Pause. "Aah, it's Jake. Jake, come here boy. I've
got a treat for you. Good doggie!" The communication process runs through the same
phases as the meaning-creation process. We are discussing what the dog is; we apply
collateral experience, because we can agree that the spot is something, but not what
it is. In our discussion of the spot, we form several hypotheses of what the spot
could be; these hypotheses involve and cause emotions because we do not know what the
spot is; we are curious (Figure 3). When the spot comes closer, we can see that it is
a dog; it possesses the characteristics of a dog. At this level, we have enough
information to interpret it as a dog-not a specific dog, but a dog. To do this, we
must have collateral experience, we must both know what characteristics a dog has in
order for it to be a dog. This is shown in Figure 4. At this level, when we can see
that it is a dog, but not a specific dog, the number of hypotheses is decreasing as
the information is increasing. At this level, the amount of collateral experience is
growing. Now, the dog is so close that we can see what dog it is. Based on our prior
knowledge about the dog, we know that it does not bite; we know that it likes treats;
we know that it is playful, etc. This is shown in Figure 5.<component x="313.97"

dog is Jake, the neighbor's dog. We have special knowledge about it, which we can
obtain only by knowing this particular dog. This knowledge is primarily subjective.
This also points in the direction that the knowledge level entails some subjective
element influencing interpretion; however, this is not to be confused with private
knowledge. Knowledge is general and can be communicated; there is no such thing as
private personal knowledge that only oneself can understand. As humans, we have the
same cognitive apparatus, so our cognition follows the same pattern. It may be worth
mentioning that emotions can change during recognition. Starting with an unconscious
feeling of uneasiness when looking at the spot in the horizon, the feeling may evolve
into a state of joy when we explicitely come to think about Jake. Consequently, there
is an intrinsic relation among the three elements in cognition and they make up a
continuum. Information is able to cause emotions both at a subconscious level and at
a conscious level. Both levels require collateral experience in order to arise, but
the cognitive level calls for explicit knowledge about Jake in order to interpret the
intentions of the dog. In this example, collateral experience exsists between two
individuals who can communicate about the object (the spot) perceived and share
experience. Collateral experience in this example is thus an understanding or
agreement about the object perceived. This also creates a discourse community between
the two individuals wherein the discussion takes place. The two examples illustrate
that information may trigger perceptions that ultimately are measured in relation to
collateral experience, and that the process of cognition follows similar paths
whether we speak of individual perceptions or negotiated perceptions. In the first
example, the perceiver is in dialogue with himself in order understand the objects
percieved. The second example adds the element of dialogue betweeen two individuals.
In this example, the object is perceived by separate minds that through dialogue may
share experiences about the object. Even though the object (the dog) is known by only
one of the perceivers, this knowledge can be communicated to the other. The example
with Jake the dog demonstrates how the knowledge creation process involves subjective
as well as intersubjective knowledge. Let us now turn our attention to an example
related specifically to LIS. Let us replace Jake the dog with a number, 61.642. A
person is looking at a shelf in a library where he sees the number 61.642. Let us
imagine that the person has only vague knowledge about classification systems. The
number being information may cause some emotions in the person, for example,
curiosity. The person can identify the number as a number, he is in a library, and
may recognize the number as some sort of library code. Consequently, the person has
some collateral knowledge number in question. Then, he looks at the shelf with the
number, all the books standing there seem to have psychology as a theme. This makes
him conclude that 61.642 has something to do with psychology. This process the person
undergoes is a meaning-creating process analogous to the example with Jake the dog.
Now let us imagine a librarian looking at the same shelf with the number 61.642. He
is so familiar with the classification system that the process of recognizing and
interpretating happens almost simultaniously. Here, the librarian possesses so much
collateral knowledge about the number that he instantly recognizes and interprets it.
Consequently, as we saw with the example with Jake, the spot or the number cause
emotions to arise, but, based on collateral knowledge, the information turns into
knowledge. As a twist, we can say that, whereas we possessed subjective knowledge
about Jake (we knew he was playful, etc.), the librarian possesses professional
knowledge concerning the classification system, and it is the professional knowledge
that comes into play, not only his subjective knowledge. Let us use now return to the
Dynacom as an analytical tool. A Bach scholar searches a database for a particular
score by Johan Sebastian Bach. This score is important to him, in that he needs it to
be able to prove a scientific point. He is used to searching the particular database,
and is capable of identifying the relevant findings. He performs the search using the
search phrase "J.S. Bach &amp; suites for harpsichord." This results in, say, 100
relevant matches, of which 2 are highly relevant. Let us try to analyze this example
by using the Dynacom. The Bach scholar writes a query; this makes him the utterer. He
endows the query with an intentional interpretant. The system receives the query and
reacts to the query; this makes the system a quasi-interpreter. It is affected by the
intention of the query and therefore represents an effectual interpretant. However,
it is quasi, because the system is not able to react in ways other than the way in
which it is programmed, but still it is an interpreter insofar as it translates the
query into a given search result. The real interpreter is the Bach scholar; he uses
the user interface as a medium in his dialog. Thus, the Bach scholar is both the
utterer and the interpreter. This seems analogous to someone writing on a piece of
paper; this is also a dialog between the writer and his future self but in this case
he has more control over what he writes; his thoughts are more identifical to his
writings on the paper. The difference between the writing into the computer and the
writing on the paper is that the paper does not interpret that which is written in a
way hidden to the writer, whereas the text written into the query field is definitely
altered when processed by the computer, so the meaning becomes altered. This is also
the case when communicating to another person or a group of persons. The utterance
embedded with a certain intentionality may be completely misinterpreted by the
interpreter. The more collateral experience between the utterer and the interpreter,
the greater the chance for a correct interpretation. In the case with the Bach
scholar, it is a dialog between himself and his future self mediated by the algoritm
in the database, but, when he sends the query, he looses control of it; he does not
know how his query is being processed. However, this may occur to him when he gets
the results of the search, which causes an effectual interpretant in the utterer. For
the Bach scholar to have a succesful experience, the database must find the document
for which he searches; there has to be a query match. However, it is based only on
the collateral experience the Bach scholar possesses about the match that he is able
to determine whether or not the particular match is the right one. The more
collateral knowledge the Bach scholar possesses about a given match, the more capable
he is of determining the relevance of the match. This is shown in Figure 6. The
discussion about relevance between query and match becomes very intricate, because
the match for a given query can be judged only by the interpretation of an
utterer/interpreter (relevance confirms the utterers hypothesis). If we return to the
communication model and say that the utterer is able to cause an effect in the
interpreter, that being an emotional, informational, or cognitional effect based

effects are placed alongside each other to make some similarities and dissimilarities
clear. This is elaborated further in Table 4. If we focus on the last two columns in
Table 4, we can see that the more predicates a given sign has, the fewer objects it
refers to and therefore the more precise the significance effect is, and the more
objects a sign refers to, the fewer predicates it has. This means that, if an
interpreter recognizes a given sign communicated to him in the way in which the
communication was intended by the utterer, the fewer objects the sign will refer to,
and the more predicates it possesses. So, we have a case where precise communication
is a condition for the release of a certain significance effect, be that of
emotional, informational, or cognitional character. The Meaning-Creation Process
Three elements seem to make up the meaning-creation process: emotion, information,
and cognition. So far we have tried to outline the relationship among these elements.
They are understandable within Peirce's framework of consciousness consisting of
primisense (emotion), altersense (information), and cognition (medisense), and
semeiotics involving three-sign trichotomies. Consequently, the bringing of
subconsciousness to self-consciousness is similar to the process of meaning creation
or semeiosis, or we can say that the process of meaning creation begins with feeling
and emotion and passes through experience of the world (the imagined or the physical
world), and then enters into thought and concepts, the process being underscored by a
degree of collateral experience. We have tried to outline the element of collateral
experience as a necessary condition for the transformation of information into
knowledge. In any process of meaning creation, both at an individual and at a
superindividual level, the recognition of collateral experience is essential and
necessary to interpret information. Collateral experience is, however, not a
situation of "either or," but rather a graded phenomenon. The more collateral
experience one possesses about a sign, the more determinate the sign processes are,
and the fewer objects the sign denotes. This means that the significance effect
depends on collateral experience, whether the effect is emotional, informational, or
cognitional.<component x="57.15" y="423.63" width="239.0" height="164.8" page="10"

aforementioned statement in mind, look at a few perspectives for information science
concerning the information system, the information need, and the social context
determing the need for information. Perspectives for Information Science Information
science, in particular the fields concerned with organization and retrieval of
information, struggle with a fragmented view of the information processes connected
to the areas of the information system itself, the human agents interacting with the
system, and the community that frames information behavior of the individual users.
We believe that the phenosemeiotic perspective presented earlier demonstrates how
information relates both to an emotional level of cognition and to deliberate,
articulate knowledge structures. The strength of the phenosemeiotic perspective is
that is connects the three fundamental kinds of significance into a whole. Thus, we
argue in favor of a semeiotic view of information science that can accommodate the
different aspects/ levels of information, the cognition of users, and the structuring
power of a social environment, and as such provide us with a stronger, unified,
theoretical foundation for information science. We are fully aware that the three
kinds of significance effects as suggested here rest upon a theoretical analysis and,
as such, require further empirical investigation. Testing the nature of significance
effects in an information system interaction environment is, however, outside the
scope of this article. Nevertheless, the significance effects have by no means come
out of thin air; we know, from studies in terminology and lexicography (Cabr&#xE9;,
2003; Felber, 1984; Myking, 2001; Sager, 1990; Thellefsen, 2004) that knowledge
domain members are more familiar with the specialities of their knowledge domain, its
concepts, and terminology than nonmembers of the domain. We also know that domain
specialists are more attentive and cautious about their use of technical terms,
simply because the meanings of technical terms are sanctioned by the community of the
knowledge domain, and addressing a community of peers at, for example, a conference,
necessitates a deliberate use of shared, specialized terminology. Many information
specialists may consider this to be a commonsense fact, which may explain why
research within LIS is so far only piecemeal and has sporadically included research
conducted within the fields of terminology and lexicography. Consequently, LIS
suffers from a common-sense approach to LIS core concepts such as concept formation
and concept delimitation (logic), categorization (similarity/dissimilarity, semantic
relations), terminology (representation/signification), knowledge (cognition and
distributed cognition), community (paradigms, universe of discourse), and
communication (language/languaging and pragmatics), which, when addressed in terms of
aboutness, information need, relevance, anomalous state of knowledge (ASK [Belkin et
al., 1982]) hypothesis, information systems interaction/behavior, etc., neglect vital
knowledge about the fundamental nature and implicit functions of information,
knowledge, and social structures. We consider it likely that signs develop through
the stages of the emotional, informational, and cognitional significance effects. The
emotional (significance) effect has been studied within, for example, marketing
research, showing that framing signs, that is, placing products in suggestive
environments, causes emotional effects in relation to consumer perception of
products, successively affecting their behavior. This we consider to support the
hypothesis of the emotional and informational significance effects, but also the
cognitional significance effect, because, the greater the knowledge about the
product, its function, its purpose, its quality, etc., the greater the effect. The
semeiotic line of thought, however, is not a bird's-eye and neutral perspective. It
is, rather, as formulated in this particular context, a method for reasoning about
the information processes connected to the information system and the conduct of
human agents and the community. Consequently, the point of view from which we
consider the functions and processes of information systems interaction is essential.
The next sections touch upon the difference in approaching the processes of
information interaction from the perspective of the information systems, from the
perspective of the user, and from the perspective of the community. Understanding the
Information System Information systems are generally systems of representation, whose
purpose is to support information activity performed by users. Within the context of
LIS, information systems are defined as knowledge-organization systems (KOS), whose
purpose is to support information retrieval in bibliographic databases. Already here
we encounter a terminological problem, in that no system, in our phenosemeiotic view,
organizes knowledge, because no cognition is taking place; it can only be information
that the system organizes. Hence it must be an information organization system (IOS).
In the phenosemeiotic perspective, cognition takes place only insofaras information
is being interpreted; the system does not interpret anything, and, if it does, this
can only be considered a quasi-interpretation. KOS may be divided into different
kinds of representation systems, (a) term lists, (b) classification and
categorization systems, and (c) systems with particular focus on relationships
(Hodge, 2000), which may be elaborated even further by kind and granularity (Friedman
&amp; Thellefsen, 2011). As such, the basic functions of KOS are to facilitate
information retrival, provide information about documents, and provide shelf
arrangements (ordering function; Broughton et al., 2005). However, understanding KOS
as systems of representation nessecitates some explanatory comments on the concept
"representation." Basically, we agree with Davis et al. (1993), who define
representation within the context of information systems as knowledge representation
(KR), and succesively as a mode of thinking rather than acting. Consequently, Davis
et al. argue that knowledge representation is a surrogate, whose function is to
represent, or model, a part of reality by means of rationally structured sign systems
in terms of information. These structured sign systems imply a set of ontological
commitments, which determine how we may think about the world. This means that
basically our understanding of the model becomes our understanding of the world. As
such, the information system becomes a medium for efficient computation that
recommends particular lines of inferences. A KR is thus a system that defines the
fundamental informational structure of concepts, that sanctions a line of thought,
and that recommends particular inferences. Furthermore, KR is considered a medium of
human expression, a language that enables us to say things about the world. Although
there are some important nuances in relation to KOS, we consider KOS types of KR;
however, KOS may be highly structured and universal, such as the Colon system
(Ranganathan, 1960), or they may be based on ad hoc categorization that meets the
needs of a particular group of users (e.g., folksonomies). However, although highly
structured and formal systems are well-suited for computer processes, they tend to be
less informative for humans. Consequently, when approaching an information system
from the perspective of the system (the systems view), three types of sign systems
emerge: (a) the sign system of the system itself, that is, the grammar of the system
(syntax), the formal system of representation; (b) the sign system of meaning, the
intended meaning of the information system's system of representation; and (c) the
cognitive effect motivated by the system in a perceiving/interpreting mind. The first
type of system constitutes the structural, semantic layer of the information system.
Thus, the system is formally organized and structured based on the rules of the
system, binary coding at the lowest level and metadata structures at the highest
level. Consequently, we may argue that this first type of system constitutes the
fundamental grammar of the system. The second type of system establishes, based on
the first level, a semantic structure that implicates an intended meaning suggested
to a user of the system, such as the organization of concepts based on a variety of
semantic relations. At this level, we may argue that the information system
communicates a particular meaning and motivates, at least intentionally, a certain
user behavior. The third type of system is beyond the control of the system. The
cognitive effect, which is the result of the sign perception and interpretation,
relies on the particular user's ability actually to understand the function and
meaning of the information system. Traditionally, the research conducted from the
information systems perspective (the systems-oriented view) prioritizes the structure
and performance of the system, optimizing search algorithms, thus focusing on
relevance, recall, and precision. Fundamentally, the systems-oriented view promotes a
rationalistic epistemology and probabilistic methodology and operates at the sign
levels of syntax and semantics, which conform to altersense, the level of the
informational significance effect. We recall that the informational sign can be
iconic, indexical, or symbolic. Approaching information retrieval based exclusively
at the level of the informational significance effect has the advantage of a
controlled environment, objectivity, performance measures of such as search
algorithms, predictability, and clear results. However, signification at the
informational level is related to the objective or explicit side of information and
ignores the emotional as well as the cognitional sign levels. We may, therefore,
criticize the systems-oriented view for suboptimizing at the systems level, at the
expense of neglecting that information is always information to someone.
Hj&#xF8;rland (2010) argues that even the systems-oriented view, despite being
perceived as objective, involves relevance criteria that implicate users' (expert
users) relevance assessment, so systems performance cannot be evaluated by itself but
is evaluated in relation to how well it performs for potential users of the system.
Consequently, the systems view implies criteria for evaluation of systems performance
that cannot in themselves be objective. However, an important difference in relation
to the user-oriented view is that, even though information systems continuously are
to be evaluated and improved by user feedback, the search algorithm performs without
reasoning about what, how, or why particular documents are matched. Simply put, the
threshold for assessing relevance is in principle generalized and as objective as any
artefact. The systems-oriented view is ultimately limited to the informational
significance effect, the outer world, establishing the grammar and syntax of KOS.
User interaction with an information system takes the form of a quasi-dialogue; in
principle, the user is communicating with himself, by selecting between relevant and
nonrelevant documents (cf. the Bach scholar example). We may argue from this
perspective that the users ASK can be clarified by interacting with an information
system. This, however, calls for some speculations about how information systems may
support users in this process of clarification. Understanding the Information Need
The concept of information need is more intricate, simply because the phenomenon
resides within the cognititive space of the user. Within LIS, in particular, the
concept of ASK has been promoted in order to address the user's state of uncertainty
and, thus, motivation for seeking information. Seen from the perspective of the user,
the first and second types of sign systems are identical. However, decoding the
intended meaning of the information system also depends on the third type of sign
system, namely, the particular users' expertise with information systems interaction
and knowledge level (collateral experience). Significance effects, whether emotional,
informational, or cognitional, thus become an integral part of information systems
interaction. However, whereas the former perspective tends to prioritize the system's
information architecture and formal representation of language, in principle ignoring
the user, the latter tends to focus on the user's perception and sense making.
Consequently, the successful systems interaction is considered a trade off between
how well-focused an information system's design is, and if information architecture
actually addresses the needs and demands of users, and how well knowledge possessed
by users actually is stimulated by system interaction. In other words, how well the
system in fact reflects the emotional and cognitional structures of the user.
However, the emotional and cognitional significance effects are brain waves, so user
needs, knowledge structures, and ASK are understood in terms of information. Even
though the user-oriented view explicitly addresses the concept of knowledge, and even
the emotional state of the user (ASK in principle should be considered an emotional
state), knowledge is conflated into the realm of information. The consequence is that
ASK and information need are conceived as a state of mind that develops from a
mental, inarticulate stage to an explicit stage that, with the right tools, can be
expressed in the terms of the information system (Taylor, 1968). Whereas the systems
view gives priority to systems optimization, the user perspective gives priority to
user information-seeking behavior, user tasks, and user interaction. The user is the
priority; therefore, user information behavior is observed and evaluated. Whereas the
information-seeking process in the systems view is considered in terms of objective
relevance criteria as recall and precision, the information-seeking process in the
user perspective is evaluated in terms of user satisfaction. However, as one might
imagine, user satisfaction is inherently problematic, because the quality or
correctness of the retrieved documents is not evaluated. Bad or wrong documents may
also cause user satisfaction. Furthermore, users are different; some users are
experts within the search domain, and others are novices, which means that knowledge
about the work task and context of the information need is relative to different
users. As pointed out by Hj&#xF8;rland (2010, p. 228), there is a paradox in that,
"on the one hand, a user's relevance is considered purely individual, while on the
other hand the researchers try to uncover general tendencies." The question is then
whether individual users, at some cognitive level, exhibit a general
information-retrieval behavior, which remains to be uncovered. However, the paradox
pointed out is similar to the problem of induction, how to discover generality from
instances, a point made by Popper in his critique of logical positivism. Theories may
be falsified, never verified, because of the problem of induction (Popper, 1968). In
relation to our theoretical framework of the significance effect, the emotional
significance effect is subcognitive. However, as suggested, the emotional effect
motivated by a given work task situation depends on experience, intuition, or what
may be described as some kind of subcognitive recognition. The cognitional
significance effect relates to the knowledge that the user possesses about the work
task situation, and the user reflects his knowledge or expertise in the process of
systems interaction. The system itself provides the informational level of
significance, but how can we address the nature of knowledge possessed by the
individual user without giving in to total subjective relativism? There seems to be
only one answer to this question, that is, the social context determining the
information need that frames the work task situation, the context of systems
interaction, and the character of the problem that motivates the information-seeking
process. This is, in short, the universe of discourse. Understanding the Universe of
Discourse The universe of discourse is defined as the socially framed or situated
context in which the information-seeking activity takes place. The user's problem
space or work task situation is anchored in a certain context that provides meaning,
scope, and purpose to the information-seeking behavior. Deliberate information
seeking is never random but purposeful and goal directed. Understanding the context
of deliberate reasoning that gives rise to the formulation of a particular
information need is thus imperative. The communication model (see Figure 7)
consequently implies different layers of communication activity, that of
communication itself (signs are communicated to a perceiver, an interpreter), a
second level that implicates a relative<component x="313.97" y="543.37"

communicated information is perceived as meaningful and relates to knowledge already
possessed by the perceiver), and a third level of agreement, or, as Peirce (1977)
would state it, "minds fused together" (pp. 196-197), an idea of conceptual
alignment; the utterer and perceiver are in agreement about what is communicated, in
sense of meaning, but not necessarily in agreement about the substance or
concequences or even fundamental premises of the argument. This is represented in
Figure 7. Let us return to the library example used earlier, with the user not being
familiar with the library system. The library system represented by the number on the
bookshelf communicates the number to the user. The classification system becomes an
utterer, and it contains an indirect intention, namely, to communicate that "if you
are looking for a book concerning psychological topics you must look under 61.642."
The system is indeed able to create an intentional interpretant, but only insofar as
it is related to the system. We can call it a quasi-intentional interpretant. The
sign communicated is 61.642. The interpreter is the person not familiar with the
library system. He is wondering about the meaning of the number on the shelf. He can
recognize the number as a number and he makes the hypothesis that it is some sort of
code. Given the fact that all the books on the shelf have the same number, he makes
the hypothesis that the 61.642 is a code for books concerning psychological topics.
The success of his line of reasoning depends on his amount of collateral experience
and his ability to create hypotheses based on his collateral experience, and that the
universe of discourse is well defined. In this case, we can say that the systems
view, the users view, and the universe of discourse are melded together in a
meaning-creating process. Consequently, we maintain that any information-seeking
theory must have all three perspectives in mind when creating information systems.
Ingwersen (1996), and Ingwersen and J&#xE4;rvelin (2005) argue that any act of
communication involves a generator, a message, and a recipient. Accordingly, when the
generator communicates a message to a recipient, the message carrying the
intentionality, meaning, implicit context, and potential informativeness of the
generator becomes stripped from intentionality, meaning, implicit context, and
potential informativeness and falls into a linguistic surface level (Figure 8).
However, we argue that, even at the fundamental level of communication (Figure 7),
where signs are uttered from a generator (utterer) to a recipient (interpreter), the
recipient must interpret (or at least recognize) the communicated signs as signs of
communication, even though he has not yet understood the intended meaning of the
communication, which takes place successively at the next, more developed level of
cognition. The communication model illustrated in Figure 6 conforms to the
traditional transmission model of communication, originally formulated by Shannon and
Weaver (1949). This model also considers the process of communication as a
transference of a message from a generator to a recipient, in terms of signals or
codes through a channel; and, at the receivers end, the process of reconstructing the
signals received starts in principle from a morphosyntactic-semantic level and is
completed when the original message transmitted by the generator is reconstructed by
the recipient. However, the transference model (which includes the idea of cognitive
free fall) neglects some important aspects of the communication process.
Communication always takes place in a context (a universe of discourse). Furthermore,
any communicator and interpreter (generator and receiver, if human) exhibits
collateral experience, and therefore provides the communication process with
intentionality (denotation and connotation at emotional, informational, and cognitive
levels). In terms of interpretation, an interpreter at the lowest level of
significance establishes an immediate interpretation of the communication process,
thus perceiving the communicated signs as signs of meaning, not just signs of
semantic structure, which at a subcognitive (emotional recognition) level involves
collateral experience and knowledge about the universe of dis<component x="314.54"

Ingwersen's concept of cognitive free fall is that it assumes that communication
fundamentally builds upon decontextualized morphosyntactic semantic codes and
structures (as formulated by Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949) that must be reconstructed
and contextualized from a syntactical surface level by a perceiving mind before any
meaning is established (Figure 9). We believe that the process of communication
should be understood the other way around. Meaning emanates before syntax.
Consequently, any process of communication involving human minds is perceived from a
pragmatic level. Any acts of communication, even signs generated by computer screens,
are perceived as signs of meaning before signs of syntax, and the cognitive process
of meaning making thus precedes syntactical speculations. Of course, the process
considered from the machine is stripped from meaning, intentionality, etc. The
computer is no more than a sign generator; consequently, the idea of a cognitive free
fall does not even apply to a strictly decontextualized data transmission context,
such as computer systems transmitting data, because no cognition is taking place. It
certainly does not apply to human agents, not even if the cognitive processes within
the human brain are considered similar to "computing." This false assumption connects
the cognitive view to cognitive science. The semeiotic approach to communication is
skeptical of the notion of cognitive free fall, simply because the idea of
communication stripped from intentionality, meaning, and context seems to be absurd.
We consider the socially determined context a prerequisite condition if communication
has to take place. Consequently, we also consider communication an activity that
occurs only between minds, and the success of the communicative process is determined
by the collateral experience shared by the communicators and the universe of
discourse that delimits and determines the precise meaning of concepts. Conclusions
We have introduced our phenosemeiotically-inspired concepts of emotion, information,
and knowledge and have tried to argue for their role and function in the
meaningcreation process as well as in communication. Furthermore, we have discussed
how our phenosemeiotic perspective relates to and influences our understanding of the
systems view, the cognitive view, and a view based in a universe of discourse. We
have, through our analysis of significance effects, related to the process of
information retrieval, argued in favor of a phenosemeiotic view that takes into
account the fundamental layer of signification, the grammar of the system that
provides for the structuring and representation of information (the KOS).
Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the phenosemiotical view takes into account
that signs are signs of meaning and that users interpret signs and use signs in their
information-seeking activity, simply because the signs carry meaning to the user.
However, the meaning of signs and the ability of users to interpret signs are related
to the individual's level of collateral experience, which concerns both the user's
experience with a particular KOS, and the user's knowledge about what is sought.
Finally, the phenosemeiotic view implies that, in addition to signs being signs
(grammar) and signs being signs of meaning (semantics), signs are also interpreted
from a perspective more general than the individual user's collateral experience
(pragmatics). We argue that the universe of discourse expresses the overall frame for
how signs are signs of meaning and frames the discourse of meaning. Consequently, we
have to consider all three perspectives: the systems perspective, the user
perspective, and the perspective of the universe of discourse in order to account for
the intricate meaning-creation process that takes place when seeking information. We
believe that our phenosemiotic view establishes a comprehensive, theoretical
foundation for addressing the processes of information, communication, and knowledge,
which we consider philosophically sound and practically relevant for the field of
LIS.<component x="313.97" y="315.01" width="239.0" height="428.22" page="14"
