INTRODUCTION Background and purpose While considering the priorities for her 2013/14 year as Medical Library Association (MLA) president, Dixie A. Jones, AHIP, noted that it had been nearly five years since a task force had reviewed the MLA Code of Ethics for Health Sciences Librarianship (2010) [1]. Feeling that the association needs to periodically review the code and call attention to its existence as a guide to ethical behavior, especially for newer members who might not realize that MLA has a code of ethics, in spring 2013, she asked the MLA Board of Directors to charge an MLA Ethical Awareness Task Force and recommended that, in addition to other objectives centered around creating general ethical awareness and generating discussion of ethical issues, the nine-member task force should conduct a survey to determine MLA members&amp;apos; awareness of and opinions about the MLA code. Members o</context>
<context citStr="[1]" endWordPosition="9350" position="51331" startWordPosition="9350">f the respondents commented that the code does a good job of upholding our values as a profession and reminds us of important ideals and our fundamental relationship with our clients. For those who found the principles outlined in the code to be too generic, perhaps another type of ethical guidance document, in addition to the code, would be helpful. As the preface to the MLA Code of Ethics makes clear, its principles "are expressed in broad statements to guide ethical decision making. These statements provide a framework; they cannot and do not dictate conduct to cover particular situations" [1], A manual of ethical advice for everyday situations in the health science library setting might be a way to offer more guidance. That type of practical instruction could also be useful in helping overcome the challenges that some respondents reported with some code principles; for example, the frustration a number of commenters expressed about not being able to provide their users with the most current and up-todate information due to budget constraints or insufficient staff. Others noted a lack of understand ing by their institutions&amp;apos; leaders about copyright policy, licensing restrictions, </context>

Less than 20% were relatively new to health sciences librarianship. Finally, the responses to Q12, "What is your gender?", clearly reflected the overall gender makeup of this profession, with men making up only a little over 12% of the respondents. The demographics of this self-selected sample of MLA members, with a few minor exceptions, matched well with two other recent MLA member surveys: the 2012 MLA member salary survey and the early 2007 MLA member survey [15, 16]. The age group distribution of responses for all three surveys was almost identical, as was the gender distribution for this survey and the 2012 salary survey, as well as the distribution of years of professional experience for this survey and the 2007 member survey. However, the distribution of responses from members in various work settings in the three surveys suggested that hospital librarians might be somewhat underrepresent ed in this survey and that academic librarians might be somewhat overrepresented (Table 1, online only).
