			<abstract>
				<p>Libraries and information centres are established with a mission to provide right information to the right user at the right time and in the right amount. Library and information science (LIS) professionals apply their competencies for achieving this mission of libraries. In the past, LIS professionals were providing services within the premises of the library but now with the aid of technology they can reach to their patrons both within premises as well as outside the premises of the library. This outreach of LIS professionals to their clientele has opened doors for embedded librarianship.To develop appropriate competencies among LIS professionals for becoming successful embedded librarians, LIS schools can play a pivotal role. This paper highlights the dynamic nature of LIS profession and describes the concept of embedded librarianship. Role of LIS schools in nurturing the embedded librarianship is also the part of present paper. Concept of specialisation in LIS curriculum is a step towards nurturing embedded librarianship.</p>
