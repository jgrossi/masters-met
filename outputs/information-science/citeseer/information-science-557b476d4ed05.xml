INTRODUCTION The United States is seeing a growing number of parents refusing or delaying recommended childhood vaccinations, as well as a rise in vaccine-preventable diseases [1]. Some of these parents—intentional nonadherents—avoid vaccination because of concerns about vaccines’ safety and a perceived low susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases [2, 3].

General results and the complete interview guide can be found elsewhere [10].
