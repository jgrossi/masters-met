			<abstract>
				<p>In recent years, there has been considerable discussion of the challenges facing the future of information education in Australia. This paper reports a study that explored the characteristics and experiences of Australia's information educators. The study was undertaken as part of a larger project, which was designed to establish a consolidated and holistic picture of the Australian information profession and identify how its future education could be mediated in a cohesive and sustainable manner. Sixty-nine of Australia's information educators completed an online questionnaire that gathered data on aspects such as age, gender, rank, qualifications, work activities and job satisfaction. The key findings from this study confirm that a number of pressing issues are confronting information educators in Australia. For example, Australia's information educators are considerably older than that of the total Australian academic workforce; over half the information educators who participated in the study are looking to retire in the next 10 years; and Australia's information educators spend more time on service activities than members of other disciplines within Australia's education system and place a stronger importance on teaching over research. Left unaddressed, these issues will have significant implications for the future of information education as well as the broader information profession. Many of the key observations drawn from this study may also have relevance to other disciplines in the Australian educational context.</p>

Findings This section outlines the key findings in five areas: age, gender and rank, qualifications, work activities and job satisfaction. Age The ages of respondents ranged from 27 to 64 years with an average age of 50 (Figure 1). Just over 63% of the participants were aged 50 years or older. For almost a decade, the Australian demographer Graeme Hugo has been warning about the ‘lost generation’ of academics (2005, 340). According to Hugo (cited in Cervini 2010), ‘generation X are pretty thin in universities compared to baby boomers, who are strongly represented’. The findings in this study provide strong support for Hugo’s observations. Of the university academics who participated in the study, almost 56% were 50 years or older (baby boomers) and less than 5% (n  2) were 30 years of age or younger. Removing casual or sessional academics (e.g., the tutors and markers) from consideration and focussing only on the full-time and part-time ongoing or contract staff, over 61% of the study’s participants were aged 50 years and older and just over 3% (n  </context>

Indeed, many in the profession have suggested that information professionals and information educators inhabit two different worlds and that very rarely do these worlds collide. Moran (2001, 54) notes that ‘many librarians have little firsthand experience with library education after they graduate’. Similarly, Feather (2003, 40) contends that the vast majority of information practitioners ‘have not stepped foot into an LIS [library and information science] department since the day [they] left’. Given that the future of Australia’s information industry hinges in large measure on the quality of new graduates entering the profession, and that information educators are the key people responsible for educating and training these graduates, it is time to bring these two worlds closer together.

It is also quite possible that disciplines that are not perceived by the university to be of high priority (e.g., not allowing the institution to be competitive within the ERA programme) may be abandoned entirely (Svantesson and White 2009). Disciplines that have limited research output as well as small student numbers within their coursework programmesmay be at risk of disappearing. The data available suggests that whilst information educators are genuinely interested in research and are starting to have some success in obtaining research funding, they still have some way to go. Genoni (2005, 18) notes ‘if LIS [library and information science] departments are to survive – and hopefully thrive – in these circumstances they are under immediate pressure to be as research active as possible’. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of Australian information educators and provide new perspectives into information education.

Literature review The Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA) gathers information on the education programmes in Australia recognised by the association at both university and vocational education and training (VET) institutions. ALIA also gathers data on those individuals involved in teaching within those programmes in its Annual Course Return. This data has been collected annually since 1996 and is one of the few formal data collection mechanisms available, but is not publicly available. Hallam (2007) provides a brief analysis of the data gathered by ALIA in 2006 and concludes that there were too many information programmes, staffed by too few academics, competing for too few students. Other professional associations within the information sector, such as the Records and Information Management Professionals Australasia and the Australian Society of Archivists, do not have a formal process for gathering data on the education programmes they accredit. At the time that this study was conducted there was only anecdotal information available about the educators of these programmes. It should be</context>
<context citStr="Hallam (2007)" endWordPosition="2691" position="18644" startWordPosition="2690">g: almost 79% of the VET educators who participated in the study were aged 50 þ and only one VET educator was younger than 40 years of age. It is therefore not surprising that the study revealed that over half of the participants, regardless of institutional context, were looking to retire within the next 10 years. With over two-thirds of information educators approaching retirement age in the next 10–15 years, and over half indicating that they are indeed looking to retire in the next 10 years, the succession planning of Australian information educators is an important issue to be addressed. Hallam (2007) points to challenges in the recruitment of educators in the university context: currently, the PhD is an essential selection criterion for academic appointments, yet a PhD remains a relatively scarce commodity in the Australian information profession (Macauley, Evans, and Pearson 2010). A 2009 study by Macauley, Evans, and Pearson which analysed Australian PhD records between 1987 and 2006 revealed that the research fields, courses and discipline (RFCD) of Librarianship (one of 139 disciplines in the RFCD schema) remained static for the number of its PhD completions between the 5-year bracket</context>
<context citStr="Hallam (2007" endWordPosition="4689" position="31837" startWordPosition="4688">ar. They also conducted a large number of seminars and workshops, again over one and a half a year. The information educators who participated in the study had a strong attachment to their profession, with 77% rating their professional affiliation as very important. The participants rated affiliation to the profession as more important than affiliations to their faculty (46%), school (49%) and institution (52%). Participants also indicated that they perceived their work as being valued most by the information profession (32%) and valued least by the institution (13%). Engagement with industry Hallam (2007, 323) suggests that information educators can ‘be totally out of touch with current industry practice’. The findings of this study clearly reveal that Australia’s information educators actively seek to connect with the industry they support. Less than 3% have never worked within the information profession and over 30% of information educators are, in addition to their work as an educator, also currently employed within the information sector. It should also be noted that over 45% have not been actively employed within the profession for more than 5 years, and 25% had not been so for more than</context>

Twenty-two countries conducted a survey of their nation’s academic workforce. By using the same online questionnaire, the project was able to establish individual national profiles as well as provide international comparisons, and a number of similarities and differences were noted between nations. A vast majority of the participating countries reported a growing number of academic staff with higher degrees, especially doctorates, higher job satisfaction, increased pressure on faculty in the research arena and a feminisation of the workforce (Huang 2008). From the small, but growing, body of knowledge exploring information educators within Australia, two observations can be made. First, studies to date have focussed on library educators and not information educators (educators involved in education in all aspects of the information profession including library, records management, archives, teacher librarianship, information management). Second, no studies have explored information educators at both the university and VET sector.

Indeed, many in the profession have suggested that information professionals and information educators inhabit two different worlds and that very rarely do these worlds collide. Moran (2001, 54) notes that ‘many librarians have little firsthand experience with library education after they graduate’. Similarly, Feather (2003, 40) contends that the vast majority of information practitioners ‘have not stepped foot into an LIS [library and information science] department since the day [they] left’. Given that the future of Australia’s information industry hinges in large measure on the quality of new graduates entering the profession, and that information educators are the key people responsible for educating and training these graduates, it is time to bring these two worlds closer </context>

The key findings of all three considerations areas are available in the project’s final report (Partridge et al. 2011). The questionnaire used in the CAP Project (Research Institute for Higher Education, Hiroshima University 2008) informed the design of the questionnaire for this study. Drawing upon the CAP Project’s instrument allowed for easier comparison with national and international data on the world’s academic workforce. Although the CAP instrument informed the study, questions were modified and added to accommodate the VET context and the specific needs and interests of the information sector in Australia.

When ranking determines the level of funding a university receives, it is inevitable that institutions will adjust their actions to obtain the best ranking possible (Svantesson andWhite 2009). Using strategies such as promotion criteria, universities will steer the activities of their academic staff in the direction emphasised in the ranking process (Svantesson and White 2009; Yates 2010). One of the aims of ERA is to define ‘areas of strength’ (Arup 2008, 32) and universities might therefore feel the need to invest their limited resources in supporting the discipline in which they are strongest, thus allowing them to continue to excel and rate highly under ERA and thereby attract government research funding. Academics working outside the scope of these disciplines may be encouraged to abandon their discipline areas in favour of the dominant disciplines. It is also quite possible that disciplines that are not perceived by the university to be of high priority (e.g., not allowi</context>

Coates et al. (2009) note that the move to greater casualisation in academia is indicative of the broader trend in the Australian workforce. They also note that casualisation may not be problematic and that very little is known about casual staff. Qualifications All but one of the 45 university academics in the current study had a postgraduate qualification, over half had a PhD, and 15% were currently completing their doctoral studies. This is similar to the findings by Smith (2006) who surveyed members of the Information Studies Educators’ Forum and noted that 52% of information academics had a PhD with another 26% completing one. The figures in both studies contrast significantly with the Australian academic workforce where almost 67% have a doctorate (DEEWR 2010). They are also in contrast to the US context where 90% of information faculty during the 1990s had a PhD (Durrance 2003). Three-quarters of the VET educators in the current study had a postgraduate qualification, with only one educator possessing a PhD. This is striking when considered against the 2008 figure</context>
