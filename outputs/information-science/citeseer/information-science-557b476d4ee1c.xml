			<abstract>
				<p>Augmented reality (AR) technology has implications for the ways that the field of library and information science (LIS) serves users and organizes information. Through content analysis, the author examined how AR is conceptualized within a sample of LIS literature from the Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts (LISTA) database and Google Blogs postings. The author also examined whether Radical Change Theory (RCT) and the digital-­‐age principles of interactivity, connectivity, and access are present in the discussion of this technology. The analysis of data led to the identification of 14 categories comprising 132 total codes across sources within the data set. The analysis indicates that the conceptualization of AR, while inconsistent, suggests expectations that the technology will enhance the user experience. This can lead to future examinations of user behavior, response, and observation of technologies like AR.</p>
