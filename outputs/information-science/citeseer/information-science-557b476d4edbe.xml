			<abstract>
				<p>We present our semeiotic-inspired concept of information as 1 of 3 important elements in meaning creation, the 2 other concepts being emotion and cognition. We have the inner world (emotion); we have the outer world (information); and cognition mediates between the two. We analyze the 3 elements in relation to communication and discuss the semeiotics-inspired communication model, the Dynacom; then, we discuss our semeiotic perspective on the meaning-creation process and communication with regard to a few, but central, elements in library and information science, namely, the systems-oriented perspective, the user-oriented perspective, and a domain-oriented perspective.</p>

Consequently, LIS suffers from a common-sense approach to LIS core concepts such as concept formation and concept delimitation (logic), categorization (similarity/dissimilarity, semantic relations), terminology (representation/signification), knowledge (cognition and distributed cognition), community (paradigms, universe of discourse), and communication (language/languaging and pragmatics), which, when addressed in terms of aboutness, information need, relevance, anomalous state of knowledge (ASK [Belkin et al., 1982]) hypothesis, information systems interaction/behavior, etc., neglect vital knowledge about the fundamental nature and implicit functions of information, knowledge, and social structures. We consider it likely that signs develop through the stages of the emotional, informational, and cognitional significance effects. The emotional (significance) effect has been studied within, for example, marketing research, showing that framing signs, that is, placing products in suggestive environments, causes emotional effects in relation to consumer perception of products, successively affecting their be</context>

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the concept of information is relative to the perspective of inquiry, this being a systems view, a user-oriented view, and a social view. We demonstrate how information relates to emotion and knowledge and vice versa, and finally, we demonstrate how this semeiotically based analysis is relevant for information science, especially the relation among the the systems-oriented perspective, the user-oriented perspective, and a domain-oriented perspective. Our present work follows the line of thought already set by Brier (1996, 2004, 2006, 2008) and Thellefsen, Brier, and Thellefsen (2003); however, the important contribution is the phenosemiotical understanding of information. The article is structured in the following way: First, we outline emotion, information, and knowledge as understood within Peirce’s framework of a scientific phenomenology, this phenomenology being a fundamental conceptual condition. Second, we look at the Peircean semeiotic and give an account of the concept of emotion in terms of the sign trichotomy qualisign, sinsign, and legisign. Third, we propose a semeiotically-inspired definition of </context>

However, signification at the informational level is related to the objective or explicit side of information and ignores the emotional as well as the cognitional sign levels. We may, therefore, criticize the systems-oriented view for suboptimizing at the systems level, at the expense of neglecting that information is always information to someone. Hjørland (2010) argues that even the systems-oriented view, despite being perceived as objective, involves relevance criteria that implicate users’ (expert users) relevance assessment, so systems performance cannot be evaluated by itself but is evaluated in relation to how well it performs for potential users of the system. Consequently, the systems view implies criteria for evaluation of systems performance that cannot in themselves be objective. However, an important difference in relation to the user-oriented view is that, even though information systems continuously are to be evaluated and improved by us</context>

However, as one might imagine, user satisfaction is inherently problematic, because the quality or correctness of the retrieved documents is not evaluated. Bad or wrong documents may also cause user satisfaction. Furthermore, users are different; some users are experts within the search domain, and others are novices, which means that knowledge about the work task and context of the information need is relative to different users. As pointed out by Hjørland (2010, p. 228), there is a paradox in that, “on the one hand, a user’s relevance is considered purely individual, while on the other hand the researchers try to uncover general tendencies.” The question is then whether individual users, at some cognitive level, exhibit a general information-retrieval behavior, which 1746 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY—August 2013 DOI: 10.1002/asi remains to be uncovered.

Hence it must be an information organization system (IOS). In the phenosemeiotic perspective, cognition takes place only insofaras information is being interpreted; the system does not interpret anything, and, if it does, this can only be considered a quasi-interpretation. KOS may be divided into different kinds of representation systems, (a) term lists, (b) classification and categorization systems, and (c) systems with particular focus on relationships (Hodge, 2000), which may be elaborated even further by kind and granularity (Friedman &amp; Thellefsen, 2011). As such, the basic functions of KOS are to facilitate information retrival, provide information about documents, and provide shelf arrangements (ordering function; Broughton et al., 2005).

In the second there was only a sense of brute force; now there is a sense of government by a general rule.

It is at this level that information is interpreted and becomes knowledge. Consequently, there is a structural difference between information and knowledge. Information is not interpreted; interpreted information is knowledge.

However, the concept of emotion that we try to put to use in our theory of the meaning-creation process follows the metaphysical conditions given by Peirce. Hence, this concept of emotion is understood within the realm of evolution; therefore, it is dynamic, like the meaning-creation process into which it enters.

Consequently, the meaning-creation process is a continuous process consisting of adding characteristics to the signs and removing hypotheses from the signs based on prior experience with the given sign. Even though the universe of discourse and collateral experience are dialogical conditions, a train of thoughts as described above is a dialog between a self and the future self; therefore, we can apply the concepts of collateral experience and universe of discourse to this situation. The universe of discourse is what an utterer and interpreter must share for communication to result (see Liszka, 1996). Liszka renames the universe of discourse to a discourse of community. “In order for genuine communication to take place the sign which is the utterer must be part of a sense common to the interpreter, and, conversely; it requires a sensibility gained from a common community” (Liszka, 1996, p. 92). It seems clear that the prior knowledge about the dog enables the interpreter to recognize the dog as a dog, and it is this prior knowledge that creates the universe of discourse, namely, that it is a spot moving, that it is a dog, and that it is Jake.

Understanding the context of deliberate reasoning that gives rise to the formulation of a particular information need is thus imperative. The communication model (see Figure 7) consequently implies different layers of communication activity, that of communication itself (signs are communicated to a perceiver, an interpreter), a second level that implicates a relative informational effect (i.e., the communicated information is perceived as meaningful and relates to knowledge already possessed by the perceiver), and a third level of agreement, or, as Peirce (1977) would state it, “minds fused together” (pp. 196–197), an idea of conceptual alignment; the utterer and perceiver are in agreement about what is communicated, in sense of meaning, but not necessarily in agreement about the substance or concequences or even fundamental premises of the argument.

As such, the information system becomes a medium for efficient computation that recommends particular lines of inferences. A KR is thus a system that defines the fundamental informational structure of concepts, that sanctions a line of thought, and that recommends particular inferences. Furthermore, KR is considered a medium of human expression, a language that enables us to say things about the world. Although there are some important nuances in relation to KOS, we consider KOS types of KR; however, KOS may be highly structured and universal, such as the Colon system (Ranganathan, 1960), or they may be based on ad hoc categorization that meets the needs of a particular group of users (e.g., folksonomies). However, although highly structured and formal systems are well-suited for computer processes, they tend to be less informative for humans. Consequently, when approaching an information system from the perspective of the system (the systems view), three types of sign systems emerge: (a) the sign system of the system itself, that is, the grammar of the system (syntax), the formal system of representation; (b) the sign system of meaning, the intended meaning of the informatio</context>

In terms of interpretation, an interpreter at the lowest level of significance establishes an immediate interpretation of the communication process, thus perceiving the communicated signs as signs of meaning, not just signs of semantic structure, which at a subcognitive (emotional recognition) level involves collateral experience and knowledge about the universe of discourse. The problem with Ingwersen’s concept of cognitive free fall is that it assumes that communication fundamentally builds upon decontextualized morphosyntactic semantic codes and structures (as formulated by Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949) that must be reconstructed and contextualized from a syntactical surface level by a perceiving mind before any meaning is established (Figure 9). We believe that the process of communication should be understood the other way around. Meaning emanates before syntax. Consequently, any process of communication involving human minds is perceived from a pragmatic level. Any acts of communication, even signs generated by computer screens, are perceived as signs of meaning before signs of syntax, and the cognitive process of meaning making thus precedes syntactical speculations. Of course, the proce</context>

But as there cannot be a General without Instances embodying it, so there cannot be thought without Signs. (Charles S. Peirce Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmaticism. CP 4.551, 19061) Introduction The topics of information and knowledge lie at the root of library and information science (LIS), both historically and analytically. In particular, the academic community of LIS, concerned with the organization and retrieval of information, has spent years discussing and clarifying the concepts of information and knowledge and the possible relationship between them (Taylor, 1968; Belkin, Oddy, &amp; Brooks, 1982; Buckland, 1991; Brier, 1996, 2004; Hjørland, 1997, 2004, 2007, 2009; Capurro &amp; Hjørland, 2003; Cornelius, 2004). Variations emerge in the definitions because of the background of the authors and the specific aims that they pursue; we seem to be facing a labyrinth on theoretical, methodological, and terminological grounds. Generally, the concept of information is approached through three general families of concepts: a systemsoriented view, a user-oriented view, and a domain-oriented view (see Ingwersen &amp; Järvelin, 2005, for an excellent review regarding the syst</context>
<context citStr="Taylor, 1968" endWordPosition="9997" position="62963" startWordPosition="9996">nal significance effects are brain waves, so user needs, knowledge structures, and ASK are understood in terms of information. Even though the user-oriented view explicitly addresses the concept of knowledge, and even the emotional state of the user (ASK in principle should be considered an emotional state), knowledge is conflated into the realm of information. The consequence is that ASK and information need are conceived as a state of mind that develops from a mental, inarticulate stage to an explicit stage that, with the right tools, can be expressed in the terms of the information system (Taylor, 1968). Whereas the systems view gives priority to systems optimization, the user perspective gives priority to user information-seeking behavior, user tasks, and user interaction. The user is the priority; therefore, user information behavior is observed and evaluated. Whereas the information-seeking process in the systems view is considered in terms of objective relevance criteria as recall and precision, the information-seeking process in the user perspective is evaluated in terms of user satisfaction. However, as one might imagine, user satisfaction is inherently problematic, because the quality</context>

We are fully aware that the three kinds of significance effects as suggested here rest upon a theoretical analysis and, as such, require further empirical investigation. Testing the nature of significance effects in an information system interaction environment is, however, outside the scope of this article. Nevertheless, the significance effects have by no means come out of thin air; we know, from studies in terminology and lexicography (Cabré, 2003; Felber, 1984; Myking, 2001; Sager, 1990; Thellefsen, 2004) that knowledge domain members are more familiar with the specialities of their knowledge domain, its concepts, and terminology than nonmembers of the domain. We also know that domain specialists are more attentive and cautious about their use of technical terms, simply because the meanings of technical terms are sanctioned by the community of the knowledge domain, and addressing a community of peers at, for example, a conference, necessitates a deliberate use of shared, specialized terminology. Many information specialists may consider this to be a commonsense fact, which may explain why rese</context>
