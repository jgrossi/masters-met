      <p>INTRODUCTION
Background and purpose
While considering the priorities for her 2013/14 year
as Medical Library Association (MLA) president,
Dixie A. Jones, AHIP, noted that it had been nearly
five years since a task force had reviewed the MLA
Code of Ethicsfor Health Sciences Librarianship (2010) [1].
Feeling that the association needs to periodically
review the code and call attention to its existence as
a guide to ethical behavior, especially for newer
members who might not realize that MLA has a code
of ethics, in spring 2013, she asked the MLA Board of
Directors to charge an MLA Ethical Awareness Task
Force and recommended that, in addition to other
objectives centered around creating general ethical
awareness and generating discussion of ethical issues,
the nine-member task force should conduct a survey
to determine MLA members' awareness of and
opinions about the MLA code.</p>
      <p>Members of the task force—working in consultation
with President Jones, MLA Executive Director Carla
J. Funk, CAE, and MLA Membership, Research, and
Information Systems Director Kate E. Corcoran—
crafted a survey instrument with the goal of deter­
mining: (1) members' awareness of the existence of
and the provisions in the code, (2) members' recent
reading or use of the code to resolve professional
ethical issues, (3) members' use of ethics codes from
other library associations or other related professions,
(4) members' views regarding the relative importance
or centrality of the eleven statements in the MLA
code, (5) members' views regarding the difficulty or
challenges that they had experienced in following any
of the eleven statements of the MLA code, and (6)
members' encounters with any professional situations
that were not clearly addressed by the MLA code. The
survey also included questions at the end to catego­
rize the responses by the respondents' primary work
setting, age group, years of professional experience,
and gender.</p>
      <p>Literature review
To provide a historical and comparative professional
context for this survey study, the authors reviewed
the library and information sciences literature for the
past approximately 25 years, looking for other studies
that have surveyed library professionals regarding
their perceptions or uses of codes of ethics. In summer
2014, we searched both the Library Literature and
Information Sciences and Library, Information Sci­
ences &amp;Technology Abstracts databases, combining
variations of the keywords "ethics" w ith variations
of the term "surveys." These searches retrieved a
combined total of about 200 different potentially
relevant publications. A review of the titles and
abstracts, and full text when needed, narrowed the
results to just 12 relevant survey studies published
between 1987 and 2012.</p>
      <p>The articles' survey populations included American</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>Library Association (ALA) members, Special Libraries</title>
      <p>Association members, leaders of library associations,
US academic and health sciences librarians, state
associations, and librarians from Norway, Russia, and
the United Kingdom. Although the level of familiarity
with codes of ethics varied from survey to survey, the
primary ethical principles remained the same in most
instances: patron privacy, equality of access, intellec­
tual freedom and censorship, preservation of the
intellectual record, copyright, and control of the
Internet.</p>
      <p>In an ALA survey about patron privacy, 76% of
respondents agreed that libraries were doing all they
can to prevent unauthorized access to personal
information [2], Academic librarians in one study
identified service to clientele, intellectual freedom,
and information literacy as the top ethical values [3].
Health sciences librarians in one state rated confiden­
tiality and privacy, access to information, professional
competence and integrity, and censorship as the most
critical issues [4],</p>
      <p>Among those who were asked about the impact of
a code of ethics on their daily work, only 13% of
academic librarians in one study completely agreed
that the ALA Code of Ethics (COE) was a useful tool,
although those who were more familiar with the ALA
COE were more likely to have taken action in
response to observing a code violation [5]. In a study
of library managers, 21% were unfamiliar with the
ALA COE, and 83% thought it was not appropriate to
post the code for patrons to read [6]. Two additional
articles reported a higher awareness and use of the
ALA COE [7, 8],</p>
      <p>Preservation of the intellectual record was an
important principle for the non-US librarians, and
they shared the US librarians' opinions that the
patrons' interests were a top value [9-11]. Librarians
in the United Kingdom were more aware of their
association's codes of ethics than their US counter­
parts [12]. One study combined leaders from US and
UK organizations, finding that all had similar ethical
concerns [13].</p>
      <p>METHODOLOGY
The survey for this study was conducted using MLA's
licensed instance of the web-based SurveyMonkey
software [14]. MLA staff coded the questions, using
draft versions provided by the task force, and then
provided access to the draft survey for all members of
the task force to review and edit. The final survey
included 8 questions focused on the MLA Code of
Ethics for Health Sciences Librarianship. The survey
instrument also included a copy of the full text of the
code's 11 principles for direct reference in answering
questions 2 through 6. As noted previously, the
survey concluded with 4 questions asking respon­
dents to indicate their primary work settings, age
groups, number of years (in 5 to 10 year ranges) of
professional experience, and genders. A copy of the
full text of the survey, including the eleven principle
statements in the MLA code, is provided in the online
only appendix.</p>
      <p>Since this survey was restricted to active MLA
members, with the goal of better understanding and
improving members' ability to make effective use of
this association resource, we did not seek formal
approval from an institutional review board (IRB) for
the study methods. The task force chair did consult
informally with the chair of the State University of
New York at Buffalo Social Sciences IRB, who advised
that the survey would have almost certainly qualified
for exemption if it had been submitted for review.
Rather than deliberately selecting a sample of MLA
members to survey, the task force decided to invite
almost all MLA members to participate. An invitation
appeared in MLA-FOCUS, an email newsletter, that,
in September 2013, was distributed bimonthly to
those 2,922 MLA members who had not opted out
of email communications from the association. No
personal information was collected from survey
participants. Internet protocol (IP) addresses were
collected automatically from participants, but these
were used by the MLA headquarters survey manager
solely to remove duplicate responses. IP information
was not provided to the Ethical Awareness Task Force
members or to the survey analysts.</p>
      <p>Our analysis of the survey response data included
both simple frequency counts and percentage tabula­
tions of the responses to each survey question. It is
important to note that the initial survey response
tabulations were revised based on a more careful
analysis of the responses to the demographic question
regarding "primary work setting" (Q9). This analysis
showed that 42 of the Q9 responses needed to be
changed to another category, based on the respon­
dents' answers to the open-ended text description of
"other library type," which these respondents includ­
ed as part of their responses. In these 42 cases,
respondents' descriptions did not match the response
categories that they had checked on the survey in Q9.
We changed these responses to the category indicated
by the text that they entered. The final tabulations and
cross-tabulations reported in the "Results" include
these changes. These Q9 changes resulted in a modest
broadening of the "Special library in a for-profit
business setting" response category. Since a few
respondents indicated in their text responses for
"other library type" that they worked in a nonprofit
association or other business-like setting, we also
changed these to be part of this "business setting"
category. Additionally, these changes helped to make
a more consistent distinction in the responses between
the first 2 response categories for Q9. "Academic
health sciences library serving a school of medicine"
was changed to include all responses for respondents
working in libraries that serve a medical school, as
well as those that also serve other schools in addition
to medicine. And, finally, "Academic library serving
health professions programs" was broadened to
include respondents who worked in any other
academic library setting that did not serve a school
of medicine.</p>
      <p>Finally, in addition to the open ended, "other"
component of the primary work setting demographic
question (Q9), we also tabulated and categorized the
open-ended text responses for 5 of the survey
questions: Q2, descriptions of other codes of ethics
or guidelines that some respondents said they used
in addition to the MLA code to guide their
professional activities; Q4, why some respondents
thought some MLA code principles were more
important than others; Q5, why some respondents
thought some MLA code principles were less
important than others; Q7, some respondents' de­
scriptions of the difficulties or challenges that they
had faced with some MLA code principles; and Q8,
some respondents' descriptions of ethical challenges,
dilemmas, or concerns they felt were not clearly
addressed by the MLA code.
Characteristics of survey responses and respondents
When the survey closed on October 1, 2013, 552 MLA
members had opened and completed at least 1 of the
questions. To ensure that the data analysis would be
uniform and complete, we eliminated 37 survey
responses that were duplicates or were significantly
incomplete. Thus, the data included in this analysis are
based on 515 MLA member responses, for a response
rate of about 17.6%. The last 4 survey questions
(Q9Q12) provide an overview of the general characteristics
of the MLA members who responded to this survey.</p>
      <p>The largest single group of respondents, by a
narrow margin, worked in hospital settings (34%),
followed closely by those in academic medical centers
with a school of medicine (33%) and in other
academic settings (21%). Those working in govern­
ment agencies, for-profit or nonprofit businesses, or a
range of other settings together made up less than
12% of the respondents. As noted previously in the
"Methods" section, 42 of the 67 descriptions of "other
library type" were used to revise the counts in this
question's response categories. Other settings men­
tioned were university faculty (4), retired (3), inde­
pendent consultant (2), consumer health (2), student
or new graduate (2), and unemployed (2). A large
majority (60%) of these MLA members were older
than 50 years, 23% were between 36 and 50 years old,
and less than 17% were 35 years old or younger.
Respondents, collectively, had a great deal of profes­
sional experience. Over 31% had more than 25 years
of professional health sciences work experience, and
another 30% had been working for at least 10 years.
Less than 20% were relatively new to health sciences
librarianship. Finally, the responses to Q12, "What is
your gender?", clearly reflected the overall gender
makeup of this profession, with men making up only
a little over 12% of the respondents.</p>
      <p>The demographics of this self-selected sample of
MLA members, with a few minor exceptions,
matched well with two other recent MLA member
surveys: the 2012 MLA member salary survey and the
early 2007 MLA member survey [15, 16]. The age
group distribution of responses for all three surveys
was almost identical, as was the gender distribution
for this survey and the 2012 salary survey, as well as
the distribution of years of professional experience for
this survey and the 2007 member survey. However, the
distribution of responses from members in various
work settings in the three surveys suggested that
hospital librarians might be somewhat underrepresent­
ed in this survey and that academic librarians might be
somewhat overrepresented (Table 1, online only).</p>
      <p>Finally, although this survey did not include a
question about the country where the member
worked (MLA does have many members in Canada
and other countries), it is likely that a few responses
were submitted by Canadian members and other
international members, because the responses to Q2
("Are there any other codes...[you] have used to
guide your professional activities?") included men­
tions of the Canadian Health Libraries Association/
Association des bibliotheques de la sante du Canada
code of ethics and other national library association
codes. (Analysis of this question appears in the next
section of the "Results.")
Awareness and use of the Medical Library
Association (MLA) code and other ethics codes
Interestingly, and perhaps not surprisingly, over 30%
of the responses to Ql, which asked, "when was the
last time you read or thought about the MLA Code of
Ethics?", were from members who could not remem­
ber the last time they had looked at the code, and
another 20% either did not even know that MLA has a
code of ethics (13.5%) or had never looked at or
thought about the code (7%) (Figure 1). The vast
majority of those who responded that they had looked
at the code (233 of 252,93%) did so fairly recently, that
is, within the last 5 years or less.</p>
      <p>The next question (Q2) asked whether the member
respondents had referred to codes of ethics from other
professional library associations or from other pro­
fessions to guide their professional activities, and the
question provided a text box to list any other codes
consulted. Less than half of the respondents (47.9%)
responded that "yes" they had referred to other
codes. However, as with the question reporting the
respondents' primary work settings (Q9 described
above), a number of the respondents (8) who
indicated they did not refer to any other codes,
nevertheless, did list 1 or more others in the text
box. Those 8 respondents are included among the 245
who responded that, "Yes," they did consult other
codes. These other "codes of ethics," described by
230 respondents, included a rather large number of
different library association and other professional
codes as well as other published guidelines, legal
codes, and even religious texts. The single most
frequently cited other code, by a wide margin, was
the ALA COE. Most respondents cited only a single
other code or guideline, but a few cited many others
(in one case, 11 others), with an average of 1.30 other</p>

Relative "importance" of the MLA code principles
After reviewing all 11 MLA code principles included
in the survey, a substantial majority of the respon­
dents (393, 76.3%) said in Q3 that all of the code
principles are "equally important or central for the
ethical practice of health sciences librarianship." The
other 122 respondents (23.7%) who said they thought
they thought that "one or more of the principles were
more (or less) important or central" were then asked
(in Q4) to select up to 3 of these MLA code principles
Q 4: Select up to 3 MLA code principles you consider more important, &amp;
Q 5: Select up to 3 MLA code principles you consider less important

N um ber o f responses
that they considered either to be "more important"
than the others and then (in Q5) up to 3 others that
they considered to be "less important." The first 4
principles in the MLA code were selected much more
frequently (each by around 50% of the 116 Q4
respondents) as being "more important" (Figure 2).
The next 3 principles (provides leadership and
expertise for the institution, advances and upholds
professional philosophy and ideals, and advocates
and advances knowledge and standards) were select­
ed more frequently (each by about one-third of the
106 Q5 respondents) as being "less important."</p>
            <p>Smaller majorities of the 122 respondents, who said
they thought 1 or more of the MLA code principles
was more or less important than the others, also
provided brief explanations or comments about their
choices. Of the 116 who selected 1,2, or 3 principles as
more important, 70 (60.3%) added an explanation or
comment; and of the 106 who selected some princi­
ples as less important, 80 (75.5%) added an explana­
tion or comment (Table 3).
"Difficulties or challenges" with the MLA
code principles
In addition to what their perceptions of the importance
of the MLA code principles were, we also asked in Q6
whether the respondents thought any of the principles
were particularly difficult or challenging to follow in
their professional activities. As with importance, a
substantial majority (397, 77.1%) said they did not find
any of the code's principles to be difficult or challenging
to follow. For those respondents who in Q6 said they
thought 1 or more of the principles were difficult to
challenging (118 respondents, 22.9%), Q7 asked them to
select up to 3 principles that they considered to be a
particular challenge. Almost all of these (117), plus 2
others (who had responded that they did not find any
of the principles difficult or challenging!), selected 1 or
more principles as particularly challenging, for a total
of 119 responses to this question (Figure 3).</p>
            <p>Two of the principles stand out in this analysis as
being of particular concern to a large plurality of these
respondents: "provides leadership and expertise in
the design...[and so on, of] information systems that
meet the information needs and obligations of the
institution" (selected by nearly 43% of these respon­
dents) and "ensures that the best available informa­
tion is provided to the client" (selected by more than
35%). Again, almost all of these respondents (105 of
119), plus 3 others who did not make any selection
(108 in all), added a prose description or comment
about the challenges they had encountered with 1 or
more of the principles (Table 4).</p>
            <p>Issues not addressed by the MLA code principles
Q8, the last of the survey questions focused on
members' assessments of the MLA code of ethics,
asked if the member had encountered any profes­
sional ethical challenges, dilemmas, or concerns that
were not clearly addressed by the principles in the

code of ethics and policies
■ Conflicts with institution’s policies of access. Library’s constitution states “all health care practitioners
have access” [but] licenses decree that only registered staff and students may access our resources
in electronic formats.
■ Many people don’t care or understand “ Freedom of inquiry, thought, and expression” [or] why it</p>
              <p>needs to be promoted. I encounter hostility to the concepts from some people.
■ Economic environment [makes] it challenging to promote info access for all. We provide public access</p>
              <p>computers, [don’t] have the funding to maintain and upgrade them, so...are reducing our efforts.
■ Hospital may require loyalty that dictates [making] them aware of potential harm or legal action</p>
              <p>because of work done in library (e.g., working with patients (or lawyers) who want to sue the hospital).
■ It is difficult to work without prejudice to meet the client’s information needs when the client is rude</p>
              <p>and disrespectful to library staff.
■ My manager and I had a long discussion over his demand that I pass along the names of people I

■ Sometimes it helps to share a question with a colleague for help—and confidentially may be difficult.
» Within a corporate health care setting, confidentiality may be applied in a way that is different from</p>
              <p>a public library or academic setting.
■ Requests to monitor for security in hospitals could place librarian gate keepers in a bind. Had two
instances where a library user fit a state security alert. From computer search logs I could have
matched up information. A dilemma.

■ Hard to ensure the best available information is provided...can be a matter of opinion or client can</p>
              <p>be doing their own searching without librarian’s help.
• We do not necessarily have access to the best available information—we always try to inform client</p>
              <p>of the best available information but we cannot always provide that information.
■ This is highly difficult given the current economic conditions for hospitals and the resultant budget cutting!
■ Because much health information is gated, [providing] the best information to all in need is
compromised in favor of those who can pay. Equality of access...[requires] open access to the
literature of the health sciences.
■ It is sometimes hard to stay present and visible to the administrators &amp; key players in the institution.
• Depends on a librarian’s position within the institution. Not all librarians are involved with the</p>
              <p>creation or development of institutional knowledge based systems.
■ Organizational structure or lack of receptive is departments can hinder librarian’s role.
■ Can depend on the willingness of the institution/community to listen to input from librarians. I know</p>
              <p>not all institutions are equally supportive of librarians attempting to be involved in this process.
■ Not an ethical challenge— rather a challenge to get to the table with input and expertise.
■ In hospitals, [many] hurdles to get librarian involvement with “design, development, and ethical
mgmt of".../s makes decisions re. infrastructure for systems...we only take part after access
problems are reported.
• What is the philosophy of the organization? It’s hard to advance and advocate when one doesn’t</p>

• These are challenging only because I haven’t really thought about them specifically in a long time
(maybe since library school). Not that they aren’t part of my day-to-day practice— I just haven’t
thought about them in a while.
■ Staff shortages and budget constraints [limit the time we can devote] to advancing the knowledge
of our profession. Many [research] projects we would like to do, but would require neglecting others
[that] support our mission.
■ When the institutions goals and aims may potentially conflict with the profession's there is no</p>
              <p>guidance as to precedence.
■ It is difficult to maintain respect when other “ professionals” are not respectful. Call it office politics.</p>
              <p>The organization will suffer with this type of environment.
■ Some colleagues [lack a] basic work ethic...have worked alongside librarians [with] no interest in
promoting the profession, or making access to information easier for patrons, so it is difficult to treat
them with courtesy and respect.
• Challenging to maintain professional integrity when one...is wondering [about] office politics...It is</p>
              <p>particularly [nonsensical] to behave in such an unprofessional manner at work.

MLA code. A very large majority of the respondents
(84.5%) said that they had not encountered situations
of this kind. Those who responded that, "yes," they
had encountered professional ethical challenges not
addressed by the MLA code were asked at the end of
Q8 to briefly describe some examples of those
challenges. All but 1 of the 79 "yes" respondents
provided a comment or description of these challeng­
es, plus an additional 5 who had responded "no" and
2 others who had skipped the first part of Q8, for a
total of 85 comments (Table 5).
This survey, created by the MLA Ethical Awareness
Task Force, measured MLA members' familiarity with
and use of the MLA code of ethics, asking when they
last viewed the code and whether they also consulted
other codes of ethics or ethical guidelines. Over 30.0%
of the respondents did not know when they had last
viewed the code, with an additional 13.5% being
unaware that MLA had a code of ethics. Nevertheless,
most of the majority who were aware of the MLA code
(233 of 252, or nearly half of all respondents) had
referred to the code within the last 5 years. Just under
half of the respondents noted they had referred to other
codes, most often the ALA COE, although the codes of
other organizations, legal guidelines, and religious
texts were also mentioned by some.</p>
              <p>The majority of survey respondents were aware
that the MLA code of ethics existed (although it
appears that most did not refer to it on a regular
basis), which was a higher percentage of awareness
than for the librarians surveyed in the other published
studies we reviewed. Elowever, MLA members
agreed with those other survey respondents about
the most important ethical principles and values for
librarians. The review of the literature undertaken in
preparation for this study showed that the majority of
US librarians agreed that people should be able to
control who sees their personal information, that
codes of ethics have an important role in profession­
alism, and that service to patrons, equity of access,
and intellectual freedom are the most important core
ethical principles. This survey confirmed that MLA
members shared these same core ethical values,
because while most respondents thought all of the
values were equally important, those respondents
who ranked the code principles most often chose the
first three under clients and society as more important
("works without prejudice to meet the client's
information needs," "promotes access to health
information for all," and "maintains conditions of
freedom of inquiry, thought, and expression"). In
more than one of the other studies that we reviewed,
relatively large numbers of participants were unfa­
miliar with the ALA COE (21% were unfamiliar in 1
case, 32% unfamiliar in another). Similarly, a rather
large percentage of the MLA member respondents
(over 41%) had never read or thought about the MLA
code, could not remember when they had, or did not
know that MLA had a code of ethics.</p>
              <p>Finally, just over 77% of respondents did not find
any of the principles of the code to be challenging
to follow. Those who thought some of the code
principles were more challenging to follow selected
"provides leadership and expertise in the design...of
information systems that meet the information needs
and obligations of the institution" and "ensures that
the best available information is provided to the
client" as the most challenging.
As with all survey research, this study had some
limitations, including the method that we used to
recruit respondents, which was not a scientifically
random or demographically stratified sample. In­
stead, the MLA-FOCUS email newsletter invitations
to participate were sent to almost all MLA members;
thus, there were likely significant differences between
those members who were likely to open those issues
of MLA-FOCUS and decide to open this survey, and
those who were more likely to not open those issues
or to decide they did not want to participate, even
with the incentive offered. Nevertheless, a large
number of members did respond, and both the
numbers and distribution of responses across work
locations, age groups, levels of experience, and gender
were all fairly comparable to the responses to
previous MLA membership surveys. It should also
be noted that the questions in this survey might have
confused some respondents since we did not pretest</p>

What about dealing with vendors—institutional agreements, licensing, etc. I have heard people
say things like “we will just ride your contract; the vendor will never know.”
Vendor-funded meals and other giveaways.</p>
              <p>Nothing about financial conflicts of interest in working with vendors and publishers. Nothing
about balancing license restrictions and community needs.</p>
              <p>I’ve had issues with upper management regarding requests to provide access beyond the scope
of contracts with vendors. The code does not address ethical practice regarding legal
agreements and/or laws.</p>
              <p>I find some vendors to be unethical (though legal) in the way they conduct their business yet the
popularity of their product prohibits me from ceasing to do business with them.</p>
              <p>Sharing [database or journal] pricing with other libraries. Vendors like to keep this quiet,...this
[makes it] difficult [since] if we were more aware of pricing, then we might be able to negotiate
[more effectively].</p>
              <p>This may be minor, but in filling interlibrary loan requests, I have downloaded and sent original
publisher PDFs instead of printing, scanning, and emailing a PDF copy. I do this, but fear it will
come back to me at some point.</p>
              <p>The difficulties in providing information that people need and/or want but staying within the
copyright law is a sticky situation.</p>
              <p>My work involves extensive use of multimedia. I think the ethical guidelines could be more
explicit in covering legal and contractual obligations with regard to use of information and other
resources.</p>
              <p>I serve as my organization’s copyright compliance officer...adhering to legal standards for
distributing information should be a professional obligation for all health librarians, and this is
[not] explicit in the Code of Ethics.</p>
              <p>Nonprofits not paying copyright fees because they aren’t “making money.” Systematic abuse of
faculty and students in distributing print copies of journal articles (yes still in print).</p>
              <p>Nothing about balancing license restrictions and community needs.</p>
              <p>Unrelated to the appropriate content for MLA ethics statement, such as workplace bullying and
discrimination.</p>
              <p>Those involving recruitment/retention/treatment of professional and paraprofessional
employees— particularly when a senior employee is involved.</p>
              <p>Managing staff that do not have good work ethics and call in sick frequently because they feel
blah...but I’m not sure how you would address that.</p>
              <p>Hiring/firing/funding ethics; hiring under presumed employment circumstances then changing
the rules during that employment despite my seeking out specifics prior to hiring a position. Very
difficult. I still think we did the wrong things.</p>
              <p>Would be useful to have a clause which would allow us to refuse providing information in cases where
giving that information would lead to breaking the law (when this fact is known to us, of course).
[Flave seen] incredible amount of unprofessional behaviors &amp; communication styles ...this is a
real challenge...also, MLA needs to address differences [between] individuals [in] major

yet negatively comment &amp; expect MLA to advocate for [them]...challenges ethics of sharing my

              <p>The dilemma of prioritizing competing requests—urgency, significance of the problem, status of
the requestor (e.g., faculty vs student) can all contribute to this dilemma.</p>
              <p>The problems come when serving more than one client base, with different needs.</p>
              <p>Some healthcare professionals feel that their concerns take precedence over others; we aim to

Sometimes keeping questions asked completely confidential (no tracking, etc.), actually works
against [helping] your institution...where you are trying to identify “trends,” gaps in knowledge,
or just in “ pushing” out information.</p>
              <p>Helping individuals identify potential research partners while maintaining patron
confidentiality— can be done but education on this issue may need to addressed by MLA.</p>

              <p>Knowing that patron could use help, but due to policy of organization not offering it.</p>
              <p>I understand it is difficult to accommodate all variations of institutions guidelines in respect to
vendors; however, something more than what is stated in the ethics list would be beneficial.
[Working] with an attorney, [can be] asked for information that may show [doctor’s] negligence. I
have some loyalty to health professions, &amp; dislike potential malpractice issues. Fortunately,
never asked to work both sides of same incident.</p>
              <p>Should mention something about the librarian remaining neutral. For instance, if a researcher
wants to prove [some things with which librarian] disagrees, must [still] help the patron without

              <p>Had lawyers in a lawsuit &amp; another one defending the same case; I knew they were going at it
differently but I could not tell either side what the other wanted. I also had to recuse myself from
the second and refer them to another library.</p>
              <p>On occasion there will be a non-medical patron (i.e., lay person), who tries to push the
boundaries of what [information we] can provide, or as is usually the case, an opinion...about
diagnosis and treatment and not just the information.</p>

teaching them about their condition, because we are not dr.s or nurses, but they want us to

              <p>Installation of security cameras in areas where librarian conducts reference.</p>
              <p>I felt unsafe around a patron once and called security rather than satisfy his information need. I
have also called security to eject a patron who was interfering with other patrons.</p>

              <p>Being offered tips by grateful patrons.</p>
              <p>The standards should mention something about the librarian remaining neutral...the librarian
must help the patron without letting her own biases in. This topic is frequently covered in public
librarianship but less so in medical.</p>

treatment...We provide them with information they request, but feel compelled to [also]
provide...other science-based information.</p>

work for them, rather than leading them to resources.</p>
              <p>Parents doing children’s assignments.</p>
              <p>What about something to address the management/handling of money?
Perhaps, the principles about upholding the ideals and advancing the knowledge of the
profession should be revised to address promoting the library’s value to administrators and
other departments.</p>
              <p>Perhaps something about cultural diversity should be included.</p>
              <p>One of my challenges has been that throughout my career I have always had more than one
“ boss” or institution to answer to. It has not been easy to balance the requirements and
expectations of both, while maintaining my own integrity.</p>

budgetary restraints where funds are not available to purchase databases necessary for quality,

■ Should add more in addition to integrity and respect...how about adding honesty, fairness, and

the survey with a representative sample of members
other than the members of the MLA Ethical Aware­
ness Task Force. Also, as noted in the "Methods"
section, it was necessary to revise the responses to Q9
(respondents' type of library or work setting) to
capture responses that were incorrectly included in
the "Other" category responses.
Member comments on the survey about some code
principles that they found to be unimportant (Q3) or
particularly difficult or challenging to follow (Q7) and
any encounters they had had with ethical challenges
not addressed by the MLA code (Q8) together suggest
that these members find the code to be irrelevant to
their daily practice (for example, one respondent
working in a smaller library thought the location of a
checked-out item in this setting sometimes can be
revealed), that influencing society about the value
of health information is beyond the reach of the
librarians, or that licensing restrictions (including lack
of funding) limit the ability to provide acceptable
levels of access to information for all. Other
commenters thought the MLA code principles were not
unique to the profession, that their institutions' ethical
guidelines adequately covered their situations, or that
individual code principles were too vague. Some
thought that stronger advocacy for the value of our
profession should be included in the code. On the
other hand, a number of the respondents commented
that the code does a good job of upholding our values
as a profession and reminds us of important ideals
and our fundamental relationship with our clients.</p>
              <p>For those who found the principles outlined in the
code to be too generic, perhaps another type of ethical
guidance document, in addition to the code, would be
helpful. As the preface to the MLA Code of Ethics
makes clear, its principles "are expressed in broad
statements to guide ethical decision making. These
statements provide a framework; they cannot and do
not dictate conduct to cover particular situations" [1],
A manual of ethical advice for everyday situations in
the health science library setting might be a way to
offer more guidance. That type of practical instruction
could also be useful in helping overcome the
challenges that some respondents reported with some
code principles; for example, the frustration a number
of commenters expressed about not being able to
provide their users with the most current and
up-todate information due to budget constraints or
insufficient staff. Others noted a lack of understand­
ing by their institutions' leaders about copyright
policy, licensing restrictions, vendor gifts, or financial
conflicts of interest. These and other areas where
some survey participants would like guidance could
be addressed outside the code in an accompanying
resource. For example, a short manual of practical
advice could include other frequently mentioned
dilemmas like dealing ethically with electronic licens­
ing negotiations and restrictions and explaining these
to others, and how to ethically and effectively
advocate for the value of our profession.</p>
              <p>In a world of changing and conflicting values,
and increasing concern for the privacy of personal
information, including health information, librarians
are key torch bearers for the ethical principles and
standards needed to ensure that our professional
services and information resources will lead to
wellinformed decisions. The MLA Code of Ethics for Health
Sciences Librarianship is a valuable tool to help with
our profession's ethical challenges and can be used to
help guide decision making, policy development, and
services, but it remains an underutilized resource.</p>
              <p>Perhaps by adding a supplementary resource to the
code, with suggestions on how to deal with some of
the more ethically challenging situations reported by
this survey's respondents, MLA members will want to
turn to the code not only to reconfirm our ethical
principles and values, but also, perhaps more fre­
quently, as a resource for practical professional ethical
advice.
