      <abstract>
        <p>Using the library and information science journals 2003-2012 in Nanjing University's Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index as data sources, the paper reveals the citation structure implied in these journals by applying social network analysis. Results show that, first, journal knowledge transfer activity in library and information science is frequent, and both the level of knowledge and discipline integration as well as the knowledge gap influenced knowledge transfer activity. According to the out-degree and in-degree, journals can be divided into three kinds. Second, based on professional bias and citation frequency, the knowledge transfer network can be divided into four blocks. With the change of discipline capacity and knowledge gap among journals, the “core-periphery” structure of the knowledge transfer network is getting weaker．Finally, regions of the knowledge transfer network evolved from a “weak-weak” subgroup to a “strong-weak” subgroup or a “weakstrong” subgroup，and then move to a “strong-strong” subgroup.</p>

      <p>of information and communication, and to trace the
mechanisms underlying informational behavior from this
insight (Hjørland and Albrechtsen 1995). At present,
research advances in domain analysis come from many
researchers (Smiraglia 2012; Tennis 2003). In the
perception of these researchers, the concept of domain refers
to a field of knowledge, activity, or interest in which
certain knowledge is marked with defined limits and whose
professionals or groups are entangled both in thought
and in language, generating differentiated thought and
interpretations (Freitas et al. 2012). The objects of domain
analysis not only involve the entire science but also a
specific discipline. For example, López-Huertas and Jiménez
Contreras (2004) conducted research to give an initial
appraisal of research activity in Spain surrounding
“knowledge organization” from 1992-2001 by the method of
DA. And, more remarkable, De la Moneda Corrochano,
López-Huertas, and Jiménez-Contreras (2013) conducted
a similar study to analyze Spanish research in knowledge
organization from 2002 to 2010 with the method of DA.</p>
      <p>When assessing scientific output in a special field, the
most usual approach is to collect the literature. Literature
is an essential source of information in scientific
research. The reason why human knowledge can be passed
on for generations mainly lies in the citation practices in
scientific literature, where old literature transfers
intelligence into new literature. The references or citations
between scientific literatures not only reveal the
accumulation, continuity and succession of scientific knowledge
but also indicate the presence of knowledge transfer.
Thus it is feasible and meaningful to make use of the
citation relationship to study knowledge transfer. In
scientific research, scholars tend to take academic journals as
the first choice to publish their newfound knowledge,
laws, theories, or methods. Because of the short diffusion
cycle, huge capacity and other reasons unmentioned,
academic journals are gradually becoming the major agents
of scientific knowledge transfer. Therefore, to better
study the feature and pattern of knowledge transfer in the
field of library and information science in China, we chose
the citation network of journals in library and
information science as our research object.</p>
      <p>In China, the discipline of library and information
science is often regarded as two disciplines. Those two
disciplines share dissimilarities as well as commonalities, so
an interesting question is how knowledge in these two
disciplines is transferred from one to the other. Citation
can be seen as a kind of knowledge transfer. Human
knowledge can be passed on for generations through
citations in and between scientific literatures. What’s more, a
ten-year period is long enough to allow us to observe
some of the evolution of one subject. Knowledge
organization is a field whose boundaries are not always
clearly defined; rather, it stands as a broad concept.
Therefore we believe the activity of knowledge transfer is
included in the domain of knowledge organization.
Moreover, the purpose of knowledge organization is to
accelerate knowledge communication as well as
knowledge innovation, and knowledge transfer is a good way to
achieve knowledge communication and knowledge
innovation. This kind of study can help to accelerate
knowledge communication and knowledge organization as well
as the development of library and information science.</p>
      <p>The study of the history of the citation relationship can
be traced back to the occurrence of concepts like citation
identity and citation image. After White (1998, 2001)
proposed citation image and citation identity, many scholars
became committed to similar research.
BonnevieNebelong and Frandsen (2006) introduced the concepts of
citation image and citation identity to the process of
journal assessment and analysis and then put forward the
notions of journal citation image and journal citation identity.
Since then, related research studying journals has sprung
up; but it has been found that most studies still concentrate
on citation itself, such as citation indicators, citation
characteristics, and citation styles (Bonnevie-Nebelong 2006;
Fangli 2013) but pay little attention to the knowledge
transfer and knowledge communication behind the
journalciting activity. In fact, citation image and citation identity
can be regarded as two aspects of the citation relationship;
only when the two are combined can we see the panorama
of citation and further understand the knowledge transfer
process and the growing and maturing of a subject
revealed in a citation network. By building journal citation
networks at different times and applying social network
analysis (SNA), we investigate the changes in the centrality
and the roles of citation networks of journals in library
and information science in China at different times to dig
deeper into the knowledge transfer pattern and traits of
this field. We also utilize the associations generated by
journal citation networks to calculate the knowledge
transfer ratio of journals in library and information science in
China to professionally similar journals and draw
corresponding knowledge maps. We then summarize the pattern
of journal knowledge transfer in library and information
science in China in the hope of providing a basis for the
formulation of corresponding knowledge transfer policy in
this field.</p>
      <p>In this article we present a systematic and visual
domain analysis of the LIS field in China in terms of
citation networks to explore the knowledge transfer
evolution of this knowledge domain over time. The objectives
of this study are:
– to examine the character of journals involved in the
field of LIS in China in terms of knowledge input and
output;
– to study the block traits of journal knowledge transfer
networks for identifying the knowledge transfer
evolution of the field of LIS in China; and,
– to detect the journal knowledge transfer model of the</p>
      <p>LIS field in China.
2.0 Data and methods</p>
      <sec id="1-1">
        <title>2.1 Data At present there are approximately 70 journals in library and information science in China, and there is no consen</title>

sus on which journals are the core periodical group in this
field. The relatively authoritative journals are what have
been included in Nanjing University’s Chinese Social Sciences
Citation Index (CSSCI), and these are also the criteria used
by most colleges and scientific research institutions to
evaluate talent. So based on CSSCI, we chose 16 journals
as the objects of study (see Table 1, we use the
abbreviatied journal titles in the tables and figures that follow).
Meanwhile, we take the reference database in CSSCI as a
data source to retrieve the citation data of these 16
journals. To obtain a better grasp on the knowledge transfer
condition in library and information science, we set a
relatively long study period (2003-2012) out of the
consideration that a long study period would reveal more accurately
the variation of citation patterns in library and information
science, from which we can find the traits of knowledge
transfer. At the same time, to eliminate the impact of
negative factors, our research divides the data into two phases:
2003-2007 and 2008-2012, so the five-year data can more
accurately show the citation relationships of journals.</p>
        <p>The initial data set from the database is more than
25000, and the research employs our self-made VBA
program to calculate how many times the journals are
cross-cited and construct a journal cross-citation matrix.
More details are shown in Figures and 2. The rows in the
matrix are the citing journals, and the columns are the
cited journals. The establishment of the journals’ citation
matrix is also an embodiment of mutual knowledge
transfer to some extent. When journal cross-citation is
drawn in a network chart, a directed weight map forms.
In this map, network nodes represent journals; sides
represent the citation and reference relationship between the
journals; the weight of each side represents the citation
and reference frequency; the direction of the sides points
from citing journals to the cited journals. In the figure,
citation relationship is basically from citing journals to the
cited journals, while the knowledge flow is just the
opposite. However, the differences of citation frequency
determine the differences of the knowledge transfer level.
The more times papers are cited, the more knowledge
flows out, and vice versa.</p>

        <title>2.2 Research methodology</title>
        <p>Social network analysis (SNA) is a set of theories and
methods which can analyze the structure and properties of
various relations in the social network. It mainly analyzes
the relation schema among actors and this method has
been proved to be valid when applied to research on
citation relationships (Yuanyuan and Qinghua 2008). We use
SNA to systematically analyze the citation network of
journals in library and information science in China; this
mainly involves two levels, the properties of the whole
network and the roles and locations of network nodes.
This process would be conducted using UCINET’s
network analysis tools. Specifically, the process consists of the
aspects described below.</p>
        <sec id="1-2-1">
          <title>2.2.1 Centrality analysis</title>
          <p>Centrality measures power in the network. We can
measure with the indexes of centrality and central potential.
Centrality measures the extent to which members are in
the network’s center; the degree of centrality is the most
commonly used and in the topology network it
represents the number of members who are directly
connected to the chosen member while in the weighted
network it represents the sum of edge weights directly
connected to this member. Central potential measures the
centralized degree of the whole network; the higher the
central potential is the more concentrated the internet
connections are on fewer nodes (Fengchao and Rongking
2013). Because we are investigating a directed network,
both centrality and central potential can be divided into
out-degree and in-degree.</p>

        <sec id="1-2-2">
          <title>2.2.2 Block model analysis</title>
          <p>The notion of location is an essential notion which
discusses the analysis of network structure. It mainly
describes the location of nodes in the network and the
interaction they have with other nodes. Block model analysis
places similar nodes in a block according to equivalence in
structure in order to simplify the complicated relationship
between network nodes into the relationship between
blocks (Liu 2009). Block model analysis usually consists of
two-sided information: a) the nodes in the network which
are divided into specific subsets are the locations; b) for
each pair of locations, the existence or vacancy of links
within or between locations reveals the relationship. Block
models can simplify the complicated networks and then
explain the network structure (Lin 2009). We can use the
CONCOR program in the software UNINET to analyze
the block model and the analysis result is the density of
block models. We can further simplify the results of the
block model into a matrix so as to briefly describe the
block features of network structure.
3.0 Results and Analysis</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
      <sec id="1-3">
        <title>3.1 The characteristics of journals</title>
        <p>We use the UCINET software to calculate the centrality of
the journal citation network in library and information
science in China during the periods of 2003-2007 and
20082012. The exact results are shown in Figures 1 and 2.</p>
        <p>In Figures 1 and 2, in-degree represents knowledge
input, and out-degree represents knowledge output.</p>
        <p>From the perspective of knowledge output, Journal of
Library Science in China has always been in the leading
position and reveals the professional strength of Chinese
academic journals of library science. As a significant
knowledge source in the field of library and information
science, Journal of Library Science in China has provided
crucial technical support for the evolution of library and
information science and development of other journals.</p>
        <p>Comparing Figure 1 with Figure 2, we can find that
Library and Information Service gradually dominates
knowledge output because of its huge number of published
papers but also its strong ability to absorb knowledge.
Library and Information Service is both an essential knowledge
output and vital for knowledge absorption in the field of
library and information science, thus it is the core and the
bond in the whole knowledge transfer process of library
and information science. We can also conclude that each
journal’s different numerical values of out-degree and
indegree give rise to the knowledge potential difference. By
the dimension of knowledge potential difference, we can
divide the journals in library and information science into
three categories: knowledge output-based journals,
knowledge-sucking journals and knowledge balanced journals.</p>
        <p>Journal of Library Science, Journal of the China Society for
Scientific and Technical Information, Journal of Academic Libraries,
and New Technology of Library and Information Service are all
knowledge output-based journals; they output more
knowledge than they input. This demonstrates their
authority in the field of library and information science. As
knowledge output-based journals, they usually publish the
most cutting-edge or up-to-date articles in aspects such as
research contents and research methods. In general,
highlevel research achievements will have more opportunities
to be cited. However, Information Science, Journal of
Information, Information and Documentation Service, Library Work and
Study, and Library Tribune have maintained their positions
as knowledge absorbers during the period 2003-2012. As
knowledge-sucking journals, they publish research results,
which take the research achievements in knowledge
output-based journals much further and have relatively
narrower intellectual vanity and better relative independence
(closure); so it also means less impact on other journals.</p>
        <p>Document, Information &amp; Knowledge, Library Journal, Library
and Information Service, and Library &amp; Information are
viewed as equation-type journals for the positive and
negative value of their potential difference changes little.</p>
        <p>Apart from Library Journal, Document, Information &amp;
Knowledge, Library and Information Service, and Library &amp;
Information involve both the disciplines of library science and
informatics judging from their names. Knowledge in the
field of library and information science realizes their
intersection and mutual complementation and referencing
in the subgroups of these journals. It is their positive
interactions that lead other journals to advocate this field’s
development. There also exist some journals whose types
vary a lot, such as Library Theory and Practice, Library and
Library and Information Studies: Theory &amp; Application. Library
Theory and Practice changes from a knowledge-sucking
journal into a knowledge output-based journal; Library
turns from a knowledge balanced journal into a
knowledge-sucking journal; Library and Information Studies: Theory
&amp; Application varies from a knowledge output-based
journal into a knowledge-sucking journal. After analysis,
we find that it is perhaps related to the forwardness,
creativity and disciplinary expansibility of the published
articles. These journals should not only keep their
advantages of academic styles and traits, but also publish more
articles that are forward-looking and that have discipline
integration in order to expand their influence.</p>
        <p>To sum up, the gap between knowledge strength and
discipline integration causes the relatively big difference
in each journal’s status in the knowledge transfer
network. Journals with strong knowledge strength and
discipline integration output knowledge constantly and absorb

2003 to 2007

2008 to 2012
external knowledge to maintain their own strength. But
journals with weak knowledge strength and discipline
integration mainly gain resources by absorbing knowledge;
because the field of articles they publish is narrow and
not forward-looking, these journals do not have much
progress in their knowledge output ability.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="1-4">
        <title>3.2 The blocks’ traits in the knowledge transfer network</title>
        <p>When establishing the cross-citation matrix in journals,
we will find the relationship between knowledge output
and knowledge absorption in journals of library and
information science. We use the CONCOR procedure in
UCINET to produce the partitioning results of the
journal cross-citation knowledge transfer network during the
periods of 2003-2007 and 2008-2012. Considering that
we are studying the structural equivalence of citing and
cited activity between journals, we take no account of
journals’ self-citation, which means that there is no value
of diagonal lines in the calculating process. The results
are shown in Figures 3 and 4; Tables 2 and 3 are
respectively the patch density matrix in the periods of
20032007 and 2008-2012 (because we are studying weighted
networks, the density is more than 1.)</p>

After comparing the density of block matrix tables with
that of the cross-citation network during the two periods,
we can simplify the figures above into the following
matrices.
According to Figures 3 and 4, we find that the knowledge
transfer networks of cross-citation in journals during
2003-2006 and 2008-2012 are both divided into 4 blocks.</p>
        <p>Based on the relationship between blocks, we can divide
the blocks into a core block, a strong edge block, a weak
edge block and a periphery block (Gao X et al.2011).</p>
        <p>According to Figures 3 and 4, the networks of journal
cross-citation knowledge transfer during periods of
20032007 and 2008-2012 are clustered based on both
professional bias and citation frequency. From the aspect of
professional bias, we divide the journals into library science
journals and informatics journals, and then further divide
them based on citation condition, although there also exist
exceptional cases. For instance, judging from their names,
Information and Documentation Services and Journal of Library
Science in China in Figure 3 should belong to informatics
and library science respectively, the partitioning results are
just the opposite; this phenomenon is principally due to
the professional bias of articles in the two journals.</p>
        <p>Combining the four tables, our research points to
further analysis. From 2003 to 2007, the first block including
Journal of Library Science in China and Journal of Academic
Libraries belongs to the core block of the network. It outputs
knowledge to the second and third block of informatics
and the fourth block of library science, while it sucks
knowledge merely through its interior communication.</p>
        <p>From this we can see its core status. From 2003 to 2007,
informatics had just sprung up and was not mature, so it
was eager to refer to its brother disciplines and suck
knowledge to develop itself. It well explains why journals
in block 1 transfer large sums of knowledge to the journals
in blocks 2 and 3. Block 2 consists of Journal of The China
Society for Scientific and Technical Information, New Technology of
Library and Information Service and other journals of
informatics. Block 2 is not only closely tied to journals in block
1, but also transfers knowledge to informatics journals in
the third block. So the second block is a strong-edge block.</p>
        <p>Journal of Information and Information and Documentation
Services are in block 3, and these journals mainly suck
knowledge from others and have tight connections with the core
block and the strong edge block; these journals belong to a
weak-edge block. The fourth block contains many library
science journals such as Library Tribune and Library Journal,
and this block only absorbs knowledge of its own
discipline and never communicates with informatics journals.</p>
        <p>So block 4 belongs to a periphery block.</p>
        <p>From 2008 to 2012, the value of R2 of the block model
for the journal citation knowledge transfer network
increased to 0.462 from 0.418; the number of nodes which
have similar structure in the network decreased slightly and
the blocks’ traits became more and more obvious. During
that period, Journal of Library Science in China, Journal of The
China Society for Scientific and Technical Information, and New
Technology of Library and Information Service were assigned to
the same block. It outputs knowledge to the second block,
to which the journals of informatics belong, and the third
block where the journals of library science are, respectively.</p>
        <p>Thus, it becomes the core block of the knowledge transfer
network at this time. However, the second block includes a
lot of journals of informatics. It not only maintains close
relationship with the core block, but also outputs
knowledge to the third block where the journals of library
science are. Thus, it is called a strong-edge block. Going
further, the journals in the two blocks all belong to
informatics, excluding Journal of Library Science in China. This
indicates that the journals of informatics act as the knowledge
source of library science and informatics. From 2008 to
2012, the development of science and the progress in
computer technology provide an opportunity for the study
of informatics; informatics becomes mature as a science
gradually, getting rid of the restraints of the library science
knowledge and developing into a subject which needs
strong theory and practice. But after long term
development of library science, its research approaches a
bottleneck. So it needs to refer to the related theories, methods,
and technology in informatics urgently to make a
breakthrough. Thus, it heavily cites related studies of
informatics. But as the leading journal in the field of library science,
Journal of Library Science in China also follows the needs of
the subject’s development and carries a lot of articles
which have a strong fusion of disciplines; its professional
bias inclines to informatics science gradually. That’s why it
is assigned to the same block with the other two
journals of informatics. Journals in the third block not only
have a close relationship with core block journals and
strong-edge block journals, but also absorb substantial
knowledge in the fourth block. Knowledge exchanging
activities are frequent. Thus, it is called a weak-edge block.</p>
        <p>However, the fourth block where a lot of journals of
library science are, just transfers knowledge from the
weakedge block. So it is isolated gradually and belongs to the
periphery block.</p>
        <p>According to the matrix of the journal cross-citation
knowledge transfer network during the periods of
20032007 and 2008-2012, we can draw the related simplified
diagram which is shown in Figure 5.</p>
        <p>From Figure 5, we find that from 2003 to 2007, the
blocks’ traits in the journal cross-citation knowledge
transfer network are obvious and the core-periphery
structure whose core is the first block is formed. Further
analysis reveals that journals in block 1 and block 4 are
library science journals, while those in block 2 and block 3
are informatics journals. During this period, library
science has more professional strength and develops quickly.</p>
        <p>The professional strength of informatics is comparatively
relatively weaker. In order to develop and grow,
knowledge transfer and knowledge communication within
informatics can no longer satisfy the need. So they seek
large quantities of cutting-edge and essential knowledge
in library science journals. For specific performance,
informatics journals in block 2 and block 3 absorb
knowledge in block 1, where most authoritative journals in
library science lie. At this time, block 1 can be viewed as
the knowledge source of the whole knowledge transfer
network and effectively annexes the knowledge authority
status in the network. According to the simplified block
figure of the knowledge transfer network during the
period of 2008 to 2012, the status and roles of blocks 2 and
1 gradually converge, and the traits of the core-periphery
structure of the journals’ network transfer network wear
off. During this time, the development of technology,
especially the growth of computer technology, offers
further opportunities for informatics to advance. The
professional power of the subject strengthens. On the
contrary, library science comes across adversity and
traditional research finds it hard to meet the requirements of
a new epoch. At this moment, it is imperative for it to

ference the advanced technologies and research methods
in informatics in order to make a breakthrough. Thus
blocks 1 and 2 where informatics journals lie can be
regarded as the knowledge source of the entire knowledge
transfer network. In sum, with the alternations of the
professional strengths of the disciplines, the knowledge
gap and the interactive model among journals changes
with it. Thus the hierarchical structure of the knowledge
transfer network of cross-citation in library and
information science journals evolves towards a fuzzy core
structure and a distinct periphery structure.
4.0 Discussion: the analysis of the pattern of
journal knowledge transfer in library and
information science
According to the structure of the network of journal
knowledge transfer in library and information science, the
knowledge power and discipline integration force of a
journal determine their intensity of knowledge supply and
demand and further determine their roles in the network;
the gap between the professional powers of the journals’
subjects decides their choice of the objects of knowledge
supply and demand, and further decides the interactive
model of knowledge transfer. According to the block traits
of the network of journal knowledge transfer in library
and information science, we find that the knowledge
transfer network of the two periods of 2003-2007 and
20082012 can both be divided into four blocks, and these four
blocks are all divided by the two dimensions of
professional bias and citation frequency. To be specific, journals
in two blocks belong to library science and journals in the
other two blocks belong to informatics. At the same time,
the journals in the same discipline are divided into two
blocks by reference conditions. Thus the relationships
between blocks are of two kinds, which are respectively the
professionally close block and professionally distant block.</p>
        <p>We set blocks as the X-axis and the power of
professionally close blocks as the Y-axis; knowledge power increases
with the direction of the arrow. By recognizing the traits
of knowledge input and output among the blocks, we
construct the pattern of journal knowledge transfer in library
and information science. The detailed process is shown in</p>
        <p>Figure 6.</p>
        <p>According to Figure 4, when the power of journals in
a certain block and its professionally close block are
comparatively weak, that is to say, the power of the discipline
where the two blocks’ journals lie is weak, their
knowledge gap is narrow; thus they can be viewed as
weakweak subgroups. In this situation, the blocks have to take
advantage of the convenience of their close disciplines
and output knowledge to the professionally close blocks
with a platform of citing activity. In order to maintain
their own power, this process will merely be realized by
knowledge transfer within the blocks. At the same time,
for their own development as well as that of the whole
discipline, journals in this block have to overcome
professional restrictions and cite articles from professionally
distant journals to absorb knowledge needed from
professionally distant blocks whose professional power is
stronger in order to promote their knowledge power.</p>
        <p>During the period of 2003 to 2007, informatics journals
reveal this condition and block 2 is a typical example.
According to Figure 3, it can be seen clearly that block 2 is
outputting knowledge to block 3, which is professionally
close. While the self-communication in block 2 is
frequent and it sucks knowledge from the professionally
distant block, block 1, whose disciplinary power is stronger
in order to promote its own power.</p>
        <p>As time goes on, if the knowledge transfer activity and
methods above promote the development of journals in
the block, while the power of professionally close blocks
has little promotion and remains relatively weak, the gap
between the block and its professionally close block further
widens. Thus this can be viewed as a strong-weak
subgroup. At this time, the block improves itself by interior
knowledge transfer activity and outputs large quantities of
knowledge to professionally close blocks. This shows that
journals in the block develop well and have already formed
superior academic strengths and academic styles; they have
relatively independent knowledge transfer patterns. In this
condition, it has already overcome its professional
restrictions and the professionally distant blocks make full use of
citations to make knowledge connections with it. The
power of the discipline the journals lie in is the main factor
affecting the pattern of knowledge transfer. From 2003 to
2007, journals in block 1 belong to this condition. The
technical power of block 1 far surpasses that of its
professionally close block, block 4; block 1 primarily
communicates and transfers knowledge with professionally distant
blocks. This is specifically expressed as the phenomenon
that journals in block 2 and block 3 cite mass information
in block 1. So we can deduce that block 1 is in the
knowledge authority status in the journal cross-citation
knowledge transfer network.</p>
        <p>If the knowledge power of a block professionally
close to a certain other block rises fast while its own
knowledge strength is still in a bad situation, that is to say,
the knowledge potential difference is big, these blocks
make up the weak-strong subgroup. In this condition, the
block will make full use of the advantage of close
professions and suck knowledge from professionally close
blocks by citation. However, the knowledge supplied by
professionally close blocks is limited in the weak-strong
subgroup and its needs cannot be fully met. So the block
would absorb mass knowledge from professionally
distant blocks in order to satisfy its needs and gain
improvements at the same time. In this case, knowledge
demand and the discipline’s development are the main
factors affecting knowledge transfer. The blocks where
journals of library science lie belong to this subgroup.</p>
        <p>If the power of the discipline where the journals of the
block lie strengthens a lot, the knowledge power of the
block and that of its professionally close block will also
increase. So the knowledge potential difference narrows and
these blocks form the strong-strong subgroup. At this
time, the block will use the advantage of close professions
to transfer knowledge to professionally distant blocks by
discipline superiority. Different from the strong-weak
subgroup, where a certain block occupies knowledge authority
status, the roles and status of a certain block and its
professionally close block in the strong-strong subgroup
gradually converge, so cohesion subgroups of knowledge
transfer who have favorable interaction form. Informatics
journals in blocks 2 and 3 during the period of 2008 to
2012 belong to this kind of subgroup.
We used the cross-citation data of journals in library and
information science in CSSCI to analyze the network
structure and pattern of knowledge transfer network in
library and information science based on journal
crosscitation. And we reach the following conclusions.</p>
        <p>From the aspect of the structure of the journal
crosscitation knowledge transfer network in library and
information science in China, we can see that journals’
knowledge transfer activity is frequent. The knowledge
strength, the force of discipline integration and the
knowledge gap between journals all affect the interactive
model of knowledge transfer. From the out-degree and
in-degree of the nodes in the network, journals in library
and information science can be divided into knowledge
output-based journals, knowledge sucking journals, and
knowledge balanced journals. Knowledge output-based
journals usually publish plentiful articles with hot topics
by strong pioneers so the chances for them to be cited
are abundant and their knowledge power and discipline
integration are superior. Articles in knowledge-sucking
journals are less specialized and have little impact on
other journals. Knowledge-balanced journals are always
the junctions of knowledge; they realize the supplement
and reference of discipline knowledge and their active
interaction promotes the rapid development of disciplines.</p>
        <p>Comparing the data from 2003 to 2007 and that from
2008 to 2012, we find that these types of journals remain
relatively stable though small variations exist.</p>
        <p>According to the blocks’ traits in the journal
crosscitation knowledge transfer network in library and
information science in China, the websites during the periods
of 2003-2007 and 2008-2012 are all divided into four
blocks by professional bias and citations, which are
respectively the core block, the strong-edge block, the
weak-edge block and the periphery block. From 2003 to
2007, the power of library science was strong, so the
block where its authoritative journals lie was cited a lot
and effectively annexed the status of knowledge
authority. During this period, the network of journal
crosscitation knowledge transfer in library and information
science in China reveals the core-periphery structure.</p>
        <p>From 2008 to 2012, informatics developed rapidly and
library science got stuck. The block in which journals of
informatics lie replaced the core status of library science
and became the knowledge source in the field of library
and information science. During this time, the status and
roles of the two blocks where journals of informatics lie
gradually converged, and the core-periphery structure of
the entire network was weakened. This shows that with
the exchange of professional power the knowledge gap
and interactive model will change accordingly. Thus the
hierarchical structure of the knowledge transfer network
of cross-citation in library and information science
journals in China evolves towards a fuzzy core structure and a
distinct periphery structure.</p>
        <p>Based on the traits of nodes and blocks in the
network of journal cross-citation knowledge transfer in
library and information sciencein China, we construct the
pattern of its knowledge transfer. The knowledge
transfer activity of journals of library and information science
shows the evolving tendency from weak-weak subgroups
to weak-strong or strong-weak subgroups and finally into
strong-strong subgroups. The blocks should grasp their
own developing condition, and prompt the formation of
knowledge transfer cohesive subgroups which have good
interaction.</p>
        <p>At present, it is still a brand new idea to study the
process of knowledge transfer by cross-citation. It shares
many similarities with citation identity and citation image
so they can learn from each other. In this paper we have
tried to serve as a modest spur to induce someone to
come forward with other, related valuable contributions.</p>
        <p>We based our research on the citation environment of
CSSCI, so the results of analysis might have certain
limitations. We hope that follow-up research can show more
comprehensive, intuitional and dynamic journal
knowledge transfer activity by collecting more intact journals’
citation information in library and information science
and applying multiple analysis methods, so as to provide
more sufficient and valuable information for the
academic circle (periodicals circles, scholars, institutions, etc.)
of library and information science.</p>
