We present our semeiotic-inspired concept of information as 1 of 3 important elements in meaning creation,
the 2 other concepts being emotion and cognition. We
have the inner world (emotion); we have the outer world
(information); and cognition mediates between the two.
We analyze the 3 elements in relation to communication
and discuss the semeiotics-inspired communication
model, the Dynacom; then, we discuss our semeiotic
perspective on the meaning-creation process and communication with regard to a few, but central, elements in
library and information science, namely, the systemsoriented perspective, the user-oriented perspective, and
a domain-oriented perspective.
Thought is not necessarily connected with a brain. It appears in
the work of bees, of crystals, and throughout the purely physical
world; and one can no more deny that it is really there, than that
the colors, the shapes, etc., of objects are really there. Consistently adhere to that unwarrantable denial, and you will be
driven to some form of idealistic nominalism akin to Fichte’s.
Not only is thought in the organic world, but it develops there.
But as there cannot be a General without Instances embodying
it, so there cannot be thought without Signs. (Charles S. Peirce
Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmaticism. CP 4.551,
19061)

Introduction
The topics of information and knowledge lie at the root
of library and information science (LIS), both historically
and analytically. In particular, the academic community of
LIS, concerned with the organization and retrieval of information, has spent years discussing and clarifying the concepts of information and knowledge and the possible
relationship between them (Taylor, 1968; Belkin, Oddy, &amp;
Brooks, 1982; Buckland, 1991; Brier, 1996, 2004; Hjørland, 1997, 2004, 2007, 2009; Capurro &amp; Hjørland, 2003;
Cornelius, 2004). Variations emerge in the definitions
because of the background of the authors and the specific
aims that they pursue; we seem to be facing a labyrinth on
theoretical, methodological, and terminological grounds.
Generally, the concept of information is approached
through three general families of concepts: a systemsoriented view, a user-oriented view, and a domain-oriented
view (see Ingwersen &amp; Järvelin, 2005, for an excellent
review regarding the systems-oriented and user-oriented
views and Hjørland, 2004, regarding the domain-oriented
view). Thus, we may approach information as objective
entities handled by information systems, as objective entities that relate to work tasks, or as objective entities related
to domains. The notion of information as something independently observable is shared among LIS scholars; but
how information may be related to the complex processes
of interpretation, meaning making, and information need
(in short “knowledge”), is another matter. At the risk of
contributing further to the expansion of the labyrinth, we
will present a Peircean account of the concepts of information and knowledge, which we believe can be useful
within the field of LIS. We believe that information
science, in particular the fields concerned with organization and retrieval of information, struggle with a fragmented view of the information processes connected to the
areas of the information system itself, the human agents

interacting with the system, and the community that frames
the information behavior of individual users. We furthermore believe that the processes of knowledge organization
and information retrieval are synonymous with a complex
meaning-creation process in which emotional, informational, and cognitional signs blend together. Or, formulated
differently, information relates to an emotional level of
cognition and to deliberate, articulate knowledge structures. We will try to demonstrate that the concepts of
emotion, information, and knowledge can be understood
within the semeiotic and phenomenological framework of
the American polymath C. S. Peirce (1839–1914). Inspired
by Peirce, we see three elements make up the meaningcreation process: emotion, information, and cognition (in
accordance with Peirce, we use cognition synonymously
with knowledge; CP 6.605). To elaborate on this claim, we
define here what we believe to be the emotional sign, the
informational sign, and the cognitional sign seen from a
Peircean perspective. We show how they interact and how
they depend on each other. We discuss how emotion enters
into information and how emotion and information enter
into cognition. However, different kinds of emotions, information, and knowledge affect us differently, so we will
also look at the concepts of emotion, information, and
knowledge within the context of communication and
address the general conditions for communication and the
interpretational effect caused by any sign.
The overall focus and purpose of this article may therefore be condensed and formulated as follows. We demonstrate that, within a phenosemeiotic framework, the
concept of information is intricate, that it is related to
emotion and cognition, and that should be analyzed in
terms of sign systems within a process of communication.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the concept of information is relative to the perspective of inquiry, this being a
systems view, a user-oriented view, and a social view. We
demonstrate how information relates to emotion and
knowledge and vice versa, and finally, we demonstrate
how this semeiotically based analysis is relevant for information science, especially the relation among the the
systems-oriented perspective, the user-oriented perspective,
and a domain-oriented perspective. Our present work
follows the line of thought already set by Brier (1996,
2004, 2006, 2008) and Thellefsen, Brier, and Thellefsen
(2003); however, the important contribution is the phenosemiotical understanding of information.
The article is structured in the following way: First, we
outline emotion, information, and knowledge as understood
within Peirce’s framework of a scientific phenomenology,
this phenomenology being a fundamental conceptual condition. Second, we look at the Peircean semeiotic and give an
account of the concept of emotion in terms of the sign
trichotomy qualisign, sinsign, and legisign. Third, we
propose a semeiotically-inspired definition of information in
terms of the sign trichotomy of icon, index, and symbol and
at the same time we touch upon Peirce’s understanding of
cognition as knowledge involving the sign trichotomy

consisting of rheme, dicent sign, and argument. Fourth, we
place the emotional, informational, and cognitional sign
inside our model of communication (called the Dynacom),
which is a semeiotically-inspired communication model.
Fifth, we look at the communication effect caused by the
utterer upon an interpreter; we call this effect the significance effect. Sixth, we put forth a few conceivable consequences of our phenosemeiotic thoughts and concepts of
emotion, information, and knowledge for the field of LIS, by
approaching the information system, the information need,
and the social context determining the information need.
Hopefully, our efforts will point toward a more unified perspective that can accommodate different aspects of information, the cognition of the users, and the structuring power of
a social environment.
Emotion, Information and Knowledge
To understand the nature of the important concepts of
emotion, information, and knowledge; how they are related;
and what role they play in the meaning-creation process, we
define them in accordance with Peirce’s three categories of
consciousness found within his science of phenomenology:
Feeling or Primisense, Altersense, and Medisense, because
Peirce believed that human consciousness exemplifies all
three categories. As he wrote in a draft to the book A guess
at the riddle (c. 1890):
There are no other forms of consciousness except . . . Feeling,
Altersense, and Medisense. They form a sort of system. Feeling
is the momentarily present contents of consciousness. . . .
Altersense is the consciousness of a directly present other. . . .
Medisense is the . . . medium between Primisense and
Altersense leading from the former to the latter. It is the consciousness of a process bringing to mind. (CP 7.551)
However, before we begin defining the emotional, informational, and cognitional sign, we must clarify that we do not
deal with Peircean metaphysics here. We define the cognitional sign or, plainly, the knowledge sign without, for
example, discussing the relation between truth and reality,
and we do not take into account Peirce’s concept concerning
the fallibility of knowledge. We do not address Peirce’s
famous papers on cognition from the Journal of Speculative
Philosophy (1868–1869; CP 5.213–63; 5.264–317; 5.318–
57), nor do we focus on Peirce’s objective idealism or his
philosophy of mind–brain–body–world interaction, in
which there is mind within nature and nature within mind
(cf. CP 6.25; 1.316). Our interest is the structural relationship among emotion, information, and knowledge.
However, placing emotion as Firstness, the first of Peirce’s
three categories (see definition in the following text) in a
meaning-creation process does entail some metaphysics,
namely, that “ . . . an emotion of the mind is real, in the sense
that it exists in the mind whether we are distinctly conscious
of it or not. But it is not external because although it does not

depend on what we think about it, it does depend upon our
state of our thought about something.” (CP 7.339).
Information is real too and being placed in Secondness
(see definition in the following text); information is facts.
Consequently, information is both real and external. Let us
give an example: A given book is full of information independent of what you and I may feel or think about it. It may
just sit on the bookshelf not being read by anyone; still, it is
full of information. Imagine a twig broken in two by the
wind; even though no one hears the sound, the sound is still
information. Information at this level in cognition does not
entail interpretation. Now, this must imply that emotion is
internal and information is external, and it is only cognition
that can bridge the internal-external gap, and this inferential
process is the meaning-creation process. Let us now look at
the emotional, informational, and cognitional sign.
The Emotional Sign
The emotional sign (involving qualisign, sinsign, and
legisign) is related to Primisense and Firstness: it involves
characteristics of primisense; it is an experience of the
monadic quality of an immediate feeling; it is a simple and
noncompound quality; it is what it is in itself, by itself. It has
no relation to the possibility of something else; it has no
parts; it has no beginning, middle, or end. In “The list of
categories: A second essay” (c. 1894), Peirce asked his
reader to imagine the following example:
Imagine me to make and in a slumberous condition to have, a
vague, unobjectified, still less unsubjectified, sense of redness,
or of salt taste, or of an ache, or of a grief or joy, or of a
prolonged musical note. That would be, as nearly as possible, a
purely monadic state of feeling. (CP 1.303)
Consequently, the emotional sign is a state of feeling. As
such, it has not been manifested. Placing the emotional sign
in the first sign trichotomy also defines it as a sign qua sign.
Naming the first sign in the trichotomy an emotional
sign seems to be in agreement with Savan; in the article
“Peirce’s semiotic theory of emotion” (1981), he draws our
attention to the following:
Emotions do enter into the systematic explanation of behaviour.
Further, emotions can be justified, shown to be inappropriate,
disproportionately strong or weak, and so on. It is clear, I think,
that an emotion is a legisign. Like any legisign it exists through
its instances or replicas. Each such replica is an iconic sinsign
(p. 323)2.
If we take a slightly more psychological approach we
could, according to Peirce, relate the emotional sign to a

Sørensen, and Andersen (2008); and Thellefsen (2010) for discussions
about Peirce and the concept of emotion.
sensation.3 It holds the same characteristics as the definition of Firstness given earlier. Peirce gives the following
illustrative example:
. . . meaning by sensation the initiation of a state of feeling;—
for by feeling I mean nothing but sensation minus the attribution of it to any particular subject. In my use of words, when an
ear-splitting, soul-bursting locomotive whistle starts, there is a
sensation, which ceases when the screech has been going on for
any considerable fraction of a minute; and at the instant it stops
there is a second sensation. Between them there is a state of
feeling (CP 1.332).
Let us imagine that we are listening to a piece of music
composed by Bach. The sensation begins the moment the
music begins and stops when the music stops; what is in
between is feeling (conveyed by the qualisign); the particular and dominant kind of feeling (conveyed by the sinsign)
being one of, for example, happiness, sadness, nostalgia, etc.
(conveyed by the legisign), the whole process being subsumed by the emotional sign. This is the first part of any
process of meaning creation. However, for an emotion to
come into being requires information of some sort. Let us
therefore look at the informational sign.
The Informational Sign
The informational sign is related to Secondness and
altersense (consisting of icon, index, and symbol), which
means that it involves characteristics of them. Secondness or
altersense is the two-sided consciousness concerning force
and resistance; it is the clash between ego and nonego; it is
experience including the experience of resistance from the
object world, where we get to know facts, and facts are
information simply and solely. The fact that a door is hard
and heavy occurs to us only when we put our shoulder
against the door trying to force it open. Peirce noted in
“Pragmatism, fragment 2” (c. 1910), how:
Standing on the outside of a door that is slightly ajar, you put
your hand upon the knob to open and enter it. You experience an
unseen, silent resistance. You put your shoulder against the door
and, gathering your forces, put forth a tremendous effort. Effort
supposes resistance. Where there is no effort there is no

We are aware of the work concerning emotions and feelings performed
by Kuhlthau (see, e.g., Kuhlthau, 1991) in relation to the informationseeking process (ISP). However, the concept of emotion that we try to put
to use in our theory of the meaning-creation process follows the metaphysical conditions given by Peirce. Hence, this concept of emotion is understood within the realm of evolution; therefore, it is dynamic, like the
meaning-creation process into which it enters. As Peirce writes: “ . . . an
emotion of the mind is real, in the sense that it exists in the mind whether
we are distinctly conscious of it or not. But it is not external because
although it does not depend on what we think about it, it does depend upon
our state of our thought about something” (CP 7.339). We believe Kuhlthau’s ISP model follows an unclear common-sense discourse both in relation
to the development of ISP itself, and in particular in relation to the interdependencies of the concepts “feelings,” “thoughts,” and “actions.”

resistance, where there is no resistance there is no effort either
in this world or any of the worlds of possibility. (CP 1.320)
Naming the second sign of the trichotomy the informational sign means that information in this semeioticallyinspired perspective can either be iconic, indexical, or
symbolic. It can be similar to, it can point to, or it can
refer to by habit or convention. It is important to note that
information, when being defined as nonego and iconic,
indexical, or symbolic, represents a relation between a
representamen, which is a sign, and its dynamical object,
which is reality. As such, there is no human interpretation
taking place at this level. Information just is, and it is
emotion that gives information its particular quality, its
tinge, tone, or flavor, if you will.
We are constantly being bombarded with information.
However, only a small fraction of that information carries
any significance to us. Peirce used a splendid metaphor to
illustrate this point. He imagines consciousness as a bottomless lake, the surface of which (understood as selfconsciousness) is constantly bombarded with percepts
(information):
Consciousness is like a bottomless lake in which ideas are
suspended at different depths. Indeed, these ideas themselves
constitute the very medium of consciousness itself. Percepts
alone are uncovered by the medium. We must imagine that there
is a continual fall of rain upon the lake; which images the
constant inflow of percepts in experience. All ideas other than
percepts are more or less deep, and we may conceive that there
is a force of gravitation, so that the deeper ideas are, the more
work will be required to bring them to the surface. (CP 7.553)
Peirce uses this metaphor to show how ideas are attracted to
one another through association of contiguity and resemblance. If someone is exposed to certain information, this
information is recognized only insofar as an idea or ideas in
the consciousness are able to recognize the sign. Now, if
someone is exposed to information, which he seems to
know, but has difficulty in placing, he will use a lot of mental
energy to place the information in relation to knowledge
sunk deep into the bottomless lake of ideas far back in his
memory.
The informational sign gives direction and form to the
interpretation to follow (conveyed by the symbol), pointing
TABLE 1.
out (via the index) the particular qualities (icons) of information in time and space. This is the second step in any
process of meaning creation.
The Cognitional Sign
The cognitional sign is related to Thirdness and medisense; it is made up from the rheme, dicent sign, and argument. Medisense is: “the main process . . . of thought” (CP
7.276). Medisense is what it is from, what it mediates
between, what it brings into relation, which is primisense
and altersense, or ego and nonego, even though medisense
cannot be reduced to this. Medisense makes the relation
between primisense and altersense stable, general, and
thereby intelligible. Put in another way, medisense is an
interpretation of the process in which primisense and
altersense become related:
This third state of mind is entirely different from the other two.
In the second there was only a sense of brute force; now there is
a sense of government by a general rule. In reaction, only two
things are involved; but in government there is a third thing,
which is a means to an end (404 [1893] 4 = n.p. cited from
Houser, 1983, p. 344)
Medisense makes the relation between the emotional sign
and the informational sign intelligible. It is at this level that
information is interpreted and becomes knowledge. Consequently, there is a structural difference between information
and knowledge. Information is not interpreted; interpreted
information is knowledge. In addition, knowledge cannot be
reduced to information; information finds its way into
explicitness through thoughts, via arguments incorporated in
dicent signs and rhemes, the whole process being subsumed
in the cognitional sign.
At this cognitional level, the cognitional sign makes the
relation between emotion and information intelligible. This
is the third step in any meaning-creation process. Consequently, cognition is the bringing together of the external
world with the internal world.
In Table 1, we summarize the three kinds of signs. So far,
we have tried to present the meaning-creation process from
a semeiotic perspective (Figure 1). Such a perspective does
not necessarily entail a subject (according to Peirce [1905],
the universe is perfused with signs [cf. CP 5.448, n1].), nor

does it necessarily entail intentionality. However, communication between human agents involves intentionality; therefore, emotion, information, and cognition in the context of
communication are at a level different from the meaningcreation process. Let us elaborate on the necessary conditions at this communicative level.
Emotion, Information, and Knowledge in a
Communicative Perspective
If we place emotion, information, and knowledge in our
Peircean inspired model of communication, the Dynacom,
we can see that there are some conditions that have to be met
in order to communicate emotion, information, and knowledge (Figure 2). We do not go into detail on the communication model here. However, we will mention the conditions
that have to be met in order for any communication to
succeed:

<listItem confidence="0.995528125">
1. The sign’s possibility to cause an effect of meaning,
which can be emotional, informational, or cognitional.
2. The interpreter’s ability to represent the sign as either a
sign of emotion, information, or cognition.
3. Communication taking place inside a universe of
discourse.
4. Utterer and interpreter possessing collateral experiences.
5. The cominterpretant occurring.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998353371428572">
A key concept in the communication model is collateral
experience. Collateral experience is prior knowledge necessary in order to interpret any sign or engage in any sign
activity. Collateral experience is an experience that is not
mediated by the sign itself but is an experience parallel to the
sign; an experience that precedes the sign. Collateral experience can be found at all levels in the communication
process, and it is a necessary condition at all levels.
Collateral experience is closely related to a universe of
discourse, but, where the universe of discourse determines
the possible organization of objects, and thus modes of interpretation, collateral experience is the actual knowledge
shared by the utterer and interpreter about concepts or phenomena in a communication process. It is important to stress
that a universe of discourse is understood in broad and
general terms, and as such addresses the contextual circumstances surrounding the communication process, which in
some cases could be a scientific community, in other cases
activities taking places in a more loosely defined and ad hoc
context. In principle, a universe of discourse could be
defined by the communication process itself taking place
between the utterer and interpreter and thus be unique and
temporary.
Let us elaborate on this using an example. We are standing and looking into the horizon, when suddently we see a
spot moving. We cannot see what the spot is, but we can see
that it is something. We are wondering what the spot can be.
The spot comes closer and we can see that it is a dog. Now
we are talking about what the dog might do, if it is happy or
bad-tempered; what kind of dog it is, etc. The dog comes
closer and now we see that it is the neighbor’s dog, Jake, and
we know Jake to be a nice and playful dog.
There are two important elements in this example: (a) a
process of meaning creation and (b) a process of communication. Let us take a closer look at both processes starting with
the meaning-creation process. As a spot on the horizon, the
dog is information (we do not yet know that it is a dog); it
makes us attentive. Here the information already has caused
emotions, but we need more information in order to know
what the spot is; however, we are forming several hypotheses,
and we know that it is something; even to recognize the spot
as a spot calls for some kind of interpretation.

<bodyText confidence="0.992543225806451">
At this phase in the meaning-creation process, we can
make many hypotheses about the spot in the horizon; it
could be almost anything, so we cannot attach many characteristics to the spot. Consequently, the information level of
the spot is broad in terms of possible things to which the spot
can refer. Here, the emotional level is the dominant one. As
the spot moves closer, it begins to manifest itself into something we can begin to recognize. We can now see that it is a
dog, but not what kind of dog it is. In this phase of recognition, we have given up a series of hypotheses and identified so many characteristics that we can identify the
information as a dog. Hence, hypotheses have been tested, as
several characteristics have been added. The information
level is the dominant one. With the dog coming closer, we
can identify the dog as the neighbor’s dog, Jake, a nice and
friendly dog. At this level, the many possible hypotheses we
had about the spot have been removed and several characteristics have been added. The information refers to the
particular dog, so the cognitional level is now the dominant
level; the information has been transformed into knowledge.
The relation between Jake and our hypotheses (our interpretations of Jake) is true. The meaning-creation process is
shown in Table 2.
As Table 2 suggests, the meaning-creation process runs
through different stages. However, it is important to stress
that it is always information that causes emotion and knowledge to arise. It is also important to stress that when the
emotional level is dominant knowledge is also involved; we
know that the spot is something, but we do not know what it
is; of course, the lack of precise knowledge about the spot
makes us uneasy. As we gradually attach more characteristics to the object, the knowledge level becomes dominant,
but it still contains emotions; also, different kinds of emotions, for example, stress and anxiety (the dog might bite
me) have been replaced with relief and other positive emotions. Consequently, the meaning-creation process is a continuous process consisting of adding characteristics to the
signs and removing hypotheses from the signs based on
prior experience with the given sign. Even though the universe of discourse and collateral experience are dialogical
conditions, a train of thoughts as described above is a dialog
between a self and the future self; therefore, we can apply
the concepts of collateral experience and universe of

an utterer and interpreter must share for communication to
result (see Liszka, 1996). Liszka renames the universe of
discourse to a discourse of community. “In order for genuine
communication to take place the sign which is the utterer
must be part of a sense common to the interpreter, and,
conversely; it requires a sensibility gained from a common
community” (Liszka, 1996, p. 92). It seems clear that the
prior knowledge about the dog enables the interpreter to
recognize the dog as a dog, and it is this prior knowledge
that creates the universe of discourse, namely, that it is a spot
moving, that it is a dog, and that it is Jake.
The second element in this example is the communicative
element. Two persons are taking a walk in the countryside;
they decide to cross a field when they see a spot moving on the
horizon; the spot is moving toward them. Person 1 says to
person 2: “Hey, can you see something is moving in the
horizon?” Person 2 replies: “Yes, is it a dog or what is it?”
Person 1 says, “I think it is a dog but I cannot see what kind it
is!” Person 2 replies, “You’re right, I think it is a dog too. I
wonder if it might be aggressive?!” Pause. “Aah, it’s Jake.
Jake, come here boy. I’ve got a treat for you. Good doggie!”
The communication process runs through the same phases as
the meaning-creation process. We are discussing what the
dog is; we apply collateral experience, because we can agree
that the spot is something, but not what it is. In our discussion
of the spot, we form several hypotheses of what the spot could
be; these hypotheses involve and cause emotions because we
do not know what the spot is; we are curious (Figure 3).
When the spot comes closer, we can see that it is a dog;
it possesses the characteristics of a dog. At this level, we
have enough information to interpret it as a dog—not a
specific dog, but a dog. To do this, we must have collateral
experience, we must both know what characteristics a dog
has in order for it to be a dog. This is shown in Figure 4.
At this level, when we can see that it is a dog, but not a
specific dog, the number of hypotheses is decreasing as the
information is increasing. At this level, the amount of collateral experience is growing. Now, the dog is so close that
we can see what dog it is. Based on our prior knowledge
about the dog, we know that it does not bite; we know that
it likes treats; we know that it is playful, etc. This is shown
in Figure 5.

FIGS. 3–5. At first, the emotional level is the dominant level. We do not know what the spot on the horizon is. We know it is something, so we have
collateral experience about the spot. Our lack of information and knowledge about the spot enable us to put forth several hypotheses about what the spot is.
At this level, we know that the dog is Jake, the neighbor’s
dog. We have special knowledge about it, which we can
obtain only by knowing this particular dog. This knowledge
is primarily subjective.
This also points in the direction that the knowledge level
entails some subjective element influencing interpretion;
however, this is not to be confused with private knowledge.
Knowledge is general and can be communicated; there is no
such thing as private personal knowledge that only oneself
can understand. As humans, we have the same cognitive
apparatus, so our cognition follows the same pattern.
It may be worth mentioning that emotions can change
during recognition. Starting with an unconscious feeling of
uneasiness when looking at the spot in the horizon, the
feeling may evolve into a state of joy when we explicitely
come to think about Jake. Consequently, there is an intrinsic
relation among the three elements in cognition and they
make up a continuum. Information is able to cause emotions
both at a subconscious level and at a conscious level. Both
levels require collateral experience in order to arise, but the
cognitive level calls for explicit knowledge about Jake in
order to interpret the intentions of the dog.
In this example, collateral experience exsists between
two individuals who can communicate about the object (the
spot) perceived and share experience. Collateral experience
in this example is thus an understanding or agreement about
the object perceived. This also creates a discourse community between the two individuals wherein the discussion
takes place.
The two examples illustrate that information may trigger
perceptions that ultimately are measured in relation to collateral experience, and that the process of cognition follows
similar paths whether we speak of individual perceptions or
negotiated perceptions. In the first example, the perceiver is
in dialogue with himself in order understand the objects
percieved. The second example adds the element of dialogue
betweeen two individuals. In this example, the object is
perceived by separate minds that through dialogue may

share experiences about the object. Even though the object
(the dog) is known by only one of the perceivers, this knowledge can be communicated to the other. The example with
Jake the dog demonstrates how the knowledge creation
process involves subjective as well as intersubjective knowledge. Let us now turn our attention to an example related
specifically to LIS.
Let us replace Jake the dog with a number, 61.642. A
person is looking at a shelf in a library where he sees the
number 61.642. Let us imagine that the person has only vague
knowledge about classification systems. The number being
information may cause some emotions in the person, for
example, curiosity. The person can identify the number as a
number, he is in a library, and may recognize the number as
some sort of library code. Consequently, the person has some
collateral knowledge number in question. Then, he looks at
the shelf with the number, all the books standing there seem
to have psychology as a theme. This makes him conclude that
61.642 has something to do with psychology. This process the
person undergoes is a meaning-creating process analogous to
the example with Jake the dog. Now let us imagine a librarian
looking at the same shelf with the number 61.642. He is so
familiar with the classification system that the process of
recognizing and interpretating happens almost simultaniously. Here, the librarian possesses so much collateral
knowledge about the number that he instantly recognizes and
interprets it. Consequently, as we saw with the example with
Jake, the spot or the number cause emotions to arise, but,
based on collateral knowledge, the information turns into
knowledge. As a twist, we can say that, whereas we possessed
subjective knowledge about Jake (we knew he was playful,
etc.), the librarian possesses professional knowledge concerning the classification system, and it is the professional
knowledge that comes into play, not only his subjective
knowledge.
Let us use now return to the Dynacom as an analytical
tool. A Bach scholar searches a database for a particular
score by Johan Sebastian Bach. This score is important to
him, in that he needs it to be able to prove a scientific point.
He is used to searching the particular database, and is
capable of identifying the relevant findings. He performs the
search using the search phrase “J.S. Bach &amp; suites for harpsichord.” This results in, say, 100 relevant matches, of which
2 are highly relevant. Let us try to analyze this example by
using the Dynacom.
The Bach scholar writes a query; this makes him the
utterer. He endows the query with an intentional interpretant. The system receives the query and reacts to the query;
this makes the system a quasi-interpreter. It is affected by the
intention of the query and therefore represents an effectual
interpretant. However, it is quasi, because the system is not
able to react in ways other than the way in which it is
programmed, but still it is an interpreter insofar as it translates the query into a given search result. The real interpreter
is the Bach scholar; he uses the user interface as a medium
in his dialog. Thus, the Bach scholar is both the utterer and
the interpreter. This seems analogous to someone writing on
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999488323529412">
a piece of paper; this is also a dialog between the writer and
his future self but in this case he has more control over what
he writes; his thoughts are more identifical to his writings on
the paper. The difference between the writing into the computer and the writing on the paper is that the paper does not
interpret that which is written in a way hidden to the writer,
whereas the text written into the query field is definitely
altered when processed by the computer, so the meaning
becomes altered. This is also the case when communicating
to another person or a group of persons. The utterance
embedded with a certain intentionality may be completely
misinterpreted by the interpreter. The more collateral experience between the utterer and the interpreter, the greater the
chance for a correct interpretation.
In the case with the Bach scholar, it is a dialog between
himself and his future self mediated by the algoritm in the
database, but, when he sends the query, he looses control of
it; he does not know how his query is being processed.
However, this may occur to him when he gets the results of
the search, which causes an effectual interpretant in the
utterer. For the Bach scholar to have a succesful experience,
the database must find the document for which he searches;
there has to be a query match. However, it is based only on
the collateral experience the Bach scholar possesses about
the match that he is able to determine whether or not the
particular match is the right one. The more collateral knowledge the Bach scholar possesses about a given match, the
more capable he is of determining the relevance of the
match. This is shown in Figure 6. The discussion about
relevance between query and match becomes very intricate,
because the match for a given query can be judged only by
the interpretation of an utterer/interpreter (relevance confirms the utterers hypothesis).
If we return to the communication model and say that the
utterer is able to cause an effect in the interpreter, that being
an emotional, informational, or cognitional effect based on

the collateral experience of the interpreter, then what can we
say about this effect? We must say that different emotions,
different kinds of information and knowledge effect us differently. The hypothesis is that the more collateral experience the interpreter possesses about a given sign (emotional,
information, or cognitional signs), the more likely the interpreter is to recognize the sign as being of relevance to him.
To understand this, we must address the significance effect,
which is an interpretational effect caused by any sign.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.603783">
The Significance Effect
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99452120212766">
There are three types of significance effects, which are
related to the emotional sign, the informational sign, and
the cognitional sign; we call them the emotional significance effect, the informational significance effect, and the
cognitional significance effect, which tell us about the
interpreter’s ability to recognize emotions, information,
and knowledge, respectively, based on his experience and
knowledge. These three types of significance effects are
closely connected. In this way, the emotional significance
effect and the informational significance effect can
be abstracted from the cognitional significance effect; the
emotional significance effect can be abstracted from the
informational significance effect, but not the other way
around. Analytically, this means that there has to be an
emotional significance effect before the informational significance effect can occur, and there has to be an emotional
significance effect and an informational significance effect
before the cognitional significance effect can occur, and, if
there is a cognitional significance effect, there also has to
be informational and emotional significance effects. The
significance effects follow the same logic as presented
earlier.
One of the main points of the significance effect is that
the recognitional level of the interpreter becomes reflected in
the sign. It seems that signs are able to release and refer to a
certain experienced memory in the interpreter. Within scientific knowledge domains, this experienced memory seems
primarily to be logically and rationally based. Communicating the concept of “semeiosis” to an interpreter within the
knowledge domain of sign theories will probably cause an
interpretation concerning the technical aspect of a sign or
maybe the historical roots of the concept, for example, that
TABLE 3.
the concept was very frequently used in “De Signis” (On
Signs), a treatise on inductive logic written by the Epicurean
philosopher Philodemus. In other cases, such as within the
areas of marketing and commercials, signs may be used
strategically to awaken certain emotional memories
enabling us to relate to a given product, and the awakening
of emotional memories might eventually persuade us to buy
the given product. This latter kind of significance effect is at
first based not on rational persuasion but rather on emotional
experiences. If the sign does awake emotional or cognitional
significance effects in the interpreter, it must be because the
interpreter shares qualities or values with the sign to such a
degree that the interpreter is able unconsciously to reflect
himself in the sign, that is, agree on the premises and conclusion of the argument or be sympathetic about the values
communicated by an utterer. Consequently, both the cognitional and the emotional significance effect are tied to the
individual as a kind of quasi-empathetic experience. It is a
quasi-empathetic experience inasmuch as the interpreter
reflects himself in the sign because he is able to identify
qualities in the sign that he himself contains or desires to
contain. He sees himself through the “eyes” of the sign, so to
speak. He learns from the sign, and the sign learns from him.
As Peirce writes in the article “Some consequences of four
incapacities” (1868):
But since man can think only by means of words or other
external symbols, these might turn round and say: “You mean
nothing which we have not taught you, and then only so far as
you address some word as the interpretant of your thought. In
fact, therefore, men and words reciprocally educate each other;
each increase of a man’s information involves and is involved
by a corresponding increase of a word’s information” (CP
5.313).
However, the effect is by no means solely individual. Being
developed within the scope of Peircean semeiotics, the significance effects are rooted in the same scholastic realism.
This means that any communication involves an utterer and
an interpreter, and, for the communication to be successful
to some degree, it must be general. If this is not the case, the
utterer cannot communicate to an exterior world and not
even to his future self; thus, no intelligible communication
can take place. In Table 3, the emotional, the informational,
Types of significance effects.
The emotional significance effect
The more experience one has with a particular
emotion, the better one is able to interpret it.
The interpretation takes place on a subconscious
level. This opens up for the emotional sign’s
ability to attract minds that share or desire the
particular emotion. The stronger the desire, the
stronger emotional significance effect.
The informational significance effect
The cognitional significance effect
Being on a communicative level, the informational
significance effect designates the mind’s ability
to recognize information. The more collateral
knowledge the mind possesses about the
information, the more capable the interpreter
will be of recognizing it, or the greater
difference the information makes to him, if we
borrow terminology from Bateson.
The interpreter reflects his knowledge
level in the concept; the cognitional
significance effect depends on how much
the interpreter “sees” his own knowledge
level reflected. The more he “sees,” the
stronger the normative effect, and vice
versa.

and the normative significance effects are placed alongside
each other to make some similarities and dissimilarities
clear. This is elaborated further in Table 4.
If we focus on the last two columns in Table 4, we can see
that the more predicates a given sign has, the fewer objects
it refers to and therefore the more precise the significance
effect is, and the more objects a sign refers to, the fewer
predicates it has. This means that, if an interpreter recognizes a given sign communicated to him in the way in which
the communication was intended by the utterer, the fewer
objects the sign will refer to, and the more predicates it
possesses. So, we have a case where precise communication
is a condition for the release of a certain significance effect,
be that of emotional, informational, or cognitional character.
The Meaning-Creation Process
Three elements seem to make up the meaning-creation
process: emotion, information, and cognition. So far we
have tried to outline the relationship among these elements.
They are understandable within Peirce’s framework of consciousness consisting of primisense (emotion), altersense
(information), and cognition (medisense), and semeiotics
involving three-sign trichotomies. Consequently, the bringing of subconsciousness to self-consciousness is similar to
the process of meaning creation or semeiosis, or we can say
that the process of meaning creation begins with feeling and
emotion and passes through experience of the world (the
imagined or the physical world), and then enters into
thought and concepts, the process being underscored by a
degree of collateral experience.
We have tried to outline the element of collateral experience as a necessary condition for the transformation of
information into knowledge. In any process of meaning
creation, both at an individual and at a superindividual
level, the recognition of collateral experience is essential
and necessary to interpret information. Collateral experience is, however, not a situation of “either or,” but rather a
graded phenomenon. The more collateral experience one
possesses about a sign, the more determinate the sign processes are, and the fewer objects the sign denotes. This
means that the significance effect depends on collateral
experience, whether the effect is emotional, informational,
or cognitional.

Let us now, with the aforementioned statement in mind,
look at a few perspectives for information science concerning the information system, the information need, and the
social context determing the need for information.

Perspectives for Information Science
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99933235483871">
Information science, in particular the fields concerned
with organization and retrieval of information, struggle with
a fragmented view of the information processes connected
to the areas of the information system itself, the human
agents interacting with the system, and the community that
frames information behavior of the individual users. We
believe that the phenosemeiotic perspective presented earlier
demonstrates how information relates both to an emotional
level of cognition and to deliberate, articulate knowledge
structures. The strength of the phenosemeiotic perspective is
that is connects the three fundamental kinds of significance
into a whole.
Thus, we argue in favor of a semeiotic view of information science that can accommodate the different aspects/
levels of information, the cognition of users, and the
structuring power of a social environment, and as such
provide us with a stronger, unified, theoretical foundation
for information science. We are fully aware that the three
kinds of significance effects as suggested here rest upon a
theoretical analysis and, as such, require further empirical
investigation. Testing the nature of significance effects in an
information system interaction environment is, however,
outside the scope of this article. Nevertheless, the significance effects have by no means come out of thin air; we
know, from studies in terminology and lexicography (Cabré,
2003; Felber, 1984; Myking, 2001; Sager, 1990; Thellefsen,
2004) that knowledge domain members are more familiar
with the specialities of their knowledge domain, its concepts, and terminology than nonmembers of the domain. We
also know that domain specialists are more attentive and
cautious about their use of technical terms, simply because
the meanings of technical terms are sanctioned by the community of the knowledge domain, and addressing a community of peers at, for example, a conference, necessitates a
deliberate use of shared, specialized terminology. Many
information specialists may consider this to be a commonsense fact, which may explain why research within LIS is so

far only piecemeal and has sporadically included research
conducted within the fields of terminology and lexicography. Consequently, LIS suffers from a common-sense
approach to LIS core concepts such as concept formation and concept delimitation (logic), categorization
(similarity/dissimilarity, semantic relations), terminology
(representation/signification), knowledge (cognition and
distributed cognition), community (paradigms, universe of
discourse), and communication (language/languaging and
pragmatics), which, when addressed in terms of aboutness,
information need, relevance, anomalous state of knowledge
(ASK [Belkin et al., 1982]) hypothesis, information systems
interaction/behavior, etc., neglect vital knowledge about the
fundamental nature and implicit functions of information,
knowledge, and social structures.
We consider it likely that signs develop through the
stages of the emotional, informational, and cognitional significance effects. The emotional (significance) effect has
been studied within, for example, marketing research,
showing that framing signs, that is, placing products in suggestive environments, causes emotional effects in relation to
consumer perception of products, successively affecting
their behavior. This we consider to support the hypothesis of
the emotional and informational significance effects, but
also the cognitional significance effect, because, the greater
the knowledge about the product, its function, its purpose,
its quality, etc., the greater the effect.
The semeiotic line of thought, however, is not a bird’s-eye
and neutral perspective. It is, rather, as formulated in this
particular context, a method for reasoning about the information processes connected to the information system and the
conduct of human agents and the community. Consequently,
the point of view from which we consider the functions and
processes of information systems interaction is essential. The
next sections touch upon the difference in approaching the
processes of information interaction from the perspective of
the information systems, from the perspective of the user, and
from the perspective of the community.
Understanding the Information System
Information systems are generally systems of representation, whose purpose is to support information activity performed by users. Within the context of LIS, information
systems are defined as knowledge-organization systems
(KOS), whose purpose is to support information retrieval in
bibliographic databases. Already here we encounter a terminological problem, in that no system, in our phenosemeiotic
view, organizes knowledge, because no cognition is taking
place; it can only be information that the system organizes.
Hence it must be an information organization system (IOS).
In the phenosemeiotic perspective, cognition takes place
only insofaras information is being interpreted; the system
does not interpret anything, and, if it does, this can only be
considered a quasi-interpretation. KOS may be divided into
different kinds of representation systems, (a) term lists, (b)
classification and categorization systems, and (c) systems
with particular focus on relationships (Hodge, 2000), which
may be elaborated even further by kind and granularity
(Friedman &amp; Thellefsen, 2011). As such, the basic functions
of KOS are to facilitate information retrival, provide information about documents, and provide shelf arrangements
(ordering function; Broughton et al., 2005).
However, understanding KOS as systems of representation nessecitates some explanatory comments on the concept
“representation.” Basically, we agree with Davis et al.
(1993), who define representation within the context of
information systems as knowledge representation (KR), and
succesively as a mode of thinking rather than acting. Consequently, Davis et al. argue that knowledge representation
is a surrogate, whose function is to represent, or model, a
part of reality by means of rationally structured sign systems
in terms of information. These structured sign systems imply
a set of ontological commitments, which determine how we
may think about the world. This means that basically our
understanding of the model becomes our understanding of
the world. As such, the information system becomes a
medium for efficient computation that recommends particular lines of inferences. A KR is thus a system that defines the
fundamental informational structure of concepts, that sanctions a line of thought, and that recommends particular inferences. Furthermore, KR is considered a medium of human
expression, a language that enables us to say things about
the world.
Although there are some important nuances in relation to
KOS, we consider KOS types of KR; however, KOS may be
highly structured and universal, such as the Colon system
(Ranganathan, 1960), or they may be based on ad hoc categorization that meets the needs of a particular group of
users (e.g., folksonomies). However, although highly structured and formal systems are well-suited for computer
processes, they tend to be less informative for humans.
Consequently, when approaching an information system
from the perspective of the system (the systems view), three
types of sign systems emerge: (a) the sign system of the
system itself, that is, the grammar of the system (syntax), the
formal system of representation; (b) the sign system of
meaning, the intended meaning of the information system’s
system of representation; and (c) the cognitive effect motivated by the system in a perceiving/interpreting mind.
The first type of system constitutes the structural, semantic layer of the information system. Thus, the system is
formally organized and structured based on the rules of the
system, binary coding at the lowest level and metadata structures at the highest level. Consequently, we may argue that
this first type of system constitutes the fundamental
grammar of the system.
The second type of system establishes, based on the first
level, a semantic structure that implicates an intended
meaning suggested to a user of the system, such as the
organization of concepts based on a variety of semantic
relations. At this level, we may argue that the information
system communicates a particular meaning and motivates, at
least intentionally, a certain user behavior.

The third type of system is beyond the control of the
system. The cognitive effect, which is the result of the sign
perception and interpretation, relies on the particular user’s
ability actually to understand the function and meaning of
the information system.
Traditionally, the research conducted from the information systems perspective (the systems-oriented view) prioritizes the structure and performance of the system,
optimizing search algorithms, thus focusing on relevance,
recall, and precision. Fundamentally, the systems-oriented
view promotes a rationalistic epistemology and probabilistic
methodology and operates at the sign levels of syntax and
semantics, which conform to altersense, the level of the
informational significance effect. We recall that the informational sign can be iconic, indexical, or symbolic. Approaching information retrieval based exclusively at the level of the
informational significance effect has the advantage of a controlled environment, objectivity, performance measures of
such as search algorithms, predictability, and clear results.
However, signification at the informational level is related to
the objective or explicit side of information and ignores the
emotional as well as the cognitional sign levels. We may,
therefore, criticize the systems-oriented view for suboptimizing at the systems level, at the expense of neglecting that
information is always information to someone. Hjørland
(2010) argues that even the systems-oriented view, despite
being perceived as objective, involves relevance criteria that
implicate users’ (expert users) relevance assessment, so
systems performance cannot be evaluated by itself but is
evaluated in relation to how well it performs for potential
users of the system. Consequently, the systems view implies
criteria for evaluation of systems performance that cannot in
themselves be objective. However, an important difference
in relation to the user-oriented view is that, even though
information systems continuously are to be evaluated and
improved by user feedback, the search algorithm performs
without reasoning about what, how, or why particular documents are matched. Simply put, the threshold for assessing
relevance is in principle generalized and as objective as any
artefact.
The systems-oriented view is ultimately limited to the
informational significance effect, the outer world, establishing the grammar and syntax of KOS. User interaction with
an information system takes the form of a quasi-dialogue; in
principle, the user is communicating with himself, by selecting between relevant and nonrelevant documents (cf. the
Bach scholar example). We may argue from this perspective
that the users ASK can be clarified by interacting with an
information system. This, however, calls for some speculations about how information systems may support users in
this process of clarification.
Understanding the Information Need
The concept of information need is more intricate, simply
because the phenomenon resides within the cognititive
space of the user. Within LIS, in particular, the concept
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.821602">
1746
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999534375">
of ASK has been promoted in order to address the user’s
state of uncertainty and, thus, motivation for seeking
information.
Seen from the perspective of the user, the first and second
types of sign systems are identical. However, decoding the
intended meaning of the information system also depends on
the third type of sign system, namely, the particular users’
expertise with information systems interaction and knowledge level (collateral experience). Significance effects,
whether emotional, informational, or cognitional, thus
become an integral part of information systems interaction.
However, whereas the former perspective tends to prioritize
the system’s information architecture and formal representation of language, in principle ignoring the user, the latter
tends to focus on the user’s perception and sense making.
Consequently, the successful systems interaction is considered a trade off between how well-focused an information
system’s design is, and if information architecture actually
addresses the needs and demands of users, and how well
knowledge possessed by users actually is stimulated by
system interaction. In other words, how well the system in
fact reflects the emotional and cognitional structures of the
user.
However, the emotional and cognitional significance
effects are brain waves, so user needs, knowledge structures,
and ASK are understood in terms of information. Even
though the user-oriented view explicitly addresses the
concept of knowledge, and even the emotional state of the
user (ASK in principle should be considered an emotional
state), knowledge is conflated into the realm of information.
The consequence is that ASK and information need are
conceived as a state of mind that develops from a mental,
inarticulate stage to an explicit stage that, with the right
tools, can be expressed in the terms of the information
system (Taylor, 1968).
Whereas the systems view gives priority to systems optimization, the user perspective gives priority to user
information-seeking behavior, user tasks, and user interaction. The user is the priority; therefore, user information
behavior is observed and evaluated. Whereas the
information-seeking process in the systems view is considered in terms of objective relevance criteria as recall and
precision, the information-seeking process in the user perspective is evaluated in terms of user satisfaction. However,
as one might imagine, user satisfaction is inherently problematic, because the quality or correctness of the retrieved
documents is not evaluated. Bad or wrong documents may
also cause user satisfaction. Furthermore, users are different;
some users are experts within the search domain, and others
are novices, which means that knowledge about the work
task and context of the information need is relative to different users. As pointed out by Hjørland (2010, p. 228), there
is a paradox in that, “on the one hand, a user’s relevance is
considered purely individual, while on the other hand the
researchers try to uncover general tendencies.” The question
is then whether individual users, at some cognitive level,
exhibit a general information-retrieval behavior, which

remains to be uncovered. However, the paradox pointed out
is similar to the problem of induction, how to discover
generality from instances, a point made by Popper in his
critique of logical positivism. Theories may be falsified,
never verified, because of the problem of induction (Popper,
1968).
In relation to our theoretical framework of the significance effect, the emotional significance effect is subcognitive. However, as suggested, the emotional effect motivated
by a given work task situation depends on experience, intuition, or what may be described as some kind of subcognitive recognition. The cognitional significance effect
relates to the knowledge that the user possesses about the
work task situation, and the user reflects his knowledge or
expertise in the process of systems interaction. The system
itself provides the informational level of significance, but
how can we address the nature of knowledge possessed by
the individual user without giving in to total subjective
relativism?
There seems to be only one answer to this question, that
is, the social context determining the information need that
frames the work task situation, the context of systems interaction, and the character of the problem that motivates the
information-seeking process. This is, in short, the universe
of discourse.
Understanding the Universe of Discourse
The universe of discourse is defined as the socially
framed or situated context in which the information-seeking
activity takes place. The user’s problem space or work task
situation is anchored in a certain context that provides
meaning, scope, and purpose to the information-seeking
behavior. Deliberate information seeking is never random
but purposeful and goal directed. Understanding the context
of deliberate reasoning that gives rise to the formulation of a
particular information need is thus imperative.
The communication model (see Figure 7) consequently
implies different layers of communication activity, that of
communication itself (signs are communicated to a perceiver,
an interpreter), a second level that implicates a relative
FIG. 7.
Different layers of communication activity.
informational effect (i.e., the communicated information is
perceived as meaningful and relates to knowledge already
possessed by the perceiver), and a third level of agreement, or,
as Peirce (1977) would state it, “minds fused together” (pp.
196–197), an idea of conceptual alignment; the utterer and
perceiver are in agreement about what is communicated, in
sense of meaning, but not necessarily in agreement about the
substance or concequences or even fundamental premises of
the argument. This is represented in Figure 7.
Let us return to the library example used earlier, with the
user not being familiar with the library system. The library
system represented by the number on the bookshelf communicates the number to the user. The classification system
becomes an utterer, and it contains an indirect intention,
namely, to communicate that “if you are looking for a book
concerning psychological topics you must look under
61.642.” The system is indeed able to create an intentional
interpretant, but only insofar as it is related to the system. We
can call it a quasi-intentional interpretant. The sign communicated is 61.642. The interpreter is the person not familiar
with the library system. He is wondering about the meaning
of the number on the shelf. He can recognize the number as
a number and he makes the hypothesis that it is some sort of
code. Given the fact that all the books on the shelf have the
same number, he makes the hypothesis that the 61.642 is a
code for books concerning psychological topics. The
success of his line of reasoning depends on his amount of
collateral experience and his ability to create hypotheses
based on his collateral experience, and that the universe of
discourse is well defined. In this case, we can say that the
systems view, the users view, and the universe of discourse
are melded together in a meaning-creating process. Consequently, we maintain that any information-seeking theory
must have all three perspectives in mind when creating
information systems.
Ingwersen (1996), and Ingwersen and Järvelin (2005)
argue that any act of communication involves a generator, a
message, and a recipient. Accordingly, when the generator
communicates a message to a recipient, the message carrying
the intentionality, meaning, implicit context, and potential
informativeness of the generator becomes stripped from
intentionality, meaning, implicit context, and potential informativeness and falls into a linguistic surface level (Figure 8).
However, we argue that, even at the fundamental level of
communication (Figure 7), where signs are uttered from a
generator (utterer) to a recipient (interpreter), the recipient
must interpret (or at least recognize) the communicated
signs as signs of communication, even though he has not yet
understood the intended meaning of the communication,
which takes place successively at the next, more developed
level of cognition. The communication model illustrated in
Figure 6 conforms to the traditional transmission model of
communication, originally formulated by Shannon and
Weaver (1949). This model also considers the process of
communication as a transference of a message from a
generator to a recipient, in terms of signals or codes through
a channel; and, at the receivers end, the process of

reconstructing the signals received starts in principle from a
morphosyntactic–semantic level and is completed when the
original message transmitted by the generator is reconstructed by the recipient.
However, the transference model (which includes the
idea of cognitive free fall) neglects some important aspects
of the communication process. Communication always
takes place in a context (a universe of discourse). Furthermore, any communicator and interpreter (generator and
receiver, if human) exhibits collateral experience, and therefore provides the communication process with intentionality
(denotation and connotation at emotional, informational,
and cognitive levels). In terms of interpretation, an interpreter at the lowest level of significance establishes an
immediate interpretation of the communication process,
thus perceiving the communicated signs as signs of
meaning, not just signs of semantic structure, which at a
subcognitive (emotional recognition) level involves collateral experience and knowledge about the universe of dis-

pick up the message from the free fall is by reconstructing the message
based on his own cognitive abilities.
course. The problem with Ingwersen’s concept of cognitive
free fall is that it assumes that communication fundamentally builds upon decontextualized morphosyntactic semantic codes and structures (as formulated by Shannon &amp;
Weaver, 1949) that must be reconstructed and contextualized from a syntactical surface level by a perceiving mind
before any meaning is established (Figure 9).
We believe that the process of communication should be
understood the other way around. Meaning emanates before
syntax. Consequently, any process of communication
involving human minds is perceived from a pragmatic level.
Any acts of communication, even signs generated by computer screens, are perceived as signs of meaning before signs
of syntax, and the cognitive process of meaning making thus
precedes syntactical speculations. Of course, the process
considered from the machine is stripped from meaning,
intentionality, etc. The computer is no more than a sign
generator; consequently, the idea of a cognitive free fall does
not even apply to a strictly decontextualized data transmission context, such as computer systems transmitting data,
because no cognition is taking place. It certainly does not
apply to human agents, not even if the cognitive processes
within the human brain are considered similar to “computing.” This false assumption connects the cognitive view to
cognitive science.
The semeiotic approach to communication is skeptical of
the notion of cognitive free fall, simply because the idea of
communication stripped from intentionality, meaning, and
context seems to be absurd. We consider the socially determined context a prerequisite condition if communication has
to take place. Consequently, we also consider communication an activity that occurs only between minds, and the
success of the communicative process is determined
by the collateral experience shared by the communicators
and the universe of discourse that delimits and determines
the precise meaning of concepts.
FIG. 9. Applying the levels of communication, relative effect of meaning, and conceptual alignment to the communication model clarifies the three
dimensions of the communication process that horizontically implicate an utterer and an interpreter and vertically implicate a gradual level of understanding.
The meaning generated within the interpreter’s mind is thus a relative product of the interpreter’s knowledge about what is communicated.

Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940266666667">
We have introduced our phenosemeiotically-inspired
concepts of emotion, information, and knowledge and have
tried to argue for their role and function in the meaningcreation process as well as in communication. Furthermore,
we have discussed how our phenosemeiotic perspective
relates to and influences our understanding of the systems
view, the cognitive view, and a view based in a universe of
discourse. We have, through our analysis of significance
effects, related to the process of information retrieval,
argued in favor of a phenosemeiotic view that takes into
account the fundamental layer of signification, the grammar
of the system that provides for the structuring and representation of information (the KOS). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the phenosemiotical view takes into account
that signs are signs of meaning and that users interpret signs
and use signs in their information-seeking activity, simply
because the signs carry meaning to the user. However, the
meaning of signs and the ability of users to interpret signs
are related to the individual’s level of collateral experience,
which concerns both the user’s experience with a particular
KOS, and the user’s knowledge about what is sought.
Finally, the phenosemeiotic view implies that, in addition to
signs being signs (grammar) and signs being signs of
meaning (semantics), signs are also interpreted from a perspective more general than the individual user’s collateral
experience (pragmatics). We argue that the universe of discourse expresses the overall frame for how signs are signs of
meaning and frames the discourse of meaning. Consequently, we have to consider all three perspectives: the
systems perspective, the user perspective, and the perspective of the universe of discourse in order to account for the
intricate meaning-creation process that takes place when
seeking information. We believe that our phenosemiotic
view establishes a comprehensive, theoretical foundation for
addressing the processes of information, communication,
and knowledge, which we consider philosophically sound
and practically relevant for the field of LIS.

However, signification at the informational level is related to the objective or explicit side of information and ignores the emotional as well as the cognitional sign levels. We may, therefore, criticize the systems-oriented view for suboptimizing at the systems level, at the expense of neglecting that information is always information to someone. Hjørland (2010) argues that even the systems-oriented view, despite being perceived as objective, involves relevance criteria that implicate users’ (expert users) relevance assessment, so systems performance cannot be evaluated by itself but is evaluated in relation to how well it performs for potential users of the system. Consequently, the systems view implies criteria for evaluation of systems performance that cannot in themselves be objective. However, an important difference in relation to the user-oriented view is that, even though information systems continuously are to be evaluated and improved by us</context>

However, as one might imagine, user satisfaction is inherently problematic, because the quality or correctness of the retrieved documents is not evaluated. Bad or wrong documents may also cause user satisfaction. Furthermore, users are different; some users are experts within the search domain, and others are novices, which means that knowledge about the work task and context of the information need is relative to different users. As pointed out by Hjørland (2010, p. 228), there is a paradox in that, “on the one hand, a user’s relevance is considered purely individual, while on the other hand the researchers try to uncover general tendencies.” The question is then whether individual users, at some cognitive level, exhibit a general information-retrieval behavior, which JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY—August 2013 DOI: 10.1002/asi remains to be uncovered.

Medisense makes the relation between primisense and altersense stable, general, and thereby intelligible. Put in another way, medisense is an interpretation of the process in which primisense and altersense become related: This third state of mind is entirely different from the other two. In the second there was only a sense of brute force; now there is a sense of government by a general rule. In reaction, only two things are involved; but in government there is a third thing, which is a means to an end (404 [1893] 4 = n.p. cited from Houser, 1983, p. 344) Medisense makes the relation between the emotional sign and the informational sign intelligible. It is at this level that information is interpreted and becomes knowledge. Consequently, there is a structural difference between information and knowledge. Information is not interpreted; interpreted information is knowledge. In addition, knowledge cannot be reduced to information; information finds its way into explicitness through thoughts, via arguments incorporated in dicent signs and rhemes, the whole process being subsumed in the cognitional sign.

The success of his line of reasoning depends on his amount of collateral experience and his ability to create hypotheses based on his collateral experience, and that the universe of discourse is well defined. In this case, we can say that the systems view, the users view, and the universe of discourse are melded together in a meaning-creating process. Consequently, we maintain that any information-seeking theory must have all three perspectives in mind when creating information systems. Ingwersen (1996), and Ingwersen and Järvelin (2005) argue that any act of communication involves a generator, a message, and a recipient. Accordingly, when the generator communicates a message to a recipient, the message carrying the intentionality, meaning, implicit context, and potential informativeness of the generator becomes stripped from intentionality, meaning, implicit context, and potential informativeness and falls into a linguistic surface level (Figure 8). However, we argue that, even at the fundamental level of communication (Figure 7), where signs are uttered from a generator (utterer) to a reci</context>

The success of his line of reasoning depends on his amount of collateral experience and his ability to create hypotheses based on his collateral experience, and that the universe of discourse is well defined. In this case, we can say that the systems view, the users view, and the universe of discourse are melded together in a meaning-creating process. Consequently, we maintain that any information-seeking theory must have all three perspectives in mind when creating information systems. Ingwersen (1996), and Ingwersen and Järvelin (2005) argue that any act of communication involves a generator, a message, and a recipient. Accordingly, when the generator communicates a message to a recipient, the message carrying the intentionality, meaning, implicit context, and potential informativeness of the generator becomes stripped from intentionality, meaning, implicit context, and potential informativeness and falls into a linguistic surface level (Figure 8). However, we argue that, even at the fundamental level of communication (Figure 7), where signs are uttered from a generator (utterer) to a recipient (interpreter), the recipient </context>

Generally, the concept of information is approached through three general families of concepts: a systemsoriented view, a user-oriented view, and a domain-oriented view (see Ingwersen &amp; Järvelin, 2005, for an excellent review regarding the systems-oriented and user-oriented views and Hjørland, 2004, regarding the domain-oriented view). Thus, we may approach information as objective entities handled by information systems, as objective entities that relate to work tasks, or as objective entities related to domains. The notion of information as something independently observable is shared among LIS scholars; but how information may be related to the complex processes of interpretation, meaning making, and information need (in short “knowledge”), is another matter.

However, the concept of emotion that we try to put to use in our theory of the meaning-creation process follows the metaphysical conditions given by Peirce. Hence, this concept of emotion is understood within the realm of evolution; therefore, it is dynamic, like the meaning-creation process into which it enters. As Peirce writes: “ . . . an emotion of the mind is real, in the sense that it exists in the mind whether we are distinctly conscious of it or not.

Liszka renames the universe of discourse to a discourse of community. “In order for genuine communication to take place the sign which is the utterer must be part of a sense common to the interpreter, and, conversely; it requires a sensibility gained from a common community” (Liszka, 1996, p. 92). It seems clear that the prior knowledge about the dog enables the interpreter to recognize the dog as a dog, and it is this prior knowledge that creates the universe of discourse, namely, that it is a spot moving, that it is a dog, and that it is Jake.

However, the paradox pointed out is similar to the problem of induction, how to discover generality from instances, a point made by Popper in his critique of logical positivism. Theories may be falsified, never verified, because of the problem of induction (Popper, 1968). In relation to our theoretical framework of the significance effect, the emotional significance effect is subcognitive. However, as suggested, the emotional effect motivated by a given work task situation depends on experience, intuition, or what may be described as some kind of subcognitive recognition. The cognitional significance effect relates to the knowledge that the user possesses about the work task situation, and the user reflects his knowledge or expertise in the process of systems interaction.

As such, the information system becomes a medium for efficient computation that recommends particular lines of inferences. A KR is thus a system that defines the fundamental informational structure of concepts, that sanctions a line of thought, and that recommends particular inferences. Furthermore, KR is considered a medium of human expression, a language that enables us to say things about the world. Although there are some important nuances in relation to KOS, we consider KOS types of KR; however, KOS may be highly structured and universal, such as the Colon system (Ranganathan, 1960), or they may be based on ad hoc categorization that meets the needs of a particular group of users (e.g., folksonomies). However, although highly structured and formal systems are well-suited for computer processes, they tend to be less informative for humans. Consequently, when approaching an information system from the perspective of the system (the systems view), three types of sign systems emerge: (a) the sign system of the system itself, that is, the grammar of the system (syntax), the formal system of representation; (b) the sign system of meaning, the intended meaning of the informatio</context>

However, we argue that, even at the fundamental level of communication (Figure 7), where signs are uttered from a generator (utterer) to a recipient (interpreter), the recipient must interpret (or at least recognize) the communicated signs as signs of communication, even though he has not yet understood the intended meaning of the communication, which takes place successively at the next, more developed level of cognition. The communication model illustrated in Figure 6 conforms to the traditional transmission model of communication, originally formulated by Shannon and Weaver (1949). This model also considers the process of communication as a transference of a message from a generator to a recipient, in terms of signals or codes through a channel; and, at the receivers end, the process of JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY—August 2013 DOI: 10.1002/asi 1747 reconstructing the signals received starts in principle from a morphosyntactic–semantic level and is completed when the original message transmitted by the generator is reconstructed by the recipient.

The problem with Ingwersen’s concept of cognitive free fall is that it assumes that communication fundamentally builds upon decontextualized morphosyntactic semantic codes and structures (as formulated by Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1949) that must be reconstructed and contextualized from a syntactical surface level by a perceiving mind before any meaning is established (Figure 9). We believe that the process of communication should be understood the other way around. Meaning emanates before syntax. Consequently, any process of communication involving human minds is perceived from a pragmatic level. Any acts of communication, even signs generated by computer screens, are perceived as signs of meaning before signs of syntax, and the cognitive process of meaning making thus precedes syntactical speculations.

DOI: 10.1002/asi.22858 Introduction The topics of information and knowledge lie at the root of library and information science (LIS), both historically and analytically. In particular, the academic community of LIS, concerned with the organization and retrieval of information, has spent years discussing and clarifying the concepts of information and knowledge and the possible relationship between them (Taylor, 1968; Belkin, Oddy, &amp; Brooks, 1982; Buckland, 1991; Brier, 1996, 2004; Hjørland, 1997, 2004, 2007, 2009; Capurro &amp; Hjørland, 2003; Cornelius, 2004).

Even though the user-oriented view explicitly addresses the concept of knowledge, and even the emotional state of the user (ASK in principle should be considered an emotional state), knowledge is conflated into the realm of information. The consequence is that ASK and information need are conceived as a state of mind that develops from a mental, inarticulate stage to an explicit stage that, with the right tools, can be expressed in the terms of the information system (Taylor, 1968). Whereas the systems view gives priority to systems optimization, the user perspective gives priority to user information-seeking behavior, user tasks, and user interaction. The user is the priority; therefore, user information behavior is observed and evaluated. Whereas the information-seeking process in the systems view is considered in terms of objective relevance criteria as recall and precision, the information-seeking process in the user perspective is evaluated in terms of user satisfaction.
