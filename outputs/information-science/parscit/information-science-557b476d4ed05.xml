This is a report on the impact of library workers’
personal beliefs on provision of vaccination
information. Nine public librarians were interviewed
about a hypothetical scenario involving a patron who
is concerned about possible vaccination-autism
connections. The analysis employed thematic
coding. Results suggested that while most participants supported childhood vaccination, tension
between their personal views and neutrality
impacted their ability to conduct the interaction. The
neutrality stance, though consonant with professional
guidelines, curtails librarians’ ability to provide
accurate health information. Outreach and communication between public and health sciences libraries

The United States is seeing a growing number of
parents refusing or delaying recommended childhood
vaccinations, as well as a rise in vaccine-preventable
diseases [1]. Some of these parents—intentional nonadherents—avoid vaccination because of concerns
about vaccines’ safety and a perceived low susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases [2, 3]. While their
beliefs and attitudes may be strong, most of these
parents appear to be earnestly open to both sides of the
controversy and express the desire for unbiased
information [4]. Other parents—unintentional nonadherents—slip off the vaccination schedule because
of a variety of logistical and socio-demographic factors.
While these parents are generally aware that childhood
vaccination is important, their lack of specific knowledge contributes to low vaccination rates [5]. Both
categories of parents could benefit from skilled help in
navigating vaccination information and understanding
its sources.
While a need for health information is one reason
that the public visits public libraries [6], little is
known about public librarians’ knowledge about
childhood vaccination and vaccination information
resources, as well as their practices in guiding patrons
who are concerned about vaccination. In helping
members of the general public navigate controversial
health information, public librarians likely struggle
with the same tension between neutrality and
advocacy that health sciences librarians experience
when dealing with the information needs of patients
and their families. On the one hand, the principle of
collection neutrality, expressed in the Library Bill of
Rights [7], maintains that particular viewpoints
should not be privileged over others and that a broad
scope of views is required. On the other hand, the
neutrality position has historically been a contested
position, with some professional voices maintaining
that there are times when librarians should be
advocates [8]. This tension in vaccination information
provision is the subject of this research report.
This paper presents an in-depth qualitative study of
nine library workers’ beliefs and attitudes about
childhood vaccination, their knowledge of health
information resources, and their response to a hypothetical reference scenario involving a young mother
who is concerned about a possible connection between
childhood vaccination and autism. In particular, the
authors were interested in exploring the potential
impact of personal beliefs, as well as the role of
mitigating factors such as professional standards and
knowledge about resources, on provision of information about vaccination. The impetus for the study was
Flaherty and Luther’s investigation of public librarians’ responses to pseudo-patrons’ questions about the
connection between autism and vaccination [9].

The nine participants in this study (five white, three
African American, one Hispanic; seven women,
two men) worked in eight public libraries in four
library systems: the District of Columbia, Montgomery County and Prince George’s County (Maryland),
and Fairfax County (Virginia). Eight held master
of library science (MLS) degrees; one was a paraprofessional. The four systems were chosen to
represent a diversity of public library branches in
the area. The general region was chosen because of
its proximity to the institution of one of the principal
investigators.

Administrators at the four library systems collectively
suggested eight libraries as representative. The
eight library directors were asked to identify library
workers with considerable reference responsibilities.
Protocol{
The library workers completed a short questionnaire
and participated in one-on-one, semi-structured interviews led by an undergraduate student. The
interviews included questions about common consumer health information requests, librarians’ collections and preferred health information sources, and
their beliefs about the role of public libraries in
addressing consumer health information needs. It also
presented two scenarios involving hypothetical patrons’ queries: one about Medicare Part D and the
other about childhood vaccination and autism. General results and the complete interview guide can be
found elsewhere [10]. The section of the interview
pertaining to addressing a vaccination query provided the basis for this study:
&amp; We are interested in your own views about one
kind of health information, which is about vaccination. It would be very helpful if you could fill out the
following short questionnaire. (See the questionnaire
below.) Could you please talk a bit about each of your
answers.
&amp; Imagine that a patron, a young mother, approached
you because she was concerned that vaccinations may
cause autism. She is looking for information. What
resources would you suggest to her and why?
&amp; We’d like to hear about what you think are the
challenges of this kind of question.
The questionnaire, modified from previous studies
on attitudes toward vaccination [3, 11], asked participants to rate their agreement or disagreement with
the following statements:

Summary of personal positions on vaccination
Review of the responses to the questionnaire reveals
that none of the participants were opposed to
vaccination. All agreed or strongly agreed that
vaccines are necessary; no one disagreed that vaccines
are safe. Yet, nuanced analysis of response patterns
suggested a different level of internal consistency of
participants’ beliefs. Three patterns of response
emerged. We identify our participants as Staunch,
Concerned, and Tentative Believers (Figure 1).
Three positions
Staunch Believers. Participants 5, 8, and 9 were the
Staunch Believers: They not only saw vaccines as
‘‘necessary for the individual, but also for public
health’’ (Participant 5), but also disagreed or strongly
disagreed with the statement that ‘‘serious side effects
can occur with vaccination.’’ This disagreement did not
mean that they saw the likelihood of side effects as the
absolute statistical zero; rather, they viewed risks as
minimal and benefits as highly exceeding the risks. For
example, Participant 5 stated, ‘‘I do understand that
every once in a while there are some side effects to some
vaccines, [but] the side effects are very moderate…, so
it’s better than getting whatever the ailment is.’’
These participants viewed eradication of vaccinepreventable diseases as a remarkable human achievement and denial of vaccination as voluntarily giving
up a major public health victory. For example, on
noting that ‘‘some diseases that we thought were
stamped back are coming back,’’ Participant 8
continued, ‘‘I think that it would be a shame to slip
back to those days where we know how to prevent
something and we are not.’’
Concerned Believers. Participants 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6
agreed (Participant 6) or strongly agreed (the rest) that
vaccines are necessary. They also agreed (Participant
3) or strongly agreed that without vaccination, a child
might get a disease and cause others to get it (the rest).

standard deviations from the mean were the following: SB (participants 5, 8, 9): 0–0.58; CB (participants 1, 2, 3, 4, 6): 0.45–0.89. As there was only 1 TB (participant 7),
no standard deviation can be reported.
However, four of the five ‘‘Slightly agreed’’ that
serious side effects can occur with vaccination. One
(Participant 6) strongly agreed with this view.
Like Staunch Believers, Concerned Believers see
many individual and societal values in vaccination.
This is exemplified by Participant 4’s statement, ‘‘I
think that [vaccines] are for the good of the child and
of society at large.’’ Where Concerned Believers
differed from Staunch Believers was in their perception of vaccination-related risks, which they described
in more specific, palpable terms. For example, when
explaining her opinion about whether vaccines were
safe, Participant 1 stated, ‘‘Generally safe.’’ She then
continued, ‘‘I won’t say that all of them are safe…You
need to take into consideration allergies and the
health problems of the individual and this kind of
thing. Okay, see, problem with this is that you can’t
say that it’s absolutely safe.’’
Despite their concerns about vaccine safety, these
participants weighted the risk/benefit ratio in favor of
vaccination. For example, Participant 3 stated, ‘‘I
J Med Lib Assoc 102(3) July 2014
believe in vaccinations and I think that they’re
important; if I had a child I would vaccinate them.’’
She continued by saying, ‘‘However there are side
effects, or there could be side effects…So I understand
why some people are hesitant.’’
Tentative Believer. Of all the participants in the study,
Participant 7 had the most tentative attitudes toward
vaccination. It appears that his tentativeness stemmed
not so much from concerns about vaccine safety, as from
beliefs in natural immunity and individual differences
in immune response that diminish the positive value of
vaccination. In explaining why he ‘‘Slightly agreed’’ that
without vaccinations a child might get a disease, this
participant said, ‘‘You are not necessarily always going
to get that disease because it depends…[For example], I
have a strong resistance to malaria. I could be in a
malaria area and I won’t get it. But then somebody else
might not have the same resistance I have and they’ll get
malaria.’’ This participant similarly invoked individual
differences in immune response when explaining his

Research reports: Keselman et al.
slight disagreement with the statement that serious side
effects can occur with vaccination. Although this
participant viewed susceptibility to vaccine-predictable
diseases and vaccine reaction as highly individualized,
he nevertheless agreed with the statement that vaccines
are necessary.
Distinction between personal views and
professional role
In discussing their role in helping the hypothetical
patron, participants often mentioned remaining neutral and abstaining from expressing their personal
views as essential to their mission. The value of
neutrality was upheld by participants regardless of
their personal beliefs about vaccination. For example,
Participant 2, a concerned believer, eloquently stated,
‘‘as a professional librarian, it’s not my job to tell
people whether they should vaccinate their children
or not. And I wouldn’t give my opinion about that.’’
Recommended resources
Participants had been presented with a hypothetical
patron scenario in which a young mother approached
them because she was concerned that vaccinations
might cause autism. A hypothetical patron described by
a third party in an interview setting away from the
reference desk is very different from a real patron
standing at the desk asking for information. For that
reason, the interviewees had difficulty making specific
suggestions. Two people indicated that they would use
‘‘library-subscribed,’’ ‘‘consumer health,’’ or ‘‘magazine
databases’’ (Participants 8 and 9) or ‘‘books on autism’’
(Participant 9); another referred to a ‘‘relatively neutral’’
book in her library’s collection covering vaccination
‘‘pros and cons.’’ However, most subjects could name
specific electronic resources. Participants from all three
philosophical positions mentioned resources from the
Department of Health and Human Services, National
Institutes of Health (NIH), and National Library of
Medicine (NLM), specifically, PubMed and MedlinePlus. One of the cautious supporters (Participant 2) also
mentioned an ‘‘autism awareness organization website.’’ Finally, the Tentative Believer mentioned WebMD
and Mercola.com, which is one of the most ‘‘heavily
trafficked’’ alternative medicine sites [13] officially
warned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
[14].
Justification of source selection
When asked why they would turn to particular
resources, participants attempted to adhere to two
not easily compatible positions: dedication to neutrality, requiring them to present a broad spectrum of
opinions, and dedication to information quality,
represented by sources with traits of authoritativeness, reliability, and a solid base of evidence.
Staunch Believers and Cautious Believers. While
these participants believed in the importance of
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.980552">
208
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999015893617021">
childhood vaccination, they refrained from letting
their views guide their resource selection toward
advocacy. For example, Participant 5 would take the
concerned mother to two types of library books: the
‘‘health section about vaccinations’’ and ‘‘books about
vaccines as a social issue.’’ His response positioned a
vaccination decision as a social, rather than a scientific
debate.
While participants tended to refrain from expressing their personal opinions, they were strong believers in providing quality information. ‘‘Quality,’’ for
these respondents, meant that a resource was ‘‘reliable’’ and free of bias, particularly commercial bias.
This clearly conflicted with their desire to present the
patron with ‘‘both sides’’ of the debate. For example,
Participant 5 stated at one point, ‘‘I will give them all
the books, I will put both [sides] out there,’’ but at
another point in the interview, maintained, ‘‘I would
be pretty reluctant to use a private website, like a drug
company.’’ Participant 2 was equally ambivalent,
making statements that advocated neutrality, while
also favoring ‘‘primarily government,’’ ‘‘unbiased’’
sources.
One attempt to reconcile these positions involved
presenting a broad range of information sources,
while supporting patrons’ evaluations of that information. Several respondents spoke to this directly. For
example, Participant 1 stated: ‘‘We have several
books…one of them…tries to look at the pros and
cons of vaccination. It tries to be relatively neutral…it
won’t push one side or the other.’’ Soon after, this
participant suggested that the young mother could
visit ‘‘websites like PubMed and MedlinePlus and be
taken to sources that specialize in autism’’ to compare
‘‘the probability of getting [vaccine preventable]
illness or problem if you do not get the vaccine’’ with
‘‘the likelihood [that]…vaccines can cause autism.’’
Tentative Believer. In discussing his strategies, Participant 7 established himself as a strong proponent of
neutrality. He said (as previously quoted), ‘‘I like to
give all different viewpoints to the person to make sure
that they see all different sides of the arguments.’’ Also,
his list of suggested resources spanned a variety of
information sources and positions on vaccination: ‘‘I
would give her a couple of different sites to see the
various viewpoints…like Dr. Mercola, a traditional site
like WebMD, and NIH or NLM site concerning any
studies from PubMed…concerning vaccination and
autism. And then I would show her copies of any
books we have related to that.’’ This participant did not
discuss criteria for ‘‘quality’’ information and did not
explicitly exclude any types of information sources.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

<bodyText confidence="0.999630014925373">
The objective of this report was to conduct a study
into library workers’ personal beliefs about childhood
vaccination, their knowledge of health information
resources, and the impact of personal beliefs on
vaccination information provision.
J Med Lib Assoc 102(3) July 2014
Research reports: Keselman et al.
The study had some limitations that need to be considered in interpreting the findings. The small sample,
necessitated by the interview methodology befitting the
research question, did not allow the authors to generalize our findings about our participants’ mostly
strongly pro-vaccination stances to the general population of public librarians. The study involved a hypothetical scenario, which prevented participants from
drawing on the richness of verbal and nonverbal cues
inherent in a real reference interaction. In addition, this
was not a study of reference interviews, which meant
that participants’ strategies for completely meeting real
patrons’ information needs could not be explored in real
depth. These limitations might well explain the lack of
specificity in recommended resources.
With regard to this report, the most salient findings
are two areas of professional tension. The first is
between participants’ personal views (largely supportive of vaccination) and the view that they feel
they can bring to the reference transaction, that is, no
views. The second is between neutrality (the abovementioned view of bringing no views) and commitment to information quality. While the neutrality
stance is completely consonant with professional
practice guidelines, avoidance of the information
quality problem has the potential to limit public
librarians’ ability to promote and support public
health. Are librarians simply conduits to sources
containing answers to questions, or are they socially
responsible agents in the transaction? The answer to
this question affects not only collection development
and maintenance—the arena in which ‘‘neutrality’’ is
traditionally explored—but also reference services,
since library workers turn to their institution’s
collections to answer questions. This professional
dilemma is an old one. It has been articulated and
argued about since the dawn of the public library
‘‘medical department’’ in the 1880s [15]. It was refined
in the early years of the AIDS epidemic [16], in the
context of the library’s obligation to provide information on condoms to teenagers. It was also recently
underlined in two other health-related contexts.
Malizia and Vargas wrote about the support that
public libraries and library staff provide in the event
of natural disasters as information hubs and as
shelters [17]. Public libraries have also been identified
as information resources about enrollment for coverage through the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act [18].
Our small study also has implications for health
sciences librarians who work with consumers and
patients on the particular issue of vaccination. First, it
is clear that the public library can be a source of useful
health information. The public library workers we
interviewed would be able to direct their real-life
patrons to many reliable, authoritative consumer
health electronic and print resources. Second, our
scenario centered on a controversial topic: autism and
a purported connection to childhood vaccination. This
social issue is a public health concern with implications for any clinic: it directly affects families’
potential communication with their children’s health
J Med Lib Assoc 102(3) July 2014
care providers. This controversial topic can be
addressed through the professional channels, such
as outreach programs, through which information
professionals of different types communicate with
and educate each other. Public library workers, after
all, are consumers, too, and are likely to have
questions about vaccines themselves.

In particular, the authors were interested in exploring the potential impact of personal beliefs, as well as the role of mitigating factors such as professional standards and knowledge about resources, on provision of information about vaccination. The impetus for the study was Flaherty and Luther’s investigation of public librarians’ responses to pseudo-patrons’ questions about the connection between autism and vaccination [9]. 205 Research reports: Keselman et al. METHODS Participants The nine participants in this study (five white, three African American, one Hispanic; seven women, two men) worked in eight public libraries in four library systems: the District of Columbia, Montgomery County and Prince George’s County (Maryland), and Fairfax County (Virginia). Eight held master of library science (MLS) degrees; one was a paraprofessional. The four systems were chosen to represent a diversity of public library branches in the area.
