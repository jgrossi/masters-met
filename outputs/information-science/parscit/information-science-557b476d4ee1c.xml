Exploring
the
Conceptualization
of
Augmented
Reality
and
its
Implications
for
the
User
in
the
Field
of
Library

Elizabeth

ABSTRACT
Augmented
reality
(AR)
technology
has
implications
for
the
ways
that
the
field
of
library
and
information
science
(LIS)
serves
users
and
organizes
information.
Through
content
analysis,
the
author
examined
how
AR
is
conceptualized
within
a
sample
of
LIS
literature
from
the
Library,
Information
Science
and
Technology
Abstracts
(LISTA)
database
and
Google
Blogs
postings.
The
author
also
examined
whether
Radical
Change
Theory
(RCT)
and
the
digital-­‐age
principles
of
interactivity,
connectivity,
and
access
are
present
in
the
discussion
of
this
technology.
The
analysis
of
data
led
to
the
identification
of
14
categories
comprising
132
total
codes
across
sources
within
the
data
set.
The
analysis
indicates
that
the
conceptualization
of
AR,
while
inconsistent,
suggests
expectations
that
the
technology
will
enhance
the
user
experience.
This
can
lead
to
future
examinations
of
user
behavior,
response,
and
observation
of
technologies
like
AR.
INTRODUCTION
It
seems
an
understatement
to
say
digital
technology
is
changing
quickly.
Cell
phones
are
like
small
computers
in
our
pockets;
we
have
access
to
far
greater
computing
resources
in
“the
cloud”
than
we
did
just
five
years
ago,
and
computers
are
processing
at
speeds
once
only
a
fantasy.
This
digital
revolution
includes
the
continued
development
of
augmented
reality
(AR)
applications.
At
its
simplest,
AR
is
a
blending
of
the
physical
environment
with
digital
elements.
As
with
many
of
the
latest
technologies,
the
development
of
AR
is
interdisciplinary.
Professionals
in
the
fields
of
computer
science,
psychology,
and
philosophy
seem
to
direct
the
discussion
on
the
development
and
application
of
AR
technology,
as
evidenced
by
the
volume
of
literature
when
searching
these
subject
databases
for
articles
pertaining
to
AR.
The
field
of
library
and
information
science
(LIS)
seems
largely
absent
from
the
conversation.
While
elements
of
AR,
such
as
global
positioning
systems
(GPS),
quick
response
(QR)
codes,
and
virtual
reality
are
not
uncommon
in
LIS
literature,
rarely
are
these
topics
defined
as
AR.
Information
theory,
information
behavior,
knowledge
management,
information
architecture,
and
digital
literacy
(to
name
only
a
few)
are
key
areas
of
study
within
LIS,
which
can
be
central

developing
and
exploring
AR.
The
focus
on
and
the
definitions
of
the
user
within
LIS
provide
a
much
different
perspective
on
the
human
aspect
of
engaging
with
digital
information
than
is
found
within
computer
science.
Literature
on
human-­‐computer
interaction
focuses
more
on
the
user
as
a
piece
of
the
system,
with
a
shift
only
recently
toward
acknowledging
this
misdirected
focus.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
Libraries
and
information
agencies
have
the
tools
and
skills—with
regard
to
user
interaction
with
and
use
of
information—to
help
answer
questions
relating
to
how
the
conceptualization
of
a
technology
like
AR
influences
the
use
of
the
technology.
Augmented
Reality
(AR)
Defined
What
is
AR,
really?
Ronald
Azuma,
a
pioneer
and
innovator
in
the
research
and
creation
of
AR
applications,
describes
AR
as
a
supplement
to
reality.9
It
combines
the
real
and
the
virtual,
aligning
the
virtual
with
the
real
environment.10
AR
is
part
of
a
mixed
reality
continuum,
and
“the
technology
depends
on
our
ability
to
make
coherent
space
from
sensory
information.”11
This
coherent
space
is
dependent
on
several
variables,
one
of
which
is
AR’s
real-­‐time
interactivity.
AR
applications
cannot
experience
any
delays
in
response
time;
if
the
real
and
virtual
are
misaligned,
it
impedes
the
sense
of
reality.
AR
needs
to
happen
at
the
same
speed
as
real
life—virtual
actions
coinciding
with
human
actions,
and
variable
across
users.
Some
also
view
AR
as
a
new
media
experience,
adding
to
the
growing
list
of
digital
literacies.
“While
the
pure
technology
provides
a
set
of
features
that
can
be
exploited,
the
features
of
the
new
technology
will
develop
into
one
or
more
particular
forms
within
a
particular
historical
and
cultural
setting.”12
This
includes
“remediating”
existing
media,
such
as
film
or
stage
productions,
with
AR
components.
As
a
result,
AR
is
contextual
and
reliant
on
each
personal
experience,
but
it
also
borrows
from
earlier
forms
of
media
within
those
contexts
and
experiences.
For
this
reason,
it
is
important
to
examine
just
how
those
within
LIS
are
constructing
AR
as
a
concept.
The
rapid
pace
at
which
AR
is
evolving
and
gaining
in
popularity
suggests
those
within
the
field
of
LIS
will
need
to
be
aware
of
new
applications
for
the
technology
as
more
and
more
users
may
come
to
expect
access
to
and
knowledge
of
this
technology.
Much
of
the
literature
also
references
AR
as
being
an
enhancement.
But
what,
exactly,
is
AR
enhancing?
The
answer
includes
our
senses
and
perceptions,13
software,14
our
emotions
and
feelings,15
and
question-­‐answering
programs.16
Authors
use
the
term
enhancement
with
no
explanation
of
how
it
is
defined
in
each
piece
of
literature.
Some
assume
more
is
always
better.
Missing
is
the
voice
of
the
user
or
consumer,
whom
authors
refer
to
as
a
subject
or
wearer.
The
irony
is
many
of
these
users
are
the
ones
creating,
building,
and
populating
these
AR
worlds.
I
propose
the
field
of
LIS
is
in
a
prime
position
to
address
the
missing
piece
of
the
research
and
discourse
of
AR.

Many
of
the
technological
enhancements
authors
describe
in
the
AR
literature
connect
to
the
development
of
knowledge,
one
of
the
main
goals
of
computing.17
There
are
a
variety
of
settings
in
which
some
expect
AR
to
create
new
routes
to
knowledge.
Within
a
library
setting,
AR
can
improve
library
instruction,18
provide
information
retrieval
about
shelved
books
through
recognition
applications,19
reconstruct
and
restore
artifacts,20
and
deliver
services
at
point
of
need
through
QR
codes.21
Others
view
AR
as
a
technological
breakthrough
with
extreme
potential
in
medical
fields,
such
as
non-­‐invasive
surgical
visualization,
which
can
display
the
organs
through
sensors
placed
on
the
body,
helping
medical
practitioners
and
students
to
understand
internal
body
functions.22
AR
is
also
said
to
perform
some
of
its
“enhancements”
in
the
classroom.23
Augmented
books
are
growing
in
number
and
are
expected
to
enhance
collaboration
and
interactivity
between
students.
Some
allow
more
than
one
person
to
explore
the
same
content
at
the
same
time
or
outside
of
the
classroom
through
mobile
technology;
others
give
students
the
ability
to
rotate,
tilt,
and
manipulate
viewing
angles
of
various
objects.24
AR
technology
within
art
education
is
said
to
have
a
positive
impact
on
student
motivation.25
In
a
2010
study,
reference
librarians
at
the
University
of
Manitoba
were
given
smartphones
and
asked
to
create
innovative
projects.
What
they
came
up
with
resulted
in
a
public
art
project
using
social
networks,
GPS
software,
and
AR
technology
that
allowed
users
to
interact
with
the
art
pieces
through
QR
codes.26
Again
and
again,
interactivity,
connectivity,
and
mobility
of
AR
applications
are
highlighted
as
efficient
and
motivating
factors
in
education
and
learning.27,28,29,30
Organizations
are
also
testing
AR
applications
for
general
public
use.
Museums
and
galleries
contain
AR
virtual
displays
of
artifacts
and
historic
scenes,
personalizing
interactive
experiences
and
providing
multiple
perspectives
of
events
and
artifacts.31
The
Natural
History
Museum
in
London,
for
example,
created
the
Attenborough
Studio
in
2009
for
live
events
and
the
viewing
of
AR
enhanced
films.32
AR
tours
are
also
offered
on
historic
places
and
spaces.
Augmented
reality
is
already
in
use
as
a
tour
guide
application,33
to
supplement
paper
maps,34
and
even
to
reconstruct
damaged
historic
sites.35
AR
is
essentially
a
mutable
form
of
displaying
what
are
typically
static
objects
and
ideas.
The
use
of
AR
is
integrative.
It
can
saturate
real
landscapes,
places,
and
spaces
with
virtual
characteristics;
it
can
add
to
or
hide
objects
in
the
environment.36
Manipulation
of
the
environment
promotes
“immersive
experiences,”37
multifaceted
for
different
people
interacting
with
AR.38
Virtual
experiences
are
expected
to
enhance
the
real-­‐life
experiences
of
the
user.
Spaces
can
become
layered,
or
scaffold,
not
only
through
depth
perception
or
AR
software,
but
also
through
the
user’s
contextual
life
experiences.39
With
growing
widespread
use,
it
is
imperative
for
those
in
the
field
of
LIS
to
understand
this
technology
and
how
it
is
used.
How
will
these
applications
be
archived?
Will
institutions
and
organizations
collaborate
with
users
in
creating
these
applications?
Will
users
expect
librarians
and
other
knowledge
workers
to
help
them
understand
and
use
the
technology?
Will
libraries

other
institutions
use
the
technology,
and
if
so,
in
what
capacity?
These
are
just
some
of
the
questions
LIS
professionals
should
be
asking
to
ensure
they
are
meeting
user
needs
in
relation
to
technology
and
the
access
of
information
through
technology.
This
study
provides
a
base
for
considering
these
questions,
and
the
effects
of
AR,
by
situating
the
concept
and
expectations
of
AR
within
the
field
and
aligning
the
conceptualization
with
Radical
Change
Theory.
The
User
Within
AR
and
LIS
The
use
of
AR
can
bring
with
it
an
altering
of
emotional
and
psychological
experiences.
Pederson
argues
AR
applications
should
be
“human-­‐centric”.40
Because
human
beings
“instrumentalize”
technology
such
as
AR,
the
technology
itself
should
accommodate
the
human
needs
for
AR
tools.41
For
AR
applications
to
be
successful,
they
must
display
the
human
characteristics
encompassing
reactions
to
one
another
and
the
environment.42
Applications
blurring
the
lines
between
the
real
and
the
virtual,
and
engaging
the
person
in
ways
that
play
on
perception,
are
capable
of
changing
the
real-­‐life
perceptions
and
expectations
of
the
user.
AR
can
be
either
a
form
of
escapism
for
brief
moments
or
an
escape
from
what
we
know
of
as
real-­‐life
for
good.43
What
much
of
the
research
assumes
is
the
desire
for
AR
applications.
Lacking
is
surveys
of
user
desire
for
AR,
or
examination
of
potential
negative
consequences.
A
user-­‐focus
is
central
to
LIS
and
the
values
of
librarianship.
Within
all
these
potential
uses,
what
is
not
being
discussed
is
how
creators
of
AR
applications
organize,
categorize
and
choose
the
information
contained
within
these
applications.
Much
of
the
discussion
surrounding
the
implications
of
AR
use
is
left
to
those
in
fields
of
philosophy
and
psychology,
dealing
in
abstraction.
The
research
and
marketing
of
AR
applications
promote
passive
acceptance
of
AR
technologies.44
There
comes
a
point
when
AR
researchers
must
ask,
to
what
extent
are
potential
users
aware
of
and
desirous
of
AR
applications?
The
notion
of
people
as
users
is
quite
similar
to
the
contextualization
of
human
as
subject
in
this
scientific
literature,
different
from
the
notion
of
user
in
LIS.
In
computer-­‐science
literature,
users
are
those
reacting
to
AR
and
providing
AR
researchers
with
content
for
AR
modification
as
evaluators
of
the
technology.
Within
computer-­‐science
literature,
there
is
much
talk
of
the
user’s
satisfaction
with
tested
AR
applications;45
there
also
much
talk
of
the
user’s
position
within
the
AR
frame/environment.46
Similar
is
the
discussion
of
the
user
and
the
physical
space
of
the
AR
application,
and
how
the
user
responds
to
the
AR
functions.47
User
and
subject
are
terms
used
interchangeably
in
the
scientific
literature.
These
terms
are
largely
undefined,
indicating
little
regard
for
the
role
of
the
human
outside
of
objectification
as
a
tool
working
in
the
AR
environment.
Within
the
field
of
LIS,
the
notion
of
the
user
takes
on
different
characteristics:
users
are
clearly
patrons,
human
beings,
for
which
LIS
provides
a
service.

anxiety,
as
developed
by
Mellon,
pivots
on
the
emotions
and
psychological
responses
of
information-­‐seekers,
or
users.50
There
are
many
more
theories
and
models
demonstrating
this
user-­‐centric
focus
in
LIS.
Case
points
to
Dervin’s
1976
article
“Strategies
for
Dealing
with
Human
Information
Needs:
Information
or
Communication?”
as
an
exemplar
of
the
shift
in
thinking
about
the
role
and
needs
of
the
user
in
LIS.51
Dervin
pointed
to
assumptions
in
research
on
information-­‐
seeking,
such
as
more
information
as
better,
and
relevant
information
existing
for
every
need.
It
is
important
to
note
whether
there
are
assumptions
now
being
made
in
LIS
literature
with
regard
to
user
interaction
with
AR
and
how
best
to
understand
user-­‐centered
design
of
AR
applications.
Bowler
et
al.
define
user-­‐centered
design
as
“[reflecting]
the
user,
typically
from
a
cognitive,
affective
or
behavioral
point
of
view,
as
well
as
the
social,
organizational,
and
cultural
contexts
in
which
users
function.”52
These
points
of
view—the
cognitive,
social,
behavioral,
and
the
like—all
synchronize
within
AR
applications.
Bowler
et
al.
state,
“With
the
increased
use
of
digital,
networked
information
tools
in
daily
practice
and
the
emergence
of
the
digital
library
and
archive,
it
is
impossible
to
separate
the
service
from
the
system.
In
this
context,
understanding
the
user
becomes
more
critical
than
ever.”53
With
the
advent
of
AR
and
its
dependence
on
user
interaction,
it
is
imperative
to
continue
to
address
the
role
of
the
user.
O’Brien
and
Toms
further
the
discussion
by
trying
to
define
user
engagement
with
technology.
The
authors
define
engagement
as
a
process,
composed
of
three
states:
a
point
of
engagement,
a
period
of
engagement
and
then
finally
disengagement.54
Attention
to
user
needs
and
behavior
as
an
individualized
process
is
evident
across
LIS
literature.
Shu
suggests
user
engagement
in
website
design
as
a
means
to
strengthening
user
relationships
with
organizations
through
a
study
of
Web
2.0
[interactive
internet
applications].55
Idoughi,
Seffah,
and
Kolski
recommend
integrating
“personae,”
or
perceived
personality
types
and
characteristics,
into
user-­‐design
to
address
challenges
in
creating
software
offering
highly
personalized
services.56
Pang
and
Schauder
take
a
community-­‐based
approach
to
systems
design,
particularly
in
libraries
and
museums
and
encourage
system
designers
to
draw
on
the
study
of
relationships
and
interaction
within
different
communities
as
a
means
to
gain
insight
into
more
user-­‐centric
design
methods.57
A
user-­‐centric
focus
has
extended
itself
to
catalog
design58
and
information-­‐retrieval
systems
design.59
It
has
been
applied
as
a
learning
approach
to
organizational
culture
within
libraries.60
Scholarly
research
within
the
library
is
said
also
to
have
benefitted
because
a
user-­‐centric
focus
informs
how
different
types
of
users
interact
with
information
within
the
library.61
Through
an
analysis
of
user
language,
user-­‐centricity
is
also
applied
as
a
means
to
identify
strategies
for
creating
language
tools
for
web
searching.62
Such
studies
are
representative
of
the
ways
a
user-­‐
centric
paradigm
proliferates
within
LIS.
These
models
and
studies
highlight
the
importance
of
the
user
perspective
and
how
the
user
engages
with
information
at
various
levels.
Radical
Change
Theory
(RCT),
developed
by
Eliza
Dresang
in
1999,
goes
one
step
further
and
adds
another
element
to
the
user-­‐information
interaction:
the
user’s
interaction
with
other
users
and
the
response
to

and
digital
technologies
in
which
information
is
becoming
embedded.
This
element
is
mirrored
in
such
applications
as
Twitter
and
Foursquare,
which
allow
digital
overlays
of
information
to
see
if
there
are
individuals
“near
you”
also
logged
on
to
these
networking
applications.
The
highly
complex
AR
applications
call
for
a
highly
complex
view
of
human
interaction
with
those
applications.
Radical
Change
Theory
helps
to
explicate
the
characteristics
of
human
expectations
and
interactions
with
information
in
digital
formats.
Coupled
with
an
examination
of
AR
discourse
within
LIS
literature,
RCT
helps
clarify
how
people,
or
users,
are
approaching
the
changing
information
landscape.
RESEARCH
APPROACH
This
study
focuses
on
the
user-­‐centric
paradigm
prevalent
in
LIS,
seeking
to
understand
the
relationship
between
the
conceptualization
of
an
emerging
technology
and
the
role
of
the
user.
The
research
questions
guiding
this
study
are
the
following:
•
•
How
is
augmented
reality
(AR)
conceptualized
in
LIS?
What
is
the
role
of
the
user
in
relation
to
AR
as
it
is
conceptualized
in
LIS?
The
aim
is
to
understand
how
a
specifically
LIS
user-­‐centric
focus
can
apply
to
the
conceptualization
of
AR
and
its
use
within
libraries
and
cultural
heritage
institutions.
The
model
for
this
study
is
Clement
and
Levine,
which
examined
how
pre-­‐1978
dissertations
were
published
and
what
the
concept
of
copyright
was
for
those
dissertations.
The
unit
of
sampling
in
their
study
was
the
written
message,
“defined
as
a
complete
statement
or
series
of
statements
with
a
distinct
start
and
end.”
Each
message
under
investigation
required
author-­‐specified
semantic
concepts.
The
researchers
then
selected
recording
units,
what
they
describe
as
“explicit
assertions”
pertaining
to
the
publication
of
dissertations.
The
authors
delineated
explicit
assertions
as
taking
several
forms,
from
a
phrase
within
a
sentence
to
a
multipage
argument.63
For
the
purpose
of
this
study,
I
investigated
written
messages
contained
in
the
journals
and
blog
posts
I
chose
as
well
as
links
to
other
webpages
or
blog
posts
contained
in
the
initial
data
set.
The
semantic
concept
is
the
term
augmented
reality.
The
recording
unit
is
any
explicit
assertions
made
regarding
augmented
reality
using
the
same
range
of
form
as
Clement
and
Levine.64
In
this
study,
I
allied
content
analysis
with
Radical
Change
Theory
(RCT).
RCT
focuses
on
the
characteristics
of
interactivity,
connectivity,
and
access,
which
are
all
dependent
on
measures
of
human
connections
through
various
forms
of
media.
The
characteristics
of
these
principles
are
as
follows:
• Interactivity
refers
to
dynamic,
user-­‐initiated,
nonlinear,
nonsequential,
complex
information
behavior,
and
representation.
• Connectivity
refers
to
the
sense
of
community
or
construction
of
social
worlds
that
emerge
from
changing
perspectives
and
expanded
associations.

• Access
refers
to
the
breaking
of
long-­‐standing
information
barriers,
bringing
entrée
to
a
wide
diversity
of
opinion
and
opportunity.65
Content
analysis
of
LIS
literature
related
to
AR
through
the
RCT
framework
allowed
me
to
find
connections
between
the
conceptualization
of
a
technology
and
how
the
conceptualization
functions
within
a
given
academic
community.
During
the
data
analysis,
I
assessed
whether
the
characteristics
of
interactivity,
connectivity,
and
access
are
present
in
the
descriptors
of
AR.
Understanding
how
AR
is
brought
into
the
discourse
of
LIS
in
LIS
literature
helps
describe
the
ways
an
emerging
technology
is
developed
as
a
concept
and
as
a
tool
through
an
examination
of
how
researchers
and
practitioners
perceive
the
need
for
and
use
of
AR.

to
the
conceptualization.
All
the
searches
took
place
over
three
months,
December
2012
to
February
2013,
and
all
searches
centered
on
the
search
term
“augmented

(the
term
was
enclosed
in
quotation
marks
in
the

Through
purposeful
criterion
sampling,
all
search
results
including
the
term
“augmented

are
included
in
the
initial
list
of
data
for
analysis.
I
chose
the
Google
Blogs
search
engine
because
of
its
popularity,
familiarity,
ease
of
use,
and
variety
of
viewpoints.
Blogs
are
an
important
source
of
data
because
they
continue
to
increase
in
popularity
across
disciplines,
including
LIS,
and
serve
as
a
way
for
people
to
communicate
with
one
another
and
exchange
information.66
The
LISTA
database
is
easy
to
access;
provided
free
to
libraries;
familiar
to
students,
faculty,
and
professionals
in
the
field
of
LIS;
and
covers
a
broad
spectrum
of
general
and
specialized
journals.
Together,
search
results
comprise
both
academic
and
popular,
or
mainstream,
sources.
Google
Blogs
I
first
gathered
data
from
searches
of
Google
Blogs.
I
conducted
two
separate
searches
of
the
search
term
“augmented
reality.”
The
first
was
in
December
2012
and
the
second
was
in
February
2013.
The
first
search
yielded
373
results
and
the
second
yielded
376.
I
used
the
advanced
search
function
to
limit
the
search
to
blog
postings
between
June
2012
and
December
2012.
The

After

removed
duplicate
and
foreign-­‐language
results
to
compile
one
complete
data
set
of
160
articles.
Recording
units
from
the
articles,
blog,
or
social
media
postings
I
collected
from
these
searches
include
explicit
assertions
concerning
AR
I
then
coded.
For
the
purposes
of
this
exploratory
study,
I
developed
codes
inductively
rather
than
approaching
the
data
with
a
predetermined
set
of
codes,
as
inductive
codes
arise
from
the
interpretation
of
the
coded
data.67
An
example
of
an
assertion
in
the
dataset
includes
the
following,
taken
from
an
article
in
my
pilot
study:
AR
is
a
very
efficient
technology
for
both
higher
education
such
as
universities
and
colleges.
Students
in
both
schools
can
improve
their
knowledge
and
skills,
especially
on
complex
theories
or
mechanisms
of
systems
or
machinery.68
I
categorized
these
assertions
according
to
the
themes
or
codes
with
which
they
are
embedded.
For
instance,
in
the
assertion
above,
the
notion
that
AR
is
efficient
and
capable
of
improving
or
adding
to
knowledge
and
skills
could
be
categorized
within
similar
assertions
about
the
value
or
purpose
of
AR.
After
I
organized
the
codes
and
categories,
I
determined
which,
if
any,
of
these
codes
coincide
with
the
digital
age
principles
of
RCT
interactivity,
connectivity,
and
access.
I
developed
132
codes.
A
further
reduction
of
codes
is
not
feasible
given
the
myriad
ways
AR
is
defined
across
sources
in
the
data
set,
which
underscores
the
lack
of
consensus
on
just
how
AR
is
truly
understood.
I
went
through
the
codes
and
grouped
them
according
to
similarities
and
overarching
themes
labeled
as
categories.
The
132
codes
make
up
14
categories,
listed
in
table
1.
How
is
AR
conceptualized
in
LIS?
The
LISTA
database
includes
more
than
560
journals
from
LIS
and
related
information-­‐science
fields
such
as
communication
and
museum
studies.
Of
the
77
LISTA
sources
included
in
the
data
set
for
this
study,
46
sources
are
peer-­‐reviewed;
</figure>
<page confidence="0.895674">

<figure confidence="0.999488736956521">
are
not.
Of
those
journals
not
peer-­‐reviewed,
all
of
them
focus
specifically
on
issues
in
the
media,
technology,
education
or
libraries.
Based
on
my
analysis,
the
categories
or
overarching
themes
most
prominent
in
the
LISTA
data
set
are
“AR
as
a
new
direction,”
“AR
as
informational,”
and
“AR
as
an
enhancement.”
Taken
together,
these
categories
suggest
AR
can
deliver
information
and
the
user
can
interact
with
information
through
an
enhanced
experience,
which
is
a
new
direction
in
technology.
Individually,
these
categories
are
loaded
with
implications
based
on
the
codes
each
category
encompasses.
The
category
of
AR
as
a
new
direction
itself
includes
twenty-­‐five
codes.
The
codes
include
assertions
of
“AR
as
a
new
normal,
providing
opportunities”
for
those
willing
to
implement
the
technology
because
of
its
“potential,
versatile”
(yet
debatable)
range
of
uses
from
the
business
sector
to
education.

While
the
technology
still
needs
development
in
terms
of
user
awareness
of
the
technology,
a
clear
definition
of
the
technology,
and
an
understanding
of
its
full
range
of
uses,
some
view
it
as
a
trend
that
raises
the
bar
of
technological
expectations.
When
viewed
as
a
growing
trend,
AR
is
creating
a
new
world
or
platform
for
information
delivery.
Furthermore,
in
the
LISTA
sources
AR
is
also
viewed
as
informational.
This
category
comprises
eight
codes,
all
of
which
refer
to
the
capability
of
AR
to
deliver,
gather,
define,
present,
and
superimpose
information
rapidly.
In
this
context
for
LIS,
AR
is
another
format
for
providing
the
user
with
information
tailored
to
specific
user
needs.
The
ways
AR
can
provide
users
with
information
are
nestled
in
the
view
of
AR
as
an
enhancement.
Within
this
category,
AR
is
described
as
an
enhancement
of
reality,
communication,
experiences,
and
learning.
Under
this
category
there
is
little
AR
will
not
enhance.
The
enhancement
of
the
user
experience
is
directly
tied
to
the
informational
quality
of
AR.
This
enhancement
rests
on
the
engaging
interactive
qualities
of
AR
fostering
relationships
and
collaboration
through
the
property
of
connectivity.
Under
this
definition,
the
digital
information
AR
displays
or
“creates”
is
the
enhancement
of
the
experience.
Sources
in
the
data
set
also
suggest
AR
enhances
the
learning
experience
through
the
digital
images
or
objects
presented
to
the
user
in
conjunction
with
the
“original
materials.”
The
connection
of
AR
to
the
Internet
and
sources
therein
also
gives
users
the
ability
to
connect
and
collaborate
with
one
another.
The
enhanced
experiences
provided
by
way
of
AR
foster
connections
between
users
as
well
as
librarians
and
the
creators
of
AR
applications
themselves.
Authors
within
the
data
set
expect
connecting
with
others
and
building
relationships
will
make
user
experiences
much
richer
in
terms
of
how
the
user
interacts
with
information
and
in
what
way
information
is
presented
to
the
user.
The
Google
Blogs
search
was
not
limited
to
LIS-­‐specific
blogs,
as
the
search
function
is
limited
in
definable
search
parameters.
Of
the
300
blog
posts
in
the
data
set,
only
four
actually
include
the
term
library
or
refer
to
AR
applications
within
libraries.
One
blog
post
alludes
to
archiving
but
does
not
explicitly
mention
a
library
setting.
These
blog
postings
code
for
versatility,
utility,
interactivity,
discovery
tool,
an
experience,
a
library
instruction
aid,
promoting
and
enhancing
the
library,
access,
and
providing
services
to
users.
While
not
all
of
these
codes
are
included
in
the
three
dominant
categories
coding
for
the
LISTA
sources,
they
do
reflect
the
utilitarian
quality
of
AR
as
a
provider
of
information
at
its
most
basic.
For
example,
AR
is
in
one
source
a
versatile
tool
enhancing
aspects
of
the
user’s
library
experience,
a
view
shared
with
the
aforementioned
LISTA
excerpts,
from
the
ways
services
are
provided
for
the
user
to
the
level
of
interactivity
the
patron
has
with
relevant
information
within
the
library,
such
as
finding

or

the

offers.

Archiving
information
displayed
through
AR
applications
poses
a
challenge
and
is
a
necessary
consideration
for
those
interested
in
archiving
information.
Truly,
AR
has
the
potential
to
change
archiving
platforms
and
access
to
those
platforms.
The
archiving
of
information
presented
via
AR
is
a
concern
for
those
implementing
AR
for
a
variety
of
purposes.
Presenting
even
library
hours
or
wayfinding
information
for
a
user
through
AR
also
raises
the
question
of
how
information
will
be
accessed,
for
how
long,
and
in
what
form
it
will
exist
once
it
is
no
longer
needed,
updated,
or
changed.
The
coded
data
suggests
AR
is
conceptualized
as
a
new
development
in
digital
technology
worth
paying
attention
to,
at
least
for
now,
but
should
also
be
approached
with
some
caution;
users
or
those
looking
to
implement
AR
should
be
careful
to
understand
the
functionality
and
implications
of
using
AR
prior
to
adapting
the
technology.
As
reflected
in
the
sources,
books
and
physical
spaces
are
potential
areas
for
AR
application
and
in
some
cases
are
already
overlaid
with
AR
and
are
enhancing
user
experiences.
As
a
whole,
the
conceptualization
of
AR
is
a
technology
with
great
potential
to
change
the
way
users
interact
with
information
because
of
its
versatility,
mobility,
and
direct
interaction
with
the
user’s
immediate
environment.
What
Is
the
Role
of
the
User
in
Relation
to
AR
as
it
is
Conceptualized
in
LIS?
The
user
is
the
foundation
of
AR,
giving
the
technology
its
functionality
or
prompting
action.
Whether
conceptualized
as
a
new
direction,
an
information
source
or
provider,
or
an
enhancement,
AR
is
essentially
static
if
there
is
no
user
prompting
the
AR
application
to
“act.”
Without
action
on
the
user’s
part,
the
information
stored
within
AR
applications
is
inert.
The
goal
of
AR
is
to
present
information
in
digital
form
within
the
context
of
the
user’s
surroundings,
environment,
or
reality.
Codes
describing
AR
as
a
new
direction,
new
world,
or
new
normal
solidify
the
idea
that
AR
is
a
new
technological
development
poised
to
redefine
not
only
the
information
landscape
but
also
the
ways
users
interact
with
technology
and
information.
Furthermore,
references
to
AR
as
a
seemingly
unstoppable
popular
trend
point
to
the
perceived
usefulness
and
importance
of
AR
in
the
life
of
the
user,
as
it
is
seen
to
raise
expectations
in
terms
of
how
users
access
information.
One
blog
source
writes,
“You
may
have
heard
about
augmented
reality
before.
If
you
haven’t,
you’ll
be
hearing
a
lot
about
it
from
now
on,
with
the
smartphone
and
tablet
revolution
now
in
full-­‐
swing.”69
The
“revolution”
surrounding
smartphones
and
tablets
alludes
to
the
increase
in
their
use
and
sales,
making
these
devices
staples
in
everyday
life.
This
idea
is
parallel
to
user
expectations
in
terms
of
online
resources,
as
many
users
rely
on
information
accessed
through
the
Internet.70,71,72,73
The
implication
is
once
AR
applications
gain
more
widespread
use,
the
user
will
come
to
expect
access
to
a
wide
range
of
information
through
those
AR
applications.
Because
AR
is
still
met
with
skepticism,
and
for
some
is
still
in
need
of
further
development,
the
technology
provides
opportunities
for
librarians
and
their
staff
as
those
implementing

providing
AR-­‐based
services
to
forge
new
paths
in
AR
application,
becoming
users
of
the
technology
“behind-­‐the-­‐scenes.”
The
following
excerpt
from
a
LISTA
source
highlights
this
view:
Technological
advances
are
beginning
to
fundamentally
change
the
way
that
library
users
interact
with
digital
information,
and
it
is
therefore
essential
that
librarians
become
engaged
with
the
relevant
technology
and
leverage
their
role
as
teachers
in
order
to
help
ensure
their
continued
relevance
in
the
lives
of
clients
in
the
twenty-­‐first
century.74
Within
this
statement,
librarians
are
learning
and
teaching
about
new
technology.
Maintaining
“relevance
in
the
lives
of
clients”
suggests
as
the
technology
grows,
implementers
of
the
technology
need
to
understand
the
technology.
As
reflected
in
this
excerpt,
on
the
other
end
is
the
user
(or
client)
of
the
AR
application
after
it
is
created
and
implemented.
The
user
has
the
opportunity
not
only
to
access
and
experience
information
in
new
ways
but
also
to
help
build
and
contribute
to
the
creation
and
streamlining
of
the
AR
application
through
his
or
her
response
to
the
application’s
functionality.
The
user
of
AR
is
also
central
to
the
view
of
AR
as
informational.
In
a
simplistic
way,
AR
is
dormant
and
incapable
of
providing,
delivering,
searching
for,
superimposing,
or
really
doing
much
of
anything
with
information
without
user
actions.
In
most
cases
with
AR,
users
must
have
some
type
of
mobile
device
to
prompt
what
is
often
described
as
an
AR
experience.
Information
provided
via
AR
applications
is
unlike
the
physical
format
of
a
book,
newspaper,
magazine,
or
other
object.
These
physical
objects
exist
in
libraries
and
the
like,
residing
on
shelves
and
taking
up
physical
space
regardless
of
the
location
or
presence
of
a
user.
By
contrast,
the
information
embedded
within
an
AR
application
is
only
viewable
and
unlocked
when
the
user
prompts
action
through
the
viewfinder
of
a
smartphone,
tablet,
or
other
mobile
device.
The
technology
is
described
as
a
catchall
or
endless
repository
for
interactive
information
for
the
user,
at
the
user’s
fingertips.
Likewise,
the
conceptualization
of
AR
as
any
kind
of
enhancement
is
also
dependent
on
the
user,
though
this
assertion
is
implicit
in
many
of
the
coded
passages.
Without
user
interaction
prompting
the
AR
application
to
overlay
information
onto
the
real
environment,
AR
is
incapable
of
enhancing
experiences,
libraries,
communication,
or
reality
itself.
Enhancement,
or
improvement,
suggests
something
or
someone
is
acted
on
in
a
way
that
is
beneficial,
intensified,
or
embedded
with
a
stronger
sense
of
value.
Much
like
the
informational
quality
of
AR,
without
the
use
of
a
mobile
device
handled
by
the
user,
AR
is
dormant
and
nonexistent,
unable
to
enhance
the
environment
or
other
aspect
of
physical
life.
Without
a
user
within
a
specific
context,
there
is
not
much
for
AR
to
enhance
because
it
exists
as
merely
a
“marker,”
tucking
away
the
desired
information,
awaiting
a
user
to
come
along
and
point
a
mobile
device
in
its
direction.
As
blogger
David
Meyer
put
it,
AR
“requires
the
active
participation
of
the
consumer—you
do
not
by
default
wander
around
with
your
phone
held
out
in
front
of
you.”75

This
implicit
role
of
the
user
is
buried
under
language
suggesting
AR
is
actually
capable
of
acting
on
the
user
and
the
user’s
reality,
giving
AR
a
sense
of
agency.
For
example,
in
terms
of
enhancement,
while
the
user
is
the
“activator”
of
the
AR
experience,
AR
is
often
described
as
making,
creating,
challenging,
improving,
producing,
delivering,
solving
problems,
and
even
bringing
some
object
to
life,
thus
prompting
this
“enhancement.”
Such
verbs
give
AR
an
active
quality,
as
if
it
is
itself
alive
and
present
in
creating
or
prompting
change.
This
is
best
exemplified
by
the
categories
of
AR
as
acting
upon
reality,
AR
as
a
modifier
and
AR
as
conditioning
the
environment.
The
perceived
quality
of
AR
as
acting
on
reality
is
what
often
drives
the
idea
of
AR
is
a
catalyst
for
change,
conditioning
the
environment
by
either
controlling
the
present
environment
or
creating
a
new
one.
The
transformative
characteristic
of
AR
reshapes
and
redefines
the
user
experience
precisely
because
of
the
ways
AR
inserts
digital
objects
into
the
real-­‐world
environment.
For
this
reason,
AR
is
often
described
through
invoking
imagination
and
with
words
like
cool,
amazing,
fun,
and
exciting,
or
other
empty
descriptors;
AR
truly
enhances
user
interaction
with
the
surrounding
world
with
what
is
perceived
as
a
“wow”
factor,
so
much
so
that
codes
in
this
study
even
reflect
legal
and
economic
implications
of
the
technology.
But,
while
AR
is
a
catalyst
for
change
and
acts
on
the
environment
and
reality,
those
changes
and
actions
are
only
seen
through
the
viewfinder
of
a
mobile
device
ultimately
in
the
hands
of
the
user.
RADICAL
CHANGE
THEORY
Dresang
founded
RCT
on
what
she
identified
as
the
three
digital-­‐age
principles
of
interactivity,
connectivity,
and
access,
which
describe
how
“the
digital
environment
has
influenced
some
nondigitized
media
to
take
on
digital
principles.”
Essentially,
Dresang’s
theory
is
an
attempt
to
explain
information
resources
and
behaviors.
Within
the
digital-­‐age
principles,
the
user
takes
on
the
role
of
initiator.
While
flexible
in
allowing
user
initiation,
the
digital
applications
are
inert
without
the
user;
a
range
of
information
is
unavailable
without
user
action
to
put
the
digital
environment
into
motion.
The
digital
environment
within
AR,
as
described
by
sources
in
the
data
set,
is
an
overlay
of
the
digital
onto
the
real
world.
RCT
suggests
the
“digital
environment
extends
far
beyond
the
digital
resources
themselves.”
The
extension
beyond
the
digital
resources
is
evident
in
AR
as
it
combines
the
real
and
physical
with
the
virtual.76
Based
on
these
principles
and
the
idea
that
the
digital
extends
beyond
the
resources
themselves,
the
conceptualization
of
AR
reflects
the
characteristics
of
RCT
in
explaining
information
behavior
and
representations
in
the
AR
“environment.”
Interactivity,
connectivity,
and
access
are
essential
parts
of
AR.
When
each
principle
is
examined
in
conjunction
with
the
coded
data,
a
picture
appears
of
AR
as
an
exemplar
of
RCT.
Interactivity
and
connectivity
emerged
as
coded
assertions
within
the
data.
These
codes
fall
under
the
category
of
AR
as
an
enhancement.
As
stated,
AR
is
expected

many
of
the
voices

data
set
to
influence
or
enhance
almost
every
aspect
of
our
lives,
and
part
of
this
enhancement
is
due
to
the
properties
of
interactivity
and
connectivity
exhibited
by
AR.
As
defined
by
Dresang,
interactivity
refers
to
dynamic,
user-­‐controlled,
nonlinear,
nonsequential
information
behavior
and
representation.77
Speaking
directly
to
the
idea
of
user-­‐controlled,
nonlinear,
and
nonsequential
information
behavior
and
representation
is
the
sense
of
agency
that
AR
is
expected
to
give
users
in
terms
of
how
they
view
and
interact
with
the
digital
overlays
of
information.
The
control
the
user
has
on
the
AR
experience
and
the
information
with
which
he
or
she
comes
in
contact
stems
from
the
functionality
of
AR
often
relying
on
tracking
a
user’s
location.
Presenting
a
user
with
information
based
on
location
is
not
only
user-­‐controlled
but
nonlinear
and
nonsequential,
since
the
application
has
no
predetermined
set
of
boundaries
the
way
a
physical
map
might
have.
People
do
not
typically
travel
through
the
day
in
a
linear
fashion
with
a
predetermined
sequence
of
action.
As
one
blogger
notes,
AR
is
“helping
to
erase
that
line
between
your
real
life
and
how
you
interact
with
the
web.”
78
AR
is
further
tied
to
the
principle
of
interactivity
as
defined
within
RCT
precisely
because
of
its
mobility
and
formatting,
namely,
because
of
mobile
devices.
A
source
within
the
LISTA
data
set
includes
the
following
assertion:
The
AR
paradigm
opens
innovative
interaction
facilities
to
users:
human
natural
familiarity
with
the
physical
environment
and
physical
objects
deﬁnes
the
basic
principles
for
exchanging
data
between
the
virtual
and
the
real
world,
thus
allowing
gestures,
body
language,
movement,
gaze
and
physical
awareness
to
trigger
events
in
the
AR
space.79
Gestures,
body
language,
movement,
gaze,
and
physical
awareness
are
all
unpredictable
actions.
For
these
actions
to
“trigger
events
in
the
AR
space,”
there
must
certainly
be
a
high
degree
of
nonlinear
and
nonsequential
information
behavior
and
representations
taking
place;
it
is
highly
unlikely
user
gestures
and
the
like
could
exist
on
a
linear
continuum
of
action.
Further,
within
RCT,
connectivity
refers
to
the
sense
of
community
or
construction
of
social
worlds
emerging
from
changing
perspectives
and
expanded
associations
in
the
world
and
in
resources.
In
terms
of
the
coded
data
in
this
study,
the
code
of
connectivity
reflects
this
idea
of
creating
community
and
social
worlds
through
the
capability
of
AR
to
connect
users
to
various
forms
of
social
media,
to
one
another,
and
to
various
resources.
Users
make
connections
through
games,
location
awareness,
and
applications
allowing
for
the
sharing
of
information
from
user
to
user.
Social
networking
figures
prominently
in
AR
technology.
Users
can
upload
overlays
of
digital
information
captured
on
a
smartphone
to
various
social
networking
sites.
Additionally,
the
ability
of
AR
to
overlay
digital
information
onto
the
real
world,
and
the
customizable
experiences
this
creates,
aids
in
connectivity.
AR
creates
a
virtual
world
wherein
users
can
engage
with
one
another
across
applications;
while
physically
in
different
places,
they
can
share
experiences

even
simple
conversations.
Connectivity
through
AR
is
possible
in
all
aspects
of
life
as
many
sources
in
the
data
set
allude
to
working,
playing,
and
learning.
To
interact
and
connect
with
one
another,
users
must
have
access
to
the
AR
space.
The
principle
of
access
within
RCT
is
defined
as
the
breaking
of
long-­‐standing
information
barriers,
allowing
exposure
and
access
to
a
wide
range
of
differing
perspectives
and
opportunities.
The
concept
of
access
(both
in
terms
of
what
is
and
is
not
accessible)
does
appear
in
the
coded
data.
Note
access
and
accessibility
within
this
study
refer
to
the
opportunity
or
right
to
use
a
system
or
service,
and
is
not
referring
to
access
and
accessibility
as
it
is
used
within
discourse
pertaining
to
disabilities.
The
use
of
AR
in
conjunction
with
smartphones
is
a
basic
way
of
interpreting
access
as
it
relates
to
RCT
and
AR.
The
mobility
of
smartphones
and
tablets
allows
users
to
access
AR
across
a
variety
of
locations,
and
each
user’s
smartphone
or
tablet
is
uniquely
tailored
to
the
user’s
interests
and
desires
through
differing
collections
of
applications
and
software.
Smartphones
and
tablets
are
comparatively
low-­‐cost
options
for
accessing
and
sharing
access
to
the
Internet
and
AR
applications.
Their
use
is
on
the
rise
because
they
are
often
much
cheaper
to
obtain
than
computers.80,81,82
The
fusion
of
AR
with
mobile
devices
suggests
an
opportunity
for
accessing
information
in
real
time
in
any
place
through
these
technologies
working
in
tandem
with
one
another.
By
its
very
nature,
AR
offers
access
to
“differing
perspectives
and
opportunities”
as
it
presents
the
user
with
information
in
atypical
formats
in
places
and
spaces
once
static,
or
lacking
in
digital
overlays.
AR
is
not
bounded
by
physical
location;
rather,
it
depends
on
and
varies
with
your
physical
location.
The
idea
that
users
can
access
AR
wherever
there
is
an
Internet
connection
means
the
only
real
barrier
to
accessing
AR
is
the
same
barrier
existing
regarding
a
web
connection
for
the
user,
something
at
least
one
source
within
the
LISTA
data
set
alludes
to
in
terms
of
the
digital
divide,
cautioning
that
AR
should
be
used
in
conjunction
with
traditional
formats
of
information
instead
of
in
lieu
of
them.
For
example,
libraries
should
not
replace
traditional
signage
with
information
only
embedded
within
AR
applications.
However,
as
more
and
more
organizations,
institutions,
and
businesses
use
AR
and
provide
users
with
access
rather
than
relying
on
the
user
to
conjure
his
or
her
own
Internet
connection,
more
barriers
to
AR
will
fall.
However,
it
is
important
to
note
that
not
all
AR
applications
actually
do
require
Internet
access.
Mobile
device
applications
can
work
off
of
markers
and
triggers
in
the
physical
environment,
not
web-­‐based
anchors.
For
example,
a
cookbook
can
include
a
marker
next
to
a
recipe
that
when
scanned
displays
an
image
of
the
finished
dish.
Access
to
AR
applications
without
a
web
connection
opens
a
wealth
of
information
to
individuals
who
do
not
have
access
to
the
web.
Not
all
AR
applications
link
to
web-­‐based
information,
and
this
widens
the
pool
of
users
engaging
with
information
through
those
AR
applications.
Moreover,
relative
ease
of
use
and
low
initial
cost
to
create
AR
applications
also
allow
users
to
become
content
creators,
as
exemplified
by
an
AR
application
allowing
an
artist
to
create
virtual
graffiti
in
public
spaces.
Users
are
able
to
display
and
access
information
otherwise
invisible.

It
is
important
to
note
the
differing
views
suggesting
AR
does
and
does
not
require
Internet
access
to
function.
Such
a
discrepancy
points
further
to
AR
as
a
loosely
defined
concept.
From
a
technical
standpoint,
AR
does
not
require
an
Internet
connection,
but
the
Internet
does
serve
as
a
repository
for
information,
and
many
see
AR
as
providing
a
bridge
to
that
information,
be
it
a
company
wanting
to
give
consumers
access
to
product
lines
or
a
library
creating
an
AR
application
linking
to
web-­‐based
databases
and
services.
In
terms
of
RCT,
the
principle
of
access
does
take
into
account
digital
information
as
able
to
both
provide
and
inhibit
access,
as
some
users
may
not
have
access
to
the
often
costly
hardware
allowing
access
to
digitally
formatted
information.
What
is
important
to
highlight
about
the
principle
of
access
is
the
focus
on
the
range
of
voices
and
the
increased
array
of
digital
information
available,
which,
in
the
case
of
this
study,
AR
provides.
Any
object
associated
in
some
way
with
a
monetary
cost
or
technical
savvy
always
has
the
potential
to
leave
some
users
in
the
dark.
Interactivity,
connectivity,
and
access
are
present
in
the
conceptualization
of
AR
within
the
LIS
literature
as
well
as
the
popular
media
blogs.
The
user
is
central
to
both
RCT
and
this
conceptualization
of
AR
as
a
new
technology
with
the
potential
to
change
the
way
users
interact
with
information
and
with
one
another.
The
goal
of
AR
is
to
present
information
in
digital
form
within
the
context
of
the
user’s
surroundings,
environment,
or
reality.
RCT
is
a
theory
seeking
to
understand
changes
in
information
behavior
and
representations,
and
AR
is
an
exemplar
of
the
myriad
changes,
or
the
evolution,
of
the
digital-­‐information
environment.
IMPLICATIONS
FOR
THEORY
This
study
has
several
implications
for
theory
within
LIS.
These
include
the
extension
of
RCT
or
creation
of
new
theories
born
out
of
the
digital
age,
the
understanding
that
a
user-­‐centric
focus
is
essential
to
theory
within
the
digital
age,
and
the
realization
that
AR
opens
new
areas
of
research
in
what
is
considered
an
enhancement
of
information.
While
this
study
sought
to
test
RCT
in
relation
to
the
conceptualization
of
AR,
it
also
provides
a
framework
for
future
studies.
The
results
of
this
study
also
suggest
AR
opens
more
areas
to
explore
within
the
field
of
LIS
to
create
new
theories
or
to
add
to
RCT
as
a
theoretical
framework
to
better
understand
information
behavior
and
representations
in
the
digital-­‐information
environment.
When
Dresang
initially
formulated
RCT,
she
focused
on
youth
information
seeking
behaviors.83
Few
scholars
have
used
the
theory,
but
those
that
have
explore
education,84
literacy,85
communication
and
writing86
as
related
to
changing
technologies.
These
previous
studies,
as
well
as
this
study,
highlight
the
importance
of
this
theory
in
examining
the
effect
of
the
digital-­‐
information
landscape
on
information-­‐seeking
and
user
understanding
of
and
reaction
to
digital
information.
RCT
is
viable
beyond
a
focus
on
youth
information
seeking
and
is
highly
relevant
to
today’s
world.
RCT
developed
to
understand
how
the
digital
age
influences
traditional
and
new
media.
AR
is
itself
often
described
as
an
environment,
a
digital
environment,
which
is
precisely
the
focus
of
RCT.

AR
is
in
fact
a
“new
normal,”
as
some
describe,
our
information
landscape
is
moving
in
a
direction
where
interactivity,
connectivity,
access,
and
the
role
of
the
user
are
central
to
any
discussion
of
how
information
is
organized,
distributed,
formatted,
and
presented.
Researchers
can
begin
by
adapting
traditional
LIS
theories
to
the
digital
age.
For
example,
Wilson
revised
his
oft-­‐cited
original
general
model
of
information-­‐seeking
behavior
in
an
attempt
to
understand
the
totality
of
information
behavior
by
linking
theory
to
action
and
understanding
what
prompts
and
hinders
the
need
to
search
for
information.87
Researchers
can
begin
to
reevaluate
the
model
to
determine
whether
it
helps
to
explain
information
behavior
within
the
AR
environment,or
whether
aspects
of
the
model
can
be
further
developed
or
revised.
Wilson’s
model’s
focus
on
human
behavior
parallels
the
focus
on
human
behavior
within
the
AR
environment.
Other
theories
within
LIS
can
also
be
adapted
to
the
AR
environment,
such
as
Erdelez’s
Information
Encountering
(IE).
Erdelez’s
theory
focuses
on
a
“memorable
experience
of
unexpected
discovery
of
useful
or
interesting
information”
situated
within
three
elements:
characteristics
of
the
information
user,
characteristics
of
the
information
environment,
and
characteristics
of
the
encountered
information.
Erdelez
further
describes
categories
of
information
users:
superencounterers,
encounterers,
occasional
encounterers,
and
nonencounterers.
While
Erdelez
has
since
taken
the
web
and
the
Internet
into
account
as
information
environments,
this
theory
could
further
be
remodeled
to
include
the
AR
environment.88
Wilson’s
model
and
Erdelez’s
theory
are
just
two
examples
of
theories
within
LIS
lending
themselves
to
further
exploration
of
the
user
of
AR
within
LIS.
Bates’
model
of
information
search
and
retrieval,
known
as
berrypicking,
which
centers
on
the
changing
nature
of
the
search
query
through
the
search
process,
can
also
be
amended
to
include
information
search
and
retrieval
within
the
AR
environment.89
Bates’
model
suggests
as
users
seek
and
find
information,
the
information
search
shifts
from
source
to
source.
The
berrypicking
model
can
also
be
updated
or
expounded
in
response
to
AR
because
of
AR’s
multidimensional
display
of
information—a
relatively
new
phenomenon
for
the
average
user—to
understand
whether
the
same
shift
in
information
queries
occurs
and
what
new
paths
to
information
users
are
taking
within
the
AR
environment.
This
study
suggests
a
user-­‐centric
focus
is
essential
to
any
theories
in
LIS
developed
within
or
extended
to
the
digital
age.
The
user
is
vital
to
making
AR
technology
functional,
as
demonstrated
in
the
conceptualization
of
AR
in
this
study.
The
personalization,
individualization,
and
mobility
of
digital
technology
like
AR
suggest
theories
related
to
information
behavior
within
this
environment
must
account
for
user
interaction.
Information
is
no
longer
contained
within
static
formats.
Geotagging
or
geospatial
awareness
and
social
networking
are
prime
examples
of
the
reliance
of
digital
technology
on
user
interaction.

functionality
of
digital
technology
in
any
context,
theoretical
frameworks
attempting
to
address
information
seeking
and
behavior
in
the
digital
age
will
be
limited.
Additionally,
should
AR
prove
to
be
a
new
direction
in
accessing,
organizing,
delivering,
and
obtaining
information,
it
further
opens
new
areas
of
theoretical
research.
Since
AR
is
considered
an
enhancement
of
the
information
experience,
it
is
incumbent
on
researchers
to
determine
just
how
“enhancement”
is
defined
in
the
context
of
AR
and
how
that
translates
to
the
user
experience.
Researchers
can
strive
to
apply
and
understand
the
concept
of
an
enhancement
in
relation
not
only
to
the
enhancement
of
information
but
also
to
the
experience
of
accessing,
organizing,
delivering,
and
obtaining
information.
The
digital-­‐age
principles
outlined
by
Dresang
in
RCT
are
just
one
example
of
how
to
understand
the
impact
of
the
digital
age
on
the
user’s
interaction
with
information
and
in
what
ways
the
digital
age
creates
enhancements.
By
itself,
the
study
of
AR
technology
raises
more
questions
than
it
answers.
The
study
of
AR
technology
could
lead
to
more
diverse
theoretical
frameworks
seeking
to
answer
not
only
practical
questions
but
also
those
more
philosophical
in
nature,
working
toward
an
understanding
of
how
the
digital-­‐information
environment
influences
everyday
life
as
it
evolves
and
changes
at
a
rapid
pace.
IMPLICATIONS
FOR
PRACTICE
This
study
can
inform
several
aspects
of
practice.
I
expound
on
three
possibilities:
the
clear
definition
of
technologies
like
AR
to
create
an
awareness
and
understanding
of
those
technologies,
development
of
best
practices,
and
the
need
for
a
focus
on
user
collaboration
in
the
design
and
functionality
of
AR
and
similar
technologies.
The
implications
for
practice
concern
both
the
user
and
the
provider
of
information
services.
This
study
provides
perspective,
or
a
starting
point,
from
which
the
field
of
LIS
can
begin
to
analyze
the
use
and
implementation
of
AR
technology.
By
taking
a
step
back
to
understand
the
current
conceptualization
of
AR,
practitioners
within
LIS
can
begin
to
seek
consensus,
identify
best
practices,
maintain
an
awareness
of
how
the
technology
is
used
and
think
realistically
about
what
factors
contribute
to
successful
implementation
of
the
technology
in
a
given
institution.
As
identified
in
the
study,
AR
is
seen
as
a
new
direction.
It
is
important
for
those
within
the
field
to
understand
this
perspective
and
to
go
on
to
identify
what
a
new
direction
in
information
gathering,
organization,
and
seeking
implies
for
the
field
as
a
whole
and
for
users.
As
a
field,
LIS
can
begin
to
have
a
broader
discussion
on
what
exactly
AR
can
provide
and
how
it
can
benefit
user
services.
Such
a
discussion
can
help
practitioners
make
sense
of
how
this
technology
can
work
with
traditional
sources
of
information.
AR
can
be
integrated
with
the
traditional
rather
than
act
as
a
replacement
for
the
traditional.
This
broader
discussion
can
lead
to
a
consensus
on
how
best
to
define
AR
as
a
tool
and
concept.
Within
this
study,
it
is
evident
AR
is
described
in
myriad
ways,
so
it
is
important
to
reflect
on
those
descriptions,
understand
what
the
issues
are
surrounding
the
technology,
and
collaboratively
seek
and
identify
best
practices.
DO
YOU

IN

Furthermore,
by
identifying
best
practices,
practitioners
can
begin
to
pinpoint
what
applications
of
AR
are
successful
within
an
institution
and
for
users,
and
why
those
applications
are
successful
for
specific
purposes.
In
doing
so,
practitioners
can
build
AR
applications
around
the
needs
and
mission
of
the
institution
rather
than
simply
flock
to
use
a
new
technology.
It
is
therefore
critical
for
practitioners
to
think
realistically
about
AR
implementation.
Adopting
such
a
technology
will
only
be
beneficial
once
practitioners
in
the
library
understand
its
full
impact.
Experience
with
technology
and
programming,
knowledge
of
AR
functionality,
versatility,
and
cost
are
important
factors
to
consider
when
contemplating
how
an
institution
can
benefit
from
AR,
if
at
all.
Similarly,
publishers
are
using
AR
to
supplement
traditional
printed
books.
Educators
are
using
AR
books
in
the
classroom
and
supplementing
traditional
course
instruction
with
these
books.
Such
books
allow
for
3D
rendering
of
models
for
study,
such
as
planets,
molecular
structures,
and
various
other
objects.
Those
within
LIS
have
a
strong
connection
to
the
field
of
education,
and
AR
books
may
become
a
part
of
the
library
collection
as
they
become
more
popular
among
educators.
Practitioners
in
LIS
through
collaboration
with
educators
will
then
need
to
be
aware
of
these
books,
their
functionality,
and
how
to
help
users
access
the
content
lying
dormant
until
“activated”
by
a
smartphone
or
tablet.
This
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
smartphones,
tablets
or
other
devices
that
can
scan
the
environment
will
become
commonplace
in
the
library
to
provide
full
access
to
users.
User
collaboration
also
becomes
central
to
understanding
the
implications
of
AR
on
practice.
User
collaboration
in
design
is
important
because
AR
technology
is
largely
dependent
on
user
context.
As
the
data
suggests,
AR
is
considered
an
enhancement—of
the
environment,
of
information,
and
of
the
user
experience.
Prior
to
implementation,
it
is
critical
to
understand
how
AR
enhances
the
user
experience
and
what
the
perception
is
among
users.
User
surveys
can
lead
to
tailored
AR
applications
for
a
given
library
or
cultural
institution
community
should
there
be
a
need
or
desire
for
AR
applications
identified
among
users.
Coupled
with
the
idea
of
user
collaboration
in
design
is
also
the
need
to
reevaluate
the
physical
spaces
of
libraries
and
similar
institutions.
Because
AR
creates
an
overlay
of
digital
information
on
the
physical
environment,
it
will
be
necessary
for
practitioners
to
identify
what
areas
of
the
library
or
institution
lend
themselves
to
digital
overlays,
what
types
of
information
users
are
accessing
through
AR
applications,
and
whether
the
library
space
is
configured
to
allow
for
navigating
space
via
AR.
Practitioners
can
also
begin
to
survey
the
role
of
RCT
in
understanding
user
information-­‐seeking
behavior.
By
acknowledging
this
theory
as
an
outline
of
our
digital-­‐information
environment,
practitioners
can
be
mindful
of
user
expectations
and
behaviors
as
they
differ
from
traditional
information
representations
and
methods
of
information
retrieval.
As
AR
creates
an
environment
or
experience
for
the
user,
it
is
important
for
practitioners
within
the
field
to
understand
how
this
technology
is
moving
forward
and
what
effect
it
has
on
the
sea
change
occurring
in
user
acquisition
of
information.
RCT
is
a
framework
providing
practitioners
the
lens
through
which
to
make
sense
of
the
sea
change
and
predict
what
might
be
on
the
horizon.

LIMITATIONS
AND
FUTURE
APPLICATION
This
study
is
just
one
step
in
the
process
of
understanding
how
new
technology
is
conceptualized
and
what
effect
that
conceptualization
has
on
implementation.
Should
AR
continue
to
grow
in
popularity,
this
study
can
serve
as
a
model
for
future
research
seeking
to
understand
concepts
misinterpreted,
misunderstood,
or
undergoing
concrete
development.
Utilizing
the
explicit
assertion
as
a
unit
of
analysis
coupled
with
RCT
can
aid
in
investigations
of
other
digital
technologies,
both
in
terms
of
implementation
and
end
use.
The
data
set
and
the
time
period
during
which
the
searches
of
the
data
set
took
place
in
this
study
highlight
two
of
the
study’s
limitations.
Further
studies
can
focus
on
a
wider
range
of
sources
not
limited
to
one
database
or
blog
search
type
and
extend
over
a
longer
period
of
time.
These
limitations
have
potentially
excluded
other
voices,
perspectives,
and
definitions
of
AR,
and
the
time
element
may
exclude
new
applications
or
uses
of
AR
currently
being
implemented.
Limitations
in
data
analysis
also
exist.
Content
analysis
is
one
of
many
research
methods
researchers
can
employ
to
explore
this
topic.
Ethnographic
research
and
user
interviews
can
lead
to
a
deeper
understanding
of
how
users
perceive
AR
and
information-­‐seeking
or
behavior
within
the
AR
environment.
Such
qualitative
studies
can
provide
insight
to
the
role
of
the
user
lacking
in
this
study.
Moreover,
this
researcher’s
own
admitted
bias
against
the
steadfast
use
of
digital
technologies
prior
to
in-­‐depth
understanding
is
what
prompted
the
qualitative
inquiry
guiding
the
study.
Quantitative
methods
can
also
be
used
to
track
the
popularity
or
perceptions
of
AR
through
close-­‐ended
questionnaires
or
surveys
of
both
users
and
practitioners
in
the
field
of
LIS.
Citation
tracking
could
further
reveal
in
what
subfields
of
LIS
the
conversation
surrounding
AR
is
taking
place,
and
may
also
uncover
whether
any
one
researcher
or
group
of
researchers
is
leading
the
conversation.
Future
studies
can
examine
and
expand
on
the
results
of
this
study.
Rather
than
focusing
on
conceptualization
only,
researchers
can
study
which
professional
fields
dominate
the
conversation
surrounding
AR
and
what
areas
of
popular
culture
dominate
the
conversation
or
influence
understanding
of
AR.
Similarly,
other
studies
can
address
the
specificity
of
each
source
making
explicit
assertions
about
this
kind
of
technology.
While
qualitative
in
nature,
the
study
is
limited
because
it
does
not
examine
quantitative
changes
in
the
number
of
articles
or
blog
posts
alluding
to
AR
over
an
extended
period
of
time.
Such
studies
might
unravel
why
AR
is
progressing
as
it
is,
and
may
identify
potential
problems
or
differences
in
the
influence
of
these
perspectives
on
the
use
of
AR.
The
study
of
AR
also
widens
the
spectrum
of
user
studies.
Augmented
reality
open
a
whole
new
area
of
user
interaction
with
information
extending
beyond
the
screen.
With
the
advent
of
products
like
Google
Glass
and
applications
overlaying
digital
information
at
the
click
of
a
button
in
an
endless
array
of
contexts
and
environments,
AR
brings
information-­‐seeking
further
into
a
world
of
instability
and
unpredictability.
The
complex
nature
of
individual
people
is
now
being
coupled
with
a
highly
individualized
complex
technology.

The
functionality
of
AR
prompts
the
need
for
archival
studies
related
to
this
technology.
The
mobile
aspect
of
AR,
the
highly
personalized
content
and
the
intangible
quality
of
the
information
stored
within
AR
applications
highlights
the
need
for
an
examination
of
how
such
information
can
actually
exist
within
an
archive
and
be
made
accessible,
or
whether
such
information
even
should
exist
within
an
archive.
Such
a
question
for
those
within
LIS
also
suggests
the
need
for
a
realistic
perspective
on
technology
like
AR—the
next
step,
or
reaction
to
such
technology,
is
often
unrecognizable
and
unidentifiable
until
the
concept
itself
is
dissected
and
each
part
is
interpreted
and
understood.
CONCLUSION
In
this
study,
I
used
content
analysis
to
explore
the
conceptualization
of
AR
technology
within
the
field
of
LIS.
The
model
for
this
study
is
the
work
of
Clement
and
Levine
and
their
use
of
the
explicit
assertion
as
a
unit
of
analysis.90
I
coded
and
examined
explicit
assertions
pertaining
to
AR
in
LIS
literature
and
Google
Blogs
to
determine
how
the
concept
of
AR
is
understood.
Analysis
shows
AR
is
most
prominently
conceptualized
as
a
new
direction
in
technology
and
media
consumption
acting
on
reality
and
as
enhancing
reality
and
interaction
with
information.
AR
is
basically
a
technology
allowing
for
digital
information
to
be
superimposed
on
the
real
world.
But
beyond
that,
it
is
a
technology
changing
the
way
users
interact
with
information,
and
it
has
the
potential
to
continue
changing
how
we
literally
see
information.
The
data
set
suggests
those
within
LIS
conceptualize
AR
as
a
new
development
in
digital
technology
worth
paying
attention
to,
at
least
for
now,
but
should
also
be
approached
with
some
caution
to
be
fully
understood
prior
to
implementation
in
case
its
popularity
and
growth
is
fleeting.
As
reflected
in
the
data
set,
books
and
physical
spaces
are
potential
areas
for
AR
application,
and
in
some
cases
are
already
overlaid
with
AR
and
enhancing
user
experiences.
As
a
whole,
AR
is
conceptualized
as
a
technology
with
great
potential
to
change
the
way
users
interact
with
information
because
of
its
versatility,
mobility,
and
direct
interaction
with
the
user’s
immediate
environment.
Within
this
conceptualization,
the
user
is
central
to
igniting
the
functionality
of
AR.
Whether
conceptualized
as
a
new
direction,
an
information
source
or
provider,
or
an
enhancement,
AR
is
essentially
static
if
there
is
no
user
prompting
the
AR
application
to
“act.”
The
goal
of
AR
is
to
present
information
in
digital
form
within
the
context
of
the
user’s
surroundings,
environment,
or
reality.
As
a
field
dedicated
to
user
services
in
regard
to
information-­‐seeking,
it
is
imperative
to
understand
the
potential
impact
this
technology
has
had
or
will
have
on
everyday
life.
RCT
is
a
theoretical
framework
aiding
in
the
exploration
of
the
potential
impact
of
AR.
Born
out
of
a
desire
to
understand
the
influence
of
the
digital
age
on
the
traditional
or
“analog”
media
with
which
we
engage,
RCT
is
one
of
few
theories
resting
entirely
on
the
characteristics
driving
our
digital-­‐information
environment,
outlined
specifically
as
interactivity,
connectivity,
and
access.
Utilizing
this
theory
as
a
lens
for
future
research
regarding
digital
information
is
a
natural
next
step
in
theory
exploration
and
development.

Together,
AR
and
RCT
accentuate
the
evolution
of
how
we
consume
and
display
information.
From
storytelling
to
printed
pages
to
electronic
devices,
our
engagement
with
information
will
never
be
the
same
again.
As
we
move
forward,
it
is
important
to
continue
to
ask
new
questions,
seek
new
explanations,
and
try
to
formulate
the
most
appropriate
answers
for
the
contexts
in
which
we
all
deal
with
information,
be
it
gathering,
organizing,
seeking,
or
understanding.
This
study
is
one
piece
in
a
puzzle,
and
it
prompts
more
questions
than
it
provides
answers.
AR
can
and
should
be
studied
from
every
aspect
of
the
field
of
LIS,
if
it
is
in
fact
a
new
direction
toward
our
new
normal.
