<bodyText confidence="0.971248727272727">
Libraries and information centres are established with a mission to provide right information to the
right user at the right time and in the right amount. Library and information science (LIS) professionals apply
their competencies for achieving this mission of libraries. In the past, LIS professionals were providing
services within the premises of the library but now with the aid of technology they can reach to their patrons
both within premises as well as outside the premises of the library. This outreach of LIS professionals
to their clientele has opened doors for embedded librarianship.To develop appropriate competencies
among LIS professionals for becoming successful embedded librarians, LIS schools can play a pivotal
role. This paper highlights the dynamic nature of LIS profession and describes the concept of embedded
librarianship. Role of LIS schools in nurturing the embedded librarianship is also the part of present
paper. Concept of specialisation in LIS curriculum is a step towards nurturing embedded librarianship.

1. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999159125">
Libraries are regarded as fountains and rich
springs of knowledge that illuminate and irrigate
the fields of academics, economics, cultural, social,
political and many other sectors of the society. Main
mission of any library and information centre is to
facilitate the easy accessibility of information to
library patrons. The library and information science
(LIS) professionals provide information in an effective
and efficient manner by using different techniques
(both manual and mechanical). To fulfill the mission
of providing right information to the right person,
LIS professional perform different library operations
like selection of information sources, acquisition of
information sources, processing and preservation
of information sources and making information
and information sources available to the persons
at the time when they require information.Earlier,
users were coming to the library for quenching
their thirst of gaining knowledge by consulting
different sources of information and librarians were
providing every kind of help to them, whether in the
form of reference services or through inculcating
different skills among users by organising orientation
programmes or user-education programmes.

1.1 Transformation in Library and Information
Centres
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9785583125">
With the advent of information and communication
technologies (ICT), libraries and information centers
witnessed various transformation after transformation.
New trends emerged in the profession of librarianship
and there is a paradigm shift in the basic philosophies
of the profession. Some of these shifts are:
1.1.1 Paper Media to other Media
In the past, libraries were just the places where
one will come across different information sources
in print format. Now sources are in digital formats
like e-journals, e-books, e-zines, CD-ROM, etc.
With the aid of technology, information sources
containing audio, video, text, graphics, and images
at one place are existing in the market and libraries
and information centres acquire these multimedia
sources of information.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.962954">
1.1.2 Possession to Access
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989413571428571">
Notion of librarians about the size of collection in
the past, i.e., bigger the best has changed. Instead
of focusing on building huge collection, library
professionals now think in terms of facilitating the
user’s access to information. In the digital environment,
library patrons can get access to digital sources of
information from any place at any time.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.791535">
1.1.3 Preservation to Utilisation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.94228625">
Libraries in the past were giving more importance
to preservation of documents. However, with the

invention
of printing press and due to the revolution
brought about by ICT, now library and information
professionals give more attention towards making
information more and more utilised by the library
patrons. All efforts are made by the professionals
whereby users information needs can be fulfilled so
that users are able to achieve their objectives.
1.1.4 Manual Process to Mechanical Process
(Automation)
have provided a favorable environment for the
evolutionary and revolutionary trends occurring in
the world of libraries. From traditional libraries have
emerged, automated libraries, electronic libraries,
digital libraries and library without walls,i.e.,virtual
libraries.

1.2 Changing Information Landscape and Role
of LIS Professionals
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9361494">
Library operations in the past were performed
manually but now majority of these activities are
being performed with the aid of technology. Different
library software packages have been created for
modernising the libraries and information centers.
In the present information landscape role of library
and information science professionals has increased.
Reason being that there are challenges posed by a
number of factors to both library professionals and
their customers. Some of these factors are:

<bodyText confidence="0.947566777777778">
as custodians of the library resources but now the
role of a facilitators are attributed to them. They
are equipped with all those competencies necessary
for navigating the digital resources available on the
ubiquitous World Wide Web. Due to their role new
labels are in vogue. Labels like information scientist,
knowledge manager, documentation officer, etc.,
have emerged to describe the role of librarian in
the knowledge world.

(c) Information anxiety
1.1.6 Isolation to Consortia
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9948035">
Digital information landscape has provided
opportunity for different libraries to join hands with
each other for sharing their resources. In India, a
number of consortia have emerged like INDEST,
UGC Infonet, etc., through these consortia libraries
provide effective and efficient services to library
patrons for enhancing the chances for fulfilling their
information needs.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.564923">
1.1.7 Free Services to Fee-based Services
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996504285714286">
To add value to the information being provided
by the library, library charges some fee from the
library users. Nominal fee is charged from users who
need some value-added service from the libraries.
Fee collected from users can be used for upgrading
the overall system of libraries to come up to the
expectations of all the stakeholders.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.88133">
1.1.8 Physical Interior Premises to Open World
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.91266875">
Libraries and information centers were performing
their operations and providing services to library
patrons only within the premises of the libraries
in the past but now with the advent of ubiquitous
internet, etc., libraries can reach people outside
the premises of their four walls.

<bodyText confidence="0.99890348">
These information-related issues have increased
the credibility of library and information professionals
among the users.The LIS professionals can utilise
their professional expertise for solving the problems
faced by library patrons due to these reasons. With
the aid of technology, LIS professionals can provide
their assistance not only within the premises of the
library but also can reach to the library patrons at
their workplaces easily.
However, LIS professionals need some advanced
competencies for delivering their professional
obligations in an effective and efficient manner.
Users can approach the librarian from outside
premises in a virtual mode or librarian can come
at their workplaces for giving them professional and
technical support in locating right information at the
right time. Thus LIS professionals empower library
patrons in exploiting information and information
sources optimally. Great scientists, philosophers,
scholars, etc., have fully recognised the contribution
of LIS professionals and have lucidly expressed it
in their acknowledgements.
This active participation of LIS professionals with
their users has opened a new facet of librarianship,
viz., embedded librarianship.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990651">
4.1 Embedded Librarianship
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997464278688524">
Different people have expressed their point of
view on embedded librarianship differently. However,
the basic consensus is on the participation of LIS
professionals among his/ customers either physically
or virtually. Dewey 1 defines embedding as a concept
in which the one distinct group is integrated with
another . As such when librarians involve themselves
actively with persons from other disciplines and
provide information support both on demand as
well as in anticipation of demand lays foundation
to embedded librarianship. Shumaker 2 stresses on
effective collaboration and closer relationship of
library professionals with their customers because the
library is focused on the user’s needs. Shumaker and
Taylor 3 have expressed their ideas about embedded
librarian as” Whether your title is ‘Knowledge
Analyst’, ‘Field Librarian’, ‘Informationist’, ‘Librarianin-Context’, ‘Client-Embedded Services Librarian’,
‘Project Information Specialist’, or something else, if
a regular part of your work involves participating in
a group, community, or organisational unit primarily
made up of non-librarians, providing knowledge
and information services as a part of the group,
then you are participating in a growing trend of
embedding librarians and their services in settings
outside the library. In a more lucid and simple
manner the ey element of embedded librarianship
has been explained by Ricco &amp; Myers 4 as: “It is
to move the librarians out of the traditional library
setting, whether physically or virtually, and into
a new framework for providing library services.
It shifts the emphasis from reactively answering
research requests in a vacuum to developing a
unique understanding of what customers need
and delivering proactive results”. Thus all efforts
of embedded librarian are revolving around library
patrons. Satisfaction of library patron is the priority
of embedded librarianship.
For achieving this satisfaction embedded librarianis
supposed to develop close proximity with the users of
library. Glynn &amp; Wu 5 is of the opinion that personal
contact, telephone calls, and e-mail messages are
just a few of the ways that librarian liaisons can
demonstrate a sincere interest in the scholarly
activities of department faculty, as well as furnishing
new services and materials.
Embedded librarianship can lead to rich dividends
for all the stakeholders. Jacobs 6 while addressing
the benefits of embedded librarianship comments
that it creates ‘win-win’ like situation which is often
used in business to describe a deal that works well
for both parties. Embedded librarianship is a winning
proposition not only for the constituents served,
but for the librarian who has the opportunity to
make a positive difference for students and faculty.
If library professionals are willing to step outside
the library to serve their patrons when and where
they are needed, their value to the processes of
teaching, learning, and scholarship will be enhanced.
In such type of librarianship, LIS professional can
use World Wide Web for reaching to their patrons
as shown in Fig. 1.

workplace of his clientele than at his own

Library and information science schools play an
important role in developing competent professionals
for managing libraries of all hues in the society.
Through sound teaching and up to date curriculum, LIS
schools provide a favorable environment to students
for learning new skills and knowledge for performing
their professional obligations in an efficient manner 7.
Library science schools are regularly redefining the
curriculum contents to make their passouts relevant
for today and tomorrow. To achieve this objective,
LIS schools are offering specialisation in different
areas like health, agriculture,etc., as is evident from
the curriculum adopted by these schools.
Always perform their activities in the context
and not out of context. Embedded librarians try
their best for satisfying their clientele. It is as such
evident from these features of embedded librarianship
that they must have thorough knowledge about a
particular subject like medicine, agriculture, law, etc.,
those library and information science professionals
who are possessing sufficient knowledge about a
particular subject can be successful embedded
librarians.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.785026">
4.1.2 Examples of Embedded Librarians in
Libraries
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998304527777778">
Scope of embedded librarianship is very wide.
Embedded librarians are having features that make
them relevant in any working environment. Some
examples of embedded librarianship are:
Librarians working in the profession of medicine
need some specialised knowledge for dealing with
information related to different branches of medical
profession. These embedded librarians in health sector
can play a very important role in disseminating right
information to the right users of information in an
effective and efficient manner. Similarly, law librarians
know better about information related to the legal
profession. There are LIS professionals who had
earned specialisation in the record archives and as
record archivists, they can play their important role.
Embedded librarians associated with business and
financial sector can perform nicely for promoting
and achieving the goals of that business.
In the present era, when there is interdisciplinary
and multidisciplinary trends operating in the universe
of knowledge, LIS professionals can get involved in
projects and can work within a team of collaborators
Librarians due to their specialised knowledge and
competencies will prove their mettle as embedded
LIS professionals in the team by offering both
customised and anticipatory information services to
all the members of that team. In the present IT era
there is the need of librarians having specialisation
in dealing with digital artifacts. For describing digital
objects, librarians create different sets of metadata.
Thus, there is scope for metadata librarians.
It is evident that library professionals working in
public, academic, school, medical, oriental, agriculture
law, defence, etc., and in any other specialised library
setting can use embedded librarianship principles
to enhance their working and careers.

4.2.1 Specialisation and Embedded Librarianship
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989852428571429">
Offering specialisation in the discipline of LIS
is actually a step for building embedded librarians.
In these specialisations, teachers give exposure to
different facets of the subject so that students taking
these specialised courses are able to offer effective
and qualitative information services to the library
patrons. University Grants Commission (UGC), the
apex body for governing higher education in India
has also incorporated concept of special information
systems in its model curriculum report published in
year under title CDC-Model curriculum (2001) 8 for
LIS. A number of special information systems are
enumerated in CDC report. The general objectives of
this module as given in the CDC report are to:

Library Consultants: Now a day’s corporate sector
have realised the importance of information and
are very keen in developing their own library for
fulfilling their information needs. Here, competent
LIS professionals can play an efficient role in
developing libraries.
It is also analysed from Fig. 2 that the contents
being taught in these courses mainly revolve around

professionals so that they can become successful
librarians of the future. The most important competency
for embedded librarians are the skills required for
building close relationship with the library patrons. e,
LIS schools must take care of developing soft skills
among the budding librarians. Besides soft skills LIS
professionals must possess sound knowledge and
skills about ICT. In the present information landscape
librarians should have enough knowledge about
the social networking tools and their application in
libraries and information centers.

5. CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999543473684211">
Present age is the age of specialisation. In any
discipline whether medical sciences, agricultural
science, engineering and technology ,etc., all disciplines
have developed specialised streams. Librarians
when equipped with sufficient knowledge about a
particular discipline, can perform their professional
obligations in a more effective way. By organising
information literacy programs, library professionals
can make his patrons proficient in the optimum,
effective and judicious use of information for not only
enhancing the understanding but productive utilisation
of information resources. By providing personal
assistance and assistance through virtual means,
embedded librarians can raise their professional
status in particular and the whole profession of
librarianship in general. Thus, the need of the hour
is that LIS schools make appropriate measures to
import qualitative education to students by integrating
more and more specialisations in the curriculum.
