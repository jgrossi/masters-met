Communicated by Francisco Mauro Salzano, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil, December 21, 2004 (received for review
September 30, 2004)
Cultural and linguistic groups are often expected to represent
genetic populations. In this article, we tested the hypothesis that
the hierarchical classification of languages proposed by J. Greenberg [(1987) Language in the Americas (Stanford Univ. Press, Stanford, CA)] also represents the genetic structure of Native North
American populations. The genetic data are mtDNA sequences for
17 populations gleaned from literature sources and public databases. The hypothesis was rejected. Further analysis showed that
departure of the genetic structure from the linguistic classification
was pervasive and not due to an outlier population or a problematic language group. Therefore, Greenberg’s language groups are
at best an imperfect approximation to the genetic structure of
these populations. Moreover, we show that the genetic structure
among these Native North American populations departs significantly from the best-fitting hierarchical models. Analysis of median
joining networks for mtDNA haplotypes provides strong evidence
for gene flow across linguistic boundaries. In principle, the language of a population can be replaced more rapidly than its genes
because language can be transmitted both vertically from parents
to children and horizontally between unrelated people. However,
languages are part of a cultural complex, and there may be strong
pressure to maintain a language in place whereas genes are free to
flow.
language and genetics ͉ mtDNA
G
eneticists and anthropologists often expect that human
language groups and gene pools will share a common
structure (1–4). It is noted that both language and genes are
passed from parents to children, mating tends to be endogamous
with respect to linguistic groups, and splits in linguistic communities usually occur with splits in breeding populations (5, 6).
Cavalli-Sforza et al. (7) have reported that genetic trees of major
geographic populations correlate well with language families.
They argue that a process consisting of population fissions,
expansion into new territories, and isolation between ancestral
and descendant groups will produced a tree-like structure common to both genes and languages. Linguists agree that population fissions and range expansions play an important role in the
generation of linguistic diversity (8–10). The correlation between patterns of linguistic and genetic variation has been
studied by many researchers in different world regions with
mixed positive (11–14) and negative (15–17) findings. Regional
differences in population history are likely to explain some of the
discrepant results. However, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions because these studies are heterogeneous with respect to the
genetic and population sampling units, definition of linguistic
variables, and analytical methods. Researchers on this topic have
identified the need for a method to directly compare language
trees with population genetic trees (1, 3).
The potential correspondence between gene pools and language groups in Native North American populations is particularly interesting for several reasons. First, the initial colonization of the Americas involved a population radiation from an
effectively small number of founders into an uninhabited region.
Second, it occurred long enough ago to permit the accumulation
1312–1317 ͉ PNAS ͉ February 1, 2005 ͉ vol. 102 ͉ no. 5
of both linguistic and genetic differences, but not so long ago that
the early history would necessarily have been erased by subsequent events. Third, there was a rich diversity of indigenous
languages in North America at the time of European contact (9,
10, 18, 19). Early investigations of the correspondence between
genetic groups and linguistic groups in Native North Americans
produced equivocal results (5, 6). On the one hand, average
genetic distances between populations in different language
families were greater than average genetic distances between
populations within language families. On the other hand, genetic
distances were not significantly correlated with glottochronological distances. However, the methods and data available 30
years ago had limited power to resolve the question.
This article revisits the question of relationship between
genetics and language in Native North American populations.
Comparable mtDNA sequences are now available for many
populations that represent diverse language groups. There are
three advantages to the mtDNA data. First, they have high power
to resolve population affinities. Second, it is easy to identify and
remove non-Native American mtDNA sequences. Third, by
contrasting gene and population trees, it is possible to discern
patterns of gene flow. We begin our analyses by formally testing
the hypothesis that a classification of languages proposed by
Greenberg (19) represents the structure of Native North American gene pools. Although the majority of linguists do not
endorse Greenberg’s language classification (4, 10, 18, 20, 21), it
is important to test this model because it remains one of the main
tenets against which questions about Native American population genetics and physical anthropology are formulated (3). To
preempt our results, this hypothesis is rejected. Because of this
finding, we proceed to ask two questions. First, is the genetic
structure of these populations hierarchical? Second, is there
evidence from mtDNA sequences for exchange across the
boundaries of widely accepted language families?

populations (24).
Model trees (e.g., the GLC) were fitted to the matrix of
observed, or ‘‘realized,’’ pairwise differences by using maximum
likelihood (25–27). Each fitted tree produces a matrix of ‘‘expected’’ average pairwise nucleotide substitutions contingent on
the assumption that the model tree accurately represents the
true genetic relationships among populations. The lack-of-fit of
the expected average pairwise differences relative to the realized
pairwise differences is measured by a likelihood ratio statistic, ⌳,
which under the idealized circumstances of a large number of
independent polymorphic sites is distributed as a ␹2 variable
(25). The degrees of freedom associated with this statistic are
equal to r(r ϩ 1)͞2 minus the number of parameters specified by
the fitted tree, where r is the number of populations sampled. To
visualize the fit of a model tree, we plotted realized versus
expected net nucleotide distances against one another. If a tree
model fit the genetic data, the expected genetic distances for
each population will be overestimated approximately as frequently as they are underestimated. The scattergram should
assume a symmetric cigar-shaped distribution.
Either or both of two potential reasons can explain why the
GLC model might fit poorly. The first is that the tree specified
by the GLC is the wrong tree to describe the genetic relationships
among these populations. The second is that the genetic data are
not tree-like; in other words, no tree will fit the genetic data well.
To distinguish among these alternatives, we applied the Fitch and
neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithms to identify tree topologies that
were optimized to the genetic data. We then used the maximum
likelihood method to fit these topologies to the genetic data,
applied the test for treeness, and examined plots of the realized
versus expected genetic distances. The rationale underlying this
test is that, if the genetic data are in fact tree-like, and only the
language hierarchy in particular is incompatible with the genetic
hierarchy, optimized trees will fit the genetic data. To determine
whether there was evidence in the mtDNA sequences for local
mate exchange across linguistic boundaries, we investigated the
pattern of relationships among individual mtDNA sequences
using median joining networks constructed for each haplogroup
using the method of Bandelt et al. (28).

looks different from Fig. 1 because the branch lengths vary, and
because the estimated length for many branches is zero. Notably,
length zero was estimated for the branches leading to two of the
three principal language families, Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dene.
The likelihood ratio statistic for the GLC model is high relative
to its degrees of freedom, indicating a substantial lack of fit to
the genetic data (Table 2). Note that the poor fit of the GLC does
not indicate insufficient information; rather it shows that the
genetic data contradict the structure postulated by the GLC
model. Nevertheless, the GLC fits much better than an island
model, which allows for genetic divergence, but assumes independent evolution, among populations (Table 2). To be certain
that the poor fit of the GLC was not solely the result of one
misplaced population, we repeated the analysis 17 times, each
time leaving out a different sample from the analysis. The

likelihood ratio statistic substantially exceeded its degrees of
freedom in each of these 17 analyses (results not shown). We
conclude that the poor fit of the GLC is systemic and not the
result of a single outlier population.
To identify the specific ways that the genetic data and GLC
model depart, we examined the plot of expected vs. realized
genetic distances (Fig. 2B). Several patterns that depart from the
tree structure are apparent upon close examination. For example, the GLC expected distances consistently overestimate the
realized genetic distances for several populations, including the
Navajo, Aleut, and Siberian Yupik populations. This relationship means that these populations are genetically similar to
populations with distantly related languages. Similarly, the GLC
tree consistently underestimates the genetic distance between
three Eskimo populations (Central Yupik, Canadian Inuit, and
Inupaiq) and all other populations.
Both the Fitch and NJ trees fit the data substantially better
than the GLC tree, and the NJ tree fits better than the Fitch tree
(Table 2). This result indicates that the data are more tree-like
than indicated by the GLC tree. Nonetheless, the likelihood ratio
statistics for both the NJ and Fitch trees are high relative to their
degrees of freedom (Table 2). This finding indicates a lack of fit
to the genetic data for even the best-fitting trees. The scatter plot
of realized versus expected genetic distances for the NJ tree (Fig.
3B) visually confirms the superior fit of the NJ tree over the GLC
tree. The results are not shown for the Fitch tree because they
are similar to the NJ tree. The lack of fit between the NJ tree and
the genetic data is evident from the fact that there is a consistent
trend for the realized genetic distances to exceed the expected
genetic distances. This lop-sided pattern is difficult to explain
and may be an artifact of applying the NJ algorithm to nontree-like data.
A drawing of the NJ tree (Fig. 3A) reveals some interesting
patterns. First, none of Greenberg’s major language groups
(Eskimo-Aleut, Na-Dene, or Amerind) forms a unique cluster.
The most exclusive cluster that contains all Eskimo-Aleut populations (defined by branch a) also includes all four Na-Denespeaking populations and the Amerind-speaking Cheyenne,
Bella Coola, and Nuu Chah Nulth populations. The most
exclusive cluster with all Na-Dene-speaking populations (defined by branch b) also includes six Eskimo-Aleut-speaking

populations (Siberian Yupik, Greenland Inuit, Central Yupik,
Canadian Inuit, and Inupiaq) and the Amerind-speaking Bella
Coola. The most exclusive cluster with all Amerind-speaking
populations (defined by branch c) includes the Eskimo-Aleutspeaking Aleuts and the Na-Dene-speaking Navajo. Second,
there is a strong North-South geographic pattern to the clustering pattern. An Arctic-Pacific Northwest cluster that includes all
Aleut-Eskimo populations, all Na-Dene populations, and the
Amerind Nuu Chah Nulth and Bella Coola populations originates on one side of branch a, whereas a more Southern group
includes the Pima, Cherokee, Sioux, and Chippewa Amerindspeaking population forms to the other side of branch a. The
Southwestern Athabascan-speaking populations, Navajo and
Apache, defy the geographic groupings, but this result is consistent with the archaeological record (30). Anthropologists
agree that circa anno Domini 1400 the ancestors of Navajos and
Apaches migrated from the Mackenzie Basin of Canada to the
Southwest region, where they came into contact with Amerindspeaking populations who had been living there for thousands of
years (31).
Fig. 4 shows the distribution of the canonical Native American
mtDNA haplogroups in the 17 populations. The occurrence of
haplogroup A differs markedly between the far Northern and the
Southwestern samples. With only few exceptions, mtDNA lineages observed in the northern Na-Dene classified populations
(Haida and Alaskan Athabascans) belong to haplogroup A (Fig.
4). Haplogroup A is also common in Eskimos and Aleuts.
Outside of the far North, the only samples in which haplogroup
A appears commonly are the Southwestern AthabascanHunley and Long
speaking populations (Navajo and Apache). mtDNA sequences
belonging to haplogroups B and C are frequent primarily in the
Amerind-classified populations (Fig. 4), including the Bella
Coola, and Nuu Chah Nulth populations on the Northwest
Coast. The Navajo and Apache are the only Na-Dene-classified
populations with substantial frequencies of B- and C-group
haplotypes, although haplogroup C is observed in the Haida and
Alaskan Athabascan samples. Haplogroup D mtDNA sequences
are common in the Eskimo and Aleut populations and the Bella
Coola and Nuu Chah Nulth on the Northwest Coast. In summary, the distribution of the major mtDNA haplogroups exhibits
a strong regional pattern in these samples. Haplogroups A and
D are concentrated in the far North and Northwest Coast,
whereas haplogroups B and C appear regularly on the Northwest
Coast and further South. Recent surveys of Native North
American mtDNA confirm the haplogroup distributions observed for the populations and regions represented here; however, broader distributions for the A, B, C, and D haplogroups
are noted when samples from other regions are included (32, 33).

In this study, we adopt a rigorous approach to tree comparisons.
First, a language classification is proposed as an a priori hypothesis for the genetic structure. Next, the language classification is
fitted to the genetic data. And finally, the resulting tree is tested
for treeness by using the method developed by Cavalli-Sforza and
Piazza (25). The null hypothesis is that the pattern of relationships among languages is the same as the pattern of relationships
among gene pools. We applied this approach to linguistic and

genetic data for Native North Americans by fitting Greenberg’s
linguistic classification (19) to mitochondrial D-loop nucleotide
sequence variations. The hypothesis of treeness was rejected.
Therefore, a significant difference exists between Greenberg’s
linguistic classification and the genetic structures of these populations. Trees produced by the NJ and Fitch algorithms fit the
genetic data better than did the Greenberg tree, but the treeness
hypothesis was rejected even for these trees. Thus, we conclude
that the genetic relationships among populations are not treelike. The lack of treeness in the genetic data makes it unlikely
that any hierarchical language classification will provide a close
fit. The fact that not one of Greenberg’s three major language
groups (Amerind, Aleut-Eskimo, and Na Dene) formed an
exclusive cluster in the better-fitting genetic trees produced by
the NJ and Fitch algorithms shows that the problems with the
GLC are pervasive and not due to a single problematic language
group.
One possibility for the disagreement between the genetic data
and the GLC is that the precontact pattern was disrupted by the
entry of Europeans. We wish to emphasize why we do not feel
that European contact is a likely explanation for our results.
First, we restricted our analysis to mtDNA sequences that are
established to be present in Native Americans and absent in
Europeans. Second, population bottleneck and͞or expansion
events in the postcontact era would have changed relative branch
lengths but would not have destroyed the treeness in the data.
Third, 14 of the 17 populations are situated today in the same
localities that they occupied at the time of first European
contact. Fourth, mtDNA from ancient (precontact) Native
American populations look similar to postcontact populations in
the same region (34–36).
Another possibility for the disagreement between the genetic
data and the GLC is that the GLC is a poor representation of the
relationships among Native North American languages (4). In
fact, most linguists do not accept the GLC (4, 10, 18, 20, 21).
Greenberg’s methods have been criticized (21, 37), and it is felt
widely that there is not sufficient information to establish deep
linguistic connections (10). Nevertheless, Greenberg included
some undisputed language families within his classification.
These undisputed families include the Eskimo-Aleut family and
the Athabascan language group (10, 38, 39). We therefore find
it quite interesting that the fitted branch to both Eskimo-Aleut
and Athabascan was estimated to have zero length (Fig. 2). This
finding suggests that the branch accounts for no increase in
genetic relationship among its descendants. The NJ tree (Fig. 3)
shows that the classifications within Aleut-Eskimo and Na Dene
language families disagree with the population genetic relationships, regardless of whether or not they are analyzed within the
context of the GLC. In fact, the NJ tree conflicts with generally
accepted language groups presented by Campbell (10). Aleuts
do not cluster with Eskimos. Neither the Yupik nor Inuit
populations form distinct clusters within Eskimo. The two
Algonquin-speaking populations do not form a cluster. The
Navajo and Apache are separated in the NJ tree by the nonAthabascan-speaking Bella Coola. It is possible that a stronger
relationship between language groups and gene pools would be
found by directly assessing language areas that arise from
diffusion of linguistic traits across phylogenetic boundaries of
languages (4, 10).
The poor correspondence between the genetic data and
language groups reflects the current population structure. Genetic and linguistic variation may have shared the same hierarchical relationships in the past. In fact, there are several features
in the data that can be interpreted as remnants of such relationships. These features include the Eskimo-Aleut-specific
transition polymorphism (29) and the two Athabascan-specific
transition polymorphisms (14). Interestingly, these results are
consistent with a linguistic model proposed by Nettle (9) that
1316 ͉ www.pnas.org͞cgi͞doi͞10.1073͞pnas.0409301102
predicts that high diversity of language stocks is a transitory
phase in linguistic evolution. According to Nettle’s model, the
entry of humans into a new region such as the Americas affords
significant opportunity for the birth of new languages. Upon
entry, population growth will be rapid and groups will fission and
spread at high rate until the region is filled. New linguistic
lineages will be founded, with population splits creating a
tree-like structure. However, the rate of population fission will
decline as open niches fill. Eventually, population dynamics will
be governed by competition and efficiency of resource utilization. In this phase, linguistic diversity will decline as expanding
communities absorb neighbors or as less successful communities
fragment and members disperse.
Examination of the median joining networks for the canonical
mtDNA haplogroups and population trees indicates a history of
pervasive genetic exchange across linguistic boundaries. The
distribution of mtDNA haplogroups in the Apache and Navajo
presents the clearest example. As shown in Fig. 4, the distribution
of the canonical Native American mtDNA haplogroups differs
markedly between the far North and the Southwest. Notably,
mtDNA sequences belonging to haplogroup B are not observed
in the northern Na-Dene-attributed populations, and members
of haplogroup C occur rarely (Fig. 4). By contrast, mtDNA
sequences in Southwestern non-Athabascan speakers are characterized by the predominance of members of haplogroups B
and C and the absence of members of haplogroup A. The
haplogroup configuration for non-Athabascan speakers in the
Southwest is exemplified in the present study by the Pima
mtDNA sequences (Fig. 4) and has been established in surveys
of haplogroups determined from diagnostic sites in many other
Southwestern populations (33, 40). The Navajo and Apache
possess many haplogroup A sequences typical of Northwestern
populations with languages attributed to the Na Dene language
family. However, DNA sequences belonging to haplogroups B
and C are also common in the Navajo and Apache, and these are
most likely due to immigrants from the local non-Athabascanspeaking populations. The elevated nucleotide diversity in the
Navajo and Apache relative to their northern counterparts is the
consequence of these haplogroup B and C mtDNA sequences.
Interestingly, the pattern of genetic exchange is not reciprocal.
A-group haplotypes would have appeared in the Pima sample if
they had absorbed a substantial number of Athabascan-speaking
migrants. The pattern of asymmetrical genetic exchanges is all
the more interesting given current mate exchange practices.
Today, marriage practice in both the Western Apache and
Navajo is strongly matrilineal. On this basis, we would not expect
to see the inclusion of female lineages introduced from the
surrounding non-Athabascan-speaking populations. However,
the practice of matrilineality in these populations is likely to have
begun after the Navajos and Apaches arrived in the Southwest
(31). This practice makes it likely that the haplogroup B and C
mtDNA sequences carried in the Navajo and Apache today were
introduced early in their experience in the Southwest, and before
the current cultural practices were initiated.
In addition to the presence of B- and C-group haplotypes in
the Navajo and Apache, other features of the median-joining
networks indicate genetic exchange between linguistically divergent neighboring populations in the Northwest and Arctic. For
example, the Northwest Coast Bella Coola and Nuu Chah Nulth
(attributed to Amerind) share A-group lineages with the Northwest Coast Haida (attributed to Na Dene), whereas the Eskimos
in the far North share A-group lineages with interior dwelling
Alaskan Athabascans. If language replacements predominated
over gene replacements, we would expect good treeness for the
genetic data but poor agreement between genetic and linguistic
trees. In opposition to this expectation, even the best trees for the
genetic data display a significant lack of treeness.
Hunley and Long
Many researchers have noted that either the language or the
genes in a population can be replaced, and examples of both gene
and language replacement have been identified (1, 2, 7). There
has been a tendency to expect that language replacements will
be more common (3, 41). In principle, language replacement can
occur more rapidly than gene replacement because language can
be transmitted both vertically from parents to children and
horizontally between unrelated people, creating bilingual and
multilingual individuals, whereas genes can be transmitted only
vertically (1, 42). However, we found that the constraints imposed by mechanisms of transmission may be relatively weak as
compared with other factors that will influence whether genes,
languages, or both will be replaced.
Finally, we note that our findings are relevant to a multiple
migration theory for the peopling of the Americas. According to
this hypothesis, the ancestors of modern Amerind, Na-Dene, and
Eskimo-Aleut speakers migrated into the Americas in three
independent waves of migration, separated in time by thousands
This work evaluates scientific hypotheses about the nature of correspondence between language groups and genetic populations. It is not a test
of cultural practices or spiritual beliefs held by Native North Americans,
and it should not be interpreted in that light. We thank Drs. D. (Weiss)

resolving power, our analyses of the currently available mtDNA
sequences show that the patterns of variation in genes and
languages actually disagree. Although our findings do not disprove that multiple migrations occurred historically, they dissipate a principal argument that was advanced to formulate the
theory.

Another possibility for the disagreement between the genetic data and the GLC is that the GLC is a poor representation of the relationships among Native North American languages (4). In fact, most linguists do not accept the GLC (4, 10, 18, 20, 21). Greenberg’s methods have been criticized (21, 37), and it is felt widely that there is not sufficient information to establish deep linguistic connections (10). Nevertheless, Greenberg included some undisputed language families within his classification. These undisputed families include the Eskimo-Aleut family and the Athabascan language group (10, 38, 39). We therefore find it quite interesting that the fitted branch to both Eskimo-Aleut and Athabascan was estimated to have zero length (Fig. 2). This finding suggests that t</context>

Aleuts do not cluster with Eskimos. Neither the Yupik nor Inuit populations form distinct clusters within Eskimo. The two Algonquin-speaking populations do not form a cluster. The Navajo and Apache are separated in the NJ tree by the nonAthabascan-speaking Bella Coola. It is possible that a stronger relationship between language groups and gene pools would be found by directly assessing language areas that arise from diffusion of linguistic traits across phylogenetic boundaries of languages (4, 10). The poor correspondence between the genetic data and language groups reflects the current population structure. Genetic and linguistic variation may have shared the same hierarchical relationships in the past. In fact, there are several features in the data that can be interpreted as remnants of such relationships. These features include the Eskimo-Aleut-specific transition polymorphism (29) and the two Athabascan-specific transition polymorphisms (14).

If language replacements predominated over gene replacements, we would expect good treeness for the genetic data but poor agreement between genetic and linguistic trees. In opposition to this expectation, even the best trees for the genetic data display a significant lack of treeness. Hunley and Long Many researchers have noted that either the language or the genes in a population can be replaced, and examples of both gene and language replacement have been identified (1, 2, 7). There has been a tendency to expect that language replacements will be more common (3, 41). In principle, language replacement can occur more rapidly than gene replacement because language can be transmitted both vertically from parents to children and horizontally between unrelated people, creating bilingual and multilingual individuals, whereas genes can be transmitted only vertically (1, 42). However, we found that the constraints imposed by mechanisms of transmission may be relatively weak as compared with other factors that will influence whether genes, languages, or both will be replac</context>

Another possibility for the disagreement between the genetic data and the GLC is that the GLC is a poor representation of the relationships among Native North American languages (4). In fact, most linguists do not accept the GLC (4, 10, 18, 20, 21). Greenberg’s methods have been criticized (21, 37), and it is felt widely that there is not sufficient information to establish deep linguistic connections (10). Nevertheless, Greenberg included some undisputed language families within his classification. These undisputed families include the Eskimo-Aleut family and the Athabascan language group (10, 38, 39). We therefore find it quite interesting that the fitted branch to both Eskimo-Aleut and Athabascan was estimated to have zero length (Fig. 2). This finding suggests that the branch accounts for no increase in genetic relationship among it</context>

First, the initial colonization of the Americas involved a population radiation from an effectively small number of founders into an uninhabited region. Second, it occurred long enough ago to permit the accumulation 1312–1317  PNAS  February 1, 2005  vol. 102  no. 5 of both linguistic and genetic differences, but not so long ago that the early history would necessarily have been erased by subsequent events. Third, there was a rich diversity of indigenous languages in North America at the time of European contact (9, 10, 18, 19). Early investigations of the correspondence between genetic groups and linguistic groups in Native North Americans produced equivocal results (5, 6). On the one hand, average genetic distances between populations in different language families were greater than average genetic distances between populations within language families. On the other hand, genetic distances were not significantly correlated with glottochronological distances. However, the methods and data available 30 years ago had limited power to resolve the question. This article revisits the question of relationship between gen</context>

Next, the language classification is fitted to the genetic data. And finally, the resulting tree is tested for treeness by using the method developed by Cavalli-Sforza and Piazza (25). The null hypothesis is that the pattern of relationships among languages is the same as the pattern of relationships among gene pools. We applied this approach to linguistic and PNAS  February 1, 2005  vol. 102  no. 5  1315 ANTHROPOLOGY Fig. 4. genetic data for Native North Americans by fitting Greenberg’s linguistic classification (19) to mitochondrial D-loop nucleotide sequence variations. The hypothesis of treeness was rejected. Therefore, a significant difference exists between Greenberg’s linguistic classification and the genetic structures of these populations. Trees produced by the NJ and Fitch algorithms fit the genetic data better than did the Greenberg tree, but the treeness hypothesis was rejected even for these trees. Thus, we conclude that the genetic relationships among populations are not treelike. The lack of treeness in the genetic data makes it unlikely that any hierarchical language classification will pro</context>
