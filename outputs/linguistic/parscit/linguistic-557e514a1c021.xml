A total of 104 six-year-old children belonging to 4 groups (English monolinguals, Chinese-English bilinguals,
French-English bilinguals, Spanish-English bilinguals) were compared on 3 verbal tasks and 1 nonverbal executive control task to examine the generality of the bilingual effects on development. Bilingual groups differed
in degree of similarity between languages, cultural background, and language of schooling. On the executive
control task, all bilingual groups performed similarly and exceeded monolinguals; on the language tasks the
best performance was achieved by bilingual children whose language of instruction was the same as the
language of testing and whose languages had more overlap. Thus, executive control outcomes for bilingual
children are general but performance on verbal tasks is specific to factors in the bilingual experience.
It is not surprising that the linguistic development
of bilingual children is different from that of their
monolingual peers, but increasing evidence shows
that nonverbal cognitive development is also
affected by bilingualism. These outcomes, however,
are different. Linguistic tasks are often performed
more poorly by bilingual children than
monolinguals, especially assessments of vocabulary
(Bialystok, Luk, Peets, &amp; Yang, 2010; Oller, Pearson,
&amp; Cobo-Lewis, 2007), although tests of metalinguistic awareness are generally performed better by
bilingual children (Bialystok, 1986; Cromdal, 1999;
Ricciardelli, 1992). In contrast, many tests of
executive control are performed better by bilinguals

although there is no effect for tasks based on withholding a response even though that too is part of
executive control (Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Martin-Rhee &amp; Bialystok, 2008).
Understanding these effects is complicated by
the fact that bilingualism is often correlated with
variables that may themselves influence performance. For example, Morton and Harper (2007)
This research was supported by Grant R01HD052523 from the
U.S. National Institutes of Health to Ellen Bialystok. The colorshape task switching was programmed by Dr. Nicholas Cepeda
at York University, Canada.

claimed that the reported bilingual advantage was
due to socioeconomic differences between bilingual
and monolingual children. There is no doubt that
socioeconomic status (SES) is a powerful influence
on executive control, but it does not undermine the
body of literature for which bilingual advantages
have been recorded (Bialystok, 2009). Similarly,
claims for cultural effects favoring Asian children
on tests of executive control (e.g., Sabbagh, Xu,
Carlson, Moses, &amp; Lee, 2006) must be separated
from the role of bilingualism in shaping this performance. The present study addresses these issues by
examining three groups of bilingual children and
one group of monolinguals performing verbal and
nonverbal tasks. The bilingual children differ in
terms of similarity between English and their other
language, cultural background, and educational
experience. It is not possible to achieve a parametric manipulation of these variables, so our approach
is to compare specific groups to address each of
these factors.
Two previous studies have examined the role of
culture and immigration history on the cognitive
outcomes of bilingualism. Bialystok and Viswanathan (2009) compared three groups of 8-year-old
children on an executive control task. Children
were matched on educational experience and social
class and were English-speaking monolinguals in
Canada, bilinguals in Canada (mixed cultural
backgrounds, immigrants), or bilinguals in India

Barac and Bialystok
(South Asian culture, nonimmigrants). The results
showed that the two bilingual groups outperformed the monolinguals on the conflict conditions,
with no difference between the two bilingual
groups. In another study, Bialystok, Barac, et al.
(2010) compared a group of bilinguals with two
monolingual groups—an English-speaking group
in Canada and a French-speaking group in France.
Again, there was no difference between the two
monolingual groups and better performance by the
bilinguals on all the conflict tasks. Together, these
results support the generality of the bilingual
effects over the influence of immigration and culture on nonverbal tests of executive control.
Unlike cognitive outcomes, different groups of
bilinguals do not perform comparably on linguistic
tasks. Spanish-English bilinguals outperformed both
monolinguals and Chinese-English bilinguals on a
test of English phonological awareness, presumably
because of the degree of similarity between the languages (Bialystok, Majumder, &amp; Martin, 2003).
Spanish orthography is transparent in that it is
based on consistent letter–sound mappings, and this
factor might also contribute to the enhanced performance of Spanish-English bilinguals on phonological awareness tasks. In addition, phonological
awareness appears to transfer easily across languages. Cross-language correlations in performance
on phonological awareness tasks have been reported
for English-Spanish bilinguals (Lindsey, Manis, &amp;
Bailey, 2003), English-French bilinguals (Comeau,
Cormier, Grandmaison, &amp; Lacroix, 1999), and English-Cantonese bilinguals (Luk &amp; Bialystok, 2008)
indicating a common basis for this ability across
languages irrespective of its rate of development.
The same is not true for early reading: In a study
comparing Spanish-English, Hebrew-English, and
Chinese-English bilingual children on a decoding
task in both languages, better performance than
monolinguals was found for the Spanish and
Hebrew groups, with no advantage for the ChineseEnglish group (Bialystok, Luk, &amp; Kwan, 2005). In
these cases, the relation between the languages contributed to performance, and in contrast to the study
of phonological awareness, there was no correlation
in decoding ability across English and Chinese, languages with different writing systems, but strong
cross-language correlations with English for both
Spanish and Hebrew, languages with more similar
writing systems. Therefore, the relation between languages has different effects on the development of
basic metalinguistic and literacy concepts. No study
to date has examined the effect of bilingual experience for both verbal and nonverbal outcomes in the
same children to determine the role of bilingualism
in each of these developmental outcomes.
In the present study, we examine the effects of
specific language pairs, cultural background, and
educational experience on verbal and nonverbal
performance. The language factor reflects the possibility that the effect of bilingualism depends on the
relation between the two languages. Previous studies have used either heterogeneous samples (i.e.,
children speaking a variety of language pairs;
Bialystok &amp; Senman, 2004; Bialystok &amp; Shapero,
2005) or homogeneous samples (i.e., all children
spoke the same two languages but with different
languages across studies; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004,
Study 2; Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Cromdal, 1999;
Martin-Rhee &amp; Bialystok, 2008, Study 1; Ricciardelli, 1992). Therefore, it is not clear whether the specific language or the relation between the two
languages mediates the results. In the present
study, we compared homogenous groups of bilingual children and manipulated the similarity
between the two languages.
Regarding culture, recent research has suggested
that Chinese and Korean monolingual children
show more advanced executive function performance than English monolingual children in North
American and United Kingdom (e.g., Oh &amp; Lewis,
2008; Sabbagh et al., 2006). Based on these findings,
Carlson and Meltzoff (2008) argued that research
with bilingual children needs to be replicated using
non-Chinese samples to account for the possibility
that results might be confounded by ‘‘cultural differences in the early socialization of self-control.’’
However, these studies are vague about what
aspects of culture contribute to differences in executive control and what mechanism underlies these
cross-cultural differences. Lewis and colleagues, for
instance, proposed that multiple factors could
explain the improved control in Asian children
including genetic factors, educational and parental
practices, and language characteristics such as frequent use of verbs with young children (Lewis
et al., 2009). Parmar, Harkness, and Super (2004)
reported evidence that Asian- and Euro-American
parents of American preschoolers differed in their
beliefs and practices of raising children. Although
these studies demonstrate that cultural factors
impact aspects of monolingual performance on
certain tasks, it is still unclear whether bilingual
children of different cultural backgrounds
(i.e., Asian, non-Asian) who are raised in the same
communities and attend the same schools would
show comparable patterns of linguistic and cognitive performance.
Language, Culture, Education, and Bilingualism
The language of education may also mediate the
documented effects of bilingualism. The study by
Bialystok, Luk, et al. (2010) on English receptive
vocabulary showed that words associated with
schooling were responded to equally well by monolingual and bilingual children, whereas comprehension of words primarily associated with home was
better in monolinguals. Related evidence from
English monolingual children demonstrated that the
development of emerging literacy skills (i.e., awareness of the characteristics of the English writing system) was strongly predicted by the degree to which
children engaged in home activities involving reading and writing practice (Levy, Gong, Hessels,
Evans, &amp; Jared, 2006). However, research rarely controls for which language is used in school even
though vocabulary size is a predictor of children’s
performance on tests of academic achievement such
as spelling, reading, and arithmetic (Smith, Smith, &amp;
Dobbs, 1991) and is positively related to executive
control in preschoolers (Carlson &amp; Moses, 2001). No
studies to date have compared bilingual groups
who are instructed in different languages to assess
the effects on language and cognitive functions.
We compared bilingual children whose two languages were English plus one of Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese), French, or Spanish, with a group
of English-speaking monolingual children. French
and Spanish have some similarity with English and
have shared cognate words and comparable grammatical structures (Finkenstaedt &amp; Wolff, 1973), but
Chinese is different from the other languages in
these dimensions (Chen &amp; Zhou, 1999). At the phonological level, Chinese is a tonal language whereas
English, French, and Spanish are nontonal languages (Ye &amp; Connine, 1999). In terms of writing
system, French, Spanish, and English use an alphabetic system (Goswami, Gombert, &amp; de Barrera,
1998), whereas Chinese is a logographic language
(Shen &amp; Forster, 1999). Morphologically, Chinese
differs from English and other alphabetic languages
in the relative number of compound words (i.e.,
snowman, toothpaste) such that they represent
about 75% of all words in the Chinese language
but only a very small proportion in the alphabetic
languages (Chen, Hao, Geva, Zhu, &amp; Shu, 2009; Liu
&amp; McBride-Chang, 2010). Finally, the overall classification of languages places them in different language families: English, French, and Spanish are
Indo-European (with French and Spanish being
Latin) and Chinese is Sino-Tibetan (Comrie, 1987).
Thus, by contrasting French and Spanish bilinguals
to Chinese bilinguals it is possible to understand
how the similarity between languages affects the

linguistic and nonlinguistic outcomes of bilingualism.
The comparison between Chinese-English bilingual children and the other two bilingual groups
allowed for the examination of the role of culture in
the performance of these linguistic and executive
control tasks by contrasting Asian bilinguals with
non-Asian bilinguals. Finally, all the children lived
in an English-speaking community, but the FrenchEnglish bilingual children attended schools in which
French was the medium of instruction while children in the other three groups were instructed in
English. All testing was conducted in English, so the
language of schooling might independently impact
performance. Because cultural background and
language similarity are correlated, only tentative
conclusions about these factors will be offered, a
point to which we return in the Discussion.
Previous research has demonstrated that differences in executive control for bilingual children are
not influenced by immigration history (Bialystok &amp;
Viswanathan, 2009) or culture variables (Bialystok,
Barac, et al. 2010), but the role of these factors on
language performance has been less explored.
Therefore, the verbal tasks in the present study
covered three aspects of language proficiency:
receptive vocabulary, grammatical ability, and metalinguistic knowledge. The nonverbal task was a
task-switching paradigm. This task was chosen
because it (a) involves processes similar to those
children use to switch attention between languages;
(b) distinguishes between global and local switch
costs, each of which indexes different cognitive processes with different developmental trajectories;
and (c) has been used with children (Bialystok &amp;
Viswanathan, 2009) and adults (Bialystok, Craik, &amp;
Ryan, 2006; Costa, Herna´ndez, &amp; Sebastia´n-Galle´s,
2008) to show bilingual advantages in global but
not local costs. Moreover, previous research has
demonstrated bilingual advantages in inhibition
using such tasks as the flanker ANT task (Mezzacappa, 2004; Yang et al., 2005) and dimensional
change card sort task (Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok &amp;
Martin, 2004), but other executive control components, particularly switching and flexibility, have
been less studied.
There are two possibilities for the effect of language similarity on executive control. The first is
that languages that are more similar require more
control to discriminate and therefore lead to more
enhanced control mechanisms. Conversely, it may
be that languages that are more distant require
more switching and monitoring and that may be
the source of greater enhancement. Our hypothesis

Barac and Bialystok
was that both types of experiences should lead to
equivalent enhancement because both require
effortful attention. Thus, we expected that all three
bilingual groups would perform similarly on nonverbal test of control but that the relation between
the two languages and the language experience in
education would affect the outcomes of the verbal
tasks, with better performance by children whose
two languages are more related (French and Spanish groups) and whose education is in English, the
language of testing (Spanish group).

Participants were 104 children composed of 26
English monolingual children, 30 Chinese-English
bilingual children, 28 French-English bilingual children, and 20 Spanish-English bilingual children. All
the children lived in a large multicultural city and
attended public schools. The French-English bilinguals attended a school in which the language of
instruction was French, all other children received
school instruction in English. All parents completed
the Language and Social Background Questionnaire
(LSBQ) in which they answered questions about
language use patterns on a scale from 1 to 5, where
1 indicated the exclusive use of English, 5 indicated
the exclusive use of a non-English language, and 3
indicated balanced use of the two. The scales were
combined to produce a mean score for language
use at home and a mean score for the language spoken by the child at home. These scores are reported
in Table 1.
The English monolingual group (M = 71.5 months,
SD = 6.3, range = 62.4–86.7 months; 13 girls and 13
boys) reported little exposure to a non-English language. In the Chinese-English bilingual group
(M = 71.5 months, SD = 6.5, range = 63.3–87.0
months; 14 girls and 16 boys), two one-sample t tests
comparing the home language with three (balanced
use of the languages) showed that parents used Chinese more frequently to communicate with the children, t(27) = 5.73, p &amp;lt; .0001, but that children spoke
both languages equally, t(28) = )0.65, ns. For the
French-English bilingual group (M = 74.8 months,
SD = 3.8, range = 67.4–81.0 months; 12 girls and 16
boys) neither home exposure to English, t(26) = 1.24,
ns, nor home use of English, t = 0, differed from
balanced usage. Finally, in the Spanish-English
bilingual group (M = 74.4 months, SD = 9.9, range =
56.4–91.0 months; 10 girls and 10 boys), home exposure to English indicated more exposure to Spanish
than English, t(19) = 2.36, p &amp;lt; .03, but children’s
home use of English did not differ from balanced
use, t(19) = )1.79, ns. Comparing the three bilingual
groups in terms of home language exposure, a oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated a main
effect of language group, F(2, 72) = 4.21, p &amp;lt; .02. Post
hoc Bonferroni contrasts showed that ChineseEnglish bilingual children received more home
exposure to the non-English language than the
French-English bilinguals, with the Spanish-English
bilinguals not significantly different from the other
two groups. A one-way ANOVA for the home
language spoken by the child showed no differences
among the three groups, F &amp;lt; 1.

Scores for home language use for English monolinguals were not further analyzed. bBecause of an error in administration, the scale
for number of years of education for three of the groups was out of 5 but for the fourth group was out of 7. Therefore, all scores were
converted to proportions. cOne monolingual child could not complete the box task for medical reasons. The child had broken her
thumb and could not hold the pencil properly to complete the task.

sent, and children provided verbal assent before
testing. All tasks were administered in English. The
battery consisted of two background measures
(Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test [KBIT], box completion), three language measures (Peabody Picture
Vocabulary Test–III [PPVT–III], the Wugs test, Formulated Sentences from the Clinical Evaluation of
Language Fundamentals Test), and a computerized
executive control task (color–shape task switching).
The tasks were administered in a fixed order:
Wugs, PPVT–III, Formulated Sentences, color–
shape task switching, box completion and KBIT.
This order was chosen to ensure that there was
enough variety in the tasks to keep children’s interest during the testing session. Children were given
stickers after the completion of each task.
Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, 2nd edition (KBIT–2).
The Matrices subtest of the KBIT–2 was administered to assess fluid reasoning (Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 2004). The test consists of 46 items divided
into three sections of increasing difficulty. On each
trial, the child was presented with visual stimuli
representing either drawings of concrete objects or
abstract figures. In the first part of the test the child
saw one target drawing at the centre of the page
and five additional drawings below it and was
asked to identify one of the five stimuli matching
the target image. For the other two sections the
child saw an incomplete display of 2 · 2 or 3 · 3
visual stimuli with one stimulus missing, and five
stimuli below the display. The task was to choose
the stimulus to complete the displayed pattern. The
testing, scoring and standardization followed the
standard procedure described in the manual.
Box completion. This task is a measure of psychomotor speed (Salthouse, 1996). The child was presented with a letter-sized sheet of paper containing
an array of 35 three-sided squares arranged in five
columns and seven rows. The squares were identical in size (side length of 1.9 cm). The child’s task
was to complete the squares by filling in the fourth
side as fast as possible using a crayon. Children
were shown examples of how to perform the task
before testing began. The time to complete the task
(in seconds) was recorded from the moment the
child started drawing the first line to the moment
the last square was finished.
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, 3rd edition. This is a
standardized test of receptive vocabulary (Dunn &amp;
Dunn, 1997) in which children select a picture from
four options to match a word given by the experimenter. The testing and scoring were done according to the procedures described in the manual.

Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, 4th
edition (CELF–4). The Formulated Sentences subtest
was used to assess children’s ability to construct
sentences which are grammatically and semantically intact (Semel, Wiig, &amp; Secord, 2003). For each
item, children were presented with a picture and a
target word and were asked to create a sentence
about the picture that incorporated the target word.
There were two practice trials before the administration of the test items. Testing, scoring, and standardization followed the standard procedure
described in the manual.
The Wugs test. This test assesses children’s ability to apply morphological rules of English (Berko,
1958) to unfamiliar forms, thereby reflecting children’s metalinguistic awareness. Children were
shown 27 pictures illustrating novel objects, animals, plants, and actions. The experimenter pointed
to each picture and read the associated text. Thirty
of the 33 texts introduced a target nonsense word
(e.g., wug, kazh, gutch, etc.) and the remaining
three included English target words (glass, melt,
ring). Children needed to complete the sentence
using the target word by applying English
morphology to the new words. The rules were the
formation of noun plural, past tense, third person
singular for simple present tense, singular and plural possessives, comparative and superlative of
adjectives, diminutives, derived adjectives, compounded words, progressive, and derived agentive.
Two practice trials in which children created plurals for real English words (e.g., cat, dog) preceded
the test. Each correct answer received 1 point, with
the maximum being 33.
Color–shape task switching. This test assesses children’s ability to switch between tasks, a central
component of the executive function (Miyake et al.,
2000). The task was programmed in Macromedia
Flash Player 7 and administered on a Lenovo X61
tablet computer with a 12-in. touch-screen monitor.
The stimuli were schematic drawings of a cow and
horse that were red or blue. A blue horse and a red
cow appeared on the top of the screen, each surrounded by a black square. On each trial, a stimulus red horse or blue cow) appeared on the bottom
center of the screen with a visual cue indicating
whether the stimulus was to be matched by color
or shape to the targets. Children responded by
touching the target picture that matched the stimulus on the designated dimension. The cue for color
was a circular color wheel about 0.5 cm in diameter
and the cue for shape was a black-and-white starlike shape of similar size.

There were 200 trials across two nonswitch
blocks (25 trials each) and three switch blocks (50
trials each). In nonswitch blocks, all trials appeared
with the same matching criterion, and in switch
blocks, the matching criterion for each trial was
generated randomly by the program with 50% of
the trials containing each cue. In switch blocks, successive trials could either have the same matching
criterion (nonswitch trials) or different matching
criteria (switch trials). Blocks were administered in
a fixed order starting with the two nonswitch
blocks and continuing with the three switch blocks.
Half of the children started the test with the nonswitch color block and the other half with the nonswitch shape block. The stimulus remained on the
screen until the child made a response. Children
were instructed to perform as quickly as possible
without making mistakes. Following the response,
the next trial started after a delay of 1000 ms.
Reaction time (RT) and accuracy were recorded
for each trial. Global and local switch costs were
calculated from the RTs of correct trials. Global cost
was calculated as the difference between mean RT
for nonswitch trials in the two nonswitch blocks
and mean RT of nonswitch trials in the switch
blocks. Local switch cost was calculated as the
difference between mean RT of nonswitch trials
and mean RT of switch trials in the switch blocks
(Cepeda, Kramer, &amp; de Sather, 2001).

Preliminary two-way ANOVAs of gender and language group for each task indicated no main effects
of gender and no interaction between gender and
language group in any analysis. Consequently, the
analyses reported below were performed by collapsing across gender groups. All significant main
effects of language group were followed up with
post hoc Bonferroni contrasts to adjust for multiple
comparisons.
Table 1 presents the mean and standard deviations for the background measures. There were no
differences in age, F(3, 100) = 1.95, ns, or SES, F(3,
98) = 1.66, ns, as measured by parents’ years of education reported on the LSBQ. Similarly, one-way
ANOVAs with language group as a between-subject
factor indicated no difference between groups for
KBIT–2 scores, or box completion times, Fs &amp;lt; 1.
Table 2 presents the mean scores and standard
deviations for the language tasks. A one-way
ANOVA on PPVT scores showed a main effect of
language group, F(3, 100) = 8.27, p &amp;lt; .0001. Post hoc
Bonferroni contrasts indicated that the monolingual
children and the Spanish-English bilingual children
outperformed the other two bilingual groups who
did not differ from each other. For scores from the
CELF test, the one-way ANOVA also indicated a
main effect of language group, F(3, 100) = 4.35,
p &amp;lt; .01, with post hoc Bonferroni contrasts showing
that monolingual and Spanish-English bilingual
children outperformed the French-English bilingual
group. Chinese-English bilinguals were not significantly different from any of the other three language groups. Finally, the ANOVA on Wug scores
showed a main effect of language group, F(3,
100) = 7.65, p &amp;lt; .0001, in which the Spanish-English
bilingual children outperformed the other three
groups.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate
the effects of language similarity, cultural background, and educational experience on the verbal
and nonverbal outcomes of bilingualism. Six-yearold monolingual and bilingual children with equivalent psychomotor speed, general cognitive level,
and SES performed language tasks measuring
vocabulary, grammar, and metalinguistic knowledge, and a nonverbal executive control task assessing task switching. The three bilingual groups
differed on several factors yet demonstrated similar
performance in task switching, exceeding that of
their monolingual peers. Consistent with other
research (e.g., Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009),
bilingual children showed smaller global switch
costs than monolingual children. These results offer
strong support for the claim that bilingualism acts
independently of variables such as language similarity, cultural background, and language of schooling in influencing nonverbal outcomes. In previous
studies, East Asian preschoolers showed an advantage over children from non-Asian cultures on both
conflict inhibition measures (e.g., day ⁄ night task,
Luria’s hand game task) and delay inhibition
measures (e.g., gift delay; e.g., Oh &amp; Lewis, 2008;
Sabbagh et al., 2006). However, research with bilinguals only shows advantages on conflict tasks
with no advantage on delay tasks (e.g., Carlson &amp;
Meltzoff, 2008). Therefore, it may be that influences
of Asian culture affect delay inhibition independently of bilingual effects on conflict resolution. In
the present study, Chinese-English bilinguals did
not differ from the Spanish- and French-English

bilinguals on executive control, suggesting that
cultural background did not contribute to performance above and beyond bilingualism. Taken
together with other results (Bialystok, Barac, et al.,
2010; Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009), these findings demonstrate the generality of the bilingual
advantage in executive functioning.
In contrast to nonverbal performance, scores on
the verbal tasks were mediated by language similarity and language of schooling. The Spanish bilingual children outperformed the French bilingual
children on all three measures (receptive vocabulary, grammatical knowledge, and metalinguistic
awareness) and the Chinese bilinguals on two of
them (receptive vocabulary and metalinguistic
awareness). Importantly, the Spanish bilinguals
were not different from the other two bilingual
groups in terms of the amount of language exposure and language production at home. The Spanish bilinguals and Chinese bilinguals were both
being educated in English, but English metalinguistic performance was better only for the Spanish
children, possibly because of greater similarity
between Spanish and English. This pattern is consistent with results reported by Bialystok et al.
(2003, Study 3) showing an interaction between
language similarity and bilingualism to determine
verbal outcomes. In another study (Bialystok et al.,
2005), Spanish and Hebrew bilinguals showed more
advanced performance in learning to read in English than English monolinguals, with the Chinese
bilinguals at an intermediate level between these
groups. These results were interpreted to suggest
both general and specific effects of bilingualism
such that speaking two languages boosts general
knowledge related to print, but this facilitation is
greater when the two languages share the same
writing system.
Taken together, these studies suggest that both
language similarity and language of schooling contribute to performance on linguistic and metalinguistic tasks by bilingual children. For the linguistic
assessments of English receptive vocabulary and
grammatical structure, the Spanish-English bilingual children obtained scores comparable with
monolinguals; French-English children spoke a language with some relation to English and ChineseEnglish children were being educated in English,
but each of these groups lacked one of the essential
experiences that characterized the Spanish-English
bilinguals and consequently obtained lower scores
than the Spanish-English bilingual and monolingual groups. However, the results are different for
the metalinguistic task. Unlike measures of linguis-
tic knowledge, metalinguistic awareness has been
shown to develop earlier in bilingual children. The
present results suggest that the metalinguistic
advantage for bilingual children depends on these
linguistic measures (i.e., receptive vocabulary and
grammatical knowledge). Specifically, the metalinguistic task was solved relatively better by the
French-English and Chinese-English bilinguals than
were the linguistic tasks in that they performed as
well as the monolinguals instead of more poorly.
Yet the Spanish-English bilinguals, whose linguistic
basis was equivalent to monolinguals performed
better than monolinguals on the metalinguistic task.
Thus, all three bilingual groups showed an advantage in the metalinguistic task relative to their performance in the linguistic measures, with the
French and Chinese groups reaching the level of
monolinguals and the Spanish group surpassing
them. This pattern provides support for the idea
that the nature of that advantage depended on the
relation between the languages and their experiences in schooling. It is important to note that the
majority of the literature reporting metalinguistic
advantages in bilingual children has compared
monolingual and bilingual children being educated
in the same language with somewhat equivalent
linguistic ability in that language, as was the case
for the Spanish bilinguals.
The present study provides evidence for the
distinction between the linguistic and cognitive
outcomes of bilingualism. The results endorse the
conclusion that bilingualism itself is responsible
for the increased levels of executive control previously reported. Bilingual children were better able
than monolinguals to maintain a task set across a
mixed block, an advantage found equally in all
three bilingual groups. In contrast, performance
on the linguistic tasks varied with educational
experience and similarity between the two languages. Although cultural background and language similarity are correlated for the Chinese
group, their effects are separable. The ChineseEnglish bilinguals were only different from the
other bilinguals on the language measures, and
since it is hard to imagine how cultural influences
would be responsible, we attribute those effects to
degree of language similarity. In contrast, there
were no differences among any of the bilingual
groups on the nonverbal measure, ruling out both
language similarity and cultural background as
contributors to that performance. These results
refine our understanding of how experience in
general, and bilingualism in particular, shape
development.

There were two practice trials before the administration of the test items. Testing, scoring, and standardization followed the standard procedure described in the manual. The Wugs test. This test assesses children’s ability to apply morphological rules of English (Berko, 1958) to unfamiliar forms, thereby reflecting children’s metalinguistic awareness. Children were shown 27 pictures illustrating novel objects, animals, plants, and actions. The experimenter pointed to each picture and read the associated text. Thirty of the 33 texts introduced a target nonsense word (e.g., wug, kazh, gutch, etc.) and the remaining three included English target words (glass, melt, ring).

These outcomes, however, are different. Linguistic tasks are often performed more poorly by bilingual children than monolinguals, especially assessments of vocabulary (Bialystok, Luk, Peets, &amp; Yang, 2010; Oller, Pearson, &amp; Cobo-Lewis, 2007), although tests of metalinguistic awareness are generally performed better by bilingual children (Bialystok, 1986; Cromdal, 1999; Ricciardelli, 1992). In contrast, many tests of executive control are performed better by bilinguals (Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok, Barac, Blaye, &amp; PoulinDubois, 2010; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004; Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009; Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Mezzacappa, 2004; Yang, Shih, &amp; Lust, 2005) although there is no effect for tasks based on withholding a response even though that too is part of executive control (Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Martin-Rhee &amp; Bialystok, 2008). Understanding these effects is complicated by the fact that bilingualism is often correlated with variables that may themselves influence performance. For example, Morton and Harper (2007) This research was supported by Grant R01HD052523 from th</context>

Moreover, previous research has demonstrated bilingual advantages in inhibition using such tasks as the flanker ANT task (Mezzacappa, 2004; Yang et al., 2005) and dimensional change card sort task (Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004), but other executive control components, particularly switching and flexibility, have been less studied. There are two possibilities for the effect of language similarity on executive control. The first is that languages that are more similar require more control to discriminate and therefore lead to more enhanced control mechanisms. Conversely, it may be that languages that are more distant require more switching and monitoring and that may be the source of greater enhancement.

There is no doubt that socioeconomic status (SES) is a powerful influence on executive control, but it does not undermine the body of literature for which bilingual advantages have been recorded (Bialystok, 2009). Similarly, claims for cultural effects favoring Asian children on tests of executive control (e.g., Sabbagh, Xu, Carlson, Moses, &amp; Lee, 2006) must be separated from the role of bilingualism in shaping this performance.

The same is not true for early reading: In a study comparing Spanish-English, Hebrew-English, and Chinese-English bilingual children on a decoding task in both languages, better performance than monolinguals was found for the Spanish and Hebrew groups, with no advantage for the ChineseEnglish group (Bialystok, Luk, &amp; Kwan, 2005). In these cases, the relation between the languages contributed to performance, and in contrast to the study of phonological awareness, there was no correlation in decoding ability across English and Chinese, languages with different writing systems, but strong cross-language correlations with English for both Spanish and Hebrew, languages with more similar writing systems. Therefore, the relation between languages has different effects on the development of basic metalinguistic and literacy concepts.

Thus, executive control outcomes for bilingual children are general but performance on verbal tasks is specific to factors in the bilingual experience. It is not surprising that the linguistic development of bilingual children is different from that of their monolingual peers, but increasing evidence shows that nonverbal cognitive development is also affected by bilingualism. These outcomes, however, are different. Linguistic tasks are often performed more poorly by bilingual children than monolinguals, especially assessments of vocabulary (Bialystok, Luk, Peets, &amp; Yang, 2010; Oller, Pearson, &amp; Cobo-Lewis, 2007), although tests of metalinguistic awareness are generally performed better by bilingual children (Bialystok, 1986; Cromdal, 1999; Ricciardelli, 1992).

Together, these results support the generality of the bilingual effects over the influence of immigration and culture on nonverbal tests of executive control. Unlike cognitive outcomes, different groups of bilinguals do not perform comparably on linguistic tasks. Spanish-English bilinguals outperformed both monolinguals and Chinese-English bilinguals on a test of English phonological awareness, presumably because of the degree of similarity between the languages (Bialystok, Majumder, &amp; Martin, 2003). Spanish orthography is transparent in that it is based on consistent letter–sound mappings, and this factor might also contribute to the enhanced performance of Spanish-English bilinguals on phonological awareness tasks. In addition, phonological awareness appears to transfer easily across languages. Cross-language correlations in performance on phonological awareness tasks have been reported for English-Spanish bilinguals (Lindsey, Manis, &amp; Bailey, 2003), English-French bilinguals (Comeau, Cormier, Grandmaison, &amp; Lacroix, 1999), and English-Cantonese bilinguals (Luk &amp; Bialystok, 2008) indi</context>

In the present study, we compared homogenous groups of bilingual children and manipulated the similarity between the two languages.

There are two possibilities for the effect of language similarity on executive control. The first is that languages that are more similar require more control to discriminate and therefore lead to more enhanced control mechanisms. Conversely, it may be that languages that are more distant require more switching and monitoring and that may be the source of greater enhancement.

The present study addresses these issues by examining three groups of bilingual children and one group of monolinguals performing verbal and nonverbal tasks. The bilingual children differ in terms of similarity between English and their other language, cultural background, and educational experience. It is not possible to achieve a parametric manipulation of these variables, so our approach is to compare specific groups to address each of these factors. Two previous studies have examined the role of culture and immigration history on the cognitive outcomes of bilingualism. Bialystok and Viswanathan (2009) compared three groups of 8-year-old children on an executive control task. Children were matched on educational experience and social class and were English-speaking monolinguals in Canada, bilinguals in Canada (mixed cultural backgrounds, immigrants), or bilinguals in India Ó 2012 The Authors Child Development Ó 2012 Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

All testing was conducted in English, so the language of schooling might independently impact performance. Because cultural background and language similarity are correlated, only tentative conclusions about these factors will be offered, a point to which we return in the Discussion. Previous research has demonstrated that differences in executive control for bilingual children are not influenced by immigration history (Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009) or culture variables (Bialystok, Barac, et al. 2010), but the role of these factors on language performance has been less explored. Therefore, the verbal tasks in the present study covered three aspects of language proficiency: receptive vocabulary, grammatical ability, and metalinguistic knowledge.

Six-yearold monolingual and bilingual children with equivalent psychomotor speed, general cognitive level, and SES performed language tasks measuring vocabulary, grammar, and metalinguistic knowledge, and a nonverbal executive control task assessing task switching. The three bilingual groups differed on several factors yet demonstrated similar performance in task switching, exceeding that of their monolingual peers. Consistent with other research (e.g., Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009), bilingual children showed smaller global switch costs than monolingual children. These results offer strong support for the claim that bilingualism acts independently of variables such as language similarity, cultural background, and language of schooling in influencing nonverbal outcomes. In previous studies, East Asian preschoolers showed an advantage over children from non-Asian cultures on both conflict inhibition measures (e.g., day ⁄ night task, Luria’s hand game task) and delay inhibition measures (e.g., gift delay; e.g., Oh &amp; Lewis, 2008; Sabbagh et al., 2006).

The language factor reflects the possibility that the effect of bilingualism depends on the relation between the two languages. Previous studies have used either heterogeneous samples (i.e., children speaking a variety of language pairs; Bialystok &amp; Senman, 2004; Bialystok &amp; Shapero, 2005) or homogeneous samples (i.e., all children spoke the same two languages but with different languages across studies; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004, Study 2; Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Cromdal, 1999; Martin-Rhee &amp; Bialystok, 2008, Study 1; Ricciardelli, 1992). Therefore, it is not clear whether the specific language or the relation between the two languages mediates the results. In the present study, we compared homogenous groups of bilingual children and manipulated the similarity between the two languages.

In previous studies, East Asian preschoolers showed an advantage over children from non-Asian cultures on both conflict inhibition measures (e.g., day ⁄ night task, Luria’s hand game task) and delay inhibition measures (e.g., gift delay; e.g., Oh &amp; Lewis, 2008; Sabbagh et al., 2006). However, research with bilinguals only shows advantages on conflict tasks with no advantage on delay tasks (e.g., Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008).

Spanish orthography is transparent in that it is based on consistent letter–sound mappings, and this factor might also contribute to the enhanced performance of Spanish-English bilinguals on phonological awareness tasks. In addition, phonological awareness appears to transfer easily across languages. Cross-language correlations in performance on phonological awareness tasks have been reported for English-Spanish bilinguals (Lindsey, Manis, &amp; Bailey, 2003), English-French bilinguals (Comeau, Cormier, Grandmaison, &amp; Lacroix, 1999), and English-Cantonese bilinguals (Luk &amp; Bialystok, 2008) indicating a common basis for this ability across languages irrespective of its rate of development. The same is not true for early reading: In a study comparing Spanish-English, Hebrew-English, and Chinese-English bilingual children on a decoding task in both languages, better performance than monolinguals was found for the Spanish and Hebrew groups, with no advantage for the ChineseEnglish group (Bialystok, Luk, &amp; Kwan, 2005).

It is not surprising that the linguistic development of bilingual children is different from that of their monolingual peers, but increasing evidence shows that nonverbal cognitive development is also affected by bilingualism. These outcomes, however, are different. Linguistic tasks are often performed more poorly by bilingual children than monolinguals, especially assessments of vocabulary (Bialystok, Luk, Peets, &amp; Yang, 2010; Oller, Pearson, &amp; Cobo-Lewis, 2007), although tests of metalinguistic awareness are generally performed better by bilingual children (Bialystok, 1986; Cromdal, 1999; Ricciardelli, 1992). In contrast, many tests of executive control are performed better by bilinguals (Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok, Barac, Blaye, &amp; PoulinDubois, 2010; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004; Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009; Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Mezzacappa, 2004; Yang, Shih, &amp; Lust, 2005) although there is no effect for tasks based on withholding a response even though that too is part of executive control (Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Martin-Rhee &amp; Bialystok, 2008). Understanding these effects is complicated by the fact that bilingualism is often correlated with variables that may themselve</context>

Lewis and colleagues, for instance, proposed that multiple factors could explain the improved control in Asian children including genetic factors, educational and parental practices, and language characteristics such as frequent use of verbs with young children (Lewis et al., 2009). Parmar, Harkness, and Super (2004) reported evidence that Asian- and Euro-American parents of American preschoolers differed in their beliefs and practices of raising children. Although these studies demonstrate that cultural factors impact aspects of monolingual performance on certain tasks, it is still unclear whether bilingual children of different cultural backgrounds (i.e., Asian, non-Asian) who are raised in the same communities and attend the same schools would show comparable patterns of linguistic and cognitive performance.

Cross-language correlations in performance on phonological awareness tasks have been reported for English-Spanish bilinguals (Lindsey, Manis, &amp; Bailey, 2003), English-French bilinguals (Comeau, Cormier, Grandmaison, &amp; Lacroix, 1999), and English-Cantonese bilinguals (Luk &amp; Bialystok, 2008) indicating a common basis for this ability across languages irrespective of its rate of development. The same is not true for early reading: In a study comparing Spanish-English, Hebrew-English, and Chinese-English bilingual children on a decoding task in both languages, better performance than monolinguals was found for the Spanish and Hebrew groups, with no advantage for the ChineseEnglish group (Bialystok, Luk, &amp; Kwan, 2005).

In terms of writing system, French, Spanish, and English use an alphabetic system (Goswami, Gombert, &amp; de Barrera, 1998), whereas Chinese is a logographic language (Shen &amp; Forster, 1999). Morphologically, Chinese differs from English and other alphabetic languages in the relative number of compound words (i.e., snowman, toothpaste) such that they represent about 75% of all words in the Chinese language but only a very small proportion in the alphabetic languages (Chen, Hao, Geva, Zhu, &amp; Shu, 2009; Liu &amp; McBride-Chang, 2010). Finally, the overall classification of languages places them in different language families: English, French, and Spanish are Indo-European (with French and Spanish being Latin) and Chinese is Sino-Tibetan (Comrie, 1987). Thus, by contrasting French and Spanish bilinguals to Chinese bilinguals it is possible to understand how the similarity between languages affects the 415 linguistic and nonlinguistic outcomes of bilingualism. The comparison between Chinese-English bilingual children and the other two bilingual groups allowed for the examination of the role of culture in the performance of </context>

Moreover, previous research has demonstrated bilingual advantages in inhibition using such tasks as the flanker ANT task (Mezzacappa, 2004; Yang et al., 2005) and dimensional change card sort task (Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004), but other executive control components, particularly switching and flexibility, have been less studied. There are two possibilities for the effect of language similarity on executive control. The first is that languages that are more similar require more control to discriminate and therefore lead to more enhanced control mechanisms. Conversely, it may be that languages that are more distant require more switching and monitoring and that may be the source of greater enhancement. Our hypothesi</context>

There is no doubt that socioeconomic status (SES) is a powerful influence on executive control, but it does not undermine the body of literature for which bilingual advantages have been recorded (Bialystok, 2009). Similarly, claims for cultural effects favoring Asian children on tests of executive control (e.g., Sabbagh, Xu, Carlson, Moses, &amp; Lee, 2006) must be separated from the role of bilingualism in shaping this performance. The present study addresses these issues by examining three groups of bilingual children and one group of monolinguals performing verbal and nonverbal tasks. The bilingual children differ in terms of similarity between English and their other language, cultural background, and educational experience. It is not possible to achieve a parametric manipulation of these variables, so our approach is to compare specific groups to address each of these factors.

In the first part of the test the child saw one target drawing at the centre of the page and five additional drawings below it and was asked to identify one of the five stimuli matching the target image. For the other two sections the child saw an incomplete display of 2 · 2 or 3 · 3 visual stimuli with one stimulus missing, and five stimuli below the display. The task was to choose the stimulus to complete the displayed pattern. The testing, scoring and standardization followed the standard procedure described in the manual. Box completion. This task is a measure of psychomotor speed (Salthouse, 1996). The child was presented with a letter-sized sheet of paper containing an array of 35 three-sided squares arranged in five columns and seven rows. The squares were identical in size (side length of 1.9 cm). The child’s task was to complete the squares by filling in the fourth side as fast as possible using a crayon. Children were shown examples of how to perform the task before testing began. The time to complete the task (in seconds) was recorded from the moment the child started drawing the first line to the moment the last square was finished.

The Formulated Sentences subtest was used to assess children’s ability to construct sentences which are grammatically and semantically intact (Semel, Wiig, &amp; Secord, 2003). For each item, children were presented with a picture and a target word and were asked to create a sentence about the picture that incorporated the target word. There were two practice trials before the administration of the test items. Testing, scoring, and standardization followed the standard procedure described in the manual. The Wugs test.

Related evidence from English monolingual children demonstrated that the development of emerging literacy skills (i.e., awareness of the characteristics of the English writing system) was strongly predicted by the degree to which children engaged in home activities involving reading and writing practice (Levy, Gong, Hessels, Evans, &amp; Jared, 2006). However, research rarely controls for which language is used in school even though vocabulary size is a predictor of children’s performance on tests of academic achievement such as spelling, reading, and arithmetic (Smith, Smith, &amp; Dobbs, 1991) and is positively related to executive control in preschoolers (Carlson &amp; Moses, 2001). No studies to date have compared bilingual groups who are instructed in different languages to assess the effects on language and cognitive functions. We compared bilingual children whose two languages were English plus one of Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese), French, or Spanish, with a group of English-speaking monolingual children.

Linguistic tasks are often performed more poorly by bilingual children than monolinguals, especially assessments of vocabulary (Bialystok, Luk, Peets, &amp; Yang, 2010; Oller, Pearson, &amp; Cobo-Lewis, 2007), although tests of metalinguistic awareness are generally performed better by bilingual children (Bialystok, 1986; Cromdal, 1999; Ricciardelli, 1992). In contrast, many tests of executive control are performed better by bilinguals (Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok, Barac, Blaye, &amp; PoulinDubois, 2010; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004; Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009; Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Mezzacappa, 2004; Yang, Shih, &amp; Lust, 2005) although there is no effect for tasks based on withholding a response even though that too is part of executive control (Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Martin-Rhee &amp; Bialystok, 2008). Understanding these effects is complicated by the fact that bilingualism is often correlated with variables that may themselves influence performance. For example, Morton and Harper (2007) This research was supported by Grant R01HD052523 from the U.S. National Institutes of Health to Ellen Bialystok. The colorshape task switching was programmed by Dr. Nicholas Cepeda at York University, Canada. Correspondence concer</context>

Moreover, previous research has demonstrated bilingual advantages in inhibition using such tasks as the flanker ANT task (Mezzacappa, 2004; Yang et al., 2005) and dimensional change card sort task (Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004), but other executive control components, particularly switching and flexibility, have been less studied. There are two possibilities for the effect of language similarity on executive control. The first is that languages that are more similar require more control to discriminate and therefore lead to more enhanced control mechanisms. Conversely, it may be that languages that are more distant require more switching and monitoring and that may be the source of greater enhancement. Our hypothesis 416 Barac and Bial</context>
