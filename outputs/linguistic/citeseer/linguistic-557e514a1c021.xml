			<abstract>
				<p>A total of 104 six-year-old children belonging to 4 groups (English monolinguals, Chinese-English bilinguals, French-English bilinguals, Spanish-English bilinguals) were compared on 3 verbal tasks and 1 nonverbal executive control task to examine the generality of the bilingual effects on development. Bilingual groups differed in degree of similarity between languages, cultural background, and language of schooling. On the executive control task, all bilingual groups performed similarly and exceeded monolinguals; on the language tasks the best performance was achieved by bilingual children whose language of instruction was the same as the language of testing and whose languages had more overlap. Thus, executive control outcomes for bilingual children are general but performance on verbal tasks is specific to factors in the bilingual experience.</p>

For each item, children were presented with a picture and a target word and were asked to create a sentence about the picture that incorporated the target word. There were two practice trials before the administration of the test items. Testing, scoring, and standardization followed the standard procedure described in the manual. The Wugs test. This test assesses children’s ability to apply morphological rules of English (Berko, 1958) to unfamiliar forms, thereby reflecting children’s metalinguistic awareness. Children were shown 27 pictures illustrating novel objects, animals, plants, and actions. The experimenter pointed to each picture and read the associated text. Thirty of the 33 texts introduced a target nonsense word (e.g., wug, kazh, gutch, etc.) and the remaining three included English target words (glass, melt, ring). Children needed to complete the sentence using the target word by applying English morphology to the new words.

Understanding these effects is complicated by the fact that bilingualism is often correlated with variables that may themselves influence performance. For example, Morton and Harper (2007) claimed that the reported bilingual advantage was due to socioeconomic differences between bilingual and monolingual children. There is no doubt that socioeconomic status (SES) is a powerful influence on executive control, but it does not undermine the body of literature for which bilingual advantages have been recorded (Bialystok, 2009). Similarly, claims for cultural effects favoring Asian children on tests of executive control (e.g., Sabbagh, Xu, Carlson, Moses, &amp; Lee, 2006) must be separated from the role of bilingualism in shaping this performance. The present study addresses these issues by examining three groups of bilingual children and one group of monolinguals performing verbal and nonverbal tasks. The bilingual children differ in terms of similarity between English and their other language, cultural background, and educational experience. It is not possible to achieve a parametric manipulation of these variables, s</context>

Therefore, the verbal tasks in the present study covered three aspects of language proficiency: receptive vocabulary, grammatical ability, and metalinguistic knowledge. The nonverbal task was a task-switching paradigm. This task was chosen because it (a) involves processes similar to those children use to switch attention between languages; (b) distinguishes between global and local switch costs, each of which indexes different cognitive processes with different developmental trajectories; and (c) has been used with children (Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009) and adults (Bialystok, Craik, &amp; Ryan, 2006; Costa, Hernandez, &amp; Sebastian-Galles, 2008) to show bilingual advantages in global but not local costs.

The same is not true for early reading: In a study comparing Spanish-English, Hebrew-English, and Chinese-English bilingual children on a decoding task in both languages, better performance than monolinguals was found for the Spanish and Hebrew groups, with no advantage for the ChineseEnglish group (Bialystok, Luk, &amp; Kwan, 2005). In these cases, the relation between the languages contributed to performance, and in contrast to the study of phonological awareness, there was no correlation in decoding ability across English and Chinese, languages with different writing systems, but strong cross-language correlations with English for both Spanish and Hebrew, languages with more similar writing systems. Therefore, the relation between languages has different effects on the development of basic metalinguistic and literacy concepts.

Together, these results support the generality of the bilingual effects over the influence of immigration and culture on nonverbal tests of executive control. Unlike cognitive outcomes, different groups of bilinguals do not perform comparably on linguistic tasks. Spanish-English bilinguals outperformed both monolinguals and Chinese-English bilinguals on a test of English phonological awareness, presumably because of the degree of similarity between the languages (Bialystok, Majumder, &amp; Martin, 2003). Spanish orthography is transparent in that it is based on consistent letter–sound mappings, and this factor might also contribute to the enhanced performance of Spanish-English bilinguals on phonological awareness tasks. In addition, phonological awareness appears to transfer easily across languages. Cross-language correlations in performance on phonological awareness tasks have been reported for English-Spanish bilinguals (Lindsey, Manis, &amp; Bailey, 2003), English-French bilinguals (Comeau, Cormier, Grandmaison, &amp; Lacroix, 1999), and English-Cantonese bilinguals (Luk &amp; Bialystok, 2008) indi</context>

In the present study, we examine the effects of specific language pairs, cultural background, and educational experience on verbal and nonverbal performance. The language factor reflects the possibility that the effect of bilingualism depends on the relation between the two languages. Previous studies have used either heterogeneous samples (i.e., children speaking a variety of language pairs; Bialystok &amp; Senman, 2004; Bialystok &amp; Shapero, 2005) or homogeneous samples (i.e., all children spoke the same two languages but with different languages across studies; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004, Study 2; Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Cromdal, 1999; Martin-Rhee &amp; Bialystok, 2008, Study 1; Ricciardelli, 1992). Therefore, it is not clear whether the specific language or the relation between the two languages mediates the results. In the present study, we compared homogenous groups of bilingual children and manipulated the similarity between the two languages. Regarding culture, recent research has suggested that Chinese and Korean monolingual children show more advanced executive function performance than English monolingual children in North American and United Kingdom (e.g., Oh &amp; Lewis, </context>

The present study addresses these issues by examining three groups of bilingual children and one group of monolinguals performing verbal and nonverbal tasks. The bilingual children differ in terms of similarity between English and their other language, cultural background, and educational experience. It is not possible to achieve a parametric manipulation of these variables, so our approach is to compare specific groups to address each of these factors. Two previous studies have examined the role of culture and immigration history on the cognitive outcomes of bilingualism. Bialystok and Viswanathan (2009) compared three groups of 8-year-old children on an executive control task. Children were matched on educational experience and social class and were English-speaking monolinguals in Canada, bilinguals in Canada (mixed cultural backgrounds, immigrants), or bilinguals in India This research was supported by Grant R01HD052523 from the U.S. National Institutes of Health to Ellen Bialystok. The colorshape task switching was programmed by Dr. Nicholas Cepeda at York University, Canada.

Linguistic tasks are often performed more poorly by bilingual children than monolinguals, especially assessments of vocabulary (Bialystok, Luk, Peets, &amp; Yang, 2010; Oller, Pearson, &amp; Cobo-Lewis, 2007), although tests of metalinguistic awareness are generally performed better by bilingual children (Bialystok, 1986; Cromdal, 1999; Ricciardelli, 1992). In contrast, many tests of executive control are performed better by bilinguals (Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok, Barac, Blaye, &amp; PoulinDubois, 2010; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004; Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009; Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Mezzacappa, 2004; Yang, Shih, &amp; Lust, 2005) although there is no effect for tasks based on withholding a response even though that too is part of executive control (Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Martin-Rhee &amp; Bialystok, 2008). Understanding these effects is complicated by the fact that bilingualism is often correlated with variables that may themselves influence performance. For example, Morton and Harper (2007) claimed that the reported bilingual advantage was due to socioeconomic differences between bilingual and monolingual children. There is no doubt that socioecono</context>

All testing was conducted in English, so the language of schooling might independently impact performance. Because cultural background and language similarity are correlated, only tentative conclusions about these factors will be offered, a point to which we return in the Discussion. Previous research has demonstrated that differences in executive control for bilingual children are not influenced by immigration history (Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009) or culture variables (Bialystok, Barac, et al. 2010), but the role of these factors on language performance has been less explored. Therefore, the verbal tasks in the present study covered three aspects of language proficiency: receptive vocabulary, grammatical ability, and metalinguistic knowledge. The nonverbal task was a task-switching paradigm. This task was chosen because it (a) involves processes similar to those children use to switch attention between languages; (b) distinguishes between global and local switch costs, each of which indexes different cognitive processes with different </context>

Six-yearold monolingual and bilingual children with equivalent psychomotor speed, general cognitive level, and SES performed language tasks measuring vocabulary, grammar, and metalinguistic knowledge, and a nonverbal executive control task assessing task switching. The three bilingual groups differed on several factors yet demonstrated similar performance in task switching, exceeding that of their monolingual peers. Consistent with other research (e.g., Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009), bilingual children showed smaller global switch costs than monolingual children. These results offer strong support for the claim that bilingualism acts independently of variables such as language similarity, cultural background, and language of schooling in influencing nonverbal outcomes. In previous studies, East Asian preschoolers showed an advantage over children from non-Asian cultures on both conflict inhibition measures (e.g., day ⁄night task, Luria’s hand game task) and delay inhibition measures (e.g., gift delay; e.g., Oh &amp; Lewis, 2008; Sabbagh et al., 2006).

Taken together with other results (Bialystok, Barac, et al., 2010; Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009), these findings demonstrate the generality of the bilingual advantage in executive functioning. In contrast to nonverbal performance, scores on the verbal tasks were mediated by language similarity and language of schooling. The Spanish bilingual children outperformed the French bilingual children on all three measures (receptive vocabulary, grammatical knowledge, and metalinguistic awareness) and the Chinese bilinguals on two of them (receptive vocabulary and metalinguistic awareness).

Spanish orthography is transparent in that it is based on consistent letter–sound mappings, and this factor might also contribute to the enhanced performance of Spanish-English bilinguals on phonological awareness tasks. In addition, phonological awareness appears to transfer easily across languages. Cross-language correlations in performance on phonological awareness tasks have been reported for English-Spanish bilinguals (Lindsey, Manis, &amp; Bailey, 2003), English-French bilinguals (Comeau, Cormier, Grandmaison, &amp; Lacroix, 1999), and English-Cantonese bilinguals (Luk &amp; Bialystok, 2008) indicating a common basis for this ability across languages irrespective of its rate of development. The same is not true for early reading: In a study comparing Spanish-English, Hebrew-English, and Chinese-English bilingual children on a decoding task in both languages, better performance than monolinguals was found for the Spanish and Hebrew groups, with no advantage for the ChineseEnglish group (Bialystok, Luk, &amp; Kwan, 2005).

These outcomes, however, are different. Linguistic tasks are often performed more poorly by bilingual children than monolinguals, especially assessments of vocabulary (Bialystok, Luk, Peets, &amp; Yang, 2010; Oller, Pearson, &amp; Cobo-Lewis, 2007), although tests of metalinguistic awareness are generally performed better by bilingual children (Bialystok, 1986; Cromdal, 1999; Ricciardelli, 1992). In contrast, many tests of executive control are performed better by bilinguals (Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok, Barac, Blaye, &amp; PoulinDubois, 2010; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004; Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009; Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Mezzacappa, 2004; Yang, Shih, &amp; Lust, 2005) although there is no effect for tasks based on withholding a response even though that too is part of executive control (Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Martin-Rhee &amp; Bialystok, 2008). Understanding these effects is complicated by the fact that bilingualism is often correlated with variables that may themselve</context>

The language factor reflects the possibility that the effect of bilingualism depends on the relation between the two languages. Previous studies have used either heterogeneous samples (i.e., children speaking a variety of language pairs; Bialystok &amp; Senman, 2004; Bialystok &amp; Shapero, 2005) or homogeneous samples (i.e., all children spoke the same two languages but with different languages across studies; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004, Study 2; Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Cromdal, 1999; Martin-Rhee &amp; Bialystok, 2008, Study 1; Ricciardelli, 1992).

In the present study, we compared homogenous groups of bilingual children and manipulated the similarity between the two languages.

(2010) on English receptive vocabulary showed that words associated with schooling were responded to equally well by monolingual and bilingual children, whereas comprehension of words primarily associated with home was better in monolinguals. Related evidence from English monolingual children demonstrated that the development of emerging literacy skills (i.e., awareness of the characteristics of the English writing system) was strongly predicted by the degree to which children engaged in home activities involving reading and writing practice (Levy, Gong, Hessels, Evans, &amp; Jared, 2006). However, research rarely controls for which language is used in school even though vocabulary size is a predictor of children’s performance on tests of academic achievement such as spelling, reading, and arithmetic (Smith, Smith, &amp; Dobbs, 1991) and is positively related to executive control in preschoolers (Carlson &amp; Moses, 2001).

Lewis and colleagues, for instance, proposed that multiple factors could explain the improved control in Asian children including genetic factors, educational and parental practices, and language characteristics such as frequent use of verbs with young children (Lewis et al., 2009). Parmar, Harkness, and Super (2004) reported evidence that Asian- and Euro-American parents of American preschoolers differed in their beliefs and practices of raising children. Although these studies demonstrate that cultural factors impact aspects of monolingual performance on certain tasks, it is still unclear whether bilingual children of different cultural backgrounds (i.e., Asian, non-Asian) who are raised in the same communities and attend the same schools would show comparable patterns of linguistic and cognitive performance. 414 Barac and Bialystok The language of education may also </context>

There are two possibilities for the effect of language similarity on executive control.

For example, Morton and Harper (2007) claimed that the reported bilingual advantage was due to socioeconomic differences between bilingual and monolingual children. There is no doubt that socioeconomic status (SES) is a powerful influence on executive control, but it does not undermine the body of literature for which bilingual advantages have been recorded (Bialystok, 2009). Similarly, claims for cultural effects favoring Asian children on tests of executive control (e.g., Sabbagh, Xu, Carlson, Moses, &amp; Lee, 2006) must be separated from the role of bilingualism in shaping this performance. The present study addresses these issues by examining three groups of bilingual children and one group of monolinguals performing verbal and nonverbal tasks. The bilingual children differ in terms of similarity between English and their other language, cultural background, and educational experience. It is not possible to achieve a parametric manipulation of these variables, so our approach is to compare specific groups to address each of these factors.

The child was presented with a letter-sized sheet of paper containing an array of 35 three-sided squares arranged in five columns and seven rows. The squares were identical in size (side length of 1.9 cm). The child’s task was to complete the squares by filling in the fourth side as fast as possible using a crayon. Children were shown examples of how to perform the task before testing began. The time to complete the task (in seconds) was recorded from the moment the child started drawing the first line to the moment the last square was finished.

However, research rarely controls for which language is used in school even though vocabulary size is a predictor of children’s performance on tests of academic achievement such as spelling, reading, and arithmetic (Smith, Smith, &amp; Dobbs, 1991) and is positively related to executive control in preschoolers (Carlson &amp; Moses, 2001).

Moreover, previous research has demonstrated bilingual advantages in inhibition using such tasks as the flanker ANT task (Mezzacappa, 2004; Yang et al., 2005) and dimensional change card sort task (Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004), but other executive control components, particularly switching and flexibility, have been less studied. There are two possibilities for the effect of language similarity on executive control. The first is that languages that are more similar require more control to discriminate and therefore lead to more enhanced control mechanisms. Conversely, it may be that languages that are more distant require more switching and monitoring and that may be the source of greater enhancement. Our hypothesis Language, Culture,</context>
