			<abstract>
				<p>When participating in talk, speakers constantly display assumptions about matters that they talk about. These assumptions are not always correct and may be adjusted by other participants who present themselves as having more information or more authority on the matter. In interaction, different human experiences and perspectives are brought together, expressed in the temporally constrained turns within sequences of action. Implicit and explicit knowledge is displayed in speaker turns and it is also contested on the turn-by-turn basis. All of this is enabled by grammars that allow speakers to express various degrees of knowledge and may have developed special formats for carrying out different kinds of social action. Many grammatical formats for expressing knowledge states and sources have already been thoroughly described in the literature on language. Evidential devices are used for showing the type of access the speaker has to the information, epistemic markers indicate the degree of speaker certainty. In addition, some grammatical devices are adapted to the task of conveying more subtle assumptions about the matter at hand. For example, a question in a specific form (positive/negative, with a tag or not) is heard as conducive of a certain kind of answer, thereby displaying speaker assumptions on what the answer will be (Sadock and Zwicky, 1985; Kö nig and Siemund, 2007). Thus, even though the authority to answer is rendered to the recipient of the question, the asker may indicate the degree of her own epistemic certainty. These assumptions and allusions need not be explicit but occasionally their existence can be proven by the subsequent behavior of other participants. Speakers can explicitly formulate an understanding of what the recipient of the allusive formulation conveyed A B S T R A C T The article shows how a bound morpheme, the enclitic-gi/-ki in Estonian, functions in the domain of interpersonal relations and mutual knowledge calibration in conversation. Speakers use the enclitic with verbs in order to adjust some assumption previously held by themselves or by their interlocutors. When formulating contributions in talk, participants always display assumptions about matters at hand as well as about what they believe other participants know. Furthermore, when accomplishing a first action in a sequence, they display an assumption that the next speaker will align in her action. All these assumptions are subject to adjustment by other participants who may present themselves as more knowledgeable on the subject matter or more entitled to provide opinions about it. The enclitic is used in reactive turns to indicate better epistemic access and higher authority in relation to a prior speaker, which may result in a disaligning action.</p>

Instead, the pragmatic effect it achieves depends on which type of word it is attached to (Metslang, 2002). Therefore, it is important to study its functions separately in different word classes, and the current paper only looks at verbs. At the same time, the scope of -gi/-ki has been claimed to be the whole sentence, not a single word or phrase (Tauli, 1980:212–215; Erelt et al., 1995:100). The present study shows that its area of operation is even wider than the sentence, namely, conversational sequence. The theoretical aim of the paper is to demonstrate how a bound grammatical element functions across speakers and turns, dealing with the emergent status of knowledge and rights to knowledge.

The telephone call corpus consists of 324 calls of two types: telemarketing calls from a daily newspaper and everyday calls between family members, relatives, friends, and colleagues.

It is a device for the speaker of a subsequent turn tomake salient an epistemic gap between the current and a prior contribution and contestwhat was assumed there. Occasionally, this implies that the just-prior action is not responded to in the way the response was projected, resulting in a disaligning turn. Access to knowledge and authority to express the knowledge are closely intertwined with opportunities of alignment and affiliation in social interaction (as discussed across many contributions in the recent volume by Stivers et al. (2011a)). The current paper focuses on the Estonian enclitic in a specific sequential position: when it is used in turns that are reactive to something that has just happened, either in the conversation or in the context of talk. This position constitutes a subsection of the overall usage of the enclitic, supposedly representing its most dialogic facet. A clitic is a grammatically independent and phonologically dependent morpheme. A proclitic attaches before the word and an enclitic after it. An enclitic can only appear with a host, which in the case of gi/-ki is basically any word, including nouns</context>

This illustrates, among other things, how knowledge emerges in discourse across time and is negotiated among the participants. As a supplement to earlier studies on evidentiality that look at how speakers code their level of certainty of knowledge or its source (Chafe and Nichols, 1986; Fox, 2001; Karkkainen, 2003), the current section demonstrates how a grammatical device figures in interpersonal negotiations on access to knowledge and authority. Conversation analytic research in particular has been interested in how speakers manage presuppositions of epistemic access (Stivers et al., 2011b:10), epistemic stance (Karkkainen, 2003; Wu, 2004) and epistemic primacy. The latter is defined as ‘‘asymmetries in the depth, specificity or completeness’’ of participants’ knowledge (Stivers et al., 2011b:13). Speakers may have differential access to a subject, and their access may be of varying depth and specificity, which implies that they also enjoy a different degree of authority in regard to the matter. The section first shows how a participant may subtly challenge the assumptions displayed in a prior turn and display her superior epistemic access to the subject at hand. Second, a p</context>

The enclitic -gi/-ki is therefore an item whose full description in grammar needs to incorporate social matters, such as distribution of knowledge among the participants, and their relative authority to make statements on the topic at hand. The enclitic basically states ‘‘I know better than you/before and I am the one entitled to know’’. Thus, it deals with the issue of access and authority to knowledge (Stivers et al., 2011a), not simply epistemic certainty. The speaker is not in the first hand characterizing her own stance towards the piece of information being provided, but her supremacy in relation to the prior speaker or her own prior self. The enclitic marks that the speaker herself used to know/assume falsely or that the conversation partner knew/assumed falsely, occasionally by claiming knowledge that does not in the first hand belong to him. The enclitic enables accomplishment of a correction without explicitly telling the other person that he is wrong, thus being amore subtle social device. The adjustme</context>

It is a device for the speaker of a subsequent turn tomake salient an epistemic gap between the current and a prior contribution and contestwhat was assumed there. Occasionally, this implies that the just-prior action is not responded to in the way the response was projected, resulting in a disaligning turn. Access to knowledge and authority to express the knowledge are closely intertwined with opportunities of alignment and affiliation in social interaction (as discussed across many contributions in the recent volume by Stivers et al. (2011a)). The current paper focuses on the Estonian enclitic in a specific sequential position: when it is used in turns that are reactive to something that has just happened, either in the conversation or in the context of talk. This position constitutes a subsection of the overall usage of the enclitic, supposedly representing its most dialogic facet. A clitic is a grammatically independent and phonologically dependent morpheme. A proclitic attaches before the word and an enclitic after it. An enclitic can only appear with a host, which in the case of gi/-ki is basically any word, including nouns</context>

This illustrates, among other things, how knowledge emerges in discourse across time and is negotiated among the participants. As a supplement to earlier studies on evidentiality that look at how speakers code their level of certainty of knowledge or its source (Chafe and Nichols, 1986; Fox, 2001; Karkkainen, 2003), the current section demonstrates how a grammatical device figures in interpersonal negotiations on access to knowledge and authority. Conversation analytic research in particular has been interested in how speakers manage presuppositions of epistemic access (Stivers et al., 2011b:10), epistemic stance (Karkkainen, 2003; Wu, 2004) and epistemic primacy. The latter is defined as ‘‘asymmetries in the depth, specificity or completeness’’ of participants’ knowledge (Stivers et al., 2011b:13). Speakers may have differential access to a subject, and their access may be of varying depth and specificity, which implies that they also enjoy a different degree of authority in regard to the matter. The section first shows how a participant may subtly challenge the assumptions displayed in a prior turn and display her superior epistemic access to the subject at hand. Second, a p</context>

The enclitic -gi/-ki is therefore an item whose full description in grammar needs to incorporate social matters, such as distribution of knowledge among the participants, and their relative authority to make statements on the topic at hand. The enclitic basically states ‘‘I know better than you/before and I am the one entitled to know’’. Thus, it deals with the issue of access and authority to knowledge (Stivers et al., 2011a), not simply epistemic certainty. The speaker is not in the first hand characterizing her own stance towards the piece of information being provided, but her supremacy in relation to the prior speaker or her own prior self. The enclitic marks that the speaker herself used to know/assume falsely or that the conversation partner knew/assumed falsely, occasionally by claiming knowledge that does not in the first hand belong to him. The enclitic enables accomplishment of a correction without explicitly telling the other person that he is wrong, thus being amore subtle social device. The adjustme</context>

The enclitic is pronounced as a fortis (k) after voiceless sounds and as a lenis (g) after voiced ones, which shows its phonological dependence. Examples of its application are thus: oleks ‘would be’ &amp;gt; olekski oleme ‘we are’ &amp;gt; olemegi The grammatical status of -gi/-ki is still being discussed. It has been characterized as an affixal particle (Tauli, 1972:93) but in the last comprehensive grammar it is interchangeably called an affix, a modal adverb, and a particle (Erelt et al., 1993:39, 1995:159,164). Its functions have been said to range from focusing to simple connecting, tomarking of concessivity and surprise (Tauli, 1980:213–215; Erelt et al., 1995). In Finnish grammar, which is a close genealogical relative of Estonian, the corresponding item -kin (-kaan/kaan in the negative) has been characterized as expressing speaker expectations, showing that her expectationswere confirmed or contradicted (Hakulinen et al., 2004:807). It has also </context>

The present study shows that its area of operation is even wider than the sentence, namely, conversational sequence. The theoretical aim of the paper is to demonstrate how a bound grammatical element functions across speakers and turns, dealing with the emergent status of knowledge and rights to knowledge. Pragmatic particles have been shown to function like that. For example, in Mandarin Chinese the final particles ou and a point out a gap between participants’ knowledge and display expectations about thematter at hand (Wu, 2004). In order to explain the role of the enclitic -gi/-ki, it needs to be similarly scrutinized in relation to prior talk and, crucially, with regard to what the prior speaker has conveyed about his/her knowledge state and underlying assumptions. The present paper aims to show that in interactional data the contradicting or following of expectations can be empirically traced. One speaker says something that reveals her underlying assumptions, which are explicitly refuted by the next speaker with the help of the enclitic. The function of the enclitic can be elucidated by taking into account what h</context>
