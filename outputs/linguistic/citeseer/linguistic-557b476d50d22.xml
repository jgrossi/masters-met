			<abstract>
				<p>The present study was designed to investigate the ways in which notions of semantics and phonology are acquired by adult na¨ıve learners of American Sign Language (ASL) when they are first exposed to a set of simple signs. First, a set of ASL signs was tested for nontransparency and a set of signs was selected for subsequent use. Next, a set of semantically related English words and a set of phonologically related English words were generated and paired with each of the signs selected earlier. In the experiment reported here, participants were taught pairs of sign–English word translations. Subsequently, they were then engaged in a translation recognition task in which foils were semantically related, phonologically related, or completely unrelated to the corresponding translations. Interference in performing the recognition task (i.e., the foil conditions) indicated that participants had encoded various features of the sign– word combinations after a single learning session. Results are discussed with regard to bilingual memory representations as well as to ASL acquisition.</p>

However, it has been suggested that this link increases in strength as the bilingual becomes more proficient or fluent in his or her L2 (a notion derived from the earlier concept mediation model). One advantage of the revised hierarchical model is that it accounts for several findings that have been reported in bilingual studies, such as faster translation in the L2–L1 direction, category interference that occurs only during L1–L2 translation (Kroll &amp; Stewart, 1994), and larger priming effects in the L1–L2 direction than in the L2–L1 direction (e.g., Altarriba, 1992; Gollan, Forster, &amp; Frost, 1997). In addition, the model attempts to show how changes in a person’s proficiency in the L2 will change the way in which lexical and conceptual information is accessed (i.e., greater proficiency in the L2 allows a greater amount of conceptual information to be available). Although this may be true to some extent, it has been argued that new words in an L2 may not be stored in just the lexicon of the L2 but rather represented as both a lexical and conceptual entry if the words were acquired in an environment in which both form and meaning were emphasized (see Alta</context>

The study investigates only receptive skills and the levels of representation acquired early in learning. The study is not about learning ASL itself; rather, it investigates what automatic mental representations or associations are acquired when adults unfamiliar with a visual language first “learn” the verbal translations of some signs. The theoretical models of bilingual memory representation studied by both Kroll and Stewart (1994) and Altarriba and Mathis (1997) are tested in the current study on the memory of novice students of ASL. Inmerging aspects of both the word association model and the concept mediation model of bilingual memory, Kroll and Stewart (1994) proposed a model (i.e., the revised hierarchical model) that describes the asymmetrical links that appear to be present in bilingual language representation as well as a model that accounts for the differences reported in the literature on translation direction (see Figure 3). This model contains mental lexicons for the L1 as well as an L2. The L1 mental lexicon is depicted as larger than tha</context>

Over time, two hypotheses with differing views on the structure and representation of more than one language in memory have been described: a word association model and a concept mediation model (see Figures 1 and 2). The first model predicts that beginning bilinguals access second-language (L2) words via their first-language (L1) lexicon (Kroll &amp; Stewart, 1994). In contrast, the second model predicts that beginning language learners access concepts corresponding to L2 words and thenmediate through the conceptual store to access the L1 translations of the L2 words (as in Altarriba &amp; Mathis, 1997). The word association hypothesis assumes that there is a direct link between the L1 The Modern Language Journal, 95, ii, (2011) DOI: 10.1111/j.1540-4781.2011.01173.x 0026-7902/11/205–216 $1.50/0 C©2011 The Modern Language Journal andL2whereby the novice bilingual associates the new L2 word with known L1 vocabulary.

When they were asked before the experiment, the participants said they had no knowledge of finger spelling or ASL. Additionally, the participants were also asked about their knowledge of ASL at the conclusion of the experiment. This practice of asking participants about their language background both before and after an experiment has been used previously, as it has been found that, on occasion, the act of performing the experiment brings to mind a forgotten memory of their exposure to ASL or other languages (see, e.g., Altarriba &amp; Mathis, 1997). The participants received partial course credit. At the end of the experiment, a brief language history questionnaire was administered to ensure that they were naıve to ASL. Mean self-ratings on a 10-point scale revealed native fluency in English at 9.3. Percent of the day English was spoken was 92.3. Questionnaire results revealed no exposure to, or Margreta von Pein and Jeanette Altarriba 209 knowledge of, ASL or any other signed language (see Appendices A and B). Materials Sign Selection.

Mode or context of learning and acquisition should also be taken into account in further investigations. Thus, participants’ bilingualism may be examined as a variable of interest in future studies of sign acquisition, as this question was not a focus of the current investigation. The present study provided evidence that conceptual and phonological interference occurs in learning the meanings of ASL signs—a finding similar to that reported for the acquisition of words of a second, spoken language (see, e.g., Altarriba &amp; Mathis, 1997; van Hell &amp; Mahn, 1997). Previous ASL research evidence points to the parallel functioning of visual–spatial and oral–aural languages. For example, signs that look different from one another are identified more quickly than those that look similar to one another. This mimics the phonological similarity effect that occurs in spoken languages (see also Emmorey, 2002). In addition, Liddell (1984) illustrated how signs have beginnings, middles, and ends similar to the segments of spoken words, onsets, medial phases, and offsets.

In a related vein, neurological investigations into the hemispheric involvement of imageable concrete signs in ASL, as distinct fromabstract lexical forms, continue to raise questions about the different roles imagery may play in ASL and English (Emmorey &amp; Corina, 1993). Most recently, neurobiological evidence also indicates that both signed and spoken languages are generally localized in the same area in the left hemisphere (Corina, Vaid, &amp; Bellugi, 1992; Damasio &amp; Damasio, 2000; Emmorey et al., 2003; Horwitz et al., 2003). Notwithstanding the linguistic and neurobiological parallels between ASL and the spoken languages of the world, we recognize that the visual modality makes a distinct difference in L2 learning. The current study kept the learning challenge of ASL to a bare minimum (i.e., acquiring the English words for 28 simple signs). Nothing about sign perception was investigated. Clearly, the greater part of understanding how sign-naıve adults learn ASL has to include working memory experiments on what the adult learner processes (i.e</context>

However, it has been suggested that this link increases in strength as the bilingual becomes more proficient or fluent in his or her L2 (a notion derived from the earlier concept mediation model). One advantage of the revised hierarchical model is that it accounts for several findings that have been reported in bilingual studies, such as faster translation in the L2–L1 direction, category interference that occurs only during L1–L2 translation (Kroll &amp; Stewart, 1994), and larger priming effects in the L1–L2 direction than in the L2–L1 direction (e.g., Altarriba, 1992; Gollan, Forster, &amp; Frost, 1997). In addition, the model attempts to show how changes in a person’s proficiency in the L2 will change the way in which lexical and conceptual information is accessed (i.e., greater proficiency in the L2 allows a greater amount of conceptual information to be available). Although this may be true to some extent, it has been argued that new words in an L2 may not be stored in just the lexicon of the L2 but rather represented as both a lexical and conceptual entry if the words were acquired in an environment in which both form and meaning were emphasized (see Altarriba &amp; Mathis, 1997).

Second, the work is aimed at investigating the representation in memory of newly acquired signs under situations that would promote the automaticity of the access of that information. Using an interference paradigm that will be described later, it was possible to determine whether Margreta von Pein and Jeanette Altarriba 207 semantic or phonological information was encoded early in the learning of ASL signs without the possibility of elaborative processes that can be engaged in untimed response tasks. Third, the present work is aimed at testing a hypothesis put forth by Kroll and Stewart (1994) regarding the conceptual or semantic development that occurs when one first learns an L2. More will be said about this final aim in the next section. THE CURRENT STUDY This study investigates a specific part of what adult naıve learners of ASL learn when first exposed to the English equivalents of 28 simple ASL signs.

Further, it is possible that the conceptual aspect of some words may not be stored in a common conceptual store for both languages, simply because there are some items that may represent language-specific 208 The Modern Language Journal 95 (2011) concepts and, therefore, direct translations in the opposing language do not exist (Altarriba, 2000). Altarriba and Mathis (1997) questioned the revised hierarchical model of Kroll and Stewart (1994), which suggests that nonfluent bilinguals rely on lexical association early in SLA and only later on conceptmediation. Asmentioned earlier, Altarriba and Mathis tested Kroll and Stewart’s model with monolingual English speakers who were taught Spanish for the first time. Altarriba and Mathis designed a set of experiments to investigate the acquisition of the link between conceptual memory and the L2, hypothesizing that it could develop as early as the first encounter or first learning session with the new language. Kroll and Stewart had claimed that this link developed over an unspecified len</context>

Both semantic and phonological interference effects were reported within the current study. It can be assumed, then, that the processes involved in acquiring an L2 as described by Altarriba and Mathis also come into play for adult novices learning a visual language as the L2. Moreover, as reported by Altarriba and Mathis, the current work also indicates that the revised hierarchical model proposed by Kroll and Stewart (1994) should be modified to indicate that conceptual/semantic information can be acquired in the earliest stages of L2 learning. In other words, even after a single learning session, individuals can acquire the knowledge of the meaning of newly learned L2 words—a link that had been purported to take more time to develop, as per the revised hierarchical model. In relation to the above issues of acquisition and development, note that all of the participants in the current study had been exposed to an L2 at some point in their lives (either from birth or through schooling in later years; see Appendix </context>

Results are discussed with regard to bilingual memory representations as well as to ASL acquisition. THIS STUDY BUILDS ON THE RESEARCH ON the development of various levels of linguistic representation in bilingual memory. Over time, two hypotheses with differing views on the structure and representation of more than one language in memory have been described: a word association model and a concept mediation model (see Figures 1 and 2). The first model predicts that beginning bilinguals access second-language (L2) words via their first-language (L1) lexicon (Kroll &amp; Stewart, 1994). In contrast, the second model predicts that beginning language learners access concepts corresponding to L2 words and thenmediate through the conceptual store to access the L1 translations of the L2 words (as in Altarriba &amp; Mathis, 1997). The word association hypothesis assumes that there is a direct link between the L1 The Modern Language Journal, 95, ii, (2011) DOI: 10.1111/j.1540-4781.2011.01173.x 0026-7902/11/205–216 $1.50/0 C©2011 The Modern Language Journal andL2whereby the novice bilingual associates the new L2 word with known L1 vocabulary.

This model contains mental lexicons for the L1 as well as an L2. The L1 mental lexicon is depicted as larger than that of the L2 because it is assumed that the bilingual would have FIGURE 3 Revised Hierarchical Model (Adapted from Kroll &amp; Stewart, 1994) L2L1 Concepts Conceptual Level Lexical Level Note.

Another participant during the study said “funny-nose” when seeing CLOWN, which is made by cupping the nose with one hand. Future experiments on systematically including mnemonics in the study phase might offer insight into another method for teaching ASL as an L2. The concept mediationmodel, explained in Altarriba and Mathis’s (1997) experiments and in the current study, supports the practice of teaching SLA using contextual units that emphasize the semantic or conceptual representation of a newly acquired word. Many beginning ASL texts already emphasize contextual learning (see, e.g., Smith et al., 1988). Thus, assuming that the acquisition of words in aural and visual languages is similar, researchers can focus onhow the visualmodality is mentally represented by hearing adults learning a signed language. What is most important to keep in mind is that bilingual research should include oral–aural as well as visual–spatial languages, and as the experiment in this study shows, the concept mediation hypothesis (as well as themodifications of the revised hierarchical model as posed by Altarriba and Mathis) applies to signed as well as to spoken language. 214 The Modern Language Journal 95 (2011) A</context>

Second, the work is aimed at investigating the representation in memory of newly acquired signs under situations that would promote the automaticity of the access of that information. Using an interference paradigm that will be described later, it was possible to determine whether Margreta von Pein and Jeanette Altarriba 207 semantic or phonological information was encoded early in the learning of ASL signs without the possibility of elaborative processes that can be engaged in untimed response tasks. Third, the present work is aimed at testing a hypothesis put forth by Kroll and Stewart (1994) regarding the conceptual or semantic development that occurs when one first learns an L2. More will be said about this final aim in the next section. THE CURRENT STUDY This study investigates a specific part of what adult naıve learners of ASL learn when first exposed to the English equivalents of 28 simple ASL signs. The study investigates only receptive skills and the levels of representation acquired early in learning. The study is not about learning ASL itself; rather, it investigates what automatic mental representations or associations are acquired when adults unfamiliar with a visual </context>

Further, it is possible that the conceptual aspect of some words may not be stored in a common conceptual store for both languages, simply because there are some items that may represent language-specific 208 The Modern Language Journal 95 (2011) concepts and, therefore, direct translations in the opposing language do not exist (Altarriba, 2000). Altarriba and Mathis (1997) questioned the revised hierarchical model of Kroll and Stewart (1994), which suggests that nonfluent bilinguals rely on lexical association early in SLA and only later on conceptmediation. Asmentioned earlier, Altarriba and Mathis tested Kroll and Stewart’s model with monolingual English speakers who were taught Spanish for the first time. Altarriba and Mathis designed a set of experiments to investigate the acquisition of the link between conceptual memory and the L2, hypothesizing that it could develop as early as the first encounter or first learning session with the new language. Kroll and Stewart had claimed that this link developed over an unspecified len</context>

Both semantic and phonological interference effects were reported within the current study. It can be assumed, then, that the processes involved in acquiring an L2 as described by Altarriba and Mathis also come into play for adult novices learning a visual language as the L2. Moreover, as reported by Altarriba and Mathis, the current work also indicates that the revised hierarchical model proposed by Kroll and Stewart (1994) should be modified to indicate that conceptual/semantic information can be acquired in the earliest stages of L2 learning. In other words, even after a single learning session, individuals can acquire the knowledge of the meaning of newly learned L2 words—a link that had been purported to take more time to develop, as per the revised hierarchical model. In relation to the above issues of acquisition and development, note that all of the participants in the current study had been exposed to an L2 at some point in their lives (either from birth or through schooling in later years; see Appendix </context>

The current study kept the learning challenge of ASL to a bare minimum (i.e., acquiring the English words for 28 simple signs). Nothing about sign perception was investigated. Clearly, the greater part of understanding how sign-naıve adults learn ASL has to include working memory experiments on what the adult learner processes (i.e., sees, stores, attends to, recalls, etc.) in the visual modality (see, e.g., Wilson &amp; Emmorey, 2003). Experiments on reproducing ASL signs are recommended, as well as experiments with ASL units longer than primarily single monomorphemic signs. When we analyzed the ways the participants remembered the Englishmeanings during the study phase of the present experiment, another potential area of research became clear. Although the participants studied the English meanings for the signs in the learning part of the experiment, we informally noted evident mnemonics used by two participants, each for a single word. For example, one participant said “father-head” while hearing the word “father” and vi</context>

The first model predicts that beginning bilinguals access second-language (L2) words via their first-language (L1) lexicon (Kroll &amp; Stewart, 1994). In contrast, the second model predicts that beginning language learners access concepts corresponding to L2 words and thenmediate through the conceptual store to access the L1 translations of the L2 words (as in Altarriba &amp; Mathis, 1997). The word association hypothesis assumes that there is a direct link between the L1 The Modern Language Journal, 95, ii, (2011) DOI: 10.1111/j.1540-4781.2011.01173.x 0026-7902/11/205–216 $1.50/0 C©2011 The Modern Language Journal andL2whereby the novice bilingual associates the new L2 word with known L1 vocabulary. Thus, a novice bilingual learns a new word in the L2 by associating it with its L1 translation and then referring to a conceptual store for meaning.

The slower response time indicates that the novice bilinguals associated the new L2 word with the known L1 lexicon in determining the correct choice for the target word. The concept mediation hypothesis assumes that there is no direct link to the L1 lexicon, but translation of L2 occurs by accessing a common semantic store that both L1 and L2 lexicons share.

Although this may be true to some extent, it has been argued that new words in an L2 may not be stored in just the lexicon of the L2 but rather represented as both a lexical and conceptual entry if the words were acquired in an environment in which both form and meaning were emphasized (see Altarriba &amp; Mathis, 1997). Further, it is possible that the conceptual aspect of some words may not be stored in a common conceptual store for both languages, simply because there are some items that may represent language-specific 208 The Modern Language Journal 95 (2011) concepts and, therefore, direct translations in the opposing language do not exist (Altarriba, 2000).

The phonologically related conditionwas constructedof rhyming words (Fergusson, 1985; Webster’s, 1987). Sample stimulus items include the following: Targets: apple, cookie; Unrelated: thigh, paddle; Semantic TABLE 1 Word Length and Frequency Means and Standard Deviation for Four Test Conditions Condition Means SD Length Target 5.08 1.38 Unrelated 5.08 1.38 Semantic 4.71 1.30 Phonological 5.21 1.35 Frequency Target 90.29 117.95 Unrelated 88.75 112.43 Semantic 77.79 81.96 Phonological 83.33 136.50 210 The Modern Language Journal 95 (2011) Foil: pie, sweet; Phonological Foil: chapel, rookie. Thus, the words that corresponded to the target “apple” in each condition included “thigh,” “pie,” and “chapel.” The set can be derived for “cookie” in the same way from the examples provided earlier (see Appendix C for a complete listing of items). The videotape of the 28 common ASL signs created previously was used in the current experiment. Four signs and four English words, each from a different test condition, were isolated for use during the practice phase. The remaining 24 English words for each condition (i.e., the English translati</context>
<context citStr="(2011)" endWordPosition="4843" position="29806" startWordPosition="4843">ms contributed to the large error rate in the phonological condition. In this later condition, most prominent were the items “fair,” “bother,” and “fig,” corresponding to “bear,” “father,” and “pig,” respectively. Clearly, these kinds of errors of substitution stem from the similarity across items in terms of initial phonemes; thus, as in most situations, whenever manner/place of articulation overlaps across lexical items, errors of recognition and identification are more likely to occur. More will be said later in terms of the implications of these kinds of 212 The Modern Language Journal 95 (2011) errors for lexical representation and processing in general. GENERAL DISCUSSION The experiments described here were designed to follow the approach of Altarriba and Mathis’s (1997) experiments in SLA. When Altarriba and Mathis tested English-speakingmonolinguals who had just acquired a set of words in an L2 (Spanish), they found that these participants had encoded both semantic and orthographic aspects of the new words and were able to access this new information when responding to a translation recognition task. Because an interference effect occurred for both conditions, it appeared that mo</context>

Thus, assuming that the acquisition of words in aural and visual languages is similar, researchers can focus onhow the visualmodality is mentally represented by hearing adults learning a signed language. What is most important to keep in mind is that bilingual research should include oral–aural as well as visual–spatial languages, and as the experiment in this study shows, the concept mediation hypothesis (as well as themodifications of the revised hierarchical model as posed by Altarriba and Mathis) applies to signed as well as to spoken language. 214 The Modern Language Journal 95 (2011) ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was completed as part of the requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy degree awarded to the first author.
