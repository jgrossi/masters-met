			<abstract>
				<p>Learners' ability to recognize linguistic contrasts in American Sign Language (ASL) was investigated using a paired-comparison discrimination task. Minimal pairs containing contrasts in five linguistic categories (i.e., the formational parameters of movement, handshape, orientation, and location in ASL phonology, and a category comprised of contrasts in complex morphology) were presented in sentence contexts to a sample of 127 hearing learners at beginning and intermediate levels of proficiency and 10 Deaf native signers. Participants' responses were analyzed to determine the relative difficulty of the linguistic categories and the effect of proficiency level on performance. The results indicated that movement contrasts were the most difficult and location contrasts the easiest, with the other categories of stimuli of intermediate difficulty. These findings have implications for language learning in situations in which the first language is a spoken language and the second language (L2) is a signed language. In such situations, the construct of language transfer does not apply to the acquisition of L2 phonology because of fundamental differences between the phonological systems of signed and spoken languages, which are associated with differences between the modalities of speech and sign. The authors are grateful to Tom Weymann and Sarah Schley for their assistance in conducting the data analysis, Gaurav Mathur and the anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments and helpful suggestions, and Joe Hamilton, Jenamarie Bacot, and Jon Lejeune for helping to develop and record the stimuli. We also would like to thank Donna Gustina, faculty in the Department of American Sign Language and Interpreting Education, and Corey Clark from the Deaf Studies Laboratory for their support in facilitating data collection. Finally, we want to thank Jonha Smith for drawing the illustration included in this article.</p>

The results of studies involving location generally show that Deaf signers and hearing nonsigners perform similarly on perceptual tasks (Emmorey, 2002). The perception of handshape, however, is more complicated since signers and nonsigners tend to perform similarly on some perceptual tasks, but not on others. In particular, there is evidence to suggest that the perception of handshape is categorical for Deaf signers, but not for hearing nonsigners (Baker, 2003; Emmorey, McCullough, &amp; Brentari, 2003; also see Morford, Grieve-Smith, MacFarlane, Staley, &amp; Waters, 2008). Finally, the results of various studies indicate that signers perceive movement differently than nonsigners and that knowledge of a signed language can influence the perception of motion (Emmorey, 2002; Poizner, 1981).

Similarly, the difficulty of handshape contrasts appears generally consistent with findings regarding the role of experience with ASL in the perception of handshape (Baker, 2003; Emmorey et al., 2003; also seeMorford et al., 2008). The performance of native signers on handshape contrasts was 92.5% correct; the performance of intermediate learners was 85.9% correct; and the performance of beginning learners was 68.5% correct.

Finally, the second response interval was presented (3 seconds), and participants indicated their response (“S” or “D”) to the second trial on the answer sheet. The two trials comprising each item were presented consecutively (one after the other) because previous research using a very similar discrimination procedure indicated no influence attributable to memory (recency) effects (Bochner et al. 1997, 2003) and because using consecutive trials could lead directly to the development of an assessment protocol based on this procedure (e.g., a computerized adaptive test of ASL discrimination ability).

The results indicated that the two scoringmethods are essentially equivalent (r= .98, p &lt; .0001). This finding indicates that no information is lost in treating the data as a set of 48 items and, following other studies using similar procedures (Bochner et al. 1997, 2003), all subsequent analyses are based on this dataset. Treating the data as a set of 48 items is considered preferable because it reduces chance-level performance and facilitates the interpretation of results.

Among the major issues addressed in the literature are the effects of age, the quality and quantity of L2 input, and interactions between the first language (L1) and L2 phonetic systems, including L1 transfer (Flege, 2002; Mack, 2003). Numerous empirical investigations have been conducted addressing segmental properties of speech pertaining to the perception and production of consonants and vowels in L2 learners (e.g., Bohn, 1995; Flege, 1992, 1995). In much of the literature, learners’ performance on speech perception and/or production tasks has been studied in relation to variations in learner age, factors associated with input, and phonetic characteristics of the native and target languages. The results of such studies have informed both theory and practice by providing empirical evidence pertaining to the construction of models and pedagogical approaches. Although the discussion thus far has focused on spoken language, similar issues apply to sign languages, such asASL.However, a good deal is known about spoken la</context>

In his postulates for the scientific study of language, Leonard Bloomfield (1926, p. 155) provided the following definition: “That which is alike will be called same. That which is not same is different.” Bloomfield’s definition is vague and imprecise to be sure, in part, because the perception of difference is far more important to the description of language than actual physical differences. In this regard, it is clear that noticeable but noncontrastive acoustic differences in the linguistic signal pale in importance to contrastive differences for language processing and acquisition (Bohn, 2002). This article addresses the age-old question “when is a difference really different?” within the context of language learning and with specific reference to the acquisition of American Sign Language (ASL). Like any other language learners, students of ASL must be able to recognize linguistic contrasts and overlook subphonemic (within-category) variation. In examining learners’ ability to distinguish contrastive from noncontrastive variation in ASL, this article addresses a crucial topic for the acquisition of all languages—and signed languages in particular.

Therefore, the surprisingly poor performance on “Same” items in this study may be attributed to the fact that the participant sample was comprised primarily of language learners, especially beginners, whose experience with ASL was very limited. It is likely that learners often attend to small subphonemic differences in sign production and incorrectly perceive utterance tokens that are the same as being similar (but not identical) to one another. In this regard, Bohn (2002) pointed out that the perception of phonetic similarity depends on factors such as the observer’s language background and experience and that similar utterance tokens (i.e., utterances that are in close proximity to one another in phonetic space) are more difficult for L2 learners to categorize than dissimilar utterance tokens (i.e., utterances distal from one another in phonetic space). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the difficulty of “Same” items in the present study follows from participants’ background as spoken language users and their lack of experience with signed language</context>

A drawing depicting each utterance was prepared and, after viewing the utterance, participants were required to select the picture that best depicted the utterance from two alternatives. The utterances represented minimal pairs because they could only be differentiated with respect to a single contrast in one ASL parameter. The parameters of movement, handshape (hand configuration), location (place of articulation), and orientation were investigated. These sublexical features are an intrinsic part of the phonology of ASL, analogous to phonetic features in spoken language phonology (Brentari, 1998; Liddell &amp; Johnson, 1989; Sandler, 1989; Stokoe, 1960). The results indicated that contrasts in movement and handshape were significantly more difficult to discern than contrasts in location and orientation. Consistent with this finding, Fischer, Delhorne, and Reed (1999) reported a similar result in a small-scale study of ASL utterances degraded by fast rates of presentation (i.e., time-compressed sign). The acquisition of sublexical features in ASL and the ability to differentiate contrastive from noncontrastive differences in sign production represent a major challenge for learners.

As such, our approach to ASL phonology may be considered oversimplified from the current perspective of sign language linguistics. Nevertheless, the approach taken in this study is justified because it forms the basis of a useful pedagogical grammar and reflects an important dimension of sign language processing. More recent approaches to ASL phonology (e.g., Brentari, 1998; Liddell &amp; Johnson, 1989) seem less suitable from a pedagogical perspective, and this point is pertinent because the present study focuses on learners. Additionally, the approach to ASL phonology adopted in this study enables comparisons to be made with previous research concerning native and highly skilled signers’ processing of formational parameters (e.g., Fischer &amp; Tartter, 1985; Tartter &amp; Fisher, 1982).

Complex morphology is known to pose a challenge for ASL learners (especially late learners) because the distinctions included in this domain of ASL grammar are relatively subtle and acquired fairly late in the acquisition process (Emmorey, 2002; Gee &amp; Goodhart, 1988). Because complex morphology contrasts generally co-occurred with contrasts in one of the phonological parameters included in this investigation, the dataset was examined to compare performance on specific complex morphology contrasts to performance on items including contrasts in the corresponding phonological parameter. In particular, performance on items containing contrasts in number incorporation (69.3% correct) was found to be comparable to performance on items containing contrasts in handshape (72% correct); performance on items containing contrasts in verb inflec</context>

The results of studies involving location generally show that Deaf signers and hearing nonsigners perform similarly on perceptual tasks (Emmorey, 2002). The perception of handshape, however, is more complicated since signers and nonsigners tend to perform similarly on some perceptual tasks, but not on others. In particular, there is evidence to suggest that the perception of handshape is categorical for Deaf signers, but not for hearing nonsigners (Baker, 2003; Emmorey, McCullough, &amp; Brentari, 2003; also see Morford, Grieve-Smith, MacFarlane, Staley, &amp; Waters, 2008). Finally, the results of various studies indicate that signers perceive movement differently than nonsigners and that knowledge of a signed language can influence the perception of motion (Emmorey, 2002; Poizner, 1981).

The native signers’ responses to “Same” items were correct 90% of the time, demonstrating that these items were very easy for them.

Manner of articulation accounts for fewer perceptual confusions; hence, it is less fragile. The phonetic feature of voicing accounts for the fewest confusions and, therefore, is the least fragile (most salient) property of speech. These results are among Miller and Nicely’s most notable and widely cited findings. Following Miller and Nicely’s (1955) study of perceptual confusions in speech, Tartter and Fischer (1982) and Fischer and Tartter (1985) studied perceptual confusions in ASL. In these two studies, the authors presented pairs of ASL utterances on videotape under normal and degraded viewing conditions to 14 highly proficient and native Deaf signers.

Among the major issues addressed in the literature are the effects of age, the quality and quantity of L2 input, and interactions between the first language (L1) and L2 phonetic systems, including L1 transfer (Flege, 2002; Mack, 2003). Numerous empirical investigations have been conducted addressing segmental properties of speech pertaining to the perception and production of consonants and vowels in L2 learners (e.g., Bohn, 1995; Flege, 1992, 1995).

In terms of second language acquisition, fundamental differences between signed and spoken languages associated with the channel of information transmission (i.e., differences in sensorimotor and phonological processing) create a situation in which the construct of language transfer has little or no discernable impact with respect to the domain of phonology (see Gass &amp; Selinker, 1983, for an overview of language transfer). When L1 and L2 are both spoken languages, L1 serves as a basis for L2 acquisition, and language transfer is presumed to influence the learning process across all linguistic domains. In contrast, when L1 is a spoken language and L2 is a signed language, transfer cannot influence the acquisition of L2 phonology because of the fundamental differences associated with the channels of information transmission.

The parameters of movement, handshape (hand configuration), location (place of articulation), and orientation were investigated. These sublexical features are an intrinsic part of the phonology of ASL, analogous to phonetic features in spoken language phonology (Brentari, 1998; Liddell &amp; Johnson, 1989; Sandler, 1989; Stokoe, 1960).

The final category did not contain a linguistic contrast of any kind and is referred to as “Same.” In the “Same” category, each trial consists of a repetition of the target (model) sentence; hence, the correct response to each trial is “Same.” The description of ASL phonology used in this investigation reflects approaches used prior to the Movement-Hold Model (Liddell &amp; Johnson, 1989). As such, our approach to ASL phonology may be considered oversimplified from the current perspective of sign language linguistics. Nevertheless, the approach taken in this study is justified because it forms the basis of a useful pedagogical grammar and reflects an important dimension of sign language processing.

Additionally, the approach to ASL phonology adopted in this study ena</context>

Acquisition The acquisition of speech perception and production abilities in L2 phonology has been studied for decades, especially with respect to nonnative pronunciation (i.e., foreign accent). Among the major issues addressed in the literature are the effects of age, the quality and quantity of L2 input, and interactions between the first language (L1) and L2 phonetic systems, including L1 transfer (Flege, 2002; Mack, 2003). Numerous empirical investigations have been conducted addressing segmental properties of speech pertaining to the perception and production of consonants and vowels in L2 learners (e.g., Bohn, 1995; Flege, 1992, 1995). In much of the literature, learners’ performance on speech perception and/or production tasks has been studied in relation to variations in learner age, factors associated with input, and phonetic characteristics of the native and target languages. The results of such studies have informed both theory and practice by providing empirical evidence pertaining to the construction </context>

Similarly, the difficulty of handshape contrasts appears generally consistent with findings regarding the role of experience with ASL in the perception of handshape (Baker, 2003; Emmorey et al., 2003; also seeMorford et al., 2008). The performance of native signers on handshape contrasts was 92.5% correct; the performance of intermediate learners was 85.9% correct; and the performance of beginning learners was 68.5% correct. Finally, the relative ease with which location contrasts are perceived is consistent with data on the acquisition of ASL as an L1 (Conlin, Mirus, Mauk, &amp; Meier, 2000; Marentette &amp; Mayberry, 2000). Unlike previous research, the present study included morphological contrasts, and the results indicated that contrasts involving complex morphology were relatively difficult. Complex morphology is known to pose a challenge for ASL learners (especially late learners) because the distinctions included in this domain of ASL grammar are relatively subtle and acquired fairly late in the acquisition process (Emmorey, 2002; Gee &amp; Goodhart, 1988). Because complex morphology contrasts generally co-occurred with contrasts in one of the phonological parameters included in this investigation, the datase</context>

The results of studies involving location generally show that Deaf signers and hearing nonsigners perform similarly on perceptual tasks (Emmorey, 2002). The perception of handshape, however, is more complicated since signers and nonsigners tend to perform similarly on some perceptual tasks, but not on others. In particular, there is evidence to suggest that the perception of handshape is categorical for Deaf signers, but not for hearing nonsigners (Baker, 2003; Emmorey, McCullough, &amp; Brentari, 2003; also see Morford, Grieve-Smith, MacFarlane, Staley, &amp; Waters, 2008).

Like any other language learners, students of ASL must be able to recognize linguistic contrasts and overlook subphonemic (within-category) variation. In examining learners’ ability to distinguish contrastive from noncontrastive variation in ASL, this article addresses a crucial topic for the acquisition of all languages—and signed languages in particular. Background American Sign Language is a native language for many Deaf1 people and a cornerstone of the Deaf community in North America (Padden &amp; Humphries, 1988). It is also a widely used second language (L2) for both hearing and Deaf/deaf people and is taught in numerous primary, secondary, and postsecondary academic programs. In fact, ASL is one of the most commonly taught languages in the United States and Canada. ASL and other natural sign languages are distinguished from spoken languages primarily by the modality or channel of communication that is used for the transmission of linguistic information; that is, whereas spoken languages transmit linguistic signals via the auditory channel, signed languages transmit linguistic signals via the visual </context>

The ability to differentiate contrastive from noncontrastive differences in ASL, as in any other language, serves as a foundation for communication and acquisition. As such, the results of this study contribute to the field of applied linguistics, in general, and have special relevance for the acquisition of signed languages, in particular. Revised version accepted 10 March 2010 Notes 1 Uppercase Deaf denotes a group of people who share a common language (ASL) and culture. Lowercase deaf denotes people with hearing loss (Padden &amp; Humphries, 1988). 2 Although phonological transfer cannot occur in the situation in which L1 is a spoken language and L2 is a signed language, phonological (and cognitive) universals can still influence the course of acquisition at an abstract, underlying level of structure. 3 Native signers’ performance on each of the six item categories was as follows: location = 95% correct; handshape = 92.5% correct; orientation = 92.5% correct; movement = 76.3% correct; complex morphology = 72.5% correct; “Same” = 90% correct. 4 For the two items reflecting noun classifier usage, one contained a contrast in handshape and</context>

As such, phonetic properties such as location, handshape, and movement are used in ASL phonology, whereas properties such as place, manner, and voicing are used in spoken language phonology. With regard to syntax, ASL generally has been considered to have an SVO word order but relies heavily on topic-comment relations in discourse (Liddell, 1980). The morphology of ASL and other signed languages, in contrast to English, is nonconcatenative because combinatorial processes rely heavily on stem-internal changes rather than affixation (Fischer &amp; Gough, 1978; Sandler, 1989, 1990). Variation Variation occurs naturally in both spoken and signed languages. Some variation is associated with aspects of language structure and can result in linguistic contrasts, such as the difference between one phoneme and another or one morpheme and another. Other variation, however, is not contrastive in the sense that it does not alter the identity of a linguistic unit or change the meaning of an utterance. For example, linguistic units at the levels of phonology and morphology sometimes are characterized by allophonic and allomorphic variation. In such situations, differences ar</context>

The utterances represented minimal pairs because they could only be differentiated with respect to a single contrast in one ASL parameter. The parameters of movement, handshape (hand configuration), location (place of articulation), and orientation were investigated. These sublexical features are an intrinsic part of the phonology of ASL, analogous to phonetic features in spoken language phonology (Brentari, 1998; Liddell &amp; Johnson, 1989; Sandler, 1989; Stokoe, 1960). The results indicated that contrasts in movement and handshape were significantly more difficult to discern than contrasts in location and orientation. Consistent with this finding, Fischer, Delhorne, and Reed (1999) reported a similar result in a small-scale study of ASL utterances degraded by fast rates of presentation (i.e., time-compressed sign). The acquisition of sublexical features in ASL and the ability to differentiate contrastive from noncontrastive differences in sign production represent a major challenge for learners.

Speech production occurs largely within the oral cavity, so the articulation of speech sounds cannot be directly observed. In contrast, the production of signs occurs outside the body and is fully accessible to observers. This distinction might have important implications with regard to learners’ processing of variation and the acquisition of phonetic categories. In particular, Stevens (1972, 1989) described nonlinearities in the relationship between vocal articulation (input) and the acoustic signal (output) in terms of a quantal theory of speech. Quantal theory is associated with nonlinearities in speech pertaining to the fact that large changes in articulation sometimes have small effects on the acoustic characteristics of the signal, whereas, conversely, small changes in articulation sometimes result in large changes in acoustic output. In short, the quantal theory of speech is based largely on the fact that “articulatory movements are not equal in their acoustic consequences</context>

It also has been suggested from a developmental and evolutionary perspective that the tendency for nonlinear (quantal) relations among “acoustic, auditory and articulatory parameters is a principal factor shaping the inventory of acoustic and articulatory attributes that are used to signal distinctions in language” (Stevens, 1989, p. 3). Because the production of signs is directly observable, the relationship between the articulation of signs and the manual signal is completely linear because the articulation of signs is the signal. The linear relationship between articulation and the signal may have specific consequences for signed languages with regard to phonological variation and the development of phonetic categories. If a nonlinear relationship accommodates variation in speech, it may be assumed that a linear relationship would have the opposite effect in sign, providing relatively limited tolerance for variatio</context>

The utterances represented minimal pairs because they could only be differentiated with respect to a single contrast in one ASL parameter. The parameters of movement, handshape (hand configuration), location (place of articulation), and orientation were investigated. These sublexical features are an intrinsic part of the phonology of ASL, analogous to phonetic features in spoken language phonology (Brentari, 1998; Liddell &amp; Johnson, 1989; Sandler, 1989; Stokoe, 1960). The results indicated that contrasts in movement and handshape were significantly more difficult to discern than contrasts in location and orientation. Consistent with this finding, Fischer, Delhorne, and Reed (1999) reported a similar result in a small-scale study of ASL utterances degraded by fast rates of presentation (i.e., time-compressed sign). The acquisition of sublexical features in ASL and the ability to differentiate contrastive from noncontrastive differences in sign production represent a major challenge for learners. In order to distinguish among signs, learners must recognize </context>

In particular, data indicated that the phonetic feature of place of articulation is highly fragile in the sense that it is the most difficult feature to perceive under degraded listening conditions. Manner of articulation accounts for fewer perceptual confusions; hence, it is less fragile. The phonetic feature of voicing accounts for the fewest confusions and, therefore, is the least fragile (most salient) property of speech. These results are among Miller and Nicely’s most notable and widely cited findings. Following Miller and Nicely’s (1955) study of perceptual confusions in speech, Tartter and Fischer (1982) and Fischer and Tartter (1985) studied perceptual confusions in ASL. In these two studies, the authors presented pairs of ASL utterances on videotape under normal and degraded viewing conditions to 14 highly proficient and native Deaf signers. The degraded utterances were recorded under special lighting conditions designed to reduce the visibility of the signer. A drawing depicting each utterance was prepared and, after viewing the utterance, participants were required to select the picture that best depicted the utterance from two alternatives.

These findings are largely consistent with those of studies using highly proficient and native Deaf signers presented with signals under normal and degraded viewing conditions. Specifically, movement contrasts generally have been found to be the most difficult, location contrasts the easiest, and handshape and orientation contrasts of intermediate difficulty in studies reported by Tartter and Fischer (1982), Fischer and Tartter (1985), and Fischer et al. (1999). The relative difficulty of movement contrasts is consistent with Brentari’s (1998) analysis of ASL phonology. In her analysis, Brentari associated the parameter of movement with perceptual salience/visibility, proposing “the more proximal the joint articulating the movement is to the midline of the body, the greater the degree of sonority” (p. 217). In terms of Brentari’s sonority hierarchy for ASL, the movement contrasts included in this study, for the most part, are associated with moderate perceptual salience/visibility.

The results indicated that the discrimination task distinguished beginners from participants classified at both the intermediate and native levels of ASL proficiency. The small sample size in the intermediate (N = 16) and native (N = 10) groups, however, prevented the difference between them from reaching statistical significance. The overall pattern of results, including their consistency with previous research (e.g., Fischer &amp; Tartter, 1985; Tartter &amp; Fischer, 1982) and the superior performance of the native signers, attests to the validity of the task. Even though the native signers performed quite well on the task overall (86% correct), their performance as a group was slightly lower than expected. In particular, four members of the group scored below 63% on complex morphology contrasts and three scored below 63% on movement contrasts. This finding indicates that some complex morphology and movement contrasts were especially difficult, even for native signers. Nevertheless, the 10 native signers performed very well on four of the six item categories, s</context>
