			<abstract>
				<p>Language is rife with ambiguity. Do children and adults meet this challenge in similar ways? Recent work suggests that while adults resolve syntactic ambiguities by integrating a variety of cues, children are less sensitive to top-down evidence. We test whether this top-down insensitivity is specific to syntax or a general feature of children's linguistic ambiguity resolution by evaluating whether children rely largely or completely on lexical associations to resolve lexical ambiguities (e.g., the word swing primes the baseball meaning of bat) or additionally integrate top-down global plausibility. Using a picture choice task, we compared 4-year-olds' ability to resolve polysemes and homophones with a Bayesian algorithm reliant purely on lexical associations and found that the algorithm's power to predict children's choices was limited. A 2nd experiment confirmed that children override associations and integrate top-down plausibility. We discuss this with regard to models of psycholinguistic development.</p>

Nevertheless, adults manage to resolve the vast majority of linguistic ambiguity rapidly and accurately. Research in psycholinguistics suggests that this accuracy is achieved through a cognitive architecture in which a wide variety of information sources, both bottom-up and top-down, are used to select the best interpretation from the multiple possible alternatives (see, e.g., Altmann, 1998; Dahan &amp; Magnuson, 2006; MacDonald, Pearlmutter, &amp; Seidenberg, 1994; Swinney, 1979). For example, the intended meaning of a noun–verb homophone like duck could be resolved using information from the same level of representation, such as priming by a related word (e.g., quack) or through top-down feedback from its syntactic context (e.g., whether it is preceded by a definite article). Far less is known, however, about how the mechanisms of ambiguity resolution develop. To what extent does the cognitive machinery that children use for language comprehension relate to the machinery used by adults?

To what extent does the cognitive machinery that children use for language comprehension relate to the machinery used by adults? In fact, recent work suggests that, in many respects, child and adult language processing are similar. Like adults, children process language quickly and incrementally: They make guesses about plausible interpretations on the basis of the currently available evidence and do not hold off on interpreting a sentence until it has finished (Fernald, Zangl, Portillo, &amp; Marchman, 2008; Snedeker, 2009; Trueswell &amp; Gleitman, 2004; Trueswell, Sekerina, Hill, &amp; Logrip, 1999). But, in other respects, children’s ambiguity resolution is very different. In particular, their coordination of different levels of linguistic representation to ultimately choose an interpretation is distinctly not adultlike. Research on syntactic ambiguity resolution suggests that although children have little difficulty using bottom-up information in their decisions, they find the integration of top-down information considerably more demanding. Evidence for this distinction comes from children’s ability to resolve ambi</context>

Five-year-olds can resolve these ambiguities using bottom-up cues such as lexical statistics, the frequency with which a verb is found in a particular syntactic structure. Because a prepositional phrase subsequent to the verb tickle most frequently describes an instrument, children tend to attach all ambiguous prepositional phrases following tickle as instruments, whereas for verbs that typically do not take an instrument phrase (e.g., choose the frog with the feather), children take the phrase to modify the frog (Kidd &amp; Bavin, 2005; Snedeker &amp; Trueswell, 2004; Trueswell et al., 1999). This bottom-up facility extends to additional cues, such as the prosodic rhythm and stress in a sentence (Snedeker &amp; Yuan, 2008). However, children’s use of top-down information is very different. For instance, adults will quickly account for a cue called referential context. If tickle the frog with the feather is uttered in front of two frogs, one holding a feather and one empty-handed, adults immediately make the inference that the prepositional phrase modifies the noun to disambiguate which of the two frogs is being referred to.

To what extent does the cognitive machinery that children use for language comprehension relate to the machinery used by adults? In fact, recent work suggests that, in many respects, child and adult language processing are similar. Like adults, children process language quickly and incrementally: They make guesses about plausible interpretations on the basis of the currently available evidence and do not hold off on interpreting a sentence until it has finished (Fernald, Zangl, Portillo, &amp; Marchman, 2008; Snedeker, 2009; Trueswell &amp; Gleitman, 2004; Trueswell, Sekerina, Hill, &amp; Logrip, 1999). But, in other respects, children’s ambiguity resolution is very different. In particular, their coordination of different levels of linguistic representation to ultimately choose an interpretation is distinctly not adultlike. Research on syntactic ambiguity resolution suggests that although children have little difficulty using bottom-up information in their decisions, they find the integration of top-down information considerably more demanding. Evidence for this distinction comes from children’s ability to resolve ambiguous phrases such as tickle the frog with the feather. Here, the ambig</context>

Five-year-olds can resolve these ambiguities using bottom-up cues such as lexical statistics, the frequency with which a verb is found in a particular syntactic structure. Because a prepositional phrase subsequent to the verb tickle most frequently describes an instrument, children tend to attach all ambiguous prepositional phrases following tickle as instruments, whereas for verbs that typically do not take an instrument phrase (e.g., choose the frog with the feather), children take the phrase to modify the frog (Kidd &amp; Bavin, 2005; Snedeker &amp; Trueswell, 2004; Trueswell et al., 1999). This bottom-up facility extends to additional cues, such as the prosodic rhythm and stress in a sentence (Snedeker &amp; Yuan, 2008). However, children’s use of top-down information is very different. For instance, adults will quickly account for a cue called referential context. If tickle the frog with the feather is uttered in front of two frogs, one holding a feather and one empty-handed, adults immediately make the inference that the prepositional phrase modifies the noun to disambiguate which of the two frogs is being referred to.
