			<abstract>
				<p>Cultural and linguistic groups are often expected to represent genetic populations. In this article, we tested the hypothesis that the hierarchical classification of languages proposed by J. Green-berg [(1987) Language in the Americas (Stanford Univ. Press, Stan-ford, CA)] also represents the genetic structure of Native North American populations. The genetic data are mtDNA sequences for 17 populations gleaned from literature sources and public databases. The hypothesis was rejected. Further analysis showed that departure of the genetic structure from the linguistic classification was pervasive and not due to an outlier population or a problematic language group. Therefore, Greenberg's language groups are at best an imperfect approximation to the genetic structure of these populations. Moreover, we show that the genetic structure among these Native North American populations departs significantly from the best-fitting hierarchical models. Analysis of median joining networks for mtDNA haplotypes provides strong evidence for gene flow across linguistic boundaries. In principle, the language of a population can be replaced more rapidly than its genes because language can be transmitted both vertically from parents to children and horizontally between unrelated people. However, languages are part of a cultural complex, and there may be strong pressure to maintain a language in place whereas genes are free to flow. language and genetics ͉ mtDNA</p>

First, they have high power to resolve population affinities. Second, it is easy to identify and remove non-Native American mtDNA sequences. Third, by contrasting gene and population trees, it is possible to discern patterns of gene flow. We begin our analyses by formally testing the hypothesis that a classification of languages proposed by Greenberg (19) represents the structure of Native North American gene pools. Although the majority of linguists do not endorse Greenberg’s language classification (4, 10, 18, 20, 21), it is important to test this model because it remains one of the main tenets against which questions about Native American population genetics and physical anthropology are formulated (3). To preempt our results, this hypothesis is rejected. Because of this finding, we proceed to ask two questions. First, is the genetic structure of these populations hierarchical? Second, is there evidence from mtDNA sequences for exchange across the boundaries of widely accepted language families? Materials and Methods Sample.

Third, 14 of the 17 populations are situated today in the same localities that they occupied at the time of first European contact. Fourth, mtDNA from ancient (precontact) Native American populations look similar to postcontact populations in the same region (34–36). Another possibility for the disagreement between the genetic data and the GLC is that the GLC is a poor representation of the relationships among Native North American languages (4). In fact, most linguists do not accept the GLC (4, 10, 18, 20, 21). Greenberg’s methods have been criticized (21, 37), and it is felt widely that there is not sufficient information to establish deep linguistic connections (10). Nevertheless, Greenberg included some undisputed language families within his classification. These undisputed families include the Eskimo-Aleut family and the Athabascan language group (10, 38, 39). We therefore find it quite interesting that the fitted branch to both Eskimo-Aleut and Athabascan was estimated to have zero length (Fig. 2). This finding suggests that t</context>

Aleuts do not cluster with Eskimos. Neither the Yupik nor Inuit populations form distinct clusters within Eskimo. The two Algonquin-speaking populations do not form a cluster. The Navajo and Apache are separated in the NJ tree by the nonAthabascan-speaking Bella Coola. It is possible that a stronger relationship between language groups and gene pools would be found by directly assessing language areas that arise from diffusion of linguistic traits across phylogenetic boundaries of languages (4, 10). The poor correspondence between the genetic data and language groups reflects the current population structure. Genetic and linguistic variation may have shared the same hierarchical relationships in the past. In fact, there are several features in the data that can be interpreted as remnants of such relationships. These features include the Eskimo-Aleut-specific transition polymorphism (29) and the two Athabascan-specific transition polymorphisms (14).

There has been a tendency to expect that language replacements will be more common (3, 41). In principle, language replacement can occur more rapidly than gene replacement because language can be transmitted both vertically from parents to children and horizontally between unrelated people, creating bilingual and multilingual individuals, whereas genes can be transmitted only vertically (1, 42). However, we found that the constraints imposed by mechanisms of transmission may be relatively weak as compared with other factors that will influence whether genes, languages, or both will be replac</context>

The poor correspondence between the genetic data and language groups reflects the current population structure. Genetic and linguistic variation may have shared the same hierarchical relationships in the past. In fact, there are several features in the data that can be interpreted as remnants of such relationships. These features include the Eskimo-Aleut-specific transition polymorphism (29) and the two Athabascan-specific transition polymorphisms (14). Interestingly, these results are consistent with a linguistic model proposed by Nettle (9) that predicts that high diversity of language stocks is a transitory phase in linguistic evolution. According to Nettle’s model, the entry of humans into a new region such as the Americas affords significant opportunity for the birth of new languages.

An Arctic-Pacific Northwest cluster that includes all Aleut-Eskimo populations, all Na-Dene populations, and the Amerind Nuu Chah Nulth and Bella Coola populations originates on one side of branch a, whereas a more Southern group includes the Pima, Cherokee, Sioux, and Chippewa Amerindspeaking population forms to the other side of branch a.

The pattern of asymmetrical genetic exchanges is all the more interesting given current mate exchange practices. Today, marriage practice in both the Western Apache and Navajo is strongly matrilineal. On this basis, we would not expect to see the inclusion of female lineages introduced from the surrounding non-Athabascan-speaking populations. However, the practice of matrilineality in these populations is likely to have begun after the Navajos and Apaches arrived in the Southwest (31). This practice makes it likely that the haplogroup B and C mtDNA sequences carried in the Navajo and Apache today were introduced early in their experience in the Southwest, and before the current cultural practices were initiated. In addition to the presence of B- and C-group haplotypes in the Navajo and Apache, other features of the median-joining networks indicate genetic exchange between linguistically divergent neighboring populations in the Northwest and Arctic. For example, the Northwest Coast Bella Coola and Nuu Chah Nulth (attributed to Amerind) share A-group lineages with the Northw</context>

The Navajo and Apache possess many haplogroup A sequences typical of Northwestern populations with languages attributed to the Na Dene language family. However, DNA sequences belonging to haplogroups B and C are also common in the Navajo and Apache, and these are most likely due to immigrants from the local non-Athabascanspeaking populations.

Fourth, mtDNA from ancient (precontact) Native American populations look similar to postcontact populations in the same region (34–36). Another possibility for the disagreement between the genetic data and the GLC is that the GLC is a poor representation of the relationships among Native North American languages (4). In fact, most linguists do not accept the GLC (4, 10, 18, 20, 21). Greenberg’s methods have been criticized (21, 37), and it is felt widely that there is not sufficient information to establish deep linguistic connections (10).

Although it has been recognized that the original genetic data used in this argument lacked resolving power, our analyses of the currently available mtDNA sequences show that the patterns of variation in genes and languages actually disagree.
