      <abstract>
        <p>Learners' ability to recognize linguistic contrasts in American Sign Language (ASL) was investigated using a paired-comparison discrimination task. Minimal pairs containing contrasts in five linguistic categories (i.e., the formational parameters of movement, handshape, orientation, and location in ASL phonology, and a category comprised of contrasts in complex morphology) were presented in sentence contexts to a sample of 127 hearing learners at beginning and intermediate levels of proficiency and 10 Deaf native signers. Participants' responses were analyzed to determine the relative difficulty of the linguistic categories and the effect of proficiency level on performance. The results indicated that movement contrasts were the most difficult and location contrasts the easiest, with the other categories of stimuli of intermediate difficulty. These findings have implications for language learning in situations in which the first language is a spoken language and the second language (L2) is a signed language. In such situations, the construct of language transfer does not apply to the acquisition of L2 phonology because of fundamental differences between the phonological systems of signed and spoken languages, which are associated with differences between the modalities of speech and sign.

      <p>Similarity and dissimilarity have historically played an important role in
linguistics with regard to the classification of sound segments. In his postulates for
the scientific study of language, Leonard Bloomfield (1926, p. 155) provided
the following definition: “That which is alike will be called same. That which
is not same is different.”</p>
      <p>Bloomfield’s definition is vague and imprecise to be sure, in part, because
the perception of difference is far more important to the description of language
than actual physical differences. In this regard, it is clear that noticeable but
noncontrastive acoustic differences in the linguistic signal pale in importance to
contrastive differences for language processing and acquisition (Bohn, 2002).</p>
      <p>This article addresses the age-old question “when is a difference really
different?” within the context of language learning and with specific reference
to the acquisition of American Sign Language (ASL). Like any other
language learners, students of ASL must be able to recognize linguistic contrasts
and overlook subphonemic (within-category) variation. In examining learners’
ability to distinguish contrastive from noncontrastive variation in ASL, this
article addresses a crucial topic for the acquisition of all languages—and signed
languages in particular.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>American Sign Language is a native language for many Deaf 1 people and a</title>
      <p>cornerstone of the Deaf community in North America (Padden &amp; Humphries,
1988). It is also a widely used second language (L2) for both hearing and
Deaf/deaf people and is taught in numerous primary, secondary, and
postsecondary academic programs. In fact, ASL is one of the most commonly taught
languages in the United States and Canada. ASL and other natural sign
languages are distinguished from spoken languages primarily by the modality or
channel of communication that is used for the transmission of linguistic
information; that is, whereas spoken languages transmit linguistic signals via the
auditory channel, signed languages transmit linguistic signals via the visual
channel. As such, phonetic properties such as location, handshape, and
movement are used in ASL phonology, whereas properties such as place, manner, and
voicing are used in spoken language phonology. With regard to syntax, ASL
generally has been considered to have an SVO word order but relies heavily
on topic-comment relations in discourse (Liddell, 1980). The morphology of
ASL and other signed languages, in contrast to English, is nonconcatenative
because combinatorial processes rely heavily on stem-internal changes rather
than affixation (Fischer &amp; Gough, 1978; Sandler, 1989, 1990).</p>
      <p>Variation
Variation occurs naturally in both spoken and signed languages. Some
variation is associated with aspects of language structure and can result in linguistic
contrasts, such as the difference between one phoneme and another or one
morpheme and another. Other variation, however, is not contrastive in the sense
that it does not alter the identity of a linguistic unit or change the meaning
of an utterance. For example, linguistic units at the levels of phonology and
morphology sometimes are characterized by allophonic and allomorphic
variation. In such situations, differences are noticeable and may even be systematic,
but they are not contrastive.</p>
      <p>Taking the concept of variation a step further, the production of sound
segments varies both within and across individual speakers. In particular,
the same sound segment can have very different acoustic (and phonetic)
manifestations depending on speaker characteristics (e.g., gender, age,
emotional state, and social/regional dialect), speaking rate, and the surrounding
phonetic environment. The phonetic inventory of any given language,
therefore, cannot be uniquely defined in terms of absolute or invariant
properties of the speech signal. This is sometimes referred to as the problem of
invariance.</p>
      <p>The problem of invariance must be addressed in the description, processing,
and acquisition of language. In particular, variation across linguistic categories
must be recognized and differentiated from within-category variation in the
segmentation and classification of linguistic units at the levels of phonology
and morphology. For example, allophones and allomorphs must be properly
identified in order for communication to be effective. Similarly, listeners must
adjust to physical variations across individual speakers, such as acoustic
differences among the voices of males, females, and children, a phenomenon known
as speaker normalization. Failure to properly segment and classify linguistic
units will result in an incorrect analysis of the linguistic signal, as will failure
to properly engage in speaker normalization (see Kent, 1997, for a general
discussion of invariance and speaker normalization).</p>
      <p>Acquisition
The acquisition of speech perception and production abilities in L2 phonology
has been studied for decades, especially with respect to nonnative
pronunciation (i.e., foreign accent). Among the major issues addressed in the literature
are the effects of age, the quality and quantity of L2 input, and interactions
between the first language (L1) and L2 phonetic systems, including L1 transfer
(Flege, 2002; Mack, 2003). Numerous empirical investigations have been
conducted addressing segmental properties of speech pertaining to the perception
and production of consonants and vowels in L2 learners (e.g., Bohn, 1995;
Flege, 1992, 1995). In much of the literature, learners’ performance on speech
perception and/or production tasks has been studied in relation to variations in
learner age, factors associated with input, and phonetic characteristics of the
native and target languages. The results of such studies have informed both
theory and practice by providing empirical evidence pertaining to the construction
of models and pedagogical approaches.</p>
      <p>Although the discussion thus far has focused on spoken language, similar
issues apply to sign languages, such as ASL. However, a good deal is known about
spoken language phonology and speech production and perception, whereas
less is known about the production, perception, and phonology of ASL and
other natural sign languages. Still, a number of studies have been conducted
on sign perception with particular reference to the phonological parameters of
location, handshape, and movement. The results of studies involving location
generally show that Deaf signers and hearing nonsigners perform similarly on
perceptual tasks (Emmorey, 2002). The perception of handshape, however, is
more complicated since signers and nonsigners tend to perform similarly on
some perceptual tasks, but not on others. In particular, there is evidence to
suggest that the perception of handshape is categorical for Deaf signers, but not for
hearing nonsigners (Baker, 2003; Emmorey, McCullough, &amp; Brentari, 2003;
also see Morford, Grieve-Smith, MacFarlane, Staley, &amp; Waters, 2008). Finally,
the results of various studies indicate that signers perceive movement
differently than nonsigners and that knowledge of a signed language can influence
the perception of motion (Emmorey, 2002; Poizner, 1981).</p>
      <p>Linguistic Contrasts in ASL
This study addresses the issue of variation in ASL from a basic linguistic
perspective involving minimal contrasts between signs (i.e., minimal pairs) with
specific reference to sublexical properties of sign formation. As such, the study
is similar in some respects to Miller and Nicely’s (1955) classic analysis of
perceptual confusions among English consonants. In Miller and Nicely’s
investigation, native speakers were asked to identify English consonants presented
under degraded listening conditions created by filtering and background noise.
Their results demonstrated that perceptual confusions do not occur in a random
fashion; rather, they are associated with specific acoustic and phonetic
properties of speech. In particular, data indicated that the phonetic feature of place of
articulation is highly fragile in the sense that it is the most difficult feature to
perceive under degraded listening conditions. Manner of articulation accounts
for fewer perceptual confusions; hence, it is less fragile. The phonetic feature
of voicing accounts for the fewest confusions and, therefore, is the least fragile
(most salient) property of speech. These results are among Miller and Nicely’s
most notable and widely cited findings.</p>
      <p>Following Miller and Nicely’s (1955) study of perceptual confusions in
speech, Tartter and Fischer (1982) and Fischer and Tartter (1985) studied
perceptual confusions in ASL. In these two studies, the authors presented pairs of
ASL utterances on videotape under normal and degraded viewing conditions
to 14 highly proficient and native Deaf signers. The degraded utterances were
recorded under special lighting conditions designed to reduce the visibility of
the signer. A drawing depicting each utterance was prepared and, after viewing
the utterance, participants were required to select the picture that best depicted
the utterance from two alternatives. The utterances represented minimal pairs
because they could only be differentiated with respect to a single contrast in
one ASL parameter. The parameters of movement, handshape (hand
configuration), location (place of articulation), and orientation were investigated. These
sublexical features are an intrinsic part of the phonology of ASL, analogous
to phonetic features in spoken language phonology (Brentari, 1998; Liddell &amp;
Johnson, 1989; Sandler, 1989; Stokoe, 1960). The results indicated that
contrasts in movement and handshape were significantly more difficult to discern
than contrasts in location and orientation. Consistent with this finding, Fischer,
Delhorne, and Reed (1999) reported a similar result in a small-scale study of
ASL utterances degraded by fast rates of presentation (i.e., time-compressed
sign).</p>
      <p>The acquisition of sublexical features in ASL and the ability to
differentiate contrastive from noncontrastive differences in sign production represent a
major challenge for learners. In order to distinguish among signs, learners
must recognize contrastive differences and determine when variations in sign
production should be overlooked because they are not contrastive. The
importance of learning to recognize contrastive differences at the sublexical level
of structure and distinguish them from noncontrastive differences is illustrated
by data indicating that adult learners tend to make more phonological than
semantic errors in the recall of ASL utterances, with the ratio of phonological
to semantic errors increasing as the learners’ experience with ASL decreases
(Mayberry &amp; Fischer, 1989; see also Mayberry, 1995). These data suggest that
learners must allocate more processing resources to recognize the
phonological shape of signs than native signers and that their allocation of processing
resources to the recognition of sublexical features is inversely related to the
length of their experience with ASL. In this and other studies (e.g., Mayberry
&amp; Eichen, 1991), the subjects consisted of early and late L1 learners, not L2
learners. Mayberry (1993) has addressed the distinction between L1 and L2
ASL learning elsewhere and, in a subsequent work, remarks that the effects
of age are “significantly more pronounced for first as compared to
secondlanguage acquisition” (Mayberry, 1995, p. 364). She then goes on to treat L2
and late L1 learners as one group and differentiate them from native learners,
stating that “language acquisition that occurs during childhood appears to be
more likely to result in automatic, or easy and instantaneous, phonological
processing than language acquisition that occurs at older ages” (Mayberry, 1995,
p. 368). Because the greatest difference between signed and spoken languages
pertains to the channel of information transmission, it is reasonable to expect
that the greatest challenge for hearing adult learners would be acquiring the
sensorimotor (visual and spatial) and phonological skills required for
communication in a modality with which they have little or no experience.</p>
      <p>In terms of second language acquisition, fundamental differences between
signed and spoken languages associated with the channel of information
transmission (i.e., differences in sensorimotor and phonological processing) create a
situation in which the construct of language transfer has little or no discernable
impact with respect to the domain of phonology (see Gass &amp; Selinker, 1983, for
an overview of language transfer). When L1 and L2 are both spoken languages,
L1 serves as a basis for L2 acquisition, and language transfer is presumed to
influence the learning process across all linguistic domains. In contrast, when
L1 is a spoken language and L2 is a signed language, transfer cannot influence
the acquisition of L2 phonology because of the fundamental differences
associated with the channels of information transmission. Although language transfer
does not appear to have any influence on the acquisition of L2 phonology in this
situation, it generally would be assumed to influence the acquisition of other
linguistic domains in the L2 (e.g., morphology and syntax).2</p>
      <p>The purpose of the present study is to investigate the ability of adult
learners to discern when differences in sign formation are contrastive and when
they are not. In addressing this issue, we examine the relative difficulty of
specific linguistic properties of ASL (i.e., the phonological properties of
movement, handshape, location, and orientation, along with aspects of morphology),
combined with natural (free) variation in the production of utterances across
signers. As such, this study addresses variation from a very general perspective
involving sublexical properties of ASL and natural differences in production
across signers.
Participants
A sample of 137 individuals participated in the study. The participant sample
was composed of 127 hearing adult learners at beginning and intermediate
levels of ASL proficiency and 10 Deaf adult native signers. Most of the learners
were enrolled in credit-bearing college-level ASL courses in either the foreign
language or interpreting education programs at the Rochester Institute of
Technology, and a few were enrolled in noncredit courses designed for faculty and
staff at the same institution. The hearing subjects’ participation was completely
voluntary and they were not compensated for their time. The Deaf subjects,
however, were paid a nominal fee for their participation.</p>
      <p>The hearing participants were drawn from three different sign language
instructional programs. The curriculum and student learning outcomes differed
from one ASL program to another. Student ability levels within a given course
also tended to vary. Therefore, fine-grained distinctions in participants’ ASL
abilities could not be determined based on their course enrollment. Keeping
this in mind, the distribution of the hearing participants’ ASL ability is reported
in highly general terms. Specifically, 111 participants were enrolled in courses
designed for learners at beginning levels of proficiency (ASL I, II, and III) and
16 were enrolled in courses appropriate for students at the intermediate level
(ASL V).</p>
      <p>Stimuli
The stimuli consisted of 48 items, which were divided into six categories of
8 items each. Five of the categories included contrasts in specific linguistic
properties of ASL, and one was a general response category. Four categories
represented the parameters of location, orientation, handshape, and movement.
The fifth category, referred to as complex morphology, contained contrasts in
directionality, number incorporation, noun classifier usage, and verb inflection
(two items each). The complex morphology category is defined very broadly
because it covers a range of forms. Importantly, the contrasts in this category are
associated with phonological changes in ASL formational parameters; that is,
the contrasts in complex morphology reflect changes at both the phonological
and morphological levels of structure and, as such, may be considered
morphophonological contrasts. Even though the category of complex morphology
differs from the purely phonological categories of location, orientation,
handshape, and movement, it represents a class of important linguistic distinctions
in ASL that must be recognized and acquired by learners in much the same
manner as phonetic categories. The final category did not contain a linguistic
contrast of any kind and is referred to as “Same.” In the “Same” category, each
trial consists of a repetition of the target (model) sentence; hence, the correct
response to each trial is “Same.”</p>
      <p>The description of ASL phonology used in this investigation reflects
approaches used prior to the Movement-Hold Model (Liddell &amp; Johnson, 1989).
As such, our approach to ASL phonology may be considered oversimplified
from the current perspective of sign language linguistics. Nevertheless, the
approach taken in this study is justified because it forms the basis of a useful
pedagogical grammar and reflects an important dimension of sign language
processing. More recent approaches to ASL phonology (e.g., Brentari, 1998;
Liddell &amp; Johnson, 1989) seem less suitable from a pedagogical
perspective, and this point is pertinent because the present study focuses on learners.
Additionally, the approach to ASL phonology adopted in this study enables
comparisons to be made with previous research concerning native and highly
skilled signers’ processing of formational parameters (e.g., Fischer &amp; Tartter,
1985; Tartter &amp; Fisher, 1982).</p>
      <p>Table 1 illustrates the linguistic contrasts included in the stimulus set by
presenting English glosses of ASL sentences as exemplars of each category.
Contrasting forms are underlined. The drawing in Figure 1 depicts the location
contrast illustrated in Table 1 and in the example below. A complete list of the
test items included within each linguistic category appears in Appendix S1 in
the online Supporting Information. Neither Table 1 nor the appendix, however,
includes “Same” items because these items do not contain linguistic contrasts,
as mentioned earlier.</p>
      <p>Each item was comprised of two pairs of ASL sentences. Each sentence pair
consisted of a model (standard) sentence followed by a comparison sentence.

      <p>The model and each comparison sentence were produced by different
individuals in order to include individual variation across utterances within the
stimulus set. Each of the individuals was a native ASL user from a Deaf
family. One was a 37-year-old third-generation Deaf male from Rochester,
New York. One was a 24-year-old second-generation Deaf female from
northern California. The third was a 30-year old second-generation Deaf male from
Figure 1 Location contrast illustrated by the minimal pair MOTHER-FATHER.
Lake Charles, Louisiana. One of the male signers always produced the model
sentences. The female signer always produced the first comparison sentence,
and the other male signer always produced the second comparison sentence.</p>
      <p>Utterances were recorded over a 4-day period in which the signers and
investigators worked together to ensure clarity, accuracy, and consistency of sign
production. Specifically, the signers discussed the formational details of sign
production with each other and three of the investigators who are fluent Deaf
ASL users. During the recording sessions, the signers observed one another,
paying particular attention to the production of the model sentences. At the
same time, the three Deaf investigators monitored sign production across the
three signers. The utterances were digitally recorded in a TV studio by a
professional videographer. The lighting and background were carefully selected
to provide high-quality images. Each signer produced at least three utterances
(tokens) of each sentence in succession. After the recording sessions, the three
Deaf investigators reviewed the recordings and identified specific utterances
for presentation to participants using the criteria of clarity, accuracy, and
consistency of sign production. The selected utterances were then excised from
the master video and recorded on DVD in a randomized order. This procedure
assured that the utterance tokens presented to participants were clear, accurate,
and consistent and that the contrasts included within each linguistic category
truly represented the category.</p>
      <p>Natural variation was observed among the signers in their production of
utterances; but this variation did not influence meaning. For example, one of the
“Same” items included the sign for SISTER. Although all three signers clearly
signed SISTER, minor, appropriate subphonemic variations in sign formation
were observed. Specifically, two of the signers produced the sign beginning
with contact at the side of the chin. The beginning place of contact for the other
signer was at the middle of the chin. Similar variation across signers may have
occurred in the form of small subphonemic (within-category) differences in
the degree of finger splay, thumb opposition, joint activity, and other aspects of
sign formation.</p>
      <p>The recorded utterances were played to individuals and groups of
participants in classroom settings. The groups ranged in size from 2 to 19 individuals.
The recordings were played on a DVD player or computer, and the images were
projected onto a large screen at the front of the room.</p>
      <p>Procedure
A paired-comparison discrimination task was used in this investigation.
Participants were presented with a model sentence immediately followed by a
comparison sentence, and they were required to judge whether the stimuli were the
“Same” or “Different.” This procedure follows from previous work on the
auditory recognition of speech. Bochner, Garrison, Sussman, and Burkard (2003)
used a very similar paired-comparison discrimination task to study differences
in listeners’ ability to discriminate among spoken utterances as a function of
linguistic (phonetic) properties of the signals as well as the sensory
capabilities of the listeners (degree of hearing loss) and listening conditions (quiet
vs. noise background). Bochner, Garrison, Palmer, Mackenzie, and Braveman
(1997) also conducted a speech recognition study using a discrimination task
resembling the one used in the present investigation.</p>
      <p>As mentioned previously, each item consisted of two pairs of sentence
stimuli. Participants were required to make a discrimination judgment for each pair
of sentences. Therefore, each item consisted of two trials—one for each pair
of stimuli. The model stimulus was presented first, followed by a one second
interstimulus interval. The first comparison sentence was then presented,
followed by a 3-second response interval. The participants responded to the first
trial during this time by circling “S” or “D” on an answer sheet to indicate same
or different. At the conclusion of the response interval, a brief flash of light was
projected on the screen accompanied by an audible tone. These visual and
auditory signals were intended to alert participants that the next stimulus was about
to be presented. The same model stimulus was presented again, followed by a
1-second interstimulus interval and then the second comparison stimulus.
Finally, the second response interval was presented (3 seconds), and participants
indicated their response (“S” or “D”) to the second trial on the answer sheet.
The two trials comprising each item were presented consecutively (one after
the other) because previous research using a very similar discrimination
procedure indicated no influence attributable to memory (recency) effects (Bochner
et al. 1997, 2003) and because using consecutive trials could lead directly to
the development of an assessment protocol based on this procedure (e.g., a
computerized adaptive test of ASL discrimination ability).</p>
      <p>Each stimulus was labeled with a caption on the lower left portion of the
screen. The model sentence was labeled “Model,” and the comparison sentences
were labeled to identify the item number and trial. The first trial for each item
was labeled “a” and the second trial was labeled “b.” For example, the first trial
for the first item was labeled “1a” and the second trial for the first item was
labeled “1b”; the first trial for the second item was labeled “2a” and the second
trial for the second item was labeled “2b”; and so on. The captioned labels on
the screen corresponded to the labels on the answer sheet.</p>
      <p>After a brief explanation of the task in which participants were instructed
to respond “Same” if the utterances in each pair had the same meaning and
“Different” if the utterances in each pair had a different meaning, six practice
items were presented to ensure understanding of the procedure. The practice
items illustrated contrasts in movement, location, orientation, and complex
morphology (one item each). Two practice items illustrated the “Same”
category. In this way, the practice items exposed participants to every item category
except handshape and provided them with a direct and practical orientation to
the task. The combination of instructions and practice items, therefore, served
to familiarize participants with the procedure. Data collection was begun after
the practice items were presented and the examiner(s) was certain that the
participants understood the task. The entire procedure required about 50 minutes
to complete, including explanations and practice items.</p>
      <p>For any item, every possible combination of “Same” and “Different” trials
could occur; that is, an item could consist of two “Same” trials, two
“Different” trials, or one trial of each. In order to reveal meaningful information
using a discrimination procedure of the sort employed in this investigation,
items must contain a linguistic contrast. Therefore, every item within each
linguistic category (location, orientation, handshape, movement, and complex
morphology) contained at least one contrast (i.e., at least one “Different” trial).
In other words, within each linguistic category (location, orientation,
handshape, movement, and complex morphology), an item could contain either two
“Different” trials or one “Same” and one “Different” trial. Half of the eight test
items within each linguistic category listed in Appendix S1 in the online
Supporting Information contained one “Different” trial and the other half contained
two “Different” trials. The determination of which specific items were assigned
one “Different” trial and which were assigned two “Different” trials was done
randomly. As mentioned previously, one category of items did not contain any
linguistic contrasts; in other words, both trials were verbatim repetitions of the
model sentence. It was necessary to include a category of items composed of
two “Same” trials as foils to minimize the potential for response bias in the
participant sample. The reader is referred to Appendix S1 in the online Supporting
Information for additional details and clarification concerning the test items.
Overall Performance
Each of the 48 items was composed of two trials, and participants’ responses
can be considered a set of 48 items or a set of 96 trials. Because the responses
can be analyzed from either the perspective of 48 items or 96 trials, we begin
by comparing scoring outcomes for the set of 48 items to the set of 96 trials.
Each trial is simply scored correct or incorrect. Because a trial consists of two
response alternatives (“S” or “D”), chance-level performance for a given trial
is 50%. The mean number of correct trials across the entire participant sample
was 73.82 (SD = 9.06). In contrast, an item is considered correct if and only
if the response to both trials is correct. No partial credit is awarded. Scoring
each item as a block of two trials reduces the chance level of performance to
25%. The mean number of correct items across the entire participant sample
was 30.95 (SD = 6.73).</p>
      <p>A correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between
participants’ responses scored as a set of 96 trials and as a set of 48 items. The
results indicated that the two scoring methods are essentially equivalent (r = .98,
p &lt; .0001). This finding indicates that no information is lost in treating the
data as a set of 48 items and, following other studies using similar procedures
(Bochner et al. 1997, 2003), all subsequent analyses are based on this dataset.
Treating the data as a set of 48 items is considered preferable because it reduces
chance-level performance and facilitates the interpretation of results.

      <p>An item analysis was conducted to compare the relative difficulty of each
of the 48 items. The results of this analysis indicated that the difficulty of
individual items ranged from 20.4% to 92.7% correct. Eleven items had difficulty
values less than 50% correct; 20 items had difficulty values in the range from
50% to 75%; and 17 items had difficulty values greater than 75%. Performance
on only one item was below chance level, and this item involved a movement
contrast (SERIOUS vs. DISAPPOINTING). Importantly, an estimate of
internal consistency reliability was computed using Cronbach’s coefficient alpha.
The alpha reliability coefficient was .81, indicating a reasonably high degree
of reliability and consistency within the item set. The alpha coefficient also
indicates that, taken together, the items measure a single unidimensional latent
construct, which we define as a measure of ASL discrimination ability.</p>
      <p>The participant sample can be divided into three broad levels of ASL
proficiency: a large group of beginners, a small group of intermediate-level
learners, and a small group of native signers. Table 2 displays the mean number
and proportion of correct responses (based on 48 items) for each group of
participants along with the standard deviation. A one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was conducted to test for differences between groups, and the results
were significant with F(2,134) = 38.54, p &lt; .0001, and with an effect size of
η2 = .365. The results of post hoc tests indicated that the difference between the
beginning and intermediate groups and the difference between the beginning
and native groups were significant (p &lt; .0001). The difference between the
intermediate and native groups was not significant (p = .0823).
Linguistic Categories
The mean number and proportion of correct items within each linguistic
category (eight items per category) and the associated standard deviation are
displayed in Table 3. A one-way ANOVA was conducted on these data, and
the results indicated significant differences between linguistic categories, with
F(5,816) = 34.89, p &lt; .0001, and with an effect size of η2 = .176. The results
of post hoc tests indicated the following: (a) The category of location was

significantly different from every other category; (b) the category of
movement was significantly different from every other category except complex
morphology and “Same;” (c) the categories of handshape and orientation were
significantly different from every other category except each other; and (d)
the categories of complex morphology and “Same” were significantly different
from location, orientation, and handshape. The level of significance of each
post hoc test is indicated in Table 4, and a histogram showing the proportion of
correct items within each category is displayed in Figure 2.

Unlike previous studies that involved the presentation of degraded signals to
small samples of highly proficient Deaf signers, the present investigation used
fully intelligible (normal) signals presented to a relatively large sample of
hearing adult learners of ASL as an L2 and a small sample of Deaf native
signers. The results indicated that the discrimination task distinguished beginners
from participants classified at both the intermediate and native levels of ASL
proficiency. The small sample size in the intermediate (N = 16) and native
(N = 10) groups, however, prevented the difference between them from
reaching statistical significance.</p>
      <p>The overall pattern of results, including their consistency with previous
research (e.g., Fischer &amp; Tartter, 1985; Tartter &amp; Fischer, 1982) and the superior
performance of the native signers, attests to the validity of the task. Even though
the native signers performed quite well on the task overall (86% correct), their
performance as a group was slightly lower than expected. In particular, four
members of the group scored below 63% on complex morphology contrasts
and three scored below 63% on movement contrasts. This finding indicates that
some complex morphology and movement contrasts were especially difficult,
even for native signers. Nevertheless, the 10 native signers performed very
well on four of the six item categories, scoring 90% or higher on location,
handshape, orientation, and “Same” items.3 In order to be absolutely certain
that these findings are accurate, the investigators double-checked the data
collection procedure, stimuli, and data analysis. No irregularities or anomalies
were discovered. Therefore, it seems that just as some spoken utterances can
be misinterpreted by native speakers as a result of phonetic confusions, some
signed utterances can be misinterpreted by native signers for the same reason.
In other words, just as two distinct utterances sometimes sound alike in speech,
two distinct utterances sometimes look alike in sign. Moreover, data from this
study show that perceptual confusions in sign are not randomly distributed;
rather, they are most likely to occur within the categories of movement and
complex morphology.</p>
      <p>The distribution of scores across participant groups along with the effect
of group membership (η2 = .365) show that the task is sensitive to a wide
range of differences in ability. The sensitivity of the task, in turn, follows from
the fact that item difficulty is distributed in a fairly uniform manner, with
similar numbers of items classified at low (greater than 75% correct), moderate
(50–75% correct), and high (less than 50% correct) levels of difficulty. Given
the results presented in Table 3 and Figure 2, it is not surprising that 11 of the
12 most difficult items were members of the movement, complex morphology,
and “Same” categories. Similarly, 9 of the 12 easiest items were members of
the location, orientation, and handshape categories.</p>
      <p>With regard to performance across linguistic categories, the results of this
study indicate the following hierarchy of difficulty: (a) Movement contrasts are
the most difficult; (b) complex morphology and “Same” contrasts are
moderately difficult; (c) handshape and orientation contrasts are relatively easy; and
(d) location contrasts are easiest. These findings are largely consistent with
those of studies using highly proficient and native Deaf signers presented with
signals under normal and degraded viewing conditions. Specifically, movement
contrasts generally have been found to be the most difficult, location contrasts
the easiest, and handshape and orientation contrasts of intermediate difficulty
in studies reported by Tartter and Fischer (1982), Fischer and Tartter (1985),
and Fischer et al. (1999).</p>
      <p>The relative difficulty of movement contrasts is consistent with Brentari’s
(1998) analysis of ASL phonology. In her analysis, Brentari associated the
parameter of movement with perceptual salience/visibility, proposing “the more
proximal the joint articulating the movement is to the midline of the body,
the greater the degree of sonority” (p. 217). In terms of Brentari’s sonority
hierarchy for ASL, the movement contrasts included in this study, for the most
part, are associated with moderate perceptual salience/visibility. Many of these
contrasts involve the wrist joint and have sonority values in the vicinity of 4 on
Brentari’s 6-point scale (also see Emmorey’s, 2002, analysis of movement, and
Hildebrandt &amp; Corina, 2002). Similarly, the difficulty of handshape contrasts
appears generally consistent with findings regarding the role of experience with
ASL in the perception of handshape (Baker, 2003; Emmorey et al., 2003; also
see Morford et al., 2008). The performance of native signers on handshape
contrasts was 92.5% correct; the performance of intermediate learners was 85.9%
correct; and the performance of beginning learners was 68.5% correct. Finally,
the relative ease with which location contrasts are perceived is consistent with
data on the acquisition of ASL as an L1 (Conlin, Mirus, Mauk, &amp; Meier, 2000;
Marentette &amp; Mayberry, 2000).</p>
      <p>Unlike previous research, the present study included morphological
contrasts, and the results indicated that contrasts involving complex morphology
were relatively difficult. Complex morphology is known to pose a challenge
for ASL learners (especially late learners) because the distinctions included
in this domain of ASL grammar are relatively subtle and acquired fairly late
in the acquisition process (Emmorey, 2002; Gee &amp; Goodhart, 1988). Because
complex morphology contrasts generally co-occurred with contrasts in one of
the phonological parameters included in this investigation, the dataset was
examined to compare performance on specific complex morphology contrasts to
performance on items including contrasts in the corresponding phonological
parameter. In particular, performance on items containing contrasts in number
incorporation (69.3% correct) was found to be comparable to performance on
items containing contrasts in handshape (72% correct); performance on items
containing contrasts in verb inflection (39.1% correct) was slightly worse than
performance on items containing contrasts in movement (53%); and
performance on items containing contrasts in directionality (83.9% correct), which
is described in terms of the location parameter in current approaches to ASL
phonology, was slightly better than performance on items containing contrasts
in location (77% correct). This pattern of results suggests that the difficulty of
complex morphology contrasts may tend to reflect the difficulty of recognizing
a contrast in the associated phonological parameter.4 In this regard, the results
indicate that the subcategory of directionality within complex morphology
tends to be comparatively easy (as is the case with location contrasts); the
subcategory of number incorporation tends to be of intermediate difficulty (as
is the case with handshape contrasts); and the subcategory of verb inflection
tends to be most difficult (as is the case with movement contrasts). However,
it also must be mentioned that performance on the category of noun classifier
usage was quite poor (less than 35% correct), suggesting that other factors
influence the difficulty of complex morphology contrasts in addition to the
inherent difficulty of the associated phonological parameter.</p>
      <p>The present study also included a category without any contrasting
linguistic information. Data indicate that “Same” items were approximately equal in
difficulty to complex morphology contrasts. The relative difficulty of “Same”
items in this study is surprising given the fact that “Same” items have proven to
be exceptionally easy in previous research using a similar discrimination task
with speech stimuli (Bochner et al. 1997, 2003) as well as in numerous other
studies using same-different judgments in perceptual comparisons (Bochner,
Garrison, &amp; Palmer, 1992; Farell, 1985). Careful inspection of the data,
however, indicates that the performance of the native signers is consistent with
expectations based on previous research using discrimination tasks. The native
signers’ responses to “Same” items were correct 90% of the time,
demonstrating that these items were very easy for them. Therefore, the surprisingly poor
performance on “Same” items in this study may be attributed to the fact that
the participant sample was comprised primarily of language learners, especially
beginners, whose experience with ASL was very limited.</p>
      <p>It is likely that learners often attend to small subphonemic differences in
sign production and incorrectly perceive utterance tokens that are the same
as being similar (but not identical) to one another. In this regard, Bohn (2002)
pointed out that the perception of phonetic similarity depends on factors such as
the observer’s language background and experience and that similar utterance
tokens (i.e., utterances that are in close proximity to one another in phonetic
space) are more difficult for L2 learners to categorize than dissimilar utterance
tokens (i.e., utterances distal from one another in phonetic space). Therefore, it
is reasonable to conclude that the difficulty of “Same” items in the present study
follows from participants’ background as spoken language users and their lack
of experience with signed languages. As occurs in the acquisition of L2 speech,
learners’ background and experience with the target language influence their
processing of phonetic similarity in the acquisition of a signed language as
an L2.
Practical Implications
The hierarchy of difficulty among linguistic properties of ASL found in this
study has potential application in projects involving the development and use of
communication technology for signed languages. For example, the hierarchy of
difficulty may be used in evaluating the efficacy of information transmission for
sign language communication via video technologies, such as computer video,
video conferencing, and videophones. Specifically, technologies that are best
at transmitting movement information are likely to provide the most effective
media for communication using signed languages.</p>
      <p>The results of this study emphasize the importance of distinguishing
contrastive from noncontrastive differences in the acquisition of signed languages.
Differentiating contrastive from noncontrastive differences in sign formation
presents an especially formidable challenge for learners at beginning levels
of proficiency (Mayberry, 1995). For learners having no prior experience
with signed languages, acquiring the sensorimotor (visual and spatial) and
phonological skills necessary for attaining proficiency is a need that
educational programs must address in a deliberate and systematic manner (Mirus,
Rathmann, &amp; Meier, 2001; Rosen, 2004). Students must learn to detect
contrastive differences and overlook noncontrastive differences in the course of
acquiring linguistic knowledge. Therefore, the development of ASL curricula
and delivery of ASL instruction should strive to facilitate learners’ ability to
identify fundamental linguistic contrasts of the sort addressed in this study and,
in so doing, address the important issue of variation from the perspective of
both allophonic variation and variation across signers. Moreover, approaches to
the assessment of ASL proficiency could benefit from the evaluation of
learners’ ability to discriminate linguistic contrasts. In particular, the discrimination
procedure used in this study appears very promising and should be considered
in the development of a practical receptive measure of ASL ability.
Theoretical Implications
The construct of language transfer plays an important role in the acquisition
of L2 phonology in spoken languages. In contrast, the acquisition of ASL and
other natural sign languages does not involve phonological transfer in
situations in which L1 is a spoken language and L2 is a signed language because of
fundamental differences between signed and spoken languages associated with
the channel of information transmission.5 Such differences are readily
apparent when approached from the perspective of contrastive linguistics. Taking a
contrastive linguistics approach and combining it with Mayberry’s (1995)
findings concerning the relationship of phonological errors to learners’ experience
with ASL (especially in childhood) leads to the prediction that L2 learners of
signed languages, especially adult learners, will face a formidable challenge in
acquiring the phonology of the signed language in situations in which their L1
is a spoken language. Of course, the relative difficulty of ASL phonology is
ultimately a question that must be addressed in empirical studies. At this point,
however, our prediction concerning the difficulty of ASL phonology may be
considered a working hypothesis, and the results of the present investigation
are consistent with this hypothesis.6</p>
      <p>One specific challenge facing learners of signed languages related to the
difference between speech and sign might pertain to the fact that the
production of signs is directly observable, but the production of speech is not. Speech
production occurs largely within the oral cavity, so the articulation of speech
sounds cannot be directly observed. In contrast, the production of signs occurs
outside the body and is fully accessible to observers. This distinction might
have important implications with regard to learners’ processing of variation
and the acquisition of phonetic categories. In particular, Stevens (1972, 1989)
described nonlinearities in the relationship between vocal articulation (input)
and the acoustic signal (output) in terms of a quantal theory of speech. Quantal
theory is associated with nonlinearities in speech pertaining to the fact that
large changes in articulation sometimes have small effects on the acoustic
characteristics of the signal, whereas, conversely, small changes in articulation
sometimes result in large changes in acoustic output. In short, the quantal
theory of speech is based largely on the fact that “articulatory movements are not
equal in their acoustic consequences” (Kent, 1997, p. 412) as well as on data
indicating similar nonlinearities in auditory-acoustic relations. Importantly, the
nonlinear relationship between articulation and the acoustic signal
accommodates variation in vocal tract configurations and works synergistically with
auditory perception so that speech sounds with certain well-defined acoustic
attributes are perceived categorically. It also has been suggested from a
developmental and evolutionary perspective that the tendency for nonlinear (quantal)
relations among “acoustic, auditory and articulatory parameters is a principal
factor shaping the inventory of acoustic and articulatory attributes that are used
to signal distinctions in language” (Stevens, 1989, p. 3).</p>
      <p>Because the production of signs is directly observable, the relationship
between the articulation of signs and the manual signal is completely linear
because the articulation of signs is the signal. The linear relationship between
articulation and the signal may have specific consequences for signed
languages with regard to phonological variation and the development of phonetic
categories. If a nonlinear relationship accommodates variation in speech, it
may be assumed that a linear relationship would have the opposite effect in
sign, providing relatively limited tolerance for variation. This is a provocative
assumption, but it is clearly speculative and greatly oversimplified because
variation is abundant in ASL and other signed languages. An important area
for future research, therefore, is to describe variation in signed languages and
its impact on their acquisition from the perspectives of both production and
perception. In this regard, it is likely that a highly detailed phonetic
transcription system for signed languages recently developed by Johnson (2008) can
facilitate such research (Chen Pichler, 2009).</p>
      <p>Languages associate linguistic signals with meaning through a set of
principles or rules described by a grammar. Acoustic signals are associated with
meaning in the case of spoken languages, and visual-manual signals are
associated with meaning in the case of signed languages. In either case, users,
especially learners, must determine when changes in the linguistic signal
correspond to changes in meaning; that is, they must be able to discern when a
difference is really different. Accordingly, the use and acquisition of language
depend crucially on individuals’ ability to effectively distinguish contrastive
from noncontrastive differences. The results of the present study strongly
emphasize this point. The ability to differentiate contrastive from noncontrastive
differences in ASL, as in any other language, serves as a foundation for
communication and acquisition. As such, the results of this study contribute to
the field of applied linguistics, in general, and have special relevance for the
acquisition of signed languages, in particular.</p>
