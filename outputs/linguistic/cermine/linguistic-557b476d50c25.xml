      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The article shows how a bound morpheme, the enclitic -gi/-ki in Estonian, functions in the
domain of interpersonal relations and mutual knowledge calibration in conversation.</p>
      <p>Speakers use the enclitic with verbs in order to adjust some assumption previously held by
themselves or by their interlocutors. When formulating contributions in talk, participants
always display assumptions about matters at hand as well as about what they believe
other participants know. Furthermore, when accomplishing a first action in a sequence,
they display an assumption that the next speaker will align in her action. All these
assumptions are subject to adjustment by other participants who may present themselves
as more knowledgeable on the subject matter or more entitled to provide opinions about
it. The enclitic is used in reactive turns to indicate better epistemic access and higher
authority in relation to a prior speaker, which may result in a disaligning action.</p>

      <p>When participating in talk, speakers constantly display assumptions about matters that they talk about. These
assumptions are not always correct and may be adjusted by other participants who present themselves as having more
information or more authority on the matter. In interaction, different human experiences and perspectives are brought
together, expressed in the temporally constrained turns within sequences of action. Implicit and explicit knowledge is
displayed in speaker turns and it is also contested on the turn-by-turn basis. All of this is enabled by grammars that allow
speakers to express various degrees of knowledge and may have developed special formats for carrying out different kinds of
social action.</p>
      <p>Many grammatical formats for expressing knowledge states and sources have already been thoroughly described in the
literature on language. Evidential devices are used for showing the type of access the speaker has to the information,
epistemic markers indicate the degree of speaker certainty. In addition, some grammatical devices are adapted to the task of
conveying more subtle assumptions about the matter at hand. For example, a question in a specific form (positive/negative,
with a tag or not) is heard as conducive of a certain kind of answer, thereby displaying speaker assumptions on what the
answer will be (Sadock and Zwicky, 1985; Ko¨ nig and Siemund, 2007). Thus, even though the authority to answer is rendered
to the recipient of the question, the asker may indicate the degree of her own epistemic certainty. These assumptions and
allusions need not be explicit but occasionally their existence can be proven by the subsequent behavior of other
participants. Speakers can explicitly formulate an understanding of what the recipient of the allusive formulation conveyed

without saying (Schegloff, 1996:181), or articulate a ‘missing’ element of the addressee’s preceding talk (Bolden, 2010),
making public something that was only implicitly present in another participant’s talk. Another example of a similar issue is
that the first person to utter a statement on a subject in a conversation also makes an implicit claim that she has epistemic
rights to the subject. Other participants may publicly confront this covert assumption (Heritage and Raymond, 2005). One
strategy for doing that in English is to repeat the prior speaker’s claim with a stress on the non-reduced copula (Stivers,
2005), another one in Finnish second assessments is to use the clitic -kin, which indicates independent access to the topic
(Hakulinen et al., 2004:808). These are some examples of how linguistic structures can be employed to deal with matters
that were only implicit in a prior turn.</p>
      <p>The current study contributes to this line of research, looking at the grammatical enclitic -gi/-ki in Estonian, which is used
for countering the assumptions expressed by a prior speaker or held previously by the speaker herself. It is a device for the
speaker of a subsequent turn to make salient an epistemic gap between the current and a prior contribution and contest what
was assumed there. Occasionally, this implies that the just-prior action is not responded to in the way the response was
projected, resulting in a disaligning turn. Access to knowledge and authority to express the knowledge are closely
intertwined with opportunities of alignment and affiliation in social interaction (as discussed across many contributions in
the recent volume by Stivers et al. (2011a)). The current paper focuses on the Estonian enclitic in a specific sequential
position: when it is used in turns that are reactive to something that has just happened, either in the conversation or in the
context of talk. This position constitutes a subsection of the overall usage of the enclitic, supposedly representing its most
dialogic facet.</p>
      <p>A clitic is a grammatically independent and phonologically dependent morpheme. A proclitic attaches before the word
and an enclitic after it. An enclitic can only appear with a host, which in the case of gi/-ki is basically any word, including
nouns, verbs, adjectives and postpositions. -gi/-ki lacks prosodic independence, even though it may occasionally carry the
main stress of the utterance. The enclitic is pronounced as a fortis (k) after voiceless sounds and as a lenis (g) after voiced
ones, which shows its phonological dependence. Examples of its application are thus:
oleks ‘would be’ &gt; olekski
oleme ‘we are’ &gt; olemegi</p>
      <p>The grammatical status of -gi/-ki is still being discussed. It has been characterized as an affixal particle (Tauli, 1972:93)
but in the last comprehensive grammar it is interchangeably called an affix, a modal adverb, and a particle (Erelt et al.,
1993:39, 1995:159,164). Its functions have been said to range from focusing to simple connecting, to marking of concessivity
and surprise (Tauli, 1980:213–215; Erelt et al., 1995). In Finnish grammar, which is a close genealogical relative of Estonian,
the corresponding item -kin (-kaan/ka¨a¨n in the negative) has been characterized as expressing speaker expectations,
showing that her expectations were confirmed or contradicted (Hakulinen et al., 2004:807). It has also been suggested in the
literature on Estonian that -gi/-ki has to do with expectations (Erelt et al., 1995:100; Metslang, 2002; Sang, 1983:44–45). In
short, the semantics and pragmatics of the enclitic have seemed quite elusive. The -gi/-ki has also lexicalized with a number
of adverbs, such as ikkagi ‘still’, pealegi ‘in addition to’, and siiski ‘nevertheless’, resulting in morphologically non-transparent
words for present-day speakers.</p>
      <p>Syntactically -gi/-ki is not applied according to the order of the words in the clause. Instead, the pragmatic effect it
achieves depends on which type of word it is attached to (Metslang, 2002). Therefore, it is important to study its functions
separately in different word classes, and the current paper only looks at verbs. At the same time, the scope of -gi/-ki has been
claimed to be the whole sentence, not a single word or phrase (Tauli, 1980:212–215; Erelt et al., 1995:100). The present
study shows that its area of operation is even wider than the sentence, namely, conversational sequence.</p>
      <p>The theoretical aim of the paper is to demonstrate how a bound grammatical element functions across speakers and
turns, dealing with the emergent status of knowledge and rights to knowledge. Pragmatic particles have been shown to
function like that. For example, in Mandarin Chinese the final particles ou and a point out a gap between participants’
knowledge and display expectations about the matter at hand (Wu, 2004). In order to explain the role of the enclitic -gi/-ki, it
needs to be similarly scrutinized in relation to prior talk and, crucially, with regard to what the prior speaker has conveyed
about his/her knowledge state and underlying assumptions. The present paper aims to show that in interactional data the
contradicting or following of expectations can be empirically traced. One speaker says something that reveals her underlying
assumptions, which are explicitly refuted by the next speaker with the help of the enclitic. The function of the enclitic can be
elucidated by taking into account what has happened in the conversation so far and what the current speaker aims to do in
relation to that. This is where the implicit ‘‘expectations’’ are at public display and may be explicitly oriented to by the next
speaker. Thereby the expectations also become empirically available for the researcher and enable a functional analysis of
the enclitic, grounded in participants’ observable actions. The study thus illustrates how intuitive matters can be dealt with
analytically.</p>

      <title>2. The data The data include both telephone calls and face-to-face events. The telephone call corpus consists of 324 calls of two types: telemarketing calls from a daily newspaper and everyday calls between family members, relatives, friends, and colleagues. The corpus includes more than 10 hours of conversation and more than 100,000 words. This has been the primary database</title>
      <p>of the study. Additionally, examples of face-to-face interaction have been used from a video recording of a preparation of a
Christmas dinner (2 hours) and from the publicly available Tartu corpus of Spoken Estonian (http://www.cl.ut.ee/suuline/
Korpus.php), which includes shorter excerpts of talk from a wide variety of situations. The corpus is constantly growing. The
version used for this study included about 300,000 words and 30 hours of talk. About one-third of the data come from
institutional settings but the enclitic does not seem to reflect specifically institutional practices, apart from the bias that it is
often the representative of the institution who displays knowledge and authority on the subject.</p>
      <p>In these two corpora 323 instances of -gi/-ki usage were registered (excluding the lexicalized items). The majority of
these, 226, were attached to verbs, which are in focus here. The very frequent occurrence with verbs supports the choice of
pattern for this study. At least in spoken usage, the enclitic usage with other word classes is much less frequent and
functionally heterogeneous. For example, its use with nouns generally implies addition, ‘too, also’, a function that should be
studied in its own right.</p>
      <p>As the aim of this paper is to reveal the interactional and interpersonal facet of -gi/-ki, the core of the data is constituted by
the dialogic instances where the turn involving a verb + -gi/-ki is an immediate reaction to some action by another
participant or something that has just happened. The reason for this delimitation is that earlier work on more monologic data
has resulted in the above broad accounts of ‘‘expectations’’, which are of course in some sense correct but have nevertheless
relied entirely on researcher intuition and native competence. In contrast, a look at more dialogic cases reveals empirically
how the expectations are publicly displayed, recalibrated and reacted to by participants using grammar in real time. For one
thing, this approach reveals that even in cases that could superficially be interpreted as ‘‘following expectations’’ actually
subtly contradict some aspect of the prior turn. The dialogic restriction leaves us with 111 cases.</p>
      <p>Within this database, there appeared three general patterns, all of which have to do with knowledge or authority
assumptions, either those previously held by the speaker herself or the ones made by another participant.1 In the following, it
will be shown how a piece of bound grammar can be used to mark subtle turn-by-turn shifts in relative knowledge status and
oppose or adjust implicit assumptions in prior talk.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="3">
      <title>3. Invalidating own prior assumption</title>
      <p>Knowing is not necessarily a stable pre-existing state, since access to knowledge may be granted in the course of an
interactive event. Participants’ state of knowledge may change from moment to moment when information is produced by
other participants or discovered in the surround. The speakers may mark the change-of-knowledge-state with turn-initial
particles in subsequent turns (Heritage, 1984) but they may also verbally expand on what exactly the changed state is about.
One grammatical option for doing the expansion in Estonian is to use the verb + -gi/-ki pattern, as it underlines that
something previously held valid by the speaker has turned out to be not so.</p>
      <p>In example (1) Piia is marking a change in her understanding of Anu’s knowledge state, and related to that, her prior
assumption about Anu’s knowledge. Before the excerpt Piia has been telling about her mother receiving a TV-set as a present.
The story comes to the end in lines (1–4) where Piia summarizes that the TV-set was a surprise to the immediate family. This
statement is followed by a generic repair-initiator from Anu, displaying problems with what Piia just said. Anu’s ‘what?’
leads Piia to realize that this fact was news to Anu, as we can see in her subsequent turn that involves a verb + enclitic (line 6).
All the names in the excerpts are pseudonyms.</p>
      <p>The pragmatically adequate translation of -gi/-ki into English implies heavy stress on some element of the clause or some
syntactic focusing pattern. Therefore, the enclitic is often untraceable in the idiomatic English line. Sometimes words such as
indeed and really provide a match.

‘expensive. y’know the relatives (did).0</p>
        <p>‘Oh my god!’</p>
        <p>In the target line (6) Piia first uses the change-of-information-state token aa (Keevallik, 1999) showing that something in
the prior turn was news to her. She then produces a continuation in which the problematic point is spread out in the form of a
candidate understanding of the situation. In the explanatory expansion the verb + -gi/-ki pattern is used. The enclitic in
particular marks that Piia previously held a different position on the matter, namely that she was not aware that the
information in lines (1–2) was new to Anu. In fact, Piia has used the particle ju (line 1) which shows that the speaker assumes
common epistemic ground among the participants (Erelt et al., 1993:100). Piia has thus explicitly expressed her assumption
that Piia and Anu already share the information about the TV-set not being an option for the present. In line 8 Piia launches
into an explanation: the relatives had at some point considered a TV-set too expensive (lines 8–10). She then retells the story
in a different way, relying on a renewed set of knowledge assumptions.</p>
        <p>The readjustment of Piia’s knowledge state in line (6) also serves as an account for why the story was told in the way it
was in the first place. In her turn, Piia thus takes care of the social issue of recipient design while explicitly marking her
newly achieved access to a piece of knowledge. The turn-initial change-of-state token aa marks a generic realization, the
following clause involving verb + enclitic makes explicit the mismatch between the speaker’s prior assumption on Anu’s
knowledge state and her current adjusted state. Since the enclitic is embedded within a clause, it enables a more specific
targeting of the adjustment than the generic change-of-state token does. In this particular excerpt, Piia even mentions
knowledge in the clause, which does not have to be the case. At the same time, formatting the knowledge state
adjustment as a question, as happens in the excerpt, is a recurrent pattern. The speaker expresses that she is
reconsidering her prior assumptions in the light of what just happened and asks for confirmation of her new
understanding. In the following example (2), the pattern is basically the same as in (1) but knowledge is not explicitly
mentioned in the enclitic clause. A course-mate informs another one that she is not ready with her work. The recipient
draws a conclusion based on that.

        <p>here NEG:be:GI nothing left November
‘Oh, there is not much left. November -’
‘November and December.0</p>
        <p>Again, the turn-initial particle ahhaa (a variant of aa, Keevallik, 1999) in line (6) marks a change of information state and
the expansion specifies in what respect the current speaker has to adjust her assumptions. The enclitic is used in a clause
showing that Tiia previously believed that Mari had been to school. The turn-expansion constitutes a candidate
understanding based on Mari’s prior turn and Mari has to confirm it. The expansion of the turn thus elicits a confirmation of
something indexed as news for Tiia. This very mechanism has also been described for the final particle ou in Mandarin
Chinese (Wu, 2004:51–63), which illustrates the common social-epistemic underpinnings of divergent linguistic elements
(enclitic, particle) in geographically and genetically disparate languages.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the above examples, the change from a prior assumption to a new understanding need not be brought about
by mere verbal information. Participants interact in a richly structured social environment where information does not have
to be provided within talk and conversation. In example (3) the speaker notices a fact in her surround and marks her prior
assumptions as changed after that. The example comes from a telemarketing call and in line (1) the client agrees to subscribe
to a paper until the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The client then discovers that there is not much time left till the end of the year. This change in her knowledge state is
verbalized first in the change-of-state token aaah (a lengthened version of aa) and then explained in a verb + enclitic clause.
The enclitic in particular marks the fact that the speaker previously held a different position on the time-span. Importantly,
this is not a conclusion based on prior talk, there has to be another source of information. This shows that -gi/-ki is not
restricted to the social action of formatting candidate understandings on the basis of talk, which could have been a
hypothesis based on examples (1–2). The function of the enclitic may be found within the domain of epistemics regardless of
the type of information source.</p>
        <p>The following excerpt (4) comes from the beginning of a phone call between two sisters who live in different countries.
From the fact that Elle answers the phone at home on her birthday, Kare draws the conclusion that she is not partying. This is
another example of a conclusion is at least not entirely based on talk, as it takes into account the whole context: the exact
date, the time of the day, the location of the phone. The clause involving verb + enclitic expresses that partying was expected
but that the speaker has just changed her prior assumptions. Again, the prior speaker has to confirm this interpretation of her
preoccupations.</p>
        <p>NAME speak:3SG
tere Esko, Kaire olen.</p>
        <p>NAME NAME be:1SG

        <p>study:INF and so
‘No, (.) I have to study a little.0</p>
        <p>As it happens, all the examples so far have demonstrated cases with negative formulations, which is not surprising since
one of the regular functions of the negative is to mark that an expectation is not fulfilled. The enclitic, however, can equally
well appear in a positive clause, which shows that it marks a change in the speaker’s state of knowledge independently of the
polarity. In excerpt (5) from the beginning of a phone call a speaker draws a conclusion based on the circumstances, quite
similarly to the prior excerpt. Esko answers his job phone and Kaire concludes that he is at work, which is apparently
unexpected to the extent that it is mentioned. In line (4) Kaire marks that she has just changed her assumption that the
contrary may have been the case. Indeed, she has called Esko’s office and must have had some information as to his
whereabouts. However, place of the call-taker is not regularly formulated in calls to land lines and if his presence at work was
entirely commonplace, it would not have been worth mentioning at all. With the help of the enclitic Kaire shows that she
now has epistemic access to the information that enables her to produce the statement. The conclusion is formulated in
positive polarity.</p>
        <p>Characteristically, the verb + enclitic pattern is also used in incredulity questions that ask for reconfirmation. The speaker
marks that she has just heard something that made her seriously reconsider what she has held true so far. A formulaic way of
doing that is displayed in (6). The phrase ongi nii va¨ ‘is that so?’ is regularly used in questions accomplishing incredulity.

        <p>The pattern described in examples (1–6) is most likely to have led to the characterization of -gi/-ki as a marker of surprise
(e.g. Tauli, 1980:213–215). When a participant has just been provided access to new and unexpected information, surprise is
easily implied. However, as will be shown with various related patterns below, the regularity of -gi/-ki usage is not to be
found in the individual expression of emotions but in sequences of action. The enclitic is not in itself a marker of surprise. It
expresses contrast with what the speaker or her interlocutor assumed earlier, which can be done with more or less affect.</p>
        <p>The first section of the paper has argued that it is possible to mark a change in the speaker’s state of knowledge by using verb
+ -gi/-ki. In particular, the verb + enclitic pattern indicates that her prior state of knowledge has merely amounted to an
assumption, and the clause involving the enclitic -gi/-ki expresses a more solid fact-based understanding. This illustrates that
participants’ knowledge is not independent from the actual discourse or the evolving conversational events in real time. The
speakers do not merely enter a social event with a set of knowings and expectations that they code in lexicon and grammar but
the knowings and assumptions are continuously adjusted. It was shown above that the enclitic pattern can involve epistemic as
well as other kinds of verbs, that the crucial new information may be obtained from verbal or non-verbal sources, and that the
pattern occurs across both polarities, even though it is more common in negative clauses that already express that the matter is
counter to expectations.</p>
        <p>In contrast with a mere change-of-state token, the verb + -gi/-ki pattern spells out the nature of the change. The speaker’s
internal change-of-state from false assumptions to better knowledge is thereby made public. When it is the interlocutor who
brings about the change-of-state, he has an obligation to confirm or disconfirm the formulation. By making her
change-ofstate public, the speaker can readjust the content of her narration (example 1), display appropriate affect in reaction to bad
news (example 6), or show concern that the other is not having fun (example 4). To mark that I previously held assumptions
that I just adjusted can thus be useful at several levels: to make sense for the interlocutor, to accomplish connectivity in
realtime conversation, and to achieve social ends in relationships.</p>
        <p>One obvious question a rising from the above analysis is how much of the action import of the turns is due to the enclitic.
Even though it occurs in the actions described, this could be a mere coincidence. However, it is impossible to just eliminate
the enclitic from the turns above and retain the action profile of the turn. This is the paradox of the analysis and the reason
why contrastive examples are hard to find. Formulations and conclusions without -gi/-ki such as sa ei ka¨inud koolis ‘you didn’t
go to school’ and sa oled ta¨na to¨o¨l ‘you’re at work today’ do not explicitly mark the speaker’s change-of-knowledge-state, nor
do they formally connect to prior discourse. The enclitic formalizes the link backward in time, its domain is the current turn
plus the immediately prior discourse or context against which the change has taken place. The temporal dimension
of the domain varies in regard to the specific actions. The affected action-span may be somewhat longer when it
concerns an inappropriately recipient-designed story (example 1) and somewhat shorter when it is a result of a noticing
in the physical surround (example 3). In any case, the domain of the enclitic is larger than a single clause, sentence or
turn.</p>
        <p>Based on occurrence regularities and the qualitative analysis, it can be claimed that verb + enclitic is a format used to
express adjustments in the knowledge state in the form of a clause. As could be seen in examples (4–6), the turn-initial
change-of-state token need not be used in the turns involving the verb + enclitic. The enclitic on its own can accomplish
identical action from within the clause, i.e. later in the turn than the change-of-state token does. That in itself is an important
interactional affordance, as it enables marking the news in a syntactically embedded way.</p>

      <title>4. Invalidating interlocutor’s assumption</title>
      <p>In the above, it was shown that the enclitic -gi/-ki is regularly used in clauses that mark the just-accomplished change in
the speaker’s knowledge state, either as a result of an other participant’s action or some contextual matter. In the current
section the same mechanism is shown to function across speakers: one speaker conveys an implicit assumption and another
one counters it, publicly marking the need to adjust the first speaker’s state of knowledge or claimed social-informational
status. This illustrates, among other things, how knowledge emerges in discourse across time and is negotiated among the
participants. As a supplement to earlier studies on evidentiality that look at how speakers code their level of certainty of
knowledge or its source (Chafe and Nichols, 1986; Fox, 2001; Ka¨ rkka¨inen, 2003), the current section demonstrates how a
grammatical device figures in interpersonal negotiations on access to knowledge and authority. Conversation analytic
research in particular has been interested in how speakers manage presuppositions of epistemic access (Stivers et al.,
2011b:10), epistemic stance (Ka¨rkka¨inen, 2003; Wu, 2004) and epistemic primacy. The latter is defined as ‘‘asymmetries in
the depth, specificity or completeness’’ of participants’ knowledge (Stivers et al., 2011b:13). Speakers may have differential
access to a subject, and their access may be of varying depth and specificity, which implies that they also enjoy a different
degree of authority in regard to the matter.</p>
      <p>The section first shows how a participant may subtly challenge the assumptions displayed in a prior turn and display
her superior epistemic access to the subject at hand. Second, a participant may address the prior speaker’s epistemic
rights and authority. The verb + -gi/-ki pattern is used for both of these tasks, as they are closely related: higher authority
often comes with better access to the matter. The examples are arranged to show more of an emphasis on access first,
and more emphasis on authority later. Finally, it will be argued that concerns of authority go beyond epistemic matters
and that the enclitic may be used generally for establishing speaker rights to decide on interactional and interpersonal
matters.</p>
      <sec id="4-1">
        <title>4.1. Targeting epistemic access</title>
        <p>Example (7) shows a simple case of the practice of targeting a knowledge assumption conveyed in a prior turn by
another speaker. It comes from a telemarketing call and in lines (1–4) the telemarketer offers to call back. By asking him
to call in the afternoon the client conveys an implicit assumption that the call can also be made at other times during the
day. In the following turn, the telemarketer refutes this assumption by using a clause with verb + enclitic.
ahhaa. (.) ah soo. .h a
‘Oh. (.) right. maybe I could’
call:COND:1SG you:ADS tomorrow back
‘call you back tomorrow.0</p>
        <p>QUES suit:3SG this you:ALL
‘Does that suit you.0
jah, aga o~htupoole,=
yeah but afternoon
‘Yeah, but in the afternoon,’</p>
        <p>o~htupoole alati. (.)
yeah we work:1PL:GI afternoon always
‘Yeah we always work in the afternoon. (.)’</p>
        <p>In terms of social action, the telemarketer aligns and complies in line (6), as he agrees to call in the evening. However,
he also chooses to set the record right in terms of his work schedule. This clearly concerns the telemarketer’s area of
expertise and knowledge that he has access to. In the continuation after the complying jaa ‘yeah’ he expresses something
that he has authority to know, in contrast to what the prior speaker merely assumed. In this way, the telemarketer’s
turnexpansion is an adjustment from an epistemically strong position. The verb + enclitic format allows the telemarketer to
accomplish the compliance projected in the prior turn while adjusting the assumption displayed there and claiming
firsthand knowledge on the issue. Part of the proof of his better epistemic access is the addition of time notions, ‘always’ and
‘every day’, which are used as evidence of his detailed knowledge of the work schedule.</p>
        <p>Example (8) is a case where the caller to an office does not understand that the person who has answered the phone is the
one she usually talks to. This is expressed in lines (2–4), where it becomes clear that the caller assumes she is not talking to
Viiu Sisask. In her response, VS reverses the caller’s assumption with a clause involving the enclitic. She obviously has access
to her own identity and can thus make such a claim form an epistemically strong and authoritative position.

‘but now it doesn’t matter.0

issand kui tore. @ .h aga a¨a¨lest
Jesus how nice but voice:ELT
‘Jesus that’s nice. but (I)’
ei tundnud a¨ra.
‘didn’t recognize (your) voice.0</p>
        <p>In the turn where the enclitic is used the speaker aligns with the action trajectory projected by the prior speaker, such as
agreeing to call in the evening (example 7) or to become a conversation partner ‘‘whoever’’ (example 8). However, the
speaker simultaneously challenges an assumption conveyed by the prior speaker. The implication is that the prior speaker
was mistaken, which can also be socially awkward, as in the above case when the answerer of the phone is not recognized. In
both excerpts (7–8) the producer of the enclitic reacts to what the prior speaker has just said. The enclitic marks that the
current utterance is reactively tied to the immediately prior talk, it functions as a formal connection between the current and
the prior turn. Thus, the pattern of verb + enclitic among other things constitutes a part of the intersubjective reactive
grammar of Estonian. It is used to formulate reactions to a prior action or event.</p>

these:PRT subscribe:INF</p>
          <p>Syntactically, the clause in focus builds on the question by repeating the verb ‘subscribe’ (comp. lines 2 and 5) and is
therefore hearable as a direct response to it.3 The enclitic reinforces the crucial word ‘afford’ in the response turn, which also
carries the main stress in the clause. This is the reason why -gi/-ki has been characterized as a marker of ‘‘communicative
focus’’ (Erelt et al., 1993:100). It regularly reinforces the item that is prosodically and informationally in focus, as can be seen
in examples (1–5, 7–9). However, the prosodic focus is pragmatically grounded in the interpersonal access to knowings and
their adjustments. In the current example the verb + enclitic is used for refuting the assumption in the question that the
client can afford newspapers, and the verb ‘afford’ is therefore focused. While refuting the assumption, the clause makes
public what is tacitly implied in the question.</p>
          <p>Another disaligning response to a question is shown in example (10). In line (1) a future newspaper subscriber asks how
to mark the promised discount in the subscription form. The telemarketer discards the whole question by saying that there is
nothing that has to be marked, as everything can be arranged on the phone (the continuation of TM’s turn not shown). The
question thus remains unanswered, TM’s response is disaligning, prohibiting the sequence from proceeding the way it was
projected by the client.</p>
          <p>One type of prior events is questions. Even though a question officially treats the recipient as more knowledgeable, it may
be designed in a way that already displays significant assumptions on the matter asked about. Thus, the answer may be
formatted with the enclitic pattern. For example, in (9) the telemarketer asks whether the potential client’s disinterest in the
paper is due to the subscription of other newspapers. This question is not open to a variety of answers, as it seeks
confirmation for a very specific hypothesis. A positive jah ‘yeah’-final question is strongly conducive of a positive answer. The
client, however, responds negatively and provides an account that includes the verb + enclitic format.

‘And how should I mark that.0

        </sec>
        <sec id="4-1-2">
          <title>3 The clause also constitutes a summary of the three-part list: the client is alone, retired and disabled. The enclitic is regularly used in summarizing</title>
          <p>clauses of stories but these more monologic instances will have to wait for a separate analysis.</p>
          <p>The telemarketer’s turn includes the verb + enclitic pattern and reveals that the main presupposition of the question –
that a form has to be filled out – does not hold. The telemarketer thereby demonstrates her better access to the information,
which of course follows from her participant role in this interactional event. As a representative of the institution, she can
claim the right and authority to adjust false assumptions by the client.</p>
          <p>The epistemic assumption-orientation of the enclitic thus becomes clear across a variety of sequences, such as sequences
initiated by directives, informings and questions. Next speakers may either align or disalign. In examples (7–8) the responses
involving enclitics promote the course of action projected by the prior speaker. The verb + -gi/-ki pattern can thus be used in
turns that comply with the action but nevertheless deal with the distribution of knowledge between the participants. It is a
device of establishing the current speaker’s access to and authority on the information previously assumed by the prior
speaker. This may result in a quite innocent and reassuring action, as in the case of wrongly assumed work hours in example
(7) but it may also constitute a socially problematic correction of facts, as in example (8). In disalignments (excerpts 9–10),
the verb + -gi/-ki pattern similarly shows that the epistemic grounding of the prior turn was inadequate, and the inadequacy
is formulated as the reason for not doing the projected action. The enclitic enhances the pragmatic focus of the clause while
dealing with interpersonal matters across turns. The verb + enclitic pattern accomplishes a specific social task and the
clauses are not replaceable by, for example, a clause without the enclitic. The latter would have a different pragmatic focus,
which would not necessarily deal with the knowledge aspect.</p>

      </sec>
      <sec id="4-2">
        <title>4.2. Targeting authority</title>
        <p>In some instances of -gi/-ki usage, matters of authority rather than access to knowledge seem to be the primary concern
for the speaker. Interactants may have similar access but still be concerned with who possesses the rights and authority to
the knowledge. A speaker may challenge the authority of the producer of a piece of information and establish her own rights
to this particular information in the next turn (Stivers, 2005). As part of revising what the prior speaker said or implied the
current speaker may display herself as more knowledgeable on the issue and with superior rights to the knowledge. This is
illustrated in example (11) where the speakers are talking about Ene’s sister who has recently moved to Holland.4 Upon
hearing about her move, Kaido speculates that the sister will get involved with a Dutch guy (line 2). This is formulated as a
prediction, something that might happen in the future. The speaker also downgrades his epistemic certainty with the
particle ega (Keevallik, 2009:150–155). Ene refutes his assumption that this is a mere hypothetical prediction by claiming
that this is indeed what will happen.5

‘See, what did I say.0</p>
          <p>Ene formulates her turn in line (3) as a statement that is not epistemically downgraded. On the one hand she aligns and
confirms Kaido’s prediction, but on the other she asserts her epistemic primacy regarding the knowledge domain, her sister’s
life. First of all, Ene reuses the verb from Kaido’s turn to accomplish the confirmation, instead of simply using a confirmative
particle. That already establishes the relative independence of the statement from the prior, as compared to a particle whose
whole sense would have been essentially dependent on the prior turn. A verb repeat is generally an option of a response to yes/
no questions and other first pair parts in Estonian (Keevallik, 2010) but in this context a verb repeat could not have been used on
its own. The enclitic makes the response grammatical. It also functions as a reinforcement of the response, accomplishing an
even more independent establishment of the facts and underlining speaker authority. Ene is indeed the only one in this
conversation who is in the position to confirm her sister’s dating status, as Kaido and Ene have not been in contact for several
years and neither have Kaido and Ene’s sister.6 Ene has better epistemic access to her sister’s life and can appeal to the socially
grounded authority for her claim. The use of the grammatical pattern of verb + -gi/-ki is thus closely intertwined with social
matters of who knows what with how much authority in comparison with another participant. What is a mere prediction for a
participant with no access to, or authority on, the matter may be authoritatively established as a fact by an entitled participant.</p>
          <p>Extract (12) presents a case where epistemic authority, and not access, is clearly the main issue. The topic of the talk is the
preparation of a Christmas steak. In line (3) Hele expresses concern about the time the roasting is going to take. Confirming the
roasting time in line (4), Kert simultaneously establishes his authority on the topic of steak preparation. He uses two verb
+ enclitic forms to reinforce his epistemic primacy, claiming deeper and more accurate knowledge as compared to the prior
speaker. He is also the one physically handling the piece of meat during the excerpt, actually taking responsibility for its
preparation.

          <p>The turn in lines (4–5) refutes the assumption displayed in the prior turn that a long preparation time should be avoided,
even though Kert agrees on the factual matter that the steak in its current size will take time. The enclitic-enforced
confirmation thus accomplishes the social aim of claiming expertise and establishing the current speaker as more of an
authority than the producer of the initial statement. Kert’s second clause ‘it has to’ further underlines his authoritative
stance. Even this clause contains the verb + enclitic pattern. Cases such as this illustrate how the meaning of a grammatical
pattern arises within the sequential contingencies of speaker turns, rather than being an expression of some pre-existing
expectation on how things are. Kert here addresses an issue implied in Hele’s turn and displays an independent and different
stance to it, a task that is suitably carried out by the verb + enclitic pattern.</p>
          <p>Relatedly, it has been argued that the Finnish corresponding enclitic -kin(-kaan/ka¨a¨n) in responsive position (in
assessment sequences) displays that the speaker has independent access to the topic at hand, even though she agrees
(Hakulinen et al., 2004:808). Verb + enclitic pattern is thus used in the two related languages, Estonian and Finnish, to claim</p>

authority of knowledge about a matter in the first hand expressed by another speaker. Along similar lines, Heritage and
Raymond (2005) have argued that the linguistic formats of tag-questions and negative interrogatives in English, when used as
second assessments, challenge the prior speaker’s claim of epistemic primacy. Language structures arise from and are adapted
to handling these kinds of interpersonal matters, including the establishment of epistemic ecologies among the participants.
Participants obviously sometimes aim to set the records right when it comes to who is entitled to which piece of knowledge.</p>
          <p>As a means of adjusting assumptions, the verb + enclitic pattern may be used for framing the prior turn as a
misinterpretation of what the current speaker had said previously. Speaker A says something, B reacts, and A then adjusts the
assumption displayed in the reaction. Typically, the verb ‘think’ + -gi/-ki is used for accomplishing this. The speakers in example
(13) are discussing a common visit to the birthday party of a former class-mate. In line (1), Mari states that she will be looking for
a present. Pire argues against this, suggesting that they make the present together. In the subsequent turn, Mari claims to have
meant precisely this – that she will find a common present. She thus aligns with Pire on the matter of a common present but
with the help of verb + enclitic she simultaneously refutes Mari’s assumption that Pire did not mean that already in her first
turn.

‘look for it myself.0</p>
          <p>In order to understand what Mari accomplishes here with the verb + -gi pattern, it is important to look closely at Pire’s
turn in (3–4). Pire initiates it with a negation word, expressing maybe not a blunt disagreement but definitely a turning point
in the sequence. Her response does not align. The turn is furthermore initiated at a moment when Mari has already projected
a continuation of hers, thus cutting into Mari’s talk and not letting her finish. Pire then continues to make a proposal in the
form of a full clause, as if accomplishing a first action in the sequence, which makes relevant a compliance as the next action.
Mari indeed complies immediately, supporting the analysis. Crucially, Pire’s turn does not show any understanding of the
prior turn as having been an offer. She formats her turn as an alternative to what Mari said, as it is possible to hear Mari’s turn
in lines (1–2) as a statement about how she will go about her own present.</p>
          <p>In lines (5–6) Mari re-establishes her authority and authorship. She makes a point out of ensuring that this was indeed her
idea too and that she is not just complying with Pire’s proposal. Here the enclitic is again crucial, as it marks the explicit tie
backwards to the earlier turn, achieving an adjustment of the assumption displayed there. Without the enclitic and the
pragmatic focus on ‘think’ Mari’s turn could sound like a simple offer to find the common present. With the current
formatting, the turn also takes the authoritative stance that a joint present was Mari’s idea from the start. The issue here is
not primarily epistemics, who knows what, but more the ownership of the idea and the proposal. It is obviously important for
speakers to claim primary authorship, even though they align and agree, as happens in this excerpt.</p>
          <p>However, speakers may also challenge others’ assumptions in a more confrontative way, for example, by refusing to do
the next action and thereby undermining the local authority of the prior speaker. Excerpt (14) illustrates that. It starts when a
topic of a prospective rental arrangement is coming to a close. In short, Pille has contacted a renter on behalf of Tiit,
apparently because they believe that girls have a better chance. Tiit has now called to accuse Pille for messing things up with
the contact person (referred to as ‘aunty’) to whom he has just talked to himself. Lines (20–24) can be heard as Pille’s
defensive account. After this rather troublesome sequence where Tiit ends up silent for a considerable time, Pille elicits a new
topic from Tiit in line (27). Tiit’s answer to the question is disaligning, he refuses to take up any topic at all. He thereby refutes
the assumption conveyed in Pille’s question that they would continue to talk about other things.

          <p>Syntactically, both clauses involving the verb + enclitic in lines (28) and (30) build explicitly on Pille’s question by reusing
the lexical item ‘talk’. Reuse of the lexical items and -gi/-ki show that Tiit’s present contribution is a reaction to the question.
Indeed, several examples in the current section (9–12) show this repeating-reactive feature of the pattern. The repetition as well
as the enclitic formally tie the current contribution to an earlier one, in order to undermine some more or less subtle aspect of it.
The contrast with the prior is enhanced by the prosody as well as the enclitic. Example (14) is quite extreme as in lines (28–30)
Tiit completely blocks the action sequence initiated by Pille. He thereby questions her authority to have asked the question in
the first place and to have assumed that she would receive an aligning answer. Tiit’s response leads Pille to ask for an account in
line (33), which shows that she has interpreted it as severely disaligning and therefore accountable. The long pause in line (32)
further supports the analysis that Pille is waiting for Tiit to do something more, which he noticeably refrains from. ‘There is
nothing else to talk about’ is a socially problematic way of discontinuing the conversation, particularly because these two
participants usually chat for half an hour or so in the recordings. In short, Tiit uses the verb + enclitic pattern to accomplish a
disaligning action that challenges Pille’s authority to extract conversation topics from him in the ongoing call.</p>
          <p>To summarize the current section, when a speaker declares another participant’s assumptions invalid, she can deal with it
in two ways: either by aligning in terms of action, or by disaligning with what the prior speaker projected. In extreme cases,
the projected activity may be blocked altogether. The verb + enclitic pattern is one grammatical option for refuting
assumptions while either aligning or disaligning in terms of action. The enclitic functions within the interpersonal sphere,
marking that the current speaker is not going along with (all) the hearable assumptions in the prior turn. The enclitic deals
with interpersonal relations, relative knowledge and relative authority of the participants. It is used in clauses that make
explicit how the prior turn is considered inadequate and which of its assumptions are declared invalid. At a more general
level, the enclitic is a cross-turn tying device, showing that the current turn is done in relation to a prior. In this way, the
enclitic functions within the domain of the conversational sequence, where the speakers reveal their assumptions and
‘‘expectations’’ as the talk evolves. In the dialogic setting studied in this section, the ‘‘expectations’’ are assigned to the prior
speaker, and concern access to knowledge and level of authority. The enclitic -gi/-ki is used to counter either an explicit or
implicit assumption that has been evident in the prior speaker’s talk and to mark the epistemic primacy and authority of the
current speaker on the topic of that talk.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The article looked at the usage of the enclitic -gi/-ki in Estonian, the function of which has been difficult to formalize in
grammatical descriptions. It demonstrated that a subset of usages limited to verb + enclitic pattern in conversational
exchanges can be coherently described as invalidating a prior assumption. The enclitic is used in clauses that refute, correct,
or adjust something that was implied earlier. The limiting of the dataset to the verb-based pattern in reactive turns enabled
us to see a functional regularity that has so far been overshadowed by the general fuzzy picture of the occurrence of the
enclitic in a variety of grammatical positions and, assumedly, functions. The verb + enclitic format ties the current turn to
prior talk, either the speaker’s own or somebody else’s, (re-)establishing authority over the claim and the epistemic primacy
of the current speaker on the matter. The enclitic -gi/-ki is therefore an item whose full description in grammar needs to
incorporate social matters, such as distribution of knowledge among the participants, and their relative authority to make
statements on the topic at hand.</p>
      <p>The enclitic basically states ‘‘I know better than you/before and I am the one entitled to know’’. Thus, it deals with the
issue of access and authority to knowledge (Stivers et al., 2011a), not simply epistemic certainty. The speaker is not in the
first hand characterizing her own stance towards the piece of information being provided, but her supremacy in relation to
the prior speaker or her own prior self. The enclitic marks that the speaker herself used to know/assume falsely or that the
conversation partner knew/assumed falsely, occasionally by claiming knowledge that does not in the first hand belong to
him. The enclitic enables accomplishment of a correction without explicitly telling the other person that he is wrong, thus
being a more subtle social device. The adjustment is embedded within an explanatory clause. The grammatical device is used
for dealing with social selves in relationship to each other: who knows better and who has more authority.</p>
      <p>The proffered account of the meaning of -gi/-ki is more precise than the earlier ones that have generally claimed that the
enclitic is a focusing device and deals with expectations. Expectations are hard to document empirically. The paper showed
that speaker assumptions appear vividly in sequences of talk and action, as is witnessed by next speaker reactions to them.
This is why the sequential method of conversation analysis is especially appropriate for studying patterns that deal with the
‘unsaid’, and the enclitic in particular. Grammatical matters, such as the polarity of the clause do not seem to be of much
relevance when it comes to the functioning of the enclitic. Accordingly, the regularity of function does not occur within the
morphological or syntactic structure of the language alone but can also be found in the interpersonal sphere. Furthermore, it
is not justified to see the enclitic as only focusing the verb within the clause, as it deals with the relationship between the
current and some previous turn. However, the fact that it appears on verbs in these patterns is relevant, as the same function
is not achieved when the enclitic is used with items from other word classes. Future studies could analyze functions of -gi/-ki
with nouns, adjectives, postpositions, etc. in dialogic or monologic settings. This paper showed that the functional domain of
an enclitic can be a sequence of actions. A bound morpheme functions across speaker turns dealing with interpersonal
matters of mutual knowledge and relative authority.</p>
