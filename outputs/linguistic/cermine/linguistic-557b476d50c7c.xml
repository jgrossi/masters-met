      <abstract>
        <p>Language is rife with ambiguity. Do children and adults meet this challenge in similar ways? Recent work suggests that while adults resolve syntactic ambiguities by integrating a variety of cues, children are less sensitive to top-down evidence. We test whether this top-down insensitivity is specific to syntax or a general feature of children's linguistic ambiguity resolution by evaluating whether children rely largely or completely on lexical associations to resolve lexical ambiguities (e.g., the word swing primes the baseball meaning of bat) or additionally integrate top-down global plausibility. Using a picture choice task, we compared 4-year-olds' ability to resolve polysemes and homophones with a Bayesian algorithm reliant purely on lexical associations and found that the algorithm's power to predict children's choices was limited. A 2nd experiment confirmed that children override associations and integrate top-down plausibility. We discuss this with regard to models of psycholinguistic development.</p>

      <p>Human language is rife with ambiguity. Sentences can be
ambiguous between multiple syntactic structures, words can be
ambiguous between multiple meanings or senses, and an acoustic
signal can be ambiguous between multiple words. Nevertheless,
adults manage to resolve the vast majority of linguistic ambiguity
rapidly and accurately.</p>
      <p>Research in psycholinguistics suggests that this accuracy is
achieved through a cognitive architecture in which a wide variety
of information sources, both bottom-up and top-down, are used to
select the best interpretation from the multiple possible alternatives
(see, e.g., Altmann, 1998; Dahan &amp; Magnuson, 2006; MacDonald,
Pearlmutter, &amp; Seidenberg, 1994; Swinney, 1979). For example,
the intended meaning of a noun–verb homophone like duck could
be resolved using information from the same level of
representation, such as priming by a related word (e.g., quack) or through
top-down feedback from its syntactic context (e.g., whether it is
preceded by a definite article).</p>
      <p>Far less is known, however, about how the mechanisms of
ambiguity resolution develop. To what extent does the cognitive
machinery that children use for language comprehension relate to
the machinery used by adults? In fact, recent work suggests that, in
many respects, child and adult language processing are similar.</p>
      <p>Like adults, children process language quickly and incrementally:
They make guesses about plausible interpretations on the basis of
the currently available evidence and do not hold off on interpreting
a sentence until it has finished (Fernald, Zangl, Portillo, &amp;
Marchman, 2008; Snedeker, 2009; Trueswell &amp; Gleitman, 2004;
Trueswell, Sekerina, Hill, &amp; Logrip, 1999). But, in other respects,
children’s ambiguity resolution is very different. In particular,
their coordination of different levels of linguistic representation to
ultimately choose an interpretation is distinctly not adultlike.</p>
      <p>Research on syntactic ambiguity resolution suggests that
although children have little difficulty using bottom-up information
in their decisions, they find the integration of top-down
information considerably more demanding. Evidence for this distinction
comes from children’s ability to resolve ambiguous phrases such
as tickle the frog with the feather. Here, the ambiguity arises over
where to attach the prepositional phrase with the feather, as an
instrument phrase attached to the verb (tickling using the feather)
or as a modifier of the noun (the frog holding the feather).</p>
      <p>Five-year-olds can resolve these ambiguities using bottom-up
cues such as lexical statistics, the frequency with which a verb is
found in a particular syntactic structure. Because a prepositional
phrase subsequent to the verb tickle most frequently describes an
instrument, children tend to attach all ambiguous prepositional
phrases following tickle as instruments, whereas for verbs that
typically do not take an instrument phrase (e.g., choose the frog
with the feather), children take the phrase to modify the frog (Kidd
&amp; Bavin, 2005; Snedeker &amp; Trueswell, 2004; Trueswell et al.,
1999). This bottom-up facility extends to additional cues, such as
the prosodic rhythm and stress in a sentence (Snedeker &amp; Yuan,
2008).</p>
      <p>However, children’s use of top-down information is very
different. For instance, adults will quickly account for a cue called
referential context. If tickle the frog with the feather is uttered in
front of two frogs, one holding a feather and one empty-handed,
adults immediately make the inference that the prepositional
phrase modifies the noun to disambiguate which of the two frogs
is being referred to. In contrast, 5-year-old children fail to make
this inference and rely on lexical statistics. It is only by around 7
years of age that children appear to use a top-down cue like
referential context (Snedeker &amp; Trueswell, 2004; Trueswell et al.,
1999).</p>
      <p>Building on this, Kidd and Bavin (2005) demonstrated that
children 3 years 8 months old pay little attention to another
top-down cue, global plausibility. Consider the phrase chop the
tree with the leaves. Even though chop typically takes an
instrument phrase, adults generally attach the prepositional phrase as a
modifier of the noun, because leaves are implausible instruments.
By contrast, their participants treated the phrase as an instrument
60% of the time; that is, they implausibly took it as an instruction
to chop the tree using some leaves (see also Snedeker, Worek, &amp;
Shafto, 2009). Finally, Hurewitz, Brown-Schmidt, Thorpe,
Gleitman, and Trueswell (2000) demonstrated that when 4.5-year-olds
heard a question that (for adults) should promote modifier
interpretations for subsequent ambiguities (e.g., Which frog went to
Mrs. Squid’s house?), it did not in fact do so.</p>
      <p>What might cause this disparity in children’s use of bottom-up
and top-down cues? Snedeker and Yuan (2008) discussed two
possible interpretations. First, they suggested a bottom-up
hypothesis, in which young children’s sentence processing shows a
blanket insensitivity to top-down information. This could arise if
top-down processing is too computationally arduous for children
to deploy quickly and accurately or if children do not know how to
correctly align levels of representation.</p>
      <p>Second, Snedeker and Yuan (2008) discussed an informativity
account originally suggested by Trueswell and colleagues
(Snedeker &amp; Trueswell, 2004; Snedeker &amp; Yuan, 2008; Trueswell &amp;
Gleitman, 2007; Trueswell et al., 1999), who proposed that
children can potentially integrate a variety of information sources but
that they instead choose to base their decisions on a smaller set of
highly frequent and reliable cues. Under this informativity
account, lexical statistics are used early because they are invariably
present, they are informative, and they can be calculated via a
relatively simple tabulation of frequencies. By contrast, referential
context appears to be rare and less reliable (Trueswell &amp; Gleitman,
2004), and so children rely on it less heavily than adults might.</p>
      <p>At first glance, the viability of the bottom-up account might
appear to be challenged by evidence that children can use
topdown information when they are learning about the structure of
their language rather than processing it. Even 6-month-olds can
use top-down lexical information to discover boundaries between
words in fluent speech (Bortfeld, Morgan, Golinkoff, &amp; Rathbun,
2005), and there are many demonstrations that children can use
higher level syntactic information to guide their hypotheses in
word learning (Naigles, 1996). However, it is not obvious that the
cognitive architectures underlying language acquisition and
processing are identical. In fact, differences in the tasks involved give
reason to believe that the two differ in a number of ways. During
processing, children must select from a small number of known
alternative interpretations, but during acquisition they have to
create these interpretations themselves. This act of creation will
most likely take place slowly and rely on top-down information
out of necessity (for instance, in learning the meaning of a word,
the arbitrary relationship between a word’s form and its meaning
ensures that bottom-up information is not particularly
informative). By contrast, language processing requires children to make a
series of quick decisions, for which bottom-up information will be
a useful guide.</p>
      <p>In sum, evidence from language acquisition does not indubitably
constrain theories of language processing development. The
critical issue for both the informativity and the bottom-up accounts is
not whether children are blind to top-down information in toto but
why they seem to have particular difficulty integrating top-down
information when resolving known linguistic ambiguities. The two
proposals ascribe quite different reasons for why children’s
language processing architecture may differ from adults’ and
therefore make different predictions about ambiguity resolution in other
linguistic domains. The bottom-up hypothesis predicts that
topdown integration is generally difficult, and so children should
ignore top-down information when resolving any type of linguistic
ambiguity. By contrast, the informativity account predicts that
those top-down cues that are not used for syntactic ambiguity
resolution might still be integrated for other types of linguistic
ambiguity.</p>

    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>Ambiguity Resolution</title>
      <p>One area where top-down processing might prove more relevant
is the resolution of lexical ambiguity. Most words are ambiguous.
This is most obviously seen with homophones (like knight, bat, or
bark), where two meanings are completely unrelated but share a
phonological form (e.g., as a result of contact between two
languages). But comprehension also requires facing the subtler
challenges of polysemes, words that are ambiguous between multiple
senses that are related (e.g., lined or academic paper, roasted or
angry chicken, or birthday or playing card). For instance, a
birthday card and a playing card are different things, but it does not
seem to be an accident that they share a name (i.e., because they
are made of the same material). The ambiguity in polysemy is not
only subtler than in homophony, it is also more common: Most
frequent words are polysemous, many of them highly so (e.g., the
Oxford English Dictionary lists 30 different senses for the word
line).1</p>
      <p>Recent work suggests children are relatively flexible in
assigning senses to words from an early age. By 4 years, they can switch
between mass and count senses of nouns (some paper vs. some
papers; Barner &amp; Snedeker, 2005), extend words to novel lexical
categories (e.g., can you lipstick the trashcan? Bushnell &amp;
Maratsos, 1984; Clark, 1981), and resolve polysemes (Rabagliati,
Marcus, &amp; Pylkka¨nen, 2010; Srinivasan &amp; Snedeker, 2011). They
also have an implicit understanding that homophonous meanings
are more arbitrary than polysemous senses: They assume that
English homophones need not be homophonous when translated
into another language but that polysemes will still be polysemous
(Srinivasan &amp; Snedeker, 2011).</p>
      <p>Figure 1 illustrates two ways in which ambiguous words could
be resolved, one relying on information from within the lexical
level and one relying on top-down information based on the
plausibility of different interpretations. The lexical-level route</p>
      <sec id="2-1">
        <title>1 The prescriptive method for distinguishing between homophones and</title>
        <p>polysemes is consulting a dictionary. Homophones are listed as separate
entries, whereas polysemous senses are listed within an entry.
shows how children might be able to resolve such ambiguities
without resorting to top-down information. In particular, they
could use associations between different lexical items: Spreading
activation between the other words in a sentence or phrase (which
we call the context words) and the critical meanings or senses of
the ambiguous word might result in increased activation of the
correct sense or meaning (e.g., the word swing might prime the
baseball meaning of bat). In addition, children could track
cooccurrences between context words and meanings or senses and
use that information (which will be correlated with priming) for
disambiguation, in a manner that is similar to their tracking of
co-occurrences between syllables (Saffran, Aslin, &amp; Newport,
1996), words (Bannard &amp; Matthews, 2008), and words and
syntactic structures (Snedeker &amp; Trueswell, 2004). Children’s
sensitivity to semantic priming (Petrey, 1977) and co-occurrence
statistics (Saffran et al., 1996) suggests that neither task should be
beyond them.</p>
        <p>But there is reason to suspect that lexical associations may not
be sufficient for accurate lexical ambiguity resolution.
Discrimination based on lexical associations will only work well when the
two meanings or senses of a word usually occur with different
context words. This will happen if the ambiguous meanings or
senses are very different, as with bat (Miller &amp; Charles, 1991). But
because most ambiguous words are polysemous, they have similar
or related senses (e.g., the word line has a queue sense and an
elongated-mark-on-a-page sense), and so they occur with similar
context words (e.g., the phrase the long line is globally
ambiguous). As a result, attending solely to lexical associations will often
lead to difficulty determining the correct sense. To accurately
resolve these senses, children need the ability to construct the
potential interpretations of each sentence and determine which is
more plausible. This is the second, top-down path shown in
Figure 1.</p>
        <p>The role of context in children’s word recognition and
processing has been quite heavily investigated, although this work has
focused on the processing skills of older children learning to read
rather than the processing skills of younger children learning to
parse spoken sentences (Simpson &amp; Foster, 1986; Simpson,
Lorsbach, &amp; Whitehouse, 1983; Stanovich, 1980; Stanovich,
Nathan, West, &amp; Vala-Rossi, 1985). Within this literature, studies
focusing on lexical ambiguity have tended to find that young
readers are relatively insensitive to context (e.g., Simpson &amp;
Foster, 1986). For instance, Booth, Harasaki, and Burman (2006)
used a priming task in which children read aloud sentences that
biased a sentence-ending homophone toward one of its meanings
and then read aloud a target word that was related to one of those
meanings. For 9- and 10-year-olds, reading time for the target was
unaffected by the prior context, and only 12-year-old children
showed evidence that they could integrate context during lexical
ambiguity resolution. But this insensitivity to context is most likely
due to reading difficulties, not language processing difficulties. As
evidence for this, Khanna and Boland (2010) had 7- to 10-year-old
children listen to (rather than read) a prime and then read a target
out loud. When the primes were two-word phrases containing
ambiguous words (e.g., laser tag), the reaction times of every age
group varied on the basis of whether the target was related to the
selected meaning.</p>
        <p>This suggests that, during spoken language processing,
7-yearold children can use context to resolve ambiguous words, although
whether they use lexical associations or additionally integrate
top-down plausibility is not clear. The informativity account
provides a reason for thinking that children should be able to use
top-down cues. As discussed above, lexical association cues are
likely to be an unreliable guide for processing polysemous words,
and so the informativity account predicts that children should turn
to top-down information. Consistent with the necessity of
topdown processing, there is some evidence that children are better
prepared to use top-down information in resolving lexical
ambiguities than syntactic ambiguities.</p>
        <p>For example, Rabagliati et al. (2010) argued that children will
sometimes assign senses to words that adults consider unlicensed,
for example, assigning a disk sense to the word movie. They
demonstrated that 4- to 6-year-olds sometimes accept questions
like Could a movie be round? and then explain their acceptance in
terms of a shifted sense (e.g., a movie could be round because it is
on a DVD). Children presumably cannot use lexical associations or
priming to assign senses that they have not previously heard.</p>
        <p>Therefore, Rabagliati et al. proposed that children use a process of
situational fit to assign senses by building a representation of each
potential interpretation of a phrase and using the most plausible
interpretation to assign a word sense in a top-down down fashion
(similar to what is seen in Figure 1).</p>
        <p>However, the results of Rabagliati et al. (2010) are not
conclusive as to whether children use situational fit (and therefore
topdown information) in day-to-day sense resolution. First, the sense
assigned was novel, so the task was closer to word learning than
ambiguity resolution. Second, only minimal association
information was available for the children: The dominant sense of the
word (e.g., film for movie) was unassociated with its context (e.g.,
round), and the to-be-shifted sense had never been encountered
before. It may be that children only use top-down cues when other
cues are uninformative.</p>
        <p>This means that children’s use of top-down information in
day-to-day lexical ambiguity resolution is still in question. The
experiments reported here therefore test whether 4-year-old
children’s ability to resolve lexical ambiguities is fully dependent on
cues such as lexical associations, as the bottom-up hypothesis
would predict, or whether they can go beyond this and use
topdown information like global plausibility.</p>
        <p>Distinctions Between Ambiguity Types</p>
        <p>Before we discuss the present experiments, one concern
remains. The recent studies that document children’s apparent
facility in resolving the related senses of polysemous words contrast
with an earlier literature demonstrating children’s difficulty
resolving homophones, whose meanings are unrelated. For example,
Campbell and Macdonald (1983) reported that children’s accuracy
resolving the subordinate (less frequent) meanings of ambiguous
words was less than 20%. Beveridge and Marsh (1991) found
similar results, with only a small improvement under highly
constraining contexts.</p>
        <p>Although surprising at first glance, a distinction between
homophony and polysemy could conceivably be because the two
types of ambiguity have been argued to be represented and
accessed in different ways. In particular, although homophones are
assumed to be two separate meanings that inhibit one another
during lexical access, polysemous words are often argued to have
a single underspecified meaning, elaborated by context (Nunberg,
1979; Rodd, Gaskell, &amp; Marslen-Wilson, 2002). Without
competitive inhibition, it should be easier to access and use less-frequent
senses than (inhibited) less-frequent homophonous meanings, and
this pattern has been found in adult reading time studies (Frazier &amp;
Rayner, 1990; Frisson, 2009). This difference in processing
difficulty could also make polysemes comparatively easier for
children, in which case our current investigation of lexical ambiguity
would need to treat the two types separately.</p>
        <p>At the same time, there are important limitations to earlier work.</p>
        <p>Campbell and Macdonald (1983) used stimuli where the
subordinate meaning was very low frequency (e.g., hair and hare). If
children did not know those meanings, accurately resolving the
homophones would be extremely unlikely. Given this, we cannot
say for sure whether children’s differential ability is due to bona
fide differences in representational format or simply due to more
mundane differences in vocabulary composition. A better test
would be to directly compare the resolution of homophony and
polysemy while controlling for vocabulary knowledge. In the
current study, we do exactly that.</p>
        <p>Current Experiments</p>
        <p>Our first study has two parts. We assessed whether children rely
on lexical associations to resolve lexical ambiguity and also tested
if resolution ability differed depending on whether the ambiguity
was a homophone or polyseme. We used an offline judgment task
in which 4-year-old children listened to short vignettes that served
to disambiguate a target ambiguous word (e.g., Snoopy was
outside. He [chased/swung] a bat, which was big; see Figure 2). They
were then shown a grid of four pictures and were asked to choose
“the picture that goes with the story.” Both the dominant (more
frequent) and subordinate (less frequent) senses of the target were
depicted, alongside semantic distracters for each sense.</p>
        <p>To control for children’s vocabulary knowledge of homophones
and polysemes, we excluded items that participants misidentified
in a vocabulary posttest. To test whether children’s behavior could
be predicted only on the basis of the use of lexical associations, we
compared their performance with a simple Bayesian algorithm
(Gale, Church, &amp; Yarowsky, 1992), which computes the
probability of each sense or meaning of an ambiguous word given the
other context words in the vignette, on the basis of their previous
co-occurrences within the Child Language Data Exchange System
(CHILDES) corpus of child language (MacWhinney, 2000). We
assumed that this measure of co-occurrence statistics also provided
a good proxy for conceptual associations and priming. If children
attend to lexical associations over the global plausibility of a
sentence, their choices should mimic the algorithm.</p>
        <p>In Experiment 2, we used the same task to provide a more direct
test of whether children attend to lexical associations alone or also
integrate global plausibility by pitting the two in competition.</p>
        <p>More specifically, we compared children’s accuracy at resolving
ambiguous words embedded in vignettes where one sense was
both lexically associated and globally plausible, compared with
minimally different vignettes where one sense was lexically
associated but the other was globally plausible.</p>
        <p>Experiment 1</p>
        <p>In Experiment 1, we assessed the role of lexical associations in
children’s lexical ambiguity resolution. To do this, we had children
resolve ambiguous words embedded in vignettes, modeled what
their responses should have been if they only used the lexical
associations, and then compared the two.</p>
        <p>But before assessing the role of associations, we tested whether
children have more difficulty resolving the meanings of
homophones than polysemes. We contrasted homophones with two
types of polysemes, regular and irregular. Regular polysemes
comprise a set of words whose senses fall into predictable patterns.</p>
        <p>For example, English contains (among others) an organism–food
polysemy pattern whereby the names of plants and animals can be
used to refer to the food they produce (noisy or delicious chicken,</p>
        <p>Figure 2. Example stimuli for each condition in Experiment 1. The target word is in italics. Dominant sense
and selecting contexts are in bold type, whereas subordinate sense and context are underlined. Distracter targets
are in plain type.
turkey, etc.). All of our regular polysemy items were drawn from
this pattern. Irregular polysemes are words whose senses are
related but do not exemplify a particular pattern, such as the senses
of letter (capital or love letter). In our analysis, we first checked
whether there was any difference in how children resolve these
ambiguity types and then assessed whether the model accurately
predicted their responses.</p>
        <p>Participants. Thirty-two 4-year-olds (range: 3 years 10
months to 4 years 2 months, M 4 years 0 months, SD 1
month; 16 girls) were tested in a laboratory setting. An additional
nine were excluded for incorrectly answering one of the two
pretest warm-up trials. All spoke English as a first language.</p>
        <p>Children were recruited by telephone from a database of families
in the New York City metropolitan area who had responded to an
earlier advertisement. Not all parents provided their ethnic
background; collapsing those who did in Experiments 1 and 2 (n 26),
our sample was 61% non-Hispanic White, with other children
evenly distributed among other racial/ethnic groups. Middle to
high socioeconomic status was typical.</p>
        <p>Materials. Two factors, sense or meaning selected by the
context (dominant or subordinate) and lexical ambiguity type
(homophone, irregular polyseme, or regular polyseme), were
varied within subjects, and one factor, the position of the
disambiguating information provided by the vignette (current or prior
sentence), was varied between subjects. Current sentence context
was defined as disambiguating information provided by the main
verb of the sentence in which the critical noun occurred as the
direct object (e.g., Snoopy was outside. He [chased/swung] a bat,
which was big). Prior sentence context was defined as
disambiguating information provided by associated nouns and verbs in the
previous sentence (e.g., Snoopy was [reading about animals/
watching sports]. The bat was big).</p>
        <p>The same eight homophones, eight irregular polysemes, and
eight regular polysemes (all from the organism–food pattern
discussed above) were used to construct vignettes in both the current
and prior sentence context conditions (see Figure 2, and see
Appendix A for a full list of the items and contexts). All of our
stimuli were classified as polysemes or homophones by the Oxford
English Dictionary online (http://www.oed.com/; see footnote 1),
except for nail (hardware/finger), which we treated as
homophonous, rather than polysemous, because we reasoned that children
would be very unlikely to perceive the relationship. We used
frequency of use in CHILDES to determine which meaning or
sense was dominant for each ambiguous word (see the Modeling
Procedure section for details). For homophones, the dominant
meaning was used in 80% of cases; for irregular polysemes, the
dominant sense was used in 65% of cases; and for regular
polysemes, the dominant sense was used in 75% of cases.</p>
        <p>We produced current and prior sentence context vignettes for
both dominant and subordinate senses. For each ambiguous word,
we also created a grid of four images that depicted both the
dominant and the subordinate meanings or senses of the
ambiguous word, along with two distracters, which were chosen because
they were semantically similar to each meaning or sense and
should be known by children. Although we did not pretest whether
children knew the distracters, we made sure to choose depictions
of frequently used words: The mean lexical frequency of the
distracters (28,999 based on Hyperspace Analogue to Language
corpus frequency in the English Lexicon Project; Balota et al.,
2007) was 40% higher than the estimated frequency of the
ambiguous word meanings (20,890). Pictures were drawn from a range
of sources, were typically clip art or illustrations, and measured
approximately 20 cm2.</p>
        <p>Procedure. At the start of each trial, the experimenter
introduced children to its protagonist (e.g., “This is a story about</p>
        <p>Snoopy”). The experimenter then showed the protagonist’s picture
and prompted the child to name him or her. The main trial began
when they completed this accurately. Children were then read the
appropriate vignette, with the ambiguous word stressed (“Snoopy
was outside. He chased a bat, which was big”). After the vignette,
the experimenter produced the grid of four images and asked the
child to choose which one “went with” the story.</p>
        <p>Children received 24 test trials, hearing all 24 ambiguous words
but with sense used counterbalanced between children (12
dominant and 12 subordinate per child). Trials were presented in one of
two random orders, and pictures were arranged on the page in one
of two random orders, making eight stimuli lists in total. Prior to
test trials, participants completed two warm-up trials that used
unambiguous target words, and those who answered either of them
incorrectly were excluded.</p>
        <p>After the test trials and a 5- to 10-min break, participants
completed a picture-pointing vocabulary posttest on the 48
meanings tested. Children pointed to the picture that went with the
word, from a selection that did not include the word’s alternative
sense. We excluded trials from the main analysis when participants
did not know the meaning of the tested word (M 4.0 per child,
SD 2.3) and also when participants chose a semantic distracter
(M 2.9 per child, SD 2.4).</p>
        <p>We first tested if children have more difficulty resolving
homophones than polysemes, in case we needed to account for such a
difference in how we modeled their use of lexical associations. For
both current and prior sentence contexts, we analyzed whether
children appropriately changed their choice of sense or meaning
depending on which was selected by the context and whether this
varied across ambiguity types. We did this using mixed-effects
logistic regression models with random intercepts for subjects and
items, which are more appropriate for binary data than analysis of
variance and more robust to missing data. In our regressions,
Outcome 1 was choosing the dominant sense or meaning, and
Outcome 0 was choosing the subordinate sense or meaning.</p>
        <p>For both current and prior sentence contexts, Figure 3 shows the
proportion of time children chose the dominant sense or meaning
(as opposed to the subordinate sense or meaning), split by whether
the context selected for the dominant or subordinate sense or
meaning. As can be seen, when context selected the dominant
sense or meaning, children chose it on a relatively high proportion
of trials across all ambiguity types (mean proportion of dominant
choices, Mdominant, between 0.68 and 0.94). But critically, and
contra Campbell and Macdonald (1983), the 4-year-old children
we studied reliably changed their selection to the subordinate
meaning of a homophone when the context selected it (for current
sentence context, Mdominant 0.25, SD 0.31, B 3.3, SE
0.79, z 4.5, p .01; for prior sentence context, Mdominant 0.44,
SD 0.36, B 2.0, SE 0.95, z 2.2, p .03); with one
exception, this did not differ across the other ambiguity types or
contexts. The sole anomaly was that children switched to the
subordinate sense for the regular polysemes under current sentence
context less often than they did for the homophone condition (for
current sentence context, Mdominant 0.69, SD 0.30, B 2.44,
SE 1.02, z 2.3, p .02). Post hoc norming with adults
indicated that this was because both pictures were considered
relatively appropriate.2

selected split by lexical ambiguity type for (A) current sentence context
and (B) prior sentence context types. Error bars represent 1 standard error
of the mean.</p>
        <p>We additionally analyzed the whole data set in terms of
accuracy rather than sense chosen and, not surprisingly, found that
children were reliably less accurate at choosing the subordinate
meaning or sense when selected under current-sentence context,
compared with the dominant meaning or sense (Mdominant 0.80,
SD 0.17; Msubordinate 0.62, SD 0.18, B 1.18, SE
0.52, z 2.3, p .02), although this effect was only marginal
under prior sentence context (Mdominant 0.77, SD 0.11;
Msubordinate 0.68, SD 0.19, B 0.84, SE 0.53, z 1.60,
p .11). In addition, children were more accurate than chance
across all conditions (all ts 7.0, all ps .01, analyzed using
one-sample t tests against a null mean of 0.25).</p>
        <p>In summary, children were reliably able to resolve ambiguous
words, and this did not depend on whether those words were
homophones or polysemes. Next, we turn to how exactly they</p>

resolved such ambiguities: Were they primarily reliant on lexical
associations, or could they integrate top-down information as well?</p>
        <p>Children’s use of lexical associations: Modeling of
Experiment 1. To predict quantitatively how children should behave if
they only use lexical associations such as priming and
cooccurrences, we appropriated a model from computational
linguistics (Gale et al., 1992). The model uses Bayes’ rule and a corpus
analysis to estimate which sense or meaning an ambiguous word
should take on the basis of (a) the relative frequency of each sense
or meaning and (b) the other words surrounding that ambiguous
word in each vignette and, in particular, how frequently those
words have previously co-occurred with each sense or meaning.
This statistic therefore directly measures co-occurrences and
should also be strongly correlated with the amount of priming
between words (strong primes are likely to co-occur more
frequently than weak primes).</p>
        <p>We used a “bag of words” model, so named because it assumes
that each context word is conditionally independent (an
assumption that greatly simplifies computation but is not entirely
plausible). In short, for an ambiguous word w (e.g., bat) with a sense si
(baseball bat) embedded in a vignette made up of a set of context
words c (e.g., snoopy, was, outside, he, chased, which, fun), the
model estimates the probability of a particular sense given the
context words, pw(si|c). It does this using Bayes’ rule, combining
the prior probability of that sense of the word, pw(si), with the
probability of the vignette’s context words appearing in a sentence
or phrase containing that sense, pw(c|si), and the probability of the
context words appearing in a sentence or phrase containing the
ambiguous word independent of the sense, pw(c):
Because we assume that context words are conditionally
independent, the conditional probability of the context words given a
sense, pw(c|si), is calculated as the product of the probabilities of
each context word given that sense:</p>
        <p>Modeling procedure. We used the maximum likelihood
method to estimate the terms of our model on the basis of
frequencies calculated from the British and American CHILDES
corpora. To calculate the prior probability of each sense/meaning,
pw(si), we extracted every occurrence of the 24 ambiguous words,
then further extracted the first occurrence from each independent
conversation, and finally sense tagged these first uses, up to a
maximum of 75 tags per word (except for homophones with
different spellings, e.g., knight and night, for which we could use
all instances). On average, this resulted in 70 tags per word (SD
13). The items shrimp and herb were excluded from further
analysis as they only occurred 10 and 5 times in the corpora,
respectively.</p>
        <p>Our context words, c, consisted of the open class words,
pronouns and prepositions in our vignettes. To calculate the
probability that a particular context word (e.g., swing) occurred in the
presence of an ambiguous word like bat, we summed
cooccurrences in individual lines of dialogue (up to one
cooccurrence per independent conversation) and divided by the
overall frequency of the word. To calculate the conditional probability
of a context word given a particular sense or meaning of the
ambiguous word, pw(cj|si), we summed co-occurrences of the
context word and that particular sense or meaning and divided by
the overall frequency of the sense or meaning. For example, to
calculate the probability of the word swing given the baseball
meaning of bat, we counted the co-occurrences of swing and bat in
its baseball meaning and divided this by the overall frequency of
the baseball meaning of bat (estimated as the frequency of bat
multiplied by the prior probability of the baseball meaning).3</p>
        <p>Modeling results. To what extent was children’s performance
reflected in the model? The bottom-up hypothesis proposes that
children should pay close attention to lexical associations, in
accord with their dependence on lexical associations for syntactic
ambiguity resolution (Snedeker &amp; Trueswell, 2004). And indeed,
the children tested here had a very similar overall level of accuracy
to the model. For the current sentence contexts, the model’s
percentage correct was 69%, whereas the children’s accuracy was
70%. For the prior sentence contexts, the model’s accuracy was
67%, whereas children’s accuracy was 68%. In addition, the
model, like the children, did better when context selected for the
dominant sense or meaning (for current sentence contexts, model
accuracy 75%, child accuracy 80%; for prior sentence
contexts, model accuracy 72%, child accuracy 78%)4 than when
context selected for the subordinate sense or meaning
(CurrentModel: 64%, Child: 69%; Prior- Model: 61%, Child: 57%). At a
coarse level of detail, therefore, the model provided a reasonable
fit to the children’s data.</p>
        <p>Next, we evaluated if the model still provided a good fit at a
deeper level of analysis, testing whether the two learners—model
and child—made the same mistakes. We performed an item-based
correlation between children’s proportion of correct answers and
the probability that the model assigned to the correct meaning. We
found similar results in both the current and the prior sentence
contexts. In each case, the two patterns of answers were correlated,
reliably so for the current sentence context, r .32, t(42) 2.17,
p .04, and marginally for the prior sentence context, r .29,
t(42) 1.94, p .06 (see Figure 4). The fact that the model had
predictive capability suggests that children do use bottom-up cues.
But this capability was also only moderate and marginal, which
suggests that children might be using other cues in addition,
potentially top-down cues such as global plausibility.</p>
        <p>Experiment 1 provided two main results. First, children resolve
the meanings of ambiguous words quite accurately, and this
accuracy does not seem to depend on whether the ambiguous word is
a polyseme or homophone. Second, children’s accuracy on the
different items was predicted, but only partially, by a Bayesian
model using lexical associations. The model reliably predicted</p>

children’s choices in the current sentence context condition but
was only a marginally reliable guide to children’s choices in the
prior sentence context condition.</p>
        <p>Overall, the rough fit of the model to the data suggests that
children do track and use associations but can also recruit
additional cues for sense or meaning resolution. In particular, children
may use a top-down cue such as global plausibility, which would
be contra the bottom-up hypothesis. To more directly test
children’s ability to use global plausibility, we conducted a second
experiment that pit plausibility against lexical associations. If
children can use top-down plausibility information, they should be
able to override the associations.</p>
        <p>Experiment 2</p>
        <p>Experiment 2 compared 4-year-olds’ ability to correctly resolve
ambiguous words when both lexical associations and plausibility
were consistent in selecting the same sense or meaning and, when
they conflicted, each selecting for a different sense or meaning.
Table 1 displays sample items, in which the lexical associations
between the context and the meanings of knight and night are
extremely similar, but the plausibility of each meaning varies (e.g.,
Consistent: Elmo watched a funny movie about a castle, and a
princess, and a silly dragon. And there was a funny knight.
Inconsistent: Elmo watched a funny movie about a castle, and a
princess, and a silly dragon. That was a funny night). If children
resolve ambiguous words using top-down plausibility, they ought
to assign reliably different senses or meanings across sentence
pairs of this sort. By contrast, if children resolve ambiguous words
using lexical associations, they should assign the same sense or
meaning to both sentences.</p>
        <p>We used the same picture-pointing task as before, with a
mixture of six homophones and irregular polysemes that were
collapsed in our analysis. In addition, we compared children’s
performance with both the association-based algorithm used in
Experiment 1 and adult judgments to confirm our manipulation.
One concern was that the sentences were more complicated than in
Experiment 1, and any difficulty that children had with the task
could result from that. As a control, we therefore included a set of
matched sentences where the target word was unambiguous;
difficulties with the task should be reflected in both conditions.</p>

      <p>Materials. We constructed two minimal pairs of vignettes for
each of six target ambiguous words (three homophones and three
irregular polysemes; see Table 1). We chose items on the basis of
the ease of constructing the vignettes. Lexical associations
between the context words and the target’s senses were
approximately constant and always pointed to the subordinate meaning.
For each pair, the subordinate meaning was not only more
associated but also more plausible in one vignette (e.g., Elmo watched
a funny movie about a castle, and a princess, and a silly dragon.
And there was a funny knight.), whereas in the other vignette, the
association statistics were almost identical, but the dominant
meaning was more plausible (e.g., Elmo watched a funny movie
about a castle, and a princess, and a silly dragon. That was a
funny night.). The control pairs were similar but contained
unambiguous target words. That is, one control item had an associated
meaning (e.g., Big Bird was visiting a castle. He saw both a sword
and a horse with the jester) and one item had an unassociated
meaning (e.g., Big Bird was visiting a castle. He saw both a sword
and a horse during the morning). Control words were frequency
matched to the ambiguous senses (ambiguous mean log
frequency 9.4, SD 1.8; unambiguous mean log frequency
8.9, SD 1.9, t(19) 1.5, ns). We counterbalanced which pair
contained ambiguous targets or unambiguous controls between
participants. Using a Latin square design, each participant received
three items from each condition (ambiguous/control crossed with
associated/unassociated), making four lists of stimuli, each
presented in a different random order. Images were selected in the
same manner as in Experiment 1, and the arrangement of pictures
on the page randomly varied between two different lists, making
eight lists total. Items are listed in Appendix B.</p>
      <p>Procedure. The basic trial structure was equivalent to
Experiment 1. Each child heard six test vignettes (three with a plausible
subordinate meaning and three with a plausible dominant
meaning) and six control vignettes, counterbalanced so that only one
sentence from each pair was used per list. Children also performed
three pretest warm-up trials containing unambiguous targets and
were excluded if they failed any. We again analyzed the data with
mixed-effects logistic regressions including random intercepts for
subjects and items. The small number of items prevented an
analysis of homophony–polysemy differences.</p>
      <p>Adults were tested slightly differently. To derive a more
sensitive measure of the effects of plausibility and association in these
stimuli, we had them rate the acceptability of each picture on a 1–7
scale (the two target pictures only; distracter pictures were not
tested) for both the ambiguous and unambiguous control items. As
our dependent measure, we calculated the rating of the dominant
sense as a proportion of the summed ratings of both senses and
analyzed this using a mixed-effects linear regression with random
subject and item intercepts. Finally, we calculated association
statistics for the algorithm in the same manner as Experiment 1.</p>
      <p>Figure 5 displays the results of Experiment 2. The adults
confirmed our plausibility manipulation. In both the ambiguous and
the unambiguous conditions, when the subordinate sense was both

associated and plausible, subjects gave it a higher rating than the
dominant sense (and so the acceptability ratio was low; Mambiguous
0.21, SD 0.21; Munambiguous .09, SD 0.18). But the ratio score
reliably increased when the dominant sense was more plausible,
even though it was statistically unassociated in the ambiguous
condition (Mambiguous 0.74, SD 0.21, B 0.53, SE 0.04,
t 13.6, p .01; Munambiguous 0.91, SD 0.13, B 0.82,
SE 0.03, t 27.12, p .01). As expected, the algorithm reliably
assigned senses on the basis of associations: It was correct for the
unambiguous controls but chose the statistically associated
meaning for the ambiguous items, not the most plausible.</p>
      <p>Finally, we tested children’s ability to use plausibility and
associations. As can be seen in Figure 5, when the ambiguous subordinate
sense was both associated and plausible, children chose it on a high
proportion of trials (Mdominant 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI)
[0.11, 0.29]). However, when the dominant sense became globally
more plausible, children chose it reliably more often, even though it
was still lexically unassociated (Mdominant 0.39, 95% CI [0.26,
0.52], B 1.27, SE 0.62, z 2.07, p .039). In addition, children
showed a similar pattern to adults on the unambiguous items (B
4.28, SE 0.86, z 4.99, p .01). This indicates that children do
use global plausibility in resolving lexical ambiguities and do not
exclusively rely on lexical associations.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, children did also use associations. They chose the
plausible but unassociated dominant sense at a lower rate (39%)
than they did in Experiment 1 (80%), suggesting that children
resolve lexical ambiguities by integrating both global plausibility
and associations.</p>
      <p>General Discussion</p>
      <p>Adults process language quickly and accurately. In particular,
they rapidly resolve ambiguities by integrating both bottom-up and
top-down cues. How does this expert skill develop? Studies of
syntactic comprehension suggest the possibility that the
development of linguistic ambiguity resolution might be characterized by
a broad dependence on bottom-up cues over top-down
information. To evaluate this, we tested whether that imbalance extends to
children’s resolution of lexical ambiguities and instead found that
even 4-year-old children used a top-down cue like global
plausibility information to resolve word senses. That is not to say that
children did not use bottom-up cues at all. In Experiment 1, the
Bayesian model offered a limited ability to predict children’s
choices, and in Experiment 2, children’s choices were clearly
swayed by the overwhelming association information. But
critically, these results are not consistent with any theory that assumes
children’s linguistic ambiguity resolution has a blanket bottom-up
quality. This suggests that children’s language processing differs
from adults’ by degree, not kind.</p>
      <p>These results are consistent with previous work that assumed
children could resolve senses and meanings on the basis of global
plausibility, such as Rabagliati et al.’s (2010) proposal that
children use situational fit in sense resolution, assigning senses on the
basis of their fit with a partial semantic context. They also fit
within the framework of the informativity account of syntactic
ambiguity resolution (Trueswell &amp; Gleitman, 2004). Trueswell
proposed that children start to apply different cues at different ages
as a result of tracking each cue’s general reliability. As we argued
in the introduction, there are reasons to suspect that although cues
such as lexical statistics are more informative than global
plausibility for syntactic ambiguity resolution, they may be less useful
for lexical ambiguity resolution. This might force children to
assign higher weight to top-down plausibility information to
resolve lexical ambiguities.</p>
      <p>Of course, the informativity account is not the only possible
explanation for the difference between children’s use of top-down
information in syntactic and lexical ambiguity resolution. One
possibility is that skills learned during language acquisition might
transfer to language processing. Lexical ambiguity resolution
resembles the act of word learning quite closely, in that both require
the child to use the surrounding context to select between a set of
candidate meanings. The major difference, of course, is that the set
of candidate meanings is much larger during word learning, but the
structure of the problem seems similar enough that the skills
developed in one could plausibly transfer to the other. Because
many theories of word learning rely on the child being able to
determine the meaning of a novel word on the basis of its syntactic
or semantic context and the scene (Gleitman, 1990; Pinker, 1994),
the use of this sort of plausibility information may well transfer
from word learning to lexical ambiguity resolution. By contrast, it
is not so obvious that plausibility (or referential context) is
particularly important for syntactic development and, as such, the use of
plausibility for syntactic processing may be underdeveloped when
compared with its use for lexical processing.</p>
      <p>What this means, in sum, is that our results cannot be explained
by accounts of children’s language processing that postulate a
blanket top-down insensitivity (e.g., the bottom-up account
described by Snedeker &amp; Yuan, 2008). Rather, they have to be
explained under theories in which children are differentially
sensitive to different types of cues for different types of linguistic
ambiguities. Given that a variety of such theories exist, further
work will be necessary to pare down the members of this set.</p>
      <p>In their use of top-down plausibility, the children tested here
generally behaved in a relatively adult way, but it is still notable
that they had lower accuracy when resolving subordinate senses or
meanings than when resolving dominant senses or meanings in
Experiment 1. This suggests that children have difficulty fully
integrating contextual cues and rely too heavily on each sense or
meaning’s prior probability. To some extent, then, this is
consistent with a weaker version of Campbell and Macdonald’s (1983)
claim that children cannot resolve the subordinate meanings of
homophones, in which subordinate meanings are simply
dispreferred rather than ruled out entirely.</p>
      <p>We see a number of potential explanations for this result. One
possibility is that children may have difficulty retrieving the
subordinate meanings of words from memory. Alternatively, it could
reflect a difficulty modulating the activity of each retrieved
meaning, perhaps because of underdeveloped executive function
abilities. The role of executive function in language-processing
development is currently a topic of intense interest (Choi &amp; Trueswell,
2010; Mazuka, Jincho, &amp; Oishi, 2009; Novick, Trueswell, &amp;
Thompson Schill, 2010). The majority of work in this area has
centered on children’s failure to revise initial parses of temporally
ambiguous sentences that are eventually resolved to a less-frequent
interpretation (as in Trueswell et al., 1999). Novick and colleagues
(Novick et al., 2010; Novick, Trueswell, &amp; Thompson-Schill,
2005) argued that this “kindergarten-path effect” is due to children
lacking the ability to inhibit highly active representations, and they
suggest that children should exhibit similar behaviors for similar
reanalysis tasks, such as resolving an ambiguous word to its
less-frequent meaning. Consistent with this, Khanna and Boland
(2010) showed that 7- to 10-year-old children’s scores on a battery
of executive function tests predict their ability to resolve
ambiguous words. Although not intended to test the role of executive
function, our participants’ greater difficulty resolving less-frequent
meanings or senses is consistent with Novick and colleagues’
proposal. Note, though, that these differences were much smaller
than Trueswell et al.’s (1999) syntactic kindergarten-path effect.
This could be because executive function plays a smaller role in
lexical ambiguity resolution, or it could be because the
disambiguating information in our stimuli always preceded the ambiguity,
minimizing the reanalysis demands.</p>
      <p>Beyond reanalysis, there have also been suggestions (Mazuka et
al., 2009) that children’s executive function difficulties may
explain their failure to integrate top-down constraints. To the best of
our knowledge, there is little direct evidence that executive
function plays a facilitatory role in the use of top-down but not
bottom-up information during sentence processing, and we do not
take our data to be consistent with this proposal. In fact, if
executive function is domain general (which most researchers
assume it to be), it would be very surprising if its
underdevelopment impaired top-down processing in syntactic ambiguity
resolution but not in lexical ambiguity resolution.</p>
      <p>One methodological note concerns the picture selection task
used in both studies. Picture selection is an offline task, which
measures the factors that affect final interpretations of ambiguous
words, rather than the moment-by-moment processes of ambiguity
resolution. Our results suggest that children and adults use similar
information sources in resolving ambiguous words, but it is still
open as to whether the two populations use the same processes to
integrate that information online, and future work will address that
topic. To assess whether different cues are integrated in the same
manner, we would need to use an online measure, like eye
tracking. It could be that all cues are integrated at the earliest moment
they become available (as would be expected under a fully
interactive model of sentence processing development, e.g., the
informativity account), but there are alternatives. In particular,
children’s integration of top-down cues may be delayed until a second
reanalysis stage (cf. two-stage parsing theories, e.g., Frazier,
1987), or our offline task may have provided children with enough
reflection time to use top-down cues in the final moments of their
decision. Our data, therefore, leave open a window of hope for a
modified version of the bottom-up hypothesis. In this version,
children’s initial parsing decisions are governed by bottom-up
information, and top-down cues are integrated later if they are
forced to make explicit decisions. Of course, this account would
still have to explain why our task allowed children to use a
decision stage, whereas the syntactic processing task from
Snedeker and Trueswell (2004) did not. One possibility is that our task
presented the choice in a more explicit way.</p>
      <p>Further work will also be needed to confirm the second main
result of the present study, that children resolve homophones with
the same accuracy as they achieve when they resolve polysemes.
Although we found no gross interpretive differences, it is possible
that more fine-grained online measures may be able to track such
a developmental dissociation. We attribute our divergence from
previous results to the efforts made here to use homophones and
polysemes that children knew rather than low-frequency items.
Although this null result could be taken as support for theories in
which homophony and polysemy are represented and resolved in
the same way (Foraker &amp; Murphy, 2009; Klein &amp; Murphy, 2001;
Murphy, 2007), we caution against immediately leaping to that
conclusion. In particular, we did not test the condition in which
homophones and polysemes have previously diverged in adults,
reanalysis contexts in which the disambiguating region falls after
the critical ambiguous word.</p>
      <p>This research demonstrates that children’s lexical ambiguity
resolution is sensitive to a variety of information sources,
including lexical associations but also top-down global plausibility
information. That is to say, children’s lexical ambiguity resolution
appears similar to adults’, and this is inconsistent with theories
based on syntactic processing that attribute a blanket insensitivity
to top-down information. Instead, this less-categorical pattern of
successes and failures suggests that children’s ambiguity
resolution is dependent on learning the value of individual information
sources and that the value of each information source varies for
different types of linguistic ambiguity. More broadly, our data
present a picture of information-processing development in which
children are minimally constrained in which cues they can learn to
integrate and, in fact, can respond to the nature of the task when
determining the most relevant cues to use.</p>
