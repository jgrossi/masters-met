are often expected to represent genetic populations. In this article, we tested the
hypothesis that the hierarchical classification of languages proposed by J. Greenberg
[(1987) Language in the Americas (Stanford Univ. Press, Stanford, CA)] also
represents the genetic structure of Native North American populations. The genetic
data are mtDNA sequences for 17 populations gleaned from literature sources and
public databases. The hypothesis was rejected. Further analysis showed that departure
of the genetic structure from the linguistic classification was pervasive and not due
to an outlier population or a problematic language group. Therefore, Greenberg's
language groups are at best an imperfect approximation to the genetic structure of
these populations. Moreover, we show that the genetic structure among these Native
North American populations departs significantly from the best-fitting hierarchical
models. Analysis of median joining networks for mtDNA haplotypes provides strong
evidence for gene flow across linguistic boundaries. In principle, the language of a
population can be replaced more rapidly than its genes because language can be
transmitted both vertically from parents to children and horizontally between
unrelated people. However, languages are part of a cultural complex, and there may be
strong pressure to maintain a language in place whereas genes are free to
flow.<component x="51.68" y="399.96" width="247.58" height="230.43" page="1"

often expect that human language groups and gene pools will share a common G
structure (1-4). It is noted that both language and genes are passed from parents to
children, mating tends to be endogamous with respect to linguistic groups, and splits
in linguistic communities usually occur with splits in breeding populations (5, 6).
et al Cavalli-Sforza . (7) have reported that genetic trees of major geographic
populations correlate well with language families. They argue that a process
consisting of population fissions, expansion into new territories, and isolation
between ancestral and descendant groups will produced a tree-like structure common to
both genes and languages. Linguists agree that population fissions and range
expansions play an important role in the generation of linguistic diversity (8-10).
The correlation between patterns of linguistic and genetic variation has been studied
by many researchers in different world regions with mixed positive (11-14) and
negative (15-17) findings. Regional differences in population history are likely to
explain some of the discrepant results. However, it is difficult to draw firm
conclusions because these studies are heterogeneous with respect to the genetic and
population sampling units, definition of linguistic variables, and analytical
methods. Researchers on this topic have identified the need for a method to directly
compare language trees with population genetic trees (1, 3). The potential
correspondence between gene pools and language groups in Native North American
populations is particularly interesting for several reasons. First, the initial
colonization of the Americas involved a population radiation from an effectively
small number of founders into an uninhabited region. Second, it occurred long enough
ago to permit the accumulation of both linguistic and genetic differences, but not so
long ago that the early history would necessarily have been erased by subsequent
events. Third, there was a rich diversity of indigenous languages in North America at
the time of European contact (9, 10, 18, 19). Early investigations of the
correspondence between genetic groups and linguistic groups in Native North Americans
produced equivocal results (5, 6). On the one hand, average genetic distances between
populations in different language families were greater than average genetic
distances between populations within language families. On the other hand, genetic
distances were not significantly correlated with glottochronological distances.
However, the methods and data available 30 years ago had limited power to resolve the
question. This article revisits the question of relationship between genetics and
language in Native North American populations. Comparable mtDNA sequences are now
available for many populations that represent diverse language groups. There are
three advantages to the mtDNA data. First, they have high power to resolve population
affinities. Second, it is easy to identify and remove non-Native American mtDNA
sequences. Third, by contrasting gene and population trees, it is possible to discern
patterns of gene f low. We begin our analyses by formally testing the hypothesis that
a classification of languages proposed by Greenberg (19) represents the structure of
Native North American gene pools. Although the majority of linguists do not endorse
Greenberg's language classification (4, 10, 18, 20, 21), it is important to test this
model because it remains one of the main tenets against which questions about Native
American population genetics and physical anthropology are formulated (3). To preempt
our results, this hypothesis is rejected. Because of this finding, we proceed to ask
two questions. First, is the genetic structure of these populations hierarchical?
Second, is there evidence from mtDNA sequences for exchange across the boundaries of
widely accepted language families? Materials and Methods Sample. We obtained 1,056
mtDNA hypervariable segment (HVS) 1 sequences for 17 Native North American
populations from the literature and public databases. No biological samples were
handled. We included only sequences classified as founding Native American
haplogroups A, B, C, D, or X (references in Table 1). The sequences were aligned and
edited to 341 nucleotides covering the reference nucleotide positions 16024-16364
(22). Table 1 provides each population's sample size, and placement in the Greenberg
language classification (GLC). The terminology used for the language categories in
this table is taken from Ruhlen (23). Fig. 1 presents the placement of these 17
populations within the GLC in tree form. Each of Greenberg's primary<component

the North, have low nucleotide diversities, in the range of nucleotide diversities in

in populations classified as Amerind speaking. The A to G transition at nucleotide
position et al (np) 16265 described by Starikovskaya . (29) appeared in all of the
Eskimo samples, and none of the non-Eskimo samples (including Aleut). The A to G
transitions at nps 16233 and 16331, identified by Torroni et al. (14), were observed
in, and only in, the three Athabascan samples. Several sites were polymorphic only in
populations classified as Amerind-speaking, but none occurred in all populations
attributed to Amerind. Statistical Analyses. A Fig. 1 displays the GLC as a tree.
Fig. 2 A shows the result of fitting this tree to the genetic data. Fig. 2 looks
different from Fig. 1 because the branch lengths vary, and because the estimated
length for many branches is zero. Notably, length zero was estimated for the branches
leading to two of the three principal language families, Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dene.
The likelihood ratio statistic for the GLC model is high relative to its degrees of
freedom, indicating a substantial lack of fit to the genetic data (Table 2). Note
that the poor fit of the GLC does not indicate insufficient information; rather it
shows that the genetic data contradict the structure postulated by the GLC model.
Nevertheless, the GLC fits much better than an island model, which allows for genetic
divergence, but assumes independent evolution, among populations (Table 2). To be
certain that the poor fit of the GLC was not solely the result of one misplaced
population, we repeated the analysis 17 times, each time leaving out a different
sample from the analysis. The<component x="51.68" y="349.93" width="247.57"

exceeded its degrees of freedom in each of these 17 analyses (results not shown). We
conclude that the poor fit of the GLC is systemic and not the result of a single
outlier population. To identify the specific ways that the genetic data and GLC model
depart, we examined the plot of expected vs. realized B genetic distances (Fig. 2 ).
Several patterns that depart from the tree structure are apparent upon close
examination. For example, the GLC expected distances consistently overestimate the
realized genetic distances for several populations, including the Navajo, Aleut, and
Siberian Yupik populations. This relationship means that these populations are
genetically similar to populations with distantly related languages. Similarly, the
GLC tree consistently underestimates the genetic distance between three Eskimo
populations (Central Yupik, Canadian Inuit, and Inupaiq) and all other populations.
Both the Fitch and NJ trees fit the data substantially better than the GLC tree, and
the NJ tree fits better than the Fitch tree (Table 2). This result indicates that the
data are more tree-like than indicated by the GLC tree. Nonetheless, the likelihood
ratio statistics for both the NJ and Fitch trees are high relative to their degrees
of freedom (Table 2). This finding indicates a lack of fit to the genetic data for
even the best-fitting trees. The scatter plot of realized versus expected genetic
distances for the NJ tree (Fig. 3 ) visually confirms the superior fit of the NJ tree
over the GLCB tree. The results are not shown for the Fitch tree because they are
similar to the NJ tree. The lack of fit between the NJ tree and the genetic data is
evident from the fact that there is a consistent trend for the realized genetic
distances to exceed the expected genetic distances. This lop-sided pattern is
difficult to explain and may be an artifact of applying the NJ algorithm to
nontree-like data. A A drawing of the NJ tree (Fig. 3 ) reveals some interesting
patterns. First, none of Greenberg's major language groups (Eskimo-Aleut, Na-Dene, or
Amerind) forms a unique cluster. The most exclusive cluster that contains all
Eskimo-Aleut populations (defined by branch a) also includes all four Na-Denespeaking
populations and the Amerind-speaking Cheyenne, Bella Coola, and Nuu Chah Nulth
populations. The most exclusive cluster with all Na-Dene-speaking populations
(defined by branch b) also includes six Eskimo-Aleut-speaking populations (Siberian
Yupik, Greenland Inuit, Central Yupik, Canadian Inuit, and Inupiaq) and the
Amerind-speaking Bella Coola. The most exclusive cluster with all Amerind-speaking
populations (defined by branch c) includes the Eskimo-Aleutspeaking Aleuts and the
Na-Dene-speaking Navajo. Second, there is a strong North-South geographic pattern to
the clustering pattern. An Arctic-Pacific Northwest cluster that includes all
Aleut-Eskimo populations, all Na-Dene populations, and the Amerind Nuu Chah Nulth and
Bella Coola populations originates on one side of branch a, whereas a more Southern
group includes the Pima, Cherokee, Sioux, and Chippewa Amerindspeaking population
forms to the other side of branch a. The Southwestern Athabascan-speaking
populations, Navajo and Apache, defy the geographic groupings, but this result is
consistent with the archaeological record (30). Anthropologists circa anno Domini
agree that 1400 the ancestors of Navajos and Apaches migrated from the Mackenzie
Basin of Canada to the Southwest region, where they came into contact with
Amerindspeaking populations who had been living there for thousands of years (31).
Fig. 4 shows the distribution of the canonical Native American mtDNA haplogroups in
the 17 populations. The occurrence of haplogroup A differs markedly between the far
Northern and the Southwestern samples. With only few exceptions, mtDNA lineages
observed in the northern Na-Dene classified populations (Haida and Alaskan
Athabascans) belong to haplogroup A (Fig. 4). Haplogroup A is also common in Eskimos
and Aleuts. Outside of the far North, the only samples in which haplogroup A appears
commonly are the Southwestern Athabascanspeaking populations (Navajo and Apache).
mtDNA sequences belonging to haplogroups B and C are frequent primarily in the
Amerind-classified populations (Fig. 4), including the Bella Coola, and Nuu Chah
Nulth populations on the Northwest Coast. The Navajo and Apache are the only
Na-Dene-classified populations with substantial frequencies of B- and C-group
haplotypes, although haplogroup C is observed in the Haida and Alaskan Athabascan
samples. Haplogroup D mtDNA sequences are common in the Eskimo and Aleut populations
and the Bella Coola and Nuu Chah Nulth on the Northwest Coast. In summary, the
distribution of the major mtDNA haplogroups exhibits a strong regional pattern in
these samples. Haplogroups A and D are concentrated in the far North and Northwest
Coast, whereas haplogroups B and C appear regularly on the Northwest Coast and
further South. Recent surveys of Native North American mtDNA confirm the haplogroup
distributions observed for the populations and regions represented here; however,
broader distributions for the A, B, C, and D haplogroups are noted when samples from
other regions are included (32, 33). Discussion In this study, we adopt a rigorous
approach to tree comparisons. a priori First, a language classification is proposed
as an hypothesis for the genetic structure. Next, the language classification is
fitted to the genetic data. And finally, the resulting tree is tested for treeness by
using the method developed by Cavalli-Sforza and Piazza (25). The null hypothesis is
that the pattern of relationships among languages is the same as the pattern of
relationships among gene pools. We applied this approach to linguistic and genetic
data for Native North Americans by fitting Greenberg's linguistic classification (19)
to mitochondrial D-loop nucleotide sequence variations. The hypothesis of treeness
was rejected. Therefore, a significant difference exists between Greenberg's
linguistic classification and the genetic structures of these populations. Trees
produced by the NJ and Fitch algorithms fit the genetic data better than did the
Greenberg tree, but the treeness hypothesis was rejected even for these trees. Thus,
we conclude that the genetic relationships among populations are not treelike. The
lack of treeness in the genetic data makes it unlikely that any hierarchical language
classification will provide a close fit. The fact that not one of Greenberg's three
major language groups (Amerind, Aleut-Eskimo, and Na Dene) formed an exclusive
cluster in the better-fitting genetic trees produced by the NJ and Fitch algorithms
shows that the problems with the GLC are pervasive and not due to a single
problematic language group. One possibility for the disagreement between the genetic
data and the GLC is that the precontact pattern was disrupted by the entry of
Europeans. We wish to emphasize why we do not feel that European contact is a likely
explanation for our results. First, we restricted our analysis to mtDNA sequences
that are established to be present in Native Americans and absent in Europeans.
Second, population bottleneck and or expansion ( events in the postcontact era would
have changed relative branch lengths but would not have destroyed the treeness in the
data. Third, 14 of the 17 populations are situated today in the same localities that
they occupied at the time of first European contact. Fourth, mtDNA from ancient
(precontact) Native American populations look similar to postcontact populations in
the same region (34-36). Another possibility for the disagreement between the genetic
data and the GLC is that the GLC is a poor representation of the relationships among
Native North American languages (4). In fact, most linguists do not accept the GLC
(4, 10, 18, 20, 21). Greenberg's methods have been criticized (21, 37), and it is
felt widely that there is not sufficient information to establish deep linguistic
connections (10). Nevertheless, Greenberg included some undisputed language families
within his classification. These undisputed families include the Eskimo-Aleut family
and the Athabascan language group (10, 38, 39). We therefore find it quite
interesting that the fitted branch to both Eskimo-Aleut and Athabascan was estimated
to have zero length (Fig. 2). This finding suggests that the branch accounts for no
increase in genetic relationship among its descendants. The NJ tree (Fig. 3) shows
that the classifications within Aleut-Eskimo and Na Dene language families disagree
with the population genetic relationships, regardless of whether or not they are
analyzed within the context of the GLC. In fact, the NJ tree conf licts with
generally accepted language groups presented by Campbell (10). Aleuts do not cluster
with Eskimos. Neither the Yupik nor Inuit populations form distinct clusters within
Eskimo. The two Algonquin-speaking populations do not form a cluster. The Navajo and
Apache are separated in the NJ tree by the nonAthabascan-speaking Bella Coola. It is
possible that a stronger relationship between language groups and gene pools would be
found by directly assessing language areas that arise from diffusion of linguistic
traits across phylogenetic boundaries of languages (4, 10). The poor correspondence
between the genetic data and language groups ref lects the current population
structure. Genetic and linguistic variation may have shared the same hierarchical
relationships in the past. In fact, there are several features in the data that can
be interpreted as remnants of such relationships. These features include the
Eskimo-Aleut-specific transition polymorphism (29) and the two Athabascan-specific
transition polymorphisms (14). Interestingly, these results are consistent with a
linguistic model proposed by Nettle (9) that predicts that high diversity of language
stocks is a transitory phase in linguistic evolution. According to Nettle's model,
the entry of humans into a new region such as the Americas affords significant
opportunity for the birth of new languages. Upon entry, population growth will be
rapid and groups will fission and spread at high rate until the region is filled. New
linguistic lineages will be founded, with population splits creating a tree-like
structure. However, the rate of population fission will decline as open niches fill.
Eventually, population dynamics will be governed by competition and efficiency of
resource utilization. In this phase, linguistic diversity will decline as expanding
communities absorb neighbors or as less successful communities fragment and members
disperse. Examination of the median joining networks for the canonical mtDNA
haplogroups and population trees indicates a history of pervasive genetic exchange
across linguistic boundaries. The distribution of mtDNA haplogroups in the Apache and
Navajo presents the clearest example. As shown in Fig. 4, the distribution of the
canonical Native American mtDNA haplogroups differs markedly between the far North
and the Southwest. Notably, mtDNA sequences belonging to haplogroup B are not
observed in the northern Na-Dene-attributed populations, and members of haplogroup C
occur rarely (Fig. 4). By contrast, mtDNA sequences in Southwestern non-Athabascan
speakers are characterized by the predominance of members of haplogroups B and C and
the absence of members of haplogroup A. The haplogroup configuration for
non-Athabascan speakers in the Southwest is exemplified in the present study by the
Pima mtDNA sequences (Fig. 4) and has been established in surveys of haplogroups
determined from diagnostic sites in many other Southwestern populations (33, 40). The
Navajo and Apache possess many haplogroup A sequences typical of Northwestern
populations with languages attributed to the Na Dene language family. However, DNA
sequences belonging to haplogroups B and C are also common in the Navajo and Apache,
and these are most likely due to immigrants from the local non-Athabascanspeaking
populations. The elevated nucleotide diversity in the Navajo and Apache relative to
their northern counterparts is the consequence of these haplogroup B and C mtDNA
sequences. Interestingly, the pattern of genetic exchange is not reciprocal. A-group
haplotypes would have appeared in the Pima sample if they had absorbed a substantial
number of Athabascan-speaking migrants. The pattern of asymmetrical genetic exchanges
is all the more interesting given current mate exchange practices. Today, marriage
practice in both the Western Apache and Navajo is strongly matrilineal. On this
basis, we would not expect to see the inclusion of female lineages introduced from
the surrounding non-Athabascan-speaking populations. However, the practice of
matrilineality in these populations is likely to have begun after the Navajos and
Apaches arrived in the Southwest (31). This practice makes it likely that the
haplogroup B and C mtDNA sequences carried in the Navajo and Apache today were
introduced early in their experience in the Southwest, and before the current
cultural practices were initiated. In addition to the presence of B- and C-group
haplotypes in the Navajo and Apache, other features of the median-joining networks
indicate genetic exchange between linguistically divergent neighboring populations in
the Northwest and Arctic. For example, the Northwest Coast Bella Coola and Nuu Chah
Nulth (attributed to Amerind) share A-group lineages with the Northwest Coast Haida
(attributed to Na Dene), whereas the Eskimos in the far North share A-group lineages
with interior dwelling Alaskan Athabascans. If language replacements predominated
over gene replacements, we would expect good treeness for the genetic data but poor
agreement between genetic and linguistic trees. In opposition to this expectation,
even the best trees for the genetic data display a significant lack of treeness. Many
researchers have noted that either the language or the genes in a population can be
replaced, and examples of both gene and language replacement have been identified (1,
2, 7). There has been a tendency to expect that language replacements will be more
common (3, 41). In principle, language replacement can occur more rapidly than gene
replacement because language can be transmitted both vertically from parents to
children and horizontally between unrelated people, creating bilingual and
multilingual individuals, whereas genes can be transmitted only vertically (1, 42).
However, we found that the constraints imposed by mechanisms of transmission may be
relatively weak as compared with other factors that will inf luence whether genes,
languages, or both will be replaced. Finally, we note that our findings are relevant
to a multiple migration theory for the peopling of the Americas. According to this
hypothesis, the ancestors of modern Amerind, Na-Dene, and Eskimo-Aleut speakers
migrated into the Americas in three independent waves of migration, separated in time
by thousands<component x="314.17" y="62.78" width="247.57" height="416.15" page="3"

are often expected to represent genetic populations. In this article, we tested the
hypothesis that the hierarchical classification of languages proposed by J. Greenberg
[(1987) Language in the Americas (Stanford Univ. Press, Stanford, CA)] also
represents the genetic structure of Native North American populations. The genetic
data are mtDNA sequences for 17 populations gleaned from literature sources and
public databases. The hypothesis was rejected. Further analysis showed that departure
of the genetic structure from the linguistic classification was pervasive and not due
to an outlier population or a problematic language group. Therefore, Greenberg's
language groups are at best an imperfect approximation to the genetic structure of
these populations. Moreover, we show that the genetic structure among these Native
North American populations departs significantly from the best-fitting hierarchical
models. Analysis of median joining networks for mtDNA haplotypes provides strong
evidence for gene flow across linguistic boundaries. In principle, the language of a
population can be replaced more rapidly than its genes because language can be
transmitted both vertically from parents to children and horizontally between
unrelated people. However, languages are part of a cultural complex, and there may be
strong pressure to maintain a language in place whereas genes are free to
flow.<component x="51.68" y="399.96" width="247.58" height="230.43" page="1"

often expect that human language groups and gene pools will share a common G
structure (1-4). It is noted that both language and genes are passed from parents to
children, mating tends to be endogamous with respect to linguistic groups, and splits
in linguistic communities usually occur with splits in breeding populations (5, 6).
et al Cavalli-Sforza . (7) have reported that genetic trees of major geographic
populations correlate well with language families. They argue that a process
consisting of population fissions, expansion into new territories, and isolation
between ancestral and descendant groups will produced a tree-like structure common to
both genes and languages. Linguists agree that population fissions and range
expansions play an important role in the generation of linguistic diversity (8-10).
The correlation between patterns of linguistic and genetic variation has been studied
by many researchers in different world regions with mixed positive (11-14) and
negative (15-17) findings. Regional differences in population history are likely to
explain some of the discrepant results. However, it is difficult to draw firm
conclusions because these studies are heterogeneous with respect to the genetic and
population sampling units, definition of linguistic variables, and analytical
methods. Researchers on this topic have identified the need for a method to directly
compare language trees with population genetic trees (1, 3). The potential
correspondence between gene pools and language groups in Native North American
populations is particularly interesting for several reasons. First, the initial
colonization of the Americas involved a population radiation from an effectively
small number of founders into an uninhabited region. Second, it occurred long enough
ago to permit the accumulation of both linguistic and genetic differences, but not so
long ago that the early history would necessarily have been erased by subsequent
events. Third, there was a rich diversity of indigenous languages in North America at
the time of European contact (9, 10, 18, 19). Early investigations of the
correspondence between genetic groups and linguistic groups in Native North Americans
produced equivocal results (5, 6). On the one hand, average genetic distances between
populations in different language families were greater than average genetic
distances between populations within language families. On the other hand, genetic
distances were not significantly correlated with glottochronological distances.
However, the methods and data available 30 years ago had limited power to resolve the
question. This article revisits the question of relationship between genetics and
language in Native North American populations. Comparable mtDNA sequences are now
available for many populations that represent diverse language groups. There are
three advantages to the mtDNA data. First, they have high power to resolve population
affinities. Second, it is easy to identify and remove non-Native American mtDNA
sequences. Third, by contrasting gene and population trees, it is possible to discern
patterns of gene f low. We begin our analyses by formally testing the hypothesis that
a classification of languages proposed by Greenberg (19) represents the structure of
Native North American gene pools. Although the majority of linguists do not endorse
Greenberg's language classification (4, 10, 18, 20, 21), it is important to test this
model because it remains one of the main tenets against which questions about Native
American population genetics and physical anthropology are formulated (3). To preempt
our results, this hypothesis is rejected. Because of this finding, we proceed to ask
two questions. First, is the genetic structure of these populations hierarchical?
Second, is there evidence from mtDNA sequences for exchange across the boundaries of
widely accepted language families? Materials and Methods Sample. We obtained 1,056
mtDNA hypervariable segment (HVS) 1 sequences for 17 Native North American
populations from the literature and public databases. No biological samples were
handled. We included only sequences classified as founding Native American
haplogroups A, B, C, D, or X (references in Table 1). The sequences were aligned and
edited to 341 nucleotides covering the reference nucleotide positions 16024-16364
(22). Table 1 provides each population's sample size, and placement in the Greenberg
language classification (GLC). The terminology used for the language categories in
this table is taken from Ruhlen (23). Fig. 1 presents the placement of these 17
populations within the GLC in tree form. Each of Greenberg's primary<component

Fig. 2 A shows the result of fitting this tree to the genetic data. Fig. 2 looks
different from Fig. 1 because the branch lengths vary, and because the estimated
length for many branches is zero. Notably, length zero was estimated for the branches
leading to two of the three principal language families, Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dene.
The likelihood ratio statistic for the GLC model is high relative to its degrees of
freedom, indicating a substantial lack of fit to the genetic data (Table 2). Note
that the poor fit of the GLC does not indicate insufficient information; rather it
shows that the genetic data contradict the structure postulated by the GLC model.
Nevertheless, the GLC fits much better than an island model, which allows for genetic
divergence, but assumes independent evolution, among populations (Table 2). To be
certain that the poor fit of the GLC was not solely the result of one misplaced
population, we repeated the analysis 17 times, each time leaving out a different
sample from the analysis. The<component x="51.68" y="349.93" width="247.57"

exceeded its degrees of freedom in each of these 17 analyses (results not shown). We
conclude that the poor fit of the GLC is systemic and not the result of a single
outlier population. To identify the specific ways that the genetic data and GLC model
depart, we examined the plot of expected vs. realized B genetic distances (Fig. 2 ).
Several patterns that depart from the tree structure are apparent upon close
examination. For example, the GLC expected distances consistently overestimate the
realized genetic distances for several populations, including the Navajo, Aleut, and
Siberian Yupik populations. This relationship means that these populations are
genetically similar to populations with distantly related languages. Similarly, the
GLC tree consistently underestimates the genetic distance between three Eskimo
populations (Central Yupik, Canadian Inuit, and Inupaiq) and all other populations.
Both the Fitch and NJ trees fit the data substantially better than the GLC tree, and
the NJ tree fits better than the Fitch tree (Table 2). This result indicates that the
data are more tree-like than indicated by the GLC tree. Nonetheless, the likelihood
ratio statistics for both the NJ and Fitch trees are high relative to their degrees
of freedom (Table 2). This finding indicates a lack of fit to the genetic data for
even the best-fitting trees. The scatter plot of realized versus expected genetic
distances for the NJ tree (Fig. 3 ) visually confirms the superior fit of the NJ tree
over the GLCB tree. The results are not shown for the Fitch tree because they are
similar to the NJ tree. The lack of fit between the NJ tree and the genetic data is
evident from the fact that there is a consistent trend for the realized genetic
distances to exceed the expected genetic distances. This lop-sided pattern is
difficult to explain and may be an artifact of applying the NJ algorithm to
nontree-like data. A A drawing of the NJ tree (Fig. 3 ) reveals some interesting
patterns. First, none of Greenberg's major language groups (Eskimo-Aleut, Na-Dene, or
Amerind) forms a unique cluster. The most exclusive cluster that contains all
Eskimo-Aleut populations (defined by branch a) also includes all four Na-Denespeaking
populations and the Amerind-speaking Cheyenne, Bella Coola, and Nuu Chah Nulth
populations. The most exclusive cluster with all Na-Dene-speaking populations
(defined by branch b) also includes six Eskimo-Aleut-speaking populations (Siberian
Yupik, Greenland Inuit, Central Yupik, Canadian Inuit, and Inupiaq) and the
Amerind-speaking Bella Coola. The most exclusive cluster with all Amerind-speaking
populations (defined by branch c) includes the Eskimo-Aleutspeaking Aleuts and the
Na-Dene-speaking Navajo. Second, there is a strong North-South geographic pattern to
the clustering pattern. An Arctic-Pacific Northwest cluster that includes all
Aleut-Eskimo populations, all Na-Dene populations, and the Amerind Nuu Chah Nulth and
Bella Coola populations originates on one side of branch a, whereas a more Southern
group includes the Pima, Cherokee, Sioux, and Chippewa Amerindspeaking population
forms to the other side of branch a. The Southwestern Athabascan-speaking
populations, Navajo and Apache, defy the geographic groupings, but this result is
consistent with the archaeological record (30). Anthropologists circa anno Domini
agree that 1400 the ancestors of Navajos and Apaches migrated from the Mackenzie
Basin of Canada to the Southwest region, where they came into contact with
Amerindspeaking populations who had been living there for thousands of years (31).
Fig. 4 shows the distribution of the canonical Native American mtDNA haplogroups in
the 17 populations. The occurrence of haplogroup A differs markedly between the far
Northern and the Southwestern samples. With only few exceptions, mtDNA lineages
observed in the northern Na-Dene classified populations (Haida and Alaskan
Athabascans) belong to haplogroup A (Fig. 4). Haplogroup A is also common in Eskimos
and Aleuts. Outside of the far North, the only samples in which haplogroup A appears
commonly are the Southwestern Athabascanspeaking populations (Navajo and Apache).
mtDNA sequences belonging to haplogroups B and C are frequent primarily in the
Amerind-classified populations (Fig. 4), including the Bella Coola, and Nuu Chah
Nulth populations on the Northwest Coast. The Navajo and Apache are the only
Na-Dene-classified populations with substantial frequencies of B- and C-group
haplotypes, although haplogroup C is observed in the Haida and Alaskan Athabascan
samples. Haplogroup D mtDNA sequences are common in the Eskimo and Aleut populations
and the Bella Coola and Nuu Chah Nulth on the Northwest Coast. In summary, the
distribution of the major mtDNA haplogroups exhibits a strong regional pattern in
these samples. Haplogroups A and D are concentrated in the far North and Northwest
Coast, whereas haplogroups B and C appear regularly on the Northwest Coast and
further South. Recent surveys of Native North American mtDNA confirm the haplogroup
distributions observed for the populations and regions represented here; however,
broader distributions for the A, B, C, and D haplogroups are noted when samples from
other regions are included (32, 33). Discussion In this study, we adopt a rigorous
approach to tree comparisons. a priori First, a language classification is proposed
as an hypothesis for the genetic structure. Next, the language classification is
fitted to the genetic data. And finally, the resulting tree is tested for treeness by
using the method developed by Cavalli-Sforza and Piazza (25). The null hypothesis is
that the pattern of relationships among languages is the same as the pattern of
relationships among gene pools. We applied this approach to linguistic and genetic
data for Native North Americans by fitting Greenberg's linguistic classification (19)
to mitochondrial D-loop nucleotide sequence variations. The hypothesis of treeness
was rejected. Therefore, a significant difference exists between Greenberg's
linguistic classification and the genetic structures of these populations. Trees
produced by the NJ and Fitch algorithms fit the genetic data better than did the
Greenberg tree, but the treeness hypothesis was rejected even for these trees. Thus,
we conclude that the genetic relationships among populations are not treelike. The
lack of treeness in the genetic data makes it unlikely that any hierarchical language
classification will provide a close fit. The fact that not one of Greenberg's three
major language groups (Amerind, Aleut-Eskimo, and Na Dene) formed an exclusive
cluster in the better-fitting genetic trees produced by the NJ and Fitch algorithms
shows that the problems with the GLC are pervasive and not due to a single
problematic language group. One possibility for the disagreement between the genetic
data and the GLC is that the precontact pattern was disrupted by the entry of
Europeans. We wish to emphasize why we do not feel that European contact is a likely
explanation for our results. First, we restricted our analysis to mtDNA sequences
that are established to be present in Native Americans and absent in Europeans.
Second, population bottleneck and or expansion ( events in the postcontact era would
have changed relative branch lengths but would not have destroyed the treeness in the
data. Third, 14 of the 17 populations are situated today in the same localities that
they occupied at the time of first European contact. Fourth, mtDNA from ancient
(precontact) Native American populations look similar to postcontact populations in
the same region (34-36). Another possibility for the disagreement between the genetic
data and the GLC is that the GLC is a poor representation of the relationships among
Native North American languages (4). In fact, most linguists do not accept the GLC
(4, 10, 18, 20, 21). Greenberg's methods have been criticized (21, 37), and it is
felt widely that there is not sufficient information to establish deep linguistic
connections (10). Nevertheless, Greenberg included some undisputed language families
within his classification. These undisputed families include the Eskimo-Aleut family
and the Athabascan language group (10, 38, 39). We therefore find it quite
interesting that the fitted branch to both Eskimo-Aleut and Athabascan was estimated
to have zero length (Fig. 2). This finding suggests that the branch accounts for no
increase in genetic relationship among its descendants. The NJ tree (Fig. 3) shows
that the classifications within Aleut-Eskimo and Na Dene language families disagree
with the population genetic relationships, regardless of whether or not they are
analyzed within the context of the GLC. In fact, the NJ tree conf licts with
generally accepted language groups presented by Campbell (10). Aleuts do not cluster
with Eskimos. Neither the Yupik nor Inuit populations form distinct clusters within
Eskimo. The two Algonquin-speaking populations do not form a cluster. The Navajo and
Apache are separated in the NJ tree by the nonAthabascan-speaking Bella Coola. It is
possible that a stronger relationship between language groups and gene pools would be
found by directly assessing language areas that arise from diffusion of linguistic
traits across phylogenetic boundaries of languages (4, 10). The poor correspondence
between the genetic data and language groups ref lects the current population
structure. Genetic and linguistic variation may have shared the same hierarchical
relationships in the past. In fact, there are several features in the data that can
be interpreted as remnants of such relationships. These features include the
Eskimo-Aleut-specific transition polymorphism (29) and the two Athabascan-specific
transition polymorphisms (14). Interestingly, these results are consistent with a
linguistic model proposed by Nettle (9) that predicts that high diversity of language
stocks is a transitory phase in linguistic evolution. According to Nettle's model,
the entry of humans into a new region such as the Americas affords significant
opportunity for the birth of new languages. Upon entry, population growth will be
rapid and groups will fission and spread at high rate until the region is filled. New
linguistic lineages will be founded, with population splits creating a tree-like
structure. However, the rate of population fission will decline as open niches fill.
Eventually, population dynamics will be governed by competition and efficiency of
resource utilization. In this phase, linguistic diversity will decline as expanding
communities absorb neighbors or as less successful communities fragment and members
disperse. Examination of the median joining networks for the canonical mtDNA
haplogroups and population trees indicates a history of pervasive genetic exchange
across linguistic boundaries. The distribution of mtDNA haplogroups in the Apache and
Navajo presents the clearest example. As shown in Fig. 4, the distribution of the
canonical Native American mtDNA haplogroups differs markedly between the far North
and the Southwest. Notably, mtDNA sequences belonging to haplogroup B are not
observed in the northern Na-Dene-attributed populations, and members of haplogroup C
occur rarely (Fig. 4). By contrast, mtDNA sequences in Southwestern non-Athabascan
speakers are characterized by the predominance of members of haplogroups B and C and
the absence of members of haplogroup A. The haplogroup configuration for
non-Athabascan speakers in the Southwest is exemplified in the present study by the
Pima mtDNA sequences (Fig. 4) and has been established in surveys of haplogroups
determined from diagnostic sites in many other Southwestern populations (33, 40). The
Navajo and Apache possess many haplogroup A sequences typical of Northwestern
populations with languages attributed to the Na Dene language family. However, DNA
sequences belonging to haplogroups B and C are also common in the Navajo and Apache,
and these are most likely due to immigrants from the local non-Athabascanspeaking
populations. The elevated nucleotide diversity in the Navajo and Apache relative to
their northern counterparts is the consequence of these haplogroup B and C mtDNA
sequences. Interestingly, the pattern of genetic exchange is not reciprocal. A-group
haplotypes would have appeared in the Pima sample if they had absorbed a substantial
number of Athabascan-speaking migrants. The pattern of asymmetrical genetic exchanges
is all the more interesting given current mate exchange practices. Today, marriage
practice in both the Western Apache and Navajo is strongly matrilineal. On this
basis, we would not expect to see the inclusion of female lineages introduced from
the surrounding non-Athabascan-speaking populations. However, the practice of
matrilineality in these populations is likely to have begun after the Navajos and
Apaches arrived in the Southwest (31). This practice makes it likely that the
haplogroup B and C mtDNA sequences carried in the Navajo and Apache today were
introduced early in their experience in the Southwest, and before the current
cultural practices were initiated. In addition to the presence of B- and C-group
haplotypes in the Navajo and Apache, other features of the median-joining networks
indicate genetic exchange between linguistically divergent neighboring populations in
the Northwest and Arctic. For example, the Northwest Coast Bella Coola and Nuu Chah
Nulth (attributed to Amerind) share A-group lineages with the Northwest Coast Haida
(attributed to Na Dene), whereas the Eskimos in the far North share A-group lineages
with interior dwelling Alaskan Athabascans. If language replacements predominated
over gene replacements, we would expect good treeness for the genetic data but poor
agreement between genetic and linguistic trees. In opposition to this expectation,
even the best trees for the genetic data display a significant lack of treeness. Many
researchers have noted that either the language or the genes in a population can be
replaced, and examples of both gene and language replacement have been identified (1,
2, 7). There has been a tendency to expect that language replacements will be more
common (3, 41). In principle, language replacement can occur more rapidly than gene
replacement because language can be transmitted both vertically from parents to
children and horizontally between unrelated people, creating bilingual and
multilingual individuals, whereas genes can be transmitted only vertically (1, 42).
However, we found that the constraints imposed by mechanisms of transmission may be
relatively weak as compared with other factors that will inf luence whether genes,
languages, or both will be replaced. Finally, we note that our findings are relevant
to a multiple migration theory for the peopling of the Americas. According to this
hypothesis, the ancestors of modern Amerind, Na-Dene, and Eskimo-Aleut speakers
migrated into the Americas in three independent waves of migration, separated in time
by thousands<component x="314.17" y="62.78" width="247.57" height="416.15" page="3"
