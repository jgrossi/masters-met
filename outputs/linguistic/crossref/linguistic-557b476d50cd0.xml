recognize linguistic contrasts in American Sign Language (ASL) was investigated using
a paired-comparison discrimination task. Minimal pairs containing contrasts in five
linguistic categories (i.e., the formational parameters of movement, handshape,
orientation, and location in ASL phonology, and a category comprised of contrasts in
complex morphology) were presented in sentence contexts to a sample of 127 hearing
learners at beginning and intermediate levels of proficiency and 10 Deaf native
signers. Participants' responses were analyzed to determine the relative difficulty
of the linguistic categories and the effect of proficiency level on performance. The
results indicated that movement contrasts were the most difficult and location
contrasts the easiest, with the other categories of stimuli of intermediate
difficulty. These findings have implications for language learning in situations in
which the first language is a spoken language and the second language (L2) is a
signed language. In such situations, the construct of language transfer does not
apply to the acquisition of L2 phonology because of fundamental differences between
the phonological systems of signed and spoken languages, which are associated with
differences between the modalities of speech and sign.<component x="55.18" y="212.44"

have historically played an important role in linguistics with regard to the
classification of sound segments. In his postulates for the scientific study of
language, Leonard Bloomfield (1926, p. 155) provided the following definition: "That
which is alike will be called same. That which is not same is different."
Bloomfield's definition is vague and imprecise to be sure, in part, because the
perception of difference is far more important to the description of language than
actual physical differences. In this regard, it is clear that noticeable but
noncontrastive acoustic differences in the linguistic signal pale in importance to
contrastive differences for language processing and acquisition (Bohn, 2002). This
article addresses the age-old question "when is a difference really different?"
within the context of language learning and with specific reference to the
acquisition of American Sign Language (ASL). Like any other language learners,
students of ASL must be able to recognize linguistic contrasts and overlook
subphonemic (within-category) variation. In examining learners' ability to
distinguish contrastive from noncontrastive variation in ASL, this article addresses
a crucial topic for the acquisition of all languages-and signed languages in
particular. Background 1 people and a American Sign Language is a native language for
many Deaf cornerstone of the Deaf community in North America (Padden &amp; Humphries,
1988). It is also a widely used second language (L2) for both hearing and Deaf/deaf
people and is taught in numerous primary, secondary, and postsecondary academic
programs. In fact, ASL is one of the most commonly taught languages in the United
States and Canada. ASL and other natural sign languages are distinguished from spoken
languages primarily by the modality or channel of communication that is used for the
transmission of linguistic information; that is, whereas spoken languages transmit
linguistic signals via the auditory channel, signed languages transmit linguistic
signals via the visual channel. As such, phonetic properties such as location,
handshape, and movement are used in ASL phonology, whereas properties such as place,
manner, and voicing are used in spoken language phonology. With regard to syntax, ASL
generally has been considered to have an SVO word order but relies heavily on
topic-comment relations in discourse (Liddell, 1980). The morphology of ASL and other
signed languages, in contrast to English, is nonconcatenative because combinatorial
processes rely heavily on stem-internal changes rather than affixation (Fischer &amp;
Gough, 1978; Sandler, 1989, 1990). Variation Variation occurs naturally in both
spoken and signed languages. Some variation is associated with aspects of language
structure and can result in linguistic contrasts, such as the difference between one
phoneme and another or one morpheme and another. Other variation, however, is not
contrastive in the sense that it does not alter the identity of a linguistic unit or
change the meaning of an utterance. For example, linguistic units at the levels of
phonology and morphology sometimes are characterized by allophonic and allomorphic
variation. In such situations, differences are noticeable and may even be systematic,
but they are not contrastive. Taking the concept of variation a step further, the
production of sound segments varies both within and across individual speakers. In
particular, the same sound segment can have very different acoustic (and phonetic)
manifestations depending on speaker characteristics (e.g., gender, age, emotional
state, and social/regional dialect), speaking rate, and the surrounding phonetic
environment. The phonetic inventory of any given language, therefore, cannot be
uniquely defined in terms of absolute or invariant properties of the speech signal.
This is sometimes referred to as the problem of invariance. The problem of invariance
must be addressed in the description, processing, and acquisition of language. In
particular, variation across linguistic categories must be recognized and
differentiated from within-category variation in the segmentation and classification
of linguistic units at the levels of phonology and morphology. For example,
allophones and allomorphs must be properly identified in order for communication to
be effective. Similarly, listeners must adjust to physical variations across
individual speakers, such as acoustic differences among the voices of males, females,
and children, a phenomenon known as speaker normalization. Failure to properly
segment and classify linguistic units will result in an incorrect analysis of the
linguistic signal, as will failure to properly engage in speaker normalization (see
Kent, 1997, for a general discussion of invariance and speaker normalization).
Acquisition The acquisition of speech perception and production abilities in L2
phonology has been studied for decades, especially with respect to nonnative
pronunciation (i.e., foreign accent). Among the major issues addressed in the
literature are the effects of age, the quality and quantity of L2 input, and
interactions between the first language (L1) and L2 phonetic systems, including L1
transfer (Flege, 2002; Mack, 2003). Numerous empirical investigations have been
conducted addressing segmental properties of speech pertaining to the perception and
production of consonants and vowels in L2 learners (e.g., Bohn, 1995; Flege, 1992,
1995). In much of the literature, learners' performance on speech perception and/or
production tasks has been studied in relation to variations in learner age, factors
associated with input, and phonetic characteristics of the native and target
languages. The results of such studies have informed both theory and practice by
providing empirical evidence pertaining to the construction of models and pedagogical
approaches. Although the discussion thus far has focused on spoken language, similar
issues apply to sign languages, such as ASL. However, a good deal is known about
spoken language phonology and speech production and perception, whereas less is known
about the production, perception, and phonology of ASL and other natural sign
languages. Still, a number of studies have been conducted on sign perception with
particular reference to the phonological parameters of location, handshape, and
movement. The results of studies involving location generally show that Deaf signers
and hearing nonsigners perform similarly on perceptual tasks (Emmorey, 2002). The
perception of handshape, however, is more complicated since signers and nonsigners
tend to perform similarly on some perceptual tasks, but not on others. In particular,
there is evidence to suggest that the perception of handshape is categorical for Deaf
signers, but not for hearing nonsigners (Baker, 2003; Emmorey, McCullough, &amp;
Brentari, 2003; also see Morford, Grieve-Smith, MacFarlane, Staley, &amp; Waters,
2008). Finally, the results of various studies indicate that signers perceive
movement differently than nonsigners and that knowledge of a signed language can
influence the perception of motion (Emmorey, 2002; Poizner, 1981). Linguistic
Contrasts in ASL This study addresses the issue of variation in ASL from a basic
linguistic perspective involving minimal contrasts between signs (i.e., minimal
pairs) with specific reference to sublexical properties of sign formation. As such,
the study is similar in some respects to Miller and Nicely's (1955) classic analysis
of perceptual confusions among English consonants. In Miller and Nicely's
investigation, native speakers were asked to identify English consonants presented
under degraded listening conditions created by filtering and background noise. Their
results demonstrated that perceptual confusions do not occur in a random fashion;
rather, they are associated with specific acoustic and phonetic properties of speech.
In particular, data indicated that the phonetic feature of place of articulation is
highly fragile in the sense that it is the most difficult feature to perceive under
degraded listening conditions. Manner of articulation accounts for fewer perceptual
confusions; hence, it is less fragile. The phonetic feature of voicing accounts for
the fewest confusions and, therefore, is the least fragile (most salient) property of
speech. These results are among Miller and Nicely's most notable and widely cited
findings. Following Miller and Nicely's (1955) study of perceptual confusions in
speech, Tartter and Fischer (1982) and Fischer and Tartter (1985) studied perceptual
confusions in ASL. In these two studies, the authors presented pairs of ASL
utterances on videotape under normal and degraded viewing conditions to 14 highly
proficient and native Deaf signers. The degraded utterances were recorded under
special lighting conditions designed to reduce the visibility of the signer. A
drawing depicting each utterance was prepared and, after viewing the utterance,
participants were required to select the picture that best depicted the utterance
from two alternatives. The utterances represented minimal pairs because they could
only be differentiated with respect to a single contrast in one ASL parameter. The
parameters of movement, handshape (hand configuration), location (place of
articulation), and orientation were investigated. These sublexical features are an
intrinsic part of the phonology of ASL, analogous to phonetic features in spoken
language phonology (Brentari, 1998; Liddell &amp; Johnson, 1989; Sandler, 1989;
Stokoe, 1960). The results indicated that contrasts in movement and handshape were
significantly more difficult to discern than contrasts in location and orientation.
Consistent with this finding, Fischer, Delhorne, and Reed (1999) reported a similar
result in a small-scale study of ASL utterances degraded by fast rates of
presentation (i.e., time-compressed sign). The acquisition of sublexical features in
ASL and the ability to differentiate contrastive from noncontrastive differences in
sign production represent a major challenge for learners. In order to distinguish
among signs, learners must recognize contrastive differences and determine when
variations in sign production should be overlooked because they are not contrastive.
The importance of learning to recognize contrastive differences at the sublexical
level of structure and distinguish them from noncontrastive differences is
illustrated by data indicating that adult learners tend to make more phonological
than semantic errors in the recall of ASL utterances, with the ratio of phonological
to semantic errors increasing as the learners' experience with ASL decreases
(Mayberry &amp; Fischer, 1989; see also Mayberry, 1995). These data suggest that
learners must allocate more processing resources to recognize the phonological shape
of signs than native signers and that their allocation of processing resources to the
recognition of sublexical features is inversely related to the length of their
experience with ASL. In this and other studies (e.g., Mayberry &amp; Eichen, 1991),
the subjects consisted of early and late L1 learners, not L2 learners. Mayberry
(1993) has addressed the distinction between L1 and L2 ASL learning elsewhere and, in
a subsequent work, remarks that the effects of age are "significantly more pronounced
for first as compared to secondlanguage acquisition" (Mayberry, 1995, p. 364). She
then goes on to treat L2 and late L1 learners as one group and differentiate them
from native learners, stating that "language acquisition that occurs during childhood
appears to be more likely to result in automatic, or easy and instantaneous,
phonological processing than language acquisition that occurs at older ages"
(Mayberry, 1995, p. 368). Because the greatest difference between signed and spoken
languages pertains to the channel of information transmission, it is reasonable to
expect that the greatest challenge for hearing adult learners would be acquiring the
sensorimotor (visual and spatial) and phonological skills required for communication
in a modality with which they have little or no experience. In terms of second
language acquisition, fundamental differences between signed and spoken languages
associated with the channel of information transmission (i.e., differences in
sensorimotor and phonological processing) create a situation in which the construct
of language transfer has little or no discernable impact with respect to the domain
of phonology (see Gass &amp; Selinker, 1983, for an overview of language transfer).
When L1 and L2 are both spoken languages, L1 serves as a basis for L2 acquisition,
and language transfer is presumed to influence the learning process across all
linguistic domains. In contrast, when L1 is a spoken language and L2 is a signed
language, transfer cannot influence the acquisition of L2 phonology because of the
fundamental differences associated with the channels of information transmission.
Although language transfer does not appear to have any influence on the acquisition
of L2 phonology in this situation, it generally would be assumed to influence the
acquisition of other 2 linguistic domains in the L2 (e.g., morphology and syntax).
The purpose of the present study is to investigate the ability of adult learners to
discern when differences in sign formation are contrastive and when they are not. In
addressing this issue, we examine the relative difficulty of specific linguistic
properties of ASL (i.e., the phonological properties of movement, handshape,
location, and orientation, along with aspects of morphology), combined with natural
(free) variation in the production of utterances across signers. As such, this study
addresses variation from a very general perspective involving sublexical properties
of ASL and natural differences in production across signers.<component x="65.52"

individuals participated in the study. The participant sample was composed of 127
hearing adult learners at beginning and intermediate levels of ASL proficiency and 10
Deaf adult native signers. Most of the learners were enrolled in credit-bearing
college-level ASL courses in either the foreign language or interpreting education
programs at the Rochester Institute of Technology, and a few were enrolled in
noncredit courses designed for faculty and staff at the same institution. The hearing
subjects' participation was completely voluntary and they were not compensated for
their time. The Deaf subjects, however, were paid a nominal fee for their
participation. The hearing participants were drawn from three different sign language
instructional programs. The curriculum and student learning outcomes differed from
one ASL program to another. Student ability levels within a given course also tended
to vary. Therefore, fine-grained distinctions in participants' ASL abilities could
not be determined based on their course enrollment. Keeping this in mind, the
distribution of the hearing participants' ASL ability is reported in highly general
terms. Specifically, 111 participants were enrolled in courses designed for learners
at beginning levels of proficiency (ASL I, II, and III) and 16 were enrolled in
courses appropriate for students at the intermediate level (ASL V). Stimuli The
stimuli consisted of 48 items, which were divided into six categories of 8 items
each. Five of the categories included contrasts in specific linguistic properties of
ASL, and one was a general response category. Four categories represented the
parameters of location, orientation, handshape, and movement. The fifth category,
referred to as complex morphology, contained contrasts in directionality, number
incorporation, noun classifier usage, and verb inflection (two items each). The
complex morphology category is defined very broadly because it covers a range of
forms. Importantly, the contrasts in this category are associated with phonological
changes in ASL formational parameters; that is, the contrasts in complex morphology
reflect changes at both the phonological and morphological levels of structure and,
as such, may be considered morphophonological contrasts. Even though the category of
complex morphology differs from the purely phonological categories of location,
orientation, handshape, and movement, it represents a class of important linguistic
distinctions in ASL that must be recognized and acquired by learners in much the same
manner as phonetic categories. The final category did not contain a linguistic
contrast of any kind and is referred to as "Same." In the "Same" category, each trial
consists of a repetition of the target (model) sentence; hence, the correct response
to each trial is "Same." The description of ASL phonology used in this investigation
reflects approaches used prior to the Movement-Hold Model (Liddell &amp; Johnson,
1989). As such, our approach to ASL phonology may be considered oversimplified from
the current perspective of sign language linguistics. Nevertheless, the approach
taken in this study is justified because it forms the basis of a useful pedagogical
grammar and reflects an important dimension of sign language processing. More recent
approaches to ASL phonology (e.g., Brentari, 1998; Liddell &amp; Johnson, 1989) seem
less suitable from a pedagogical perspective, and this point is pertinent because the
present study focuses on learners. Additionally, the approach to ASL phonology
adopted in this study enables comparisons to be made with previous research
concerning native and highly skilled signers' processing of formational parameters
(e.g., Fischer &amp; Tartter, 1985; Tartter &amp; Fisher, 1982). Table 1 illustrates
the linguistic contrasts included in the stimulus set by presenting English glosses
of ASL sentences as exemplars of each category. . The drawing in Figure 1 depicts the
location Contrasting forms are underlined contrast illustrated in Table 1 and in the
example below. A complete list of the test items included within each linguistic
category appears in Appendix S1 in the online Supporting Information. Neither Table 1
nor the appendix, however, includes "Same" items because these items do not contain
linguistic contrasts, as mentioned earlier. Each item was comprised of two pairs of
ASL sentences. Each sentence pair consisted of a model (standard) sentence followed
by a comparison sentence.<component x="55.18" y="135.35" width="310.85"

signers always produced the model sentences. The female signer always produced the
first comparison sentence, and the other male signer always produced the second
comparison sentence. Utterances were recorded over a 4-day period in which the
signers and investigators worked together to ensure clarity, accuracy, and
consistency of sign production. Specifically, the signers discussed the formational
details of sign production with each other and three of the investigators who are
fluent Deaf ASL users. During the recording sessions, the signers observed one
another, paying particular attention to the production of the model sentences. At the
same time, the three Deaf investigators monitored sign production across the three
signers. The utterances were digitally recorded in a TV studio by a professional
videographer. The lighting and background were carefully selected to provide
high-quality images. Each signer produced at least three utterances (tokens) of each
sentence in succession. After the recording sessions, the three Deaf investigators
reviewed the recordings and identified specific utterances for presentation to
participants using the criteria of clarity, accuracy, and consistency of sign
production. The selected utterances were then excised from the master video and
recorded on DVD in a randomized order. This procedure assured that the utterance
tokens presented to participants were clear, accurate, and consistent and that the
contrasts included within each linguistic category truly represented the category.
Natural variation was observed among the signers in their production of utterances;
but this variation did not influence meaning. For example, one of the "Same" items
included the sign for SISTER. Although all three signers clearly signed SISTER,
minor, appropriate subphonemic variations in sign formation were observed.
Specifically, two of the signers produced the sign beginning with contact at the side
of the chin. The beginning place of contact for the other signer was at the middle of
the chin. Similar variation across signers may have occurred in the form of small
subphonemic (within-category) differences in the degree of finger splay, thumb
opposition, joint activity, and other aspects of sign formation. The recorded
utterances were played to individuals and groups of participants in classroom
settings. The groups ranged in size from 2 to 19 individuals. The recordings were
played on a DVD player or computer, and the images were projected onto a large screen
at the front of the room. Procedure A paired-comparison discrimination task was used
in this investigation. Participants were presented with a model sentence immediately
followed by a comparison sentence, and they were required to judge whether the
stimuli were the "Same" or "Different." This procedure follows from previous work on
the auditory recognition of speech. Bochner, Garrison, Sussman, and Burkard (2003)
used a very similar paired-comparison discrimination task to study differences in
listeners' ability to discriminate among spoken utterances as a function of
linguistic (phonetic) properties of the signals as well as the sensory capabilities
of the listeners (degree of hearing loss) and listening conditions (quiet vs. noise
background). Bochner, Garrison, Palmer, Mackenzie, and Braveman (1997) also conducted
a speech recognition study using a discrimination task resembling the one used in the
present investigation. As mentioned previously, each item consisted of two pairs of
sentence stimuli. Participants were required to make a discrimination judgment for
each pair of sentences. Therefore, each item consisted of two trials-one for each
pair of stimuli. The model stimulus was presented first, followed by a one second
interstimulus interval. The first comparison sentence was then presented, followed by
a 3-second response interval. The participants responded to the first trial during
this time by circling "S" or "D" on an answer sheet to indicate same or different. At
the conclusion of the response interval, a brief flash of light was projected on the
screen accompanied by an audible tone. These visual and auditory signals were
intended to alert participants that the next stimulus was about to be presented. The
same model stimulus was presented again, followed by a 1-second interstimulus
interval and then the second comparison stimulus. Finally, the second response
interval was presented (3 seconds), and participants indicated their response ("S" or
"D") to the second trial on the answer sheet. The two trials comprising each item
were presented consecutively (one after the other) because previous research using a
very similar discrimination procedure indicated no influence attributable to memory
(recency) effects (Bochner et al. 1997, 2003) and because using consecutive trials
could lead directly to the development of an assessment protocol based on this
procedure (e.g., a computerized adaptive test of ASL discrimination ability). Each
stimulus was labeled with a caption on the lower left portion of the screen. The
model sentence was labeled "Model," and the comparison sentences were labeled to
identify the item number and trial. The first trial for each item was labeled "a" and
the second trial was labeled "b." For example, the first trial for the first item was
labeled "1a" and the second trial for the first item was labeled "1b"; the first
trial for the second item was labeled "2a" and the second trial for the second item
was labeled "2b"; and so on. The captioned labels on the screen corresponded to the
labels on the answer sheet. After a brief explanation of the task in which
participants were instructed to respond "Same" if the utterances in each pair had the
same meaning and "Different" if the utterances in each pair had a different meaning,
six practice items were presented to ensure understanding of the procedure. The
practice items illustrated contrasts in movement, location, orientation, and complex
morphology (one item each). Two practice items illustrated the "Same" category. In
this way, the practice items exposed participants to every item category except
handshape and provided them with a direct and practical orientation to the task. The
combination of instructions and practice items, therefore, served to familiarize
participants with the procedure. Data collection was begun after the practice items
were presented and the examiner(s) was certain that the participants understood the
task. The entire procedure required about 50 minutes to complete, including
explanations and practice items. For any item, every possible combination of "Same"
and "Different" trials could occur; that is, an item could consist of two "Same"
trials, two "Different" trials, or one trial of each. In order to reveal meaningful
information using a discrimination procedure of the sort employed in this
investigation, items must contain a linguistic contrast. Therefore, every item within
each linguistic category (location, orientation, handshape, movement, and complex
morphology) contained at least one contrast (i.e., at least one "Different" trial).
In other words, within each linguistic category (location, orientation, handshape,
movement, and complex morphology), an item could contain either two "Different"
trials or one "Same" and one "Different" trial. Half of the eight test items within
each linguistic category listed in Appendix S1 in the online Supporting Information
contained one "Different" trial and the other half contained two "Different" trials.
The determination of which specific items were assigned one "Different" trial and
which were assigned two "Different" trials was done randomly. As mentioned
previously, one category of items did not contain any linguistic contrasts; in other
words, both trials were verbatim repetitions of the model sentence. It was necessary
to include a category of items composed of two "Same" trials as foils to minimize the
potential for response bias in the participant sample. The reader is referred to
Appendix S1 in the online Supporting Information for additional details and
clarification concerning the test items.<component x="65.52" y="71.69" width="310.85"

composed of two trials, and participants' responses can be considered a set of 48
items or a set of 96 trials. Because the responses can be analyzed from either the
perspective of 48 items or 96 trials, we begin by comparing scoring outcomes for the
set of 48 items to the set of 96 trials. Each trial is simply scored correct or
incorrect. Because a trial consists of two response alternatives ("S" or "D"),
chance-level performance for a given trial is 50%. The mean number of correct trials
across the entire participant sample was 73.82 (SD 9.06). In contrast, an item is
considered correct if and only = if the response to both trials is correct. No
partial credit is awarded. Scoring each item as a block of two trials reduces the
chance level of performance to 25%. The mean number of correct items across the
entire participant sample was 30.95 (SD 6.73). = A correlation analysis was conducted
to examine the relationship between participants' responses scored as a set of 96
trials and as a set of 48 items. The results indicated that the two scoring methods
are essentially equivalent (r .98, = p &lt; .0001). This finding indicates that no
information is lost in treating the data as a set of 48 items and, following other
studies using similar procedures (Bochner et al. 1997, 2003), all subsequent analyses
are based on this dataset. Treating the data as a set of 48 items is considered
preferable because it reduces chance-level performance and facilitates the
interpretation of results.<component x="55.18" y="71.69" width="310.85"

to compare the relative difficulty of each of the 48 items. The results of this
analysis indicated that the difficulty of individual items ranged from 20.4% to 92.7%
correct. Eleven items had difficulty values less than 50% correct; 20 items had
difficulty values in the range from 50% to 75%; and 17 items had difficulty values
greater than 75%. Performance on only one item was below chance level, and this item
involved a movement contrast (SERIOUS vs. DISAPPOINTING). Importantly, an estimate of
internal consistency reliability was computed using Cronbach's coefficient alpha. The
alpha reliability coefficient was .81, indicating a reasonably high degree of
reliability and consistency within the item set. The alpha coefficient also indicates
that, taken together, the items measure a single unidimensional latent construct,
which we define as a measure of ASL discrimination ability. The participant sample
can be divided into three broad levels of ASL proficiency: a large group of
beginners, a small group of intermediate-level learners, and a small group of native
signers. Table 2 displays the mean number and proportion of correct responses (based
on 48 items) for each group of participants along with the standard deviation. A
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test for differences between
groups, and the results were significant with F(2,134) 38.54, p &lt; .0001, and with

involved the presentation of degraded signals to small samples of highly proficient
Deaf signers, the present investigation used fully intelligible (normal) signals
presented to a relatively large sample of hearing adult learners of ASL as an L2 and
a small sample of Deaf native signers. The results indicated that the discrimination
task distinguished beginners from participants classified at both the intermediate
and native levels of ASL proficiency. The small sample size in the intermediate (N
16) and native = (N 10) groups, however, prevented the difference between them from
reach= ing statistical significance. The overall pattern of results, including their
consistency with previous research (e.g., Fischer &amp; Tartter, 1985; Tartter &amp;
Fischer, 1982) and the superior performance of the native signers, attests to the
validity of the task. Even though the native signers performed quite well on the task
overall (86% correct), their performance as a group was slightly lower than expected.
In particular, four members of the group scored below 63% on complex morphology
contrasts and three scored below 63% on movement contrasts. This finding indicates
that some complex morphology and movement contrasts were especially difficult, even
for native signers. Nevertheless, the 10 native signers performed very well on four
of the six item categories, scoring 90% or higher on location, 3 handshape,
orientation, and "Same" items. In order to be absolutely certain that these findings
are accurate, the investigators double-checked the data collection procedure,
stimuli, and data analysis. No irregularities or anomalies were discovered.
Therefore, it seems that just as some spoken utterances can be misinterpreted by
native speakers as a result of phonetic confusions, some signed utterances can be
misinterpreted by native signers for the same reason. In other words, just as two
distinct utterances sometimes sound alike in speech, two distinct utterances
sometimes look alike in sign. Moreover, data from this study show that perceptual
confusions in sign are not randomly distributed; rather, they are most likely to
occur within the categories of movement and complex morphology. The distribution of
scores across participant groups along with the effect 2 .365) show that the task is
sensitive to a wide of group membership (&#x3B7; = range of differences in ability.
The sensitivity of the task, in turn, follows from the fact that item difficulty is
distributed in a fairly uniform manner, with similar numbers of items classified at
low (greater than 75% correct), moderate (50-75% correct), and high (less than 50%
correct) levels of difficulty. Given the results presented in Table 3 and Figure 2,
it is not surprising that 11 of the 12 most difficult items were members of the
movement, complex morphology, and "Same" categories. Similarly, 9 of the 12 easiest
items were members of the location, orientation, and handshape categories. With
regard to performance across linguistic categories, the results of this study
indicate the following hierarchy of difficulty: (a) Movement contrasts are the most
difficult; (b) complex morphology and "Same" contrasts are moderately difficult; (c)
handshape and orientation contrasts are relatively easy; and (d) location contrasts
are easiest. These findings are largely consistent with those of studies using highly
proficient and native Deaf signers presented with signals under normal and degraded
viewing conditions. Specifically, movement contrasts generally have been found to be
the most difficult, location contrasts the easiest, and handshape and orientation
contrasts of intermediate difficulty in studies reported by Tartter and Fischer
(1982), Fischer and Tartter (1985), and Fischer et al. (1999). The relative
difficulty of movement contrasts is consistent with Brentari's (1998) analysis of ASL
phonology. In her analysis, Brentari associated the parameter of movement with
perceptual salience/visibility, proposing "the more proximal the joint articulating
the movement is to the midline of the body, the greater the degree of sonority" (p.
217). In terms of Brentari's sonority hierarchy for ASL, the movement contrasts
included in this study, for the most part, are associated with moderate perceptual
salience/visibility. Many of these contrasts involve the wrist joint and have
sonority values in the vicinity of 4 on Brentari's 6-point scale (also see Emmorey's,
2002, analysis of movement, and Hildebrandt &amp; Corina, 2002). Similarly, the
difficulty of handshape contrasts appears generally consistent with findings
regarding the role of experience with ASL in the perception of handshape (Baker,
2003; Emmorey et al., 2003; also see Morford et al., 2008). The performance of native
signers on handshape contrasts was 92.5% correct; the performance of intermediate
learners was 85.9% correct; and the performance of beginning learners was 68.5%
correct. Finally, the relative ease with which location contrasts are perceived is
consistent with data on the acquisition of ASL as an L1 (Conlin, Mirus, Mauk, &amp;
Meier, 2000; Marentette &amp; Mayberry, 2000). Unlike previous research, the present
study included morphological contrasts, and the results indicated that contrasts
involving complex morphology were relatively difficult. Complex morphology is known
to pose a challenge for ASL learners (especially late learners) because the
distinctions included in this domain of ASL grammar are relatively subtle and
acquired fairly late in the acquisition process (Emmorey, 2002; Gee &amp; Goodhart,
1988). Because complex morphology contrasts generally co-occurred with contrasts in
one of the phonological parameters included in this investigation, the dataset was
examined to compare performance on specific complex morphology contrasts to
performance on items including contrasts in the corresponding phonological parameter.
In particular, performance on items containing contrasts in number incorporation
(69.3% correct) was found to be comparable to performance on items containing
contrasts in handshape (72% correct); performance on items containing contrasts in
verb inflection (39.1% correct) was slightly worse than performance on items
containing contrasts in movement (53%); and performance on items containing contrasts
in directionality (83.9% correct), which is described in terms of the location
parameter in current approaches to ASL phonology, was slightly better than
performance on items containing contrasts in location (77% correct). This pattern of
results suggests that the difficulty of complex morphology contrasts may tend to
reflect the difficulty of recognizing 4 In this regard, the results a contrast in the
associated phonological parameter. indicate that the subcategory of directionality
within complex morphology tends to be comparatively easy (as is the case with
location contrasts); the subcategory of number incorporation tends to be of
intermediate difficulty (as is the case with handshape contrasts); and the
subcategory of verb inflection tends to be most difficult (as is the case with
movement contrasts). However, it also must be mentioned that performance on the
category of noun classifier usage was quite poor (less than 35% correct), suggesting
that other factors influence the difficulty of complex morphology contrasts in
addition to the inherent difficulty of the associated phonological parameter. The
present study also included a category without any contrasting linguistic
information. Data indicate that "Same" items were approximately equal in difficulty
to complex morphology contrasts. The relative difficulty of "Same" items in this
study is surprising given the fact that "Same" items have proven to be exceptionally
easy in previous research using a similar discrimination task with speech stimuli
(Bochner et al. 1997, 2003) as well as in numerous other studies using same-different
judgments in perceptual comparisons (Bochner, Garrison, &amp; Palmer, 1992; Farell,
1985). Careful inspection of the data, however, indicates that the performance of the
native signers is consistent with expectations based on previous research using
discrimination tasks. The native signers' responses to "Same" items were correct 90%
of the time, demonstrating that these items were very easy for them. Therefore, the
surprisingly poor performance on "Same" items in this study may be attributed to the
fact that the participant sample was comprised primarily of language learners,
especially beginners, whose experience with ASL was very limited. It is likely that
learners often attend to small subphonemic differences in sign production and
incorrectly perceive utterance tokens that are the same as being similar (but not
identical) to one another. In this regard, Bohn (2002) pointed out that the
perception of phonetic similarity depends on factors such as the observer's language
background and experience and that similar utterance tokens (i.e., utterances that
are in close proximity to one another in phonetic space) are more difficult for L2
learners to categorize than dissimilar utterance tokens (i.e., utterances distal from
one another in phonetic space). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the
difficulty of "Same" items in the present study follows from participants' background
as spoken language users and their lack of experience with signed languages. As
occurs in the acquisition of L2 speech, learners' background and experience with the
target language influence their processing of phonetic similarity in the acquisition
of a signed language as an L2.<component x="65.52" y="71.72" width="310.86"

hierarchy of difficulty among linguistic properties of ASL found in this study has
potential application in projects involving the development and use of communication
technology for signed languages. For example, the hierarchy of difficulty may be used
in evaluating the efficacy of information transmission for sign language
communication via video technologies, such as computer video, video conferencing, and
videophones. Specifically, technologies that are best at transmitting movement
information are likely to provide the most effective media for communication using
signed languages. The results of this study emphasize the importance of
distinguishing contrastive from noncontrastive differences in the acquisition of
signed languages. Differentiating contrastive from noncontrastive differences in sign
formation presents an especially formidable challenge for learners at beginning
levels of proficiency (Mayberry, 1995). For learners having no prior experience with
signed languages, acquiring the sensorimotor (visual and spatial) and phonological
skills necessary for attaining proficiency is a need that educational programs must
address in a deliberate and systematic manner (Mirus, Rathmann, &amp; Meier, 2001;
Rosen, 2004). Students must learn to detect contrastive differences and overlook
noncontrastive differences in the course of acquiring linguistic knowledge.
Therefore, the development of ASL curricula and delivery of ASL instruction should
strive to facilitate learners' ability to identify fundamental linguistic contrasts
of the sort addressed in this study and, in so doing, address the important issue of
variation from the perspective of both allophonic variation and variation across
signers. Moreover, approaches to the assessment of ASL proficiency could benefit from
the evaluation of learners' ability to discriminate linguistic contrasts. In
particular, the discrimination procedure used in this study appears very promising
and should be considered in the development of a practical receptive measure of ASL
ability. Theoretical Implications The construct of language transfer plays an
important role in the acquisition of L2 phonology in spoken languages. In contrast,
the acquisition of ASL and other natural sign languages does not involve phonological
transfer in situations in which L1 is a spoken language and L2 is a signed language
because of fundamental differences between signed and spoken languages associated
with 5 Such differences are readily apparthe channel of information transmission. ent
when approached from the perspective of contrastive linguistics. Taking a contrastive
linguistics approach and combining it with Mayberry's (1995) findings concerning the
relationship of phonological errors to learners' experience with ASL (especially in
childhood) leads to the prediction that L2 learners of signed languages, especially
adult learners, will face a formidable challenge in acquiring the phonology of the
signed language in situations in which their L1 is a spoken language. Of course, the
relative difficulty of ASL phonology is ultimately a question that must be addressed
in empirical studies. At this point, however, our prediction concerning the
difficulty of ASL phonology may be considered a working hypothesis, and the results
of the present investigation 6 are consistent with this hypothesis. One specific
challenge facing learners of signed languages related to the difference between
speech and sign might pertain to the fact that the production of signs is directly
observable, but the production of speech is not. Speech production occurs largely
within the oral cavity, so the articulation of speech sounds cannot be directly
observed. In contrast, the production of signs occurs outside the body and is fully
accessible to observers. This distinction might have important implications with
regard to learners' processing of variation and the acquisition of phonetic
categories. In particular, Stevens (1972, 1989) described nonlinearities in the
relationship between vocal articulation (input) and the acoustic signal (output) in
terms of a quantal theory of speech. Quantal theory is associated with nonlinearities
in speech pertaining to the fact that large changes in articulation sometimes have
small effects on the acoustic characteristics of the signal, whereas, conversely,
small changes in articulation sometimes result in large changes in acoustic output.
In short, the quantal theory of speech is based largely on the fact that
"articulatory movements are not equal in their acoustic consequences" (Kent, 1997, p.
412) as well as on data indicating similar nonlinearities in auditory-acoustic
relations. Importantly, the nonlinear relationship between articulation and the
acoustic signal accommodates variation in vocal tract configurations and works
synergistically with auditory perception so that speech sounds with certain
well-defined acoustic attributes are perceived categorically. It also has been
suggested from a developmental and evolutionary perspective that the tendency for
nonlinear (quantal) relations among "acoustic, auditory and articulatory parameters
is a principal factor shaping the inventory of acoustic and articulatory attributes
that are used to signal distinctions in language" (Stevens, 1989, p. 3). Because the
production of signs is directly observable, the relationship between the articulation
of signs and the manual signal is completely linear because the articulation of signs
is the signal. The linear relationship between articulation and the signal may have
specific consequences for signed languages with regard to phonological variation and
the development of phonetic categories. If a nonlinear relationship accommodates
variation in speech, it may be assumed that a linear relationship would have the
opposite effect in sign, providing relatively limited tolerance for variation. This
is a provocative assumption, but it is clearly speculative and greatly oversimplified
because variation is abundant in ASL and other signed languages. An important area
for future research, therefore, is to describe variation in signed languages and its
impact on their acquisition from the perspectives of both production and perception.
In this regard, it is likely that a highly detailed phonetic transcription system for
signed languages recently developed by Johnson (2008) can facilitate such research
(Chen Pichler, 2009). Languages associate linguistic signals with meaning through a
set of principles or rules described by a grammar. Acoustic signals are associated
with meaning in the case of spoken languages, and visual-manual signals are
associated with meaning in the case of signed languages. In either case, users,
especially learners, must determine when changes in the linguistic signal correspond
to changes in meaning; that is, they must be able to discern when a difference is
really different. Accordingly, the use and acquisition of language depend crucially
on individuals' ability to effectively distinguish contrastive from noncontrastive
differences. The results of the present study strongly emphasize this point. The
ability to differentiate contrastive from noncontrastive differences in ASL, as in
any other language, serves as a foundation for communication and acquisition. As
such, the results of this study contribute to the field of applied linguistics, in
general, and have special relevance for the acquisition of signed languages, in
particular.<component x="55.18" y="71.71" width="310.86" height="60.67" page="19"

group of people who share a common language (ASL) and culture. Lowercase deaf denotes
people with hearing loss (Padden &amp; Humphries, 1988). 2 Although phonological
transfer cannot occur in the situation in which L1 is a spoken language and L2 is a
signed language, phonological (and cognitive) universals can still influence the
course of acquisition at an abstract, underlying level of structure. 3 Native
signers' performance on each of the six item categories was as follows: location 95%

items reflecting noun classifier usage, one contained a contrast in handshape and the
other contained a contrast in location. As such, a single comparison involving both
of these items was not possible. Performance on this category was very poor, with
participants scoring less than 35% correct. 5 It has been suggested that hearing
adult learners' familiarity with conventional communicative gestures may influence
their acquisition of handshape contrasts in ASL through the mechanism of transfer
(Chen Pichler, 2009, 2011). Even if this suggestion is supported by additional data,
the influence of communicative gestures cannot be considered a form of language
transfer because gestures fall outside the realm of language and within the domain of
paralinguistic or extralinguistic behavior. 2 .365) in this study indicates that

that the effects of phonological processing observed in Mayberry's (1995) studies are
not limited to late L1 acquisition. Specifically, this finding shows that
phonological processing also has an important influence on L2 acquisition.<component

recognize linguistic contrasts in American Sign Language (ASL) was investigated using
a paired-comparison discrimination task. Minimal pairs containing contrasts in five
linguistic categories (i.e., the formational parameters of movement, handshape,
orientation, and location in ASL phonology, and a category comprised of contrasts in
complex morphology) were presented in sentence contexts to a sample of 127 hearing
learners at beginning and intermediate levels of proficiency and 10 Deaf native
signers. Participants' responses were analyzed to determine the relative difficulty
of the linguistic categories and the effect of proficiency level on performance. The
results indicated that movement contrasts were the most difficult and location
contrasts the easiest, with the other categories of stimuli of intermediate
difficulty. These findings have implications for language learning in situations in
which the first language is a spoken language and the second language (L2) is a
signed language. In such situations, the construct of language transfer does not
apply to the acquisition of L2 phonology because of fundamental differences between
the phonological systems of signed and spoken languages, which are associated with
differences between the modalities of speech and sign.<component x="55.18" y="212.44"

have historically played an important role in linguistics with regard to the
classification of sound segments. In his postulates for the scientific study of
language, Leonard Bloomfield (1926, p. 155) provided the following definition: "That
which is alike will be called same. That which is not same is different."
Bloomfield's definition is vague and imprecise to be sure, in part, because the
perception of difference is far more important to the description of language than
actual physical differences. In this regard, it is clear that noticeable but
noncontrastive acoustic differences in the linguistic signal pale in importance to
contrastive differences for language processing and acquisition (Bohn, 2002). This
article addresses the age-old question "when is a difference really different?"
within the context of language learning and with specific reference to the
acquisition of American Sign Language (ASL). Like any other language learners,
students of ASL must be able to recognize linguistic contrasts and overlook
subphonemic (within-category) variation. In examining learners' ability to
distinguish contrastive from noncontrastive variation in ASL, this article addresses
a crucial topic for the acquisition of all languages-and signed languages in
particular. Background 1 people and a American Sign Language is a native language for
many Deaf cornerstone of the Deaf community in North America (Padden &amp; Humphries,
1988). It is also a widely used second language (L2) for both hearing and Deaf/deaf
people and is taught in numerous primary, secondary, and postsecondary academic
programs. In fact, ASL is one of the most commonly taught languages in the United
States and Canada. ASL and other natural sign languages are distinguished from spoken
languages primarily by the modality or channel of communication that is used for the
transmission of linguistic information; that is, whereas spoken languages transmit
linguistic signals via the auditory channel, signed languages transmit linguistic
signals via the visual channel. As such, phonetic properties such as location,
handshape, and movement are used in ASL phonology, whereas properties such as place,
manner, and voicing are used in spoken language phonology. With regard to syntax, ASL
generally has been considered to have an SVO word order but relies heavily on
topic-comment relations in discourse (Liddell, 1980). The morphology of ASL and other
signed languages, in contrast to English, is nonconcatenative because combinatorial
processes rely heavily on stem-internal changes rather than affixation (Fischer &amp;
Gough, 1978; Sandler, 1989, 1990). Variation Variation occurs naturally in both
spoken and signed languages. Some variation is associated with aspects of language
structure and can result in linguistic contrasts, such as the difference between one
phoneme and another or one morpheme and another. Other variation, however, is not
contrastive in the sense that it does not alter the identity of a linguistic unit or
change the meaning of an utterance. For example, linguistic units at the levels of
phonology and morphology sometimes are characterized by allophonic and allomorphic
variation. In such situations, differences are noticeable and may even be systematic,
but they are not contrastive. Taking the concept of variation a step further, the
production of sound segments varies both within and across individual speakers. In
particular, the same sound segment can have very different acoustic (and phonetic)
manifestations depending on speaker characteristics (e.g., gender, age, emotional
state, and social/regional dialect), speaking rate, and the surrounding phonetic
environment. The phonetic inventory of any given language, therefore, cannot be
uniquely defined in terms of absolute or invariant properties of the speech signal.
This is sometimes referred to as the problem of invariance. The problem of invariance
must be addressed in the description, processing, and acquisition of language. In
particular, variation across linguistic categories must be recognized and
differentiated from within-category variation in the segmentation and classification
of linguistic units at the levels of phonology and morphology. For example,
allophones and allomorphs must be properly identified in order for communication to
be effective. Similarly, listeners must adjust to physical variations across
individual speakers, such as acoustic differences among the voices of males, females,
and children, a phenomenon known as speaker normalization. Failure to properly
segment and classify linguistic units will result in an incorrect analysis of the
linguistic signal, as will failure to properly engage in speaker normalization (see
Kent, 1997, for a general discussion of invariance and speaker normalization).
Acquisition The acquisition of speech perception and production abilities in L2
phonology has been studied for decades, especially with respect to nonnative
pronunciation (i.e., foreign accent). Among the major issues addressed in the
literature are the effects of age, the quality and quantity of L2 input, and
interactions between the first language (L1) and L2 phonetic systems, including L1
transfer (Flege, 2002; Mack, 2003). Numerous empirical investigations have been
conducted addressing segmental properties of speech pertaining to the perception and
production of consonants and vowels in L2 learners (e.g., Bohn, 1995; Flege, 1992,
1995). In much of the literature, learners' performance on speech perception and/or
production tasks has been studied in relation to variations in learner age, factors
associated with input, and phonetic characteristics of the native and target
languages. The results of such studies have informed both theory and practice by
providing empirical evidence pertaining to the construction of models and pedagogical
approaches. Although the discussion thus far has focused on spoken language, similar
issues apply to sign languages, such as ASL. However, a good deal is known about
spoken language phonology and speech production and perception, whereas less is known
about the production, perception, and phonology of ASL and other natural sign
languages. Still, a number of studies have been conducted on sign perception with
particular reference to the phonological parameters of location, handshape, and
movement. The results of studies involving location generally show that Deaf signers
and hearing nonsigners perform similarly on perceptual tasks (Emmorey, 2002). The
perception of handshape, however, is more complicated since signers and nonsigners
tend to perform similarly on some perceptual tasks, but not on others. In particular,
there is evidence to suggest that the perception of handshape is categorical for Deaf
signers, but not for hearing nonsigners (Baker, 2003; Emmorey, McCullough, &amp;
Brentari, 2003; also see Morford, Grieve-Smith, MacFarlane, Staley, &amp; Waters,
2008). Finally, the results of various studies indicate that signers perceive
movement differently than nonsigners and that knowledge of a signed language can
influence the perception of motion (Emmorey, 2002; Poizner, 1981). Linguistic
Contrasts in ASL This study addresses the issue of variation in ASL from a basic
linguistic perspective involving minimal contrasts between signs (i.e., minimal
pairs) with specific reference to sublexical properties of sign formation. As such,
the study is similar in some respects to Miller and Nicely's (1955) classic analysis
of perceptual confusions among English consonants. In Miller and Nicely's
investigation, native speakers were asked to identify English consonants presented
under degraded listening conditions created by filtering and background noise. Their
results demonstrated that perceptual confusions do not occur in a random fashion;
rather, they are associated with specific acoustic and phonetic properties of speech.
In particular, data indicated that the phonetic feature of place of articulation is
highly fragile in the sense that it is the most difficult feature to perceive under
degraded listening conditions. Manner of articulation accounts for fewer perceptual
confusions; hence, it is less fragile. The phonetic feature of voicing accounts for
the fewest confusions and, therefore, is the least fragile (most salient) property of
speech. These results are among Miller and Nicely's most notable and widely cited
findings. Following Miller and Nicely's (1955) study of perceptual confusions in
speech, Tartter and Fischer (1982) and Fischer and Tartter (1985) studied perceptual
confusions in ASL. In these two studies, the authors presented pairs of ASL
utterances on videotape under normal and degraded viewing conditions to 14 highly
proficient and native Deaf signers. The degraded utterances were recorded under
special lighting conditions designed to reduce the visibility of the signer. A
drawing depicting each utterance was prepared and, after viewing the utterance,
participants were required to select the picture that best depicted the utterance
from two alternatives. The utterances represented minimal pairs because they could
only be differentiated with respect to a single contrast in one ASL parameter. The
parameters of movement, handshape (hand configuration), location (place of
articulation), and orientation were investigated. These sublexical features are an
intrinsic part of the phonology of ASL, analogous to phonetic features in spoken
language phonology (Brentari, 1998; Liddell &amp; Johnson, 1989; Sandler, 1989;
Stokoe, 1960). The results indicated that contrasts in movement and handshape were
significantly more difficult to discern than contrasts in location and orientation.
Consistent with this finding, Fischer, Delhorne, and Reed (1999) reported a similar
result in a small-scale study of ASL utterances degraded by fast rates of
presentation (i.e., time-compressed sign). The acquisition of sublexical features in
ASL and the ability to differentiate contrastive from noncontrastive differences in
sign production represent a major challenge for learners. In order to distinguish
among signs, learners must recognize contrastive differences and determine when
variations in sign production should be overlooked because they are not contrastive.
The importance of learning to recognize contrastive differences at the sublexical
level of structure and distinguish them from noncontrastive differences is
illustrated by data indicating that adult learners tend to make more phonological
than semantic errors in the recall of ASL utterances, with the ratio of phonological
to semantic errors increasing as the learners' experience with ASL decreases
(Mayberry &amp; Fischer, 1989; see also Mayberry, 1995). These data suggest that
learners must allocate more processing resources to recognize the phonological shape
of signs than native signers and that their allocation of processing resources to the
recognition of sublexical features is inversely related to the length of their
experience with ASL. In this and other studies (e.g., Mayberry &amp; Eichen, 1991),
the subjects consisted of early and late L1 learners, not L2 learners. Mayberry
(1993) has addressed the distinction between L1 and L2 ASL learning elsewhere and, in
a subsequent work, remarks that the effects of age are "significantly more pronounced
for first as compared to secondlanguage acquisition" (Mayberry, 1995, p. 364). She
then goes on to treat L2 and late L1 learners as one group and differentiate them
from native learners, stating that "language acquisition that occurs during childhood
appears to be more likely to result in automatic, or easy and instantaneous,
phonological processing than language acquisition that occurs at older ages"
(Mayberry, 1995, p. 368). Because the greatest difference between signed and spoken
languages pertains to the channel of information transmission, it is reasonable to
expect that the greatest challenge for hearing adult learners would be acquiring the
sensorimotor (visual and spatial) and phonological skills required for communication
in a modality with which they have little or no experience. In terms of second
language acquisition, fundamental differences between signed and spoken languages
associated with the channel of information transmission (i.e., differences in
sensorimotor and phonological processing) create a situation in which the construct
of language transfer has little or no discernable impact with respect to the domain
of phonology (see Gass &amp; Selinker, 1983, for an overview of language transfer).
When L1 and L2 are both spoken languages, L1 serves as a basis for L2 acquisition,
and language transfer is presumed to influence the learning process across all
linguistic domains. In contrast, when L1 is a spoken language and L2 is a signed
language, transfer cannot influence the acquisition of L2 phonology because of the
fundamental differences associated with the channels of information transmission.
Although language transfer does not appear to have any influence on the acquisition
of L2 phonology in this situation, it generally would be assumed to influence the
acquisition of other 2 linguistic domains in the L2 (e.g., morphology and syntax).
The purpose of the present study is to investigate the ability of adult learners to
discern when differences in sign formation are contrastive and when they are not. In
addressing this issue, we examine the relative difficulty of specific linguistic
properties of ASL (i.e., the phonological properties of movement, handshape,
location, and orientation, along with aspects of morphology), combined with natural
(free) variation in the production of utterances across signers. As such, this study
addresses variation from a very general perspective involving sublexical properties
of ASL and natural differences in production across signers.<component x="65.52"

individuals participated in the study. The participant sample was composed of 127
hearing adult learners at beginning and intermediate levels of ASL proficiency and 10
Deaf adult native signers. Most of the learners were enrolled in credit-bearing
college-level ASL courses in either the foreign language or interpreting education
programs at the Rochester Institute of Technology, and a few were enrolled in
noncredit courses designed for faculty and staff at the same institution. The hearing
subjects' participation was completely voluntary and they were not compensated for
their time. The Deaf subjects, however, were paid a nominal fee for their
participation. The hearing participants were drawn from three different sign language
instructional programs. The curriculum and student learning outcomes differed from
one ASL program to another. Student ability levels within a given course also tended
to vary. Therefore, fine-grained distinctions in participants' ASL abilities could
not be determined based on their course enrollment. Keeping this in mind, the
distribution of the hearing participants' ASL ability is reported in highly general
terms. Specifically, 111 participants were enrolled in courses designed for learners
at beginning levels of proficiency (ASL I, II, and III) and 16 were enrolled in
courses appropriate for students at the intermediate level (ASL V). Stimuli The
stimuli consisted of 48 items, which were divided into six categories of 8 items
each. Five of the categories included contrasts in specific linguistic properties of
ASL, and one was a general response category. Four categories represented the
parameters of location, orientation, handshape, and movement. The fifth category,
referred to as complex morphology, contained contrasts in directionality, number
incorporation, noun classifier usage, and verb inflection (two items each). The
complex morphology category is defined very broadly because it covers a range of
forms. Importantly, the contrasts in this category are associated with phonological
changes in ASL formational parameters; that is, the contrasts in complex morphology
reflect changes at both the phonological and morphological levels of structure and,
as such, may be considered morphophonological contrasts. Even though the category of
complex morphology differs from the purely phonological categories of location,
orientation, handshape, and movement, it represents a class of important linguistic
distinctions in ASL that must be recognized and acquired by learners in much the same
manner as phonetic categories. The final category did not contain a linguistic
contrast of any kind and is referred to as "Same." In the "Same" category, each trial
consists of a repetition of the target (model) sentence; hence, the correct response
to each trial is "Same." The description of ASL phonology used in this investigation
reflects approaches used prior to the Movement-Hold Model (Liddell &amp; Johnson,
1989). As such, our approach to ASL phonology may be considered oversimplified from
the current perspective of sign language linguistics. Nevertheless, the approach
taken in this study is justified because it forms the basis of a useful pedagogical
grammar and reflects an important dimension of sign language processing. More recent
approaches to ASL phonology (e.g., Brentari, 1998; Liddell &amp; Johnson, 1989) seem
less suitable from a pedagogical perspective, and this point is pertinent because the
present study focuses on learners. Additionally, the approach to ASL phonology
adopted in this study enables comparisons to be made with previous research
concerning native and highly skilled signers' processing of formational parameters
(e.g., Fischer &amp; Tartter, 1985; Tartter &amp; Fisher, 1982). Table 1 illustrates
the linguistic contrasts included in the stimulus set by presenting English glosses
of ASL sentences as exemplars of each category. . The drawing in Figure 1 depicts the
location Contrasting forms are underlined contrast illustrated in Table 1 and in the
example below. A complete list of the test items included within each linguistic
category appears in Appendix S1 in the online Supporting Information. Neither Table 1
nor the appendix, however, includes "Same" items because these items do not contain
linguistic contrasts, as mentioned earlier. Each item was comprised of two pairs of
ASL sentences. Each sentence pair consisted of a model (standard) sentence followed
by a comparison sentence.<component x="55.18" y="135.35" width="310.85"

signers always produced the model sentences. The female signer always produced the
first comparison sentence, and the other male signer always produced the second
comparison sentence. Utterances were recorded over a 4-day period in which the
signers and investigators worked together to ensure clarity, accuracy, and
consistency of sign production. Specifically, the signers discussed the formational
details of sign production with each other and three of the investigators who are
fluent Deaf ASL users. During the recording sessions, the signers observed one
another, paying particular attention to the production of the model sentences. At the
same time, the three Deaf investigators monitored sign production across the three
signers. The utterances were digitally recorded in a TV studio by a professional
videographer. The lighting and background were carefully selected to provide
high-quality images. Each signer produced at least three utterances (tokens) of each
sentence in succession. After the recording sessions, the three Deaf investigators
reviewed the recordings and identified specific utterances for presentation to
participants using the criteria of clarity, accuracy, and consistency of sign
production. The selected utterances were then excised from the master video and
recorded on DVD in a randomized order. This procedure assured that the utterance
tokens presented to participants were clear, accurate, and consistent and that the
contrasts included within each linguistic category truly represented the category.
Natural variation was observed among the signers in their production of utterances;
but this variation did not influence meaning. For example, one of the "Same" items
included the sign for SISTER. Although all three signers clearly signed SISTER,
minor, appropriate subphonemic variations in sign formation were observed.
Specifically, two of the signers produced the sign beginning with contact at the side
of the chin. The beginning place of contact for the other signer was at the middle of
the chin. Similar variation across signers may have occurred in the form of small
subphonemic (within-category) differences in the degree of finger splay, thumb
opposition, joint activity, and other aspects of sign formation. The recorded
utterances were played to individuals and groups of participants in classroom
settings. The groups ranged in size from 2 to 19 individuals. The recordings were
played on a DVD player or computer, and the images were projected onto a large screen
at the front of the room. Procedure A paired-comparison discrimination task was used
in this investigation. Participants were presented with a model sentence immediately
followed by a comparison sentence, and they were required to judge whether the
stimuli were the "Same" or "Different." This procedure follows from previous work on
the auditory recognition of speech. Bochner, Garrison, Sussman, and Burkard (2003)
used a very similar paired-comparison discrimination task to study differences in
listeners' ability to discriminate among spoken utterances as a function of
linguistic (phonetic) properties of the signals as well as the sensory capabilities
of the listeners (degree of hearing loss) and listening conditions (quiet vs. noise
background). Bochner, Garrison, Palmer, Mackenzie, and Braveman (1997) also conducted
a speech recognition study using a discrimination task resembling the one used in the
present investigation. As mentioned previously, each item consisted of two pairs of
sentence stimuli. Participants were required to make a discrimination judgment for
each pair of sentences. Therefore, each item consisted of two trials-one for each
pair of stimuli. The model stimulus was presented first, followed by a one second
interstimulus interval. The first comparison sentence was then presented, followed by
a 3-second response interval. The participants responded to the first trial during
this time by circling "S" or "D" on an answer sheet to indicate same or different. At
the conclusion of the response interval, a brief flash of light was projected on the
screen accompanied by an audible tone. These visual and auditory signals were
intended to alert participants that the next stimulus was about to be presented. The
same model stimulus was presented again, followed by a 1-second interstimulus
interval and then the second comparison stimulus. Finally, the second response
interval was presented (3 seconds), and participants indicated their response ("S" or
"D") to the second trial on the answer sheet. The two trials comprising each item
were presented consecutively (one after the other) because previous research using a
very similar discrimination procedure indicated no influence attributable to memory
(recency) effects (Bochner et al. 1997, 2003) and because using consecutive trials
could lead directly to the development of an assessment protocol based on this
procedure (e.g., a computerized adaptive test of ASL discrimination ability). Each
stimulus was labeled with a caption on the lower left portion of the screen. The
model sentence was labeled "Model," and the comparison sentences were labeled to
identify the item number and trial. The first trial for each item was labeled "a" and
the second trial was labeled "b." For example, the first trial for the first item was
labeled "1a" and the second trial for the first item was labeled "1b"; the first
trial for the second item was labeled "2a" and the second trial for the second item
was labeled "2b"; and so on. The captioned labels on the screen corresponded to the
labels on the answer sheet. After a brief explanation of the task in which
participants were instructed to respond "Same" if the utterances in each pair had the
same meaning and "Different" if the utterances in each pair had a different meaning,
six practice items were presented to ensure understanding of the procedure. The
practice items illustrated contrasts in movement, location, orientation, and complex
morphology (one item each). Two practice items illustrated the "Same" category. In
this way, the practice items exposed participants to every item category except
handshape and provided them with a direct and practical orientation to the task. The
combination of instructions and practice items, therefore, served to familiarize
participants with the procedure. Data collection was begun after the practice items
were presented and the examiner(s) was certain that the participants understood the
task. The entire procedure required about 50 minutes to complete, including
explanations and practice items. For any item, every possible combination of "Same"
and "Different" trials could occur; that is, an item could consist of two "Same"
trials, two "Different" trials, or one trial of each. In order to reveal meaningful
information using a discrimination procedure of the sort employed in this
investigation, items must contain a linguistic contrast. Therefore, every item within
each linguistic category (location, orientation, handshape, movement, and complex
morphology) contained at least one contrast (i.e., at least one "Different" trial).
In other words, within each linguistic category (location, orientation, handshape,
movement, and complex morphology), an item could contain either two "Different"
trials or one "Same" and one "Different" trial. Half of the eight test items within
each linguistic category listed in Appendix S1 in the online Supporting Information
contained one "Different" trial and the other half contained two "Different" trials.
The determination of which specific items were assigned one "Different" trial and
which were assigned two "Different" trials was done randomly. As mentioned
previously, one category of items did not contain any linguistic contrasts; in other
words, both trials were verbatim repetitions of the model sentence. It was necessary
to include a category of items composed of two "Same" trials as foils to minimize the
potential for response bias in the participant sample. The reader is referred to
Appendix S1 in the online Supporting Information for additional details and
clarification concerning the test items.<component x="65.52" y="71.69" width="310.85"

composed of two trials, and participants' responses can be considered a set of 48
items or a set of 96 trials. Because the responses can be analyzed from either the
perspective of 48 items or 96 trials, we begin by comparing scoring outcomes for the
set of 48 items to the set of 96 trials. Each trial is simply scored correct or
incorrect. Because a trial consists of two response alternatives ("S" or "D"),
chance-level performance for a given trial is 50%. The mean number of correct trials
across the entire participant sample was 73.82 (SD 9.06). In contrast, an item is
considered correct if and only = if the response to both trials is correct. No
partial credit is awarded. Scoring each item as a block of two trials reduces the
chance level of performance to 25%. The mean number of correct items across the
entire participant sample was 30.95 (SD 6.73). = A correlation analysis was conducted
to examine the relationship between participants' responses scored as a set of 96
trials and as a set of 48 items. The results indicated that the two scoring methods
are essentially equivalent (r .98, = p &lt; .0001). This finding indicates that no
information is lost in treating the data as a set of 48 items and, following other
studies using similar procedures (Bochner et al. 1997, 2003), all subsequent analyses
are based on this dataset. Treating the data as a set of 48 items is considered
preferable because it reduces chance-level performance and facilitates the
interpretation of results.<component x="55.18" y="71.69" width="310.85"

to compare the relative difficulty of each of the 48 items. The results of this
analysis indicated that the difficulty of individual items ranged from 20.4% to 92.7%
correct. Eleven items had difficulty values less than 50% correct; 20 items had
difficulty values in the range from 50% to 75%; and 17 items had difficulty values
greater than 75%. Performance on only one item was below chance level, and this item
involved a movement contrast (SERIOUS vs. DISAPPOINTING). Importantly, an estimate of
internal consistency reliability was computed using Cronbach's coefficient alpha. The
alpha reliability coefficient was .81, indicating a reasonably high degree of
reliability and consistency within the item set. The alpha coefficient also indicates
that, taken together, the items measure a single unidimensional latent construct,
which we define as a measure of ASL discrimination ability. The participant sample
can be divided into three broad levels of ASL proficiency: a large group of
beginners, a small group of intermediate-level learners, and a small group of native
signers. Table 2 displays the mean number and proportion of correct responses (based
on 48 items) for each group of participants along with the standard deviation. A
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test for differences between
groups, and the results were significant with F(2,134) 38.54, p &lt; .0001, and with
an effect size of = 2 .365. The results of post hoc tests indicated that the
difference between the &#x3B7; = beginning and intermediate groups and the difference
between the beginning and native groups were significant (p &lt; .0001). The
difference between the intermediate and native groups was not significant (p .0823).

involved the presentation of degraded signals to small samples of highly proficient
Deaf signers, the present investigation used fully intelligible (normal) signals
presented to a relatively large sample of hearing adult learners of ASL as an L2 and
a small sample of Deaf native signers. The results indicated that the discrimination
task distinguished beginners from participants classified at both the intermediate
and native levels of ASL proficiency. The small sample size in the intermediate (N
16) and native = (N 10) groups, however, prevented the difference between them from
reach= ing statistical significance. The overall pattern of results, including their
consistency with previous research (e.g., Fischer &amp; Tartter, 1985; Tartter &amp;
Fischer, 1982) and the superior performance of the native signers, attests to the
validity of the task. Even though the native signers performed quite well on the task
overall (86% correct), their performance as a group was slightly lower than expected.
In particular, four members of the group scored below 63% on complex morphology
contrasts and three scored below 63% on movement contrasts. This finding indicates
that some complex morphology and movement contrasts were especially difficult, even
for native signers. Nevertheless, the 10 native signers performed very well on four
of the six item categories, scoring 90% or higher on location, 3 handshape,
orientation, and "Same" items. In order to be absolutely certain that these findings
are accurate, the investigators double-checked the data collection procedure,
stimuli, and data analysis. No irregularities or anomalies were discovered.
Therefore, it seems that just as some spoken utterances can be misinterpreted by
native speakers as a result of phonetic confusions, some signed utterances can be
misinterpreted by native signers for the same reason. In other words, just as two
distinct utterances sometimes sound alike in speech, two distinct utterances
sometimes look alike in sign. Moreover, data from this study show that perceptual
confusions in sign are not randomly distributed; rather, they are most likely to
occur within the categories of movement and complex morphology. The distribution of
scores across participant groups along with the effect 2 .365) show that the task is
sensitive to a wide of group membership (&#x3B7; = range of differences in ability.
The sensitivity of the task, in turn, follows from the fact that item difficulty is
distributed in a fairly uniform manner, with similar numbers of items classified at
low (greater than 75% correct), moderate (50-75% correct), and high (less than 50%
correct) levels of difficulty. Given the results presented in Table 3 and Figure 2,
it is not surprising that 11 of the 12 most difficult items were members of the
movement, complex morphology, and "Same" categories. Similarly, 9 of the 12 easiest
items were members of the location, orientation, and handshape categories. With
regard to performance across linguistic categories, the results of this study
indicate the following hierarchy of difficulty: (a) Movement contrasts are the most
difficult; (b) complex morphology and "Same" contrasts are moderately difficult; (c)
handshape and orientation contrasts are relatively easy; and (d) location contrasts
are easiest. These findings are largely consistent with those of studies using highly
proficient and native Deaf signers presented with signals under normal and degraded
viewing conditions. Specifically, movement contrasts generally have been found to be
the most difficult, location contrasts the easiest, and handshape and orientation
contrasts of intermediate difficulty in studies reported by Tartter and Fischer
(1982), Fischer and Tartter (1985), and Fischer et al. (1999). The relative
difficulty of movement contrasts is consistent with Brentari's (1998) analysis of ASL
phonology. In her analysis, Brentari associated the parameter of movement with
perceptual salience/visibility, proposing "the more proximal the joint articulating
the movement is to the midline of the body, the greater the degree of sonority" (p.
217). In terms of Brentari's sonority hierarchy for ASL, the movement contrasts
included in this study, for the most part, are associated with moderate perceptual
salience/visibility. Many of these contrasts involve the wrist joint and have
sonority values in the vicinity of 4 on Brentari's 6-point scale (also see Emmorey's,
2002, analysis of movement, and Hildebrandt &amp; Corina, 2002). Similarly, the
difficulty of handshape contrasts appears generally consistent with findings
regarding the role of experience with ASL in the perception of handshape (Baker,
2003; Emmorey et al., 2003; also see Morford et al., 2008). The performance of native
signers on handshape contrasts was 92.5% correct; the performance of intermediate
learners was 85.9% correct; and the performance of beginning learners was 68.5%
correct. Finally, the relative ease with which location contrasts are perceived is
consistent with data on the acquisition of ASL as an L1 (Conlin, Mirus, Mauk, &amp;
Meier, 2000; Marentette &amp; Mayberry, 2000). Unlike previous research, the present
study included morphological contrasts, and the results indicated that contrasts
involving complex morphology were relatively difficult. Complex morphology is known
to pose a challenge for ASL learners (especially late learners) because the
distinctions included in this domain of ASL grammar are relatively subtle and
acquired fairly late in the acquisition process (Emmorey, 2002; Gee &amp; Goodhart,
1988). Because complex morphology contrasts generally co-occurred with contrasts in
one of the phonological parameters included in this investigation, the dataset was
examined to compare performance on specific complex morphology contrasts to
performance on items including contrasts in the corresponding phonological parameter.
In particular, performance on items containing contrasts in number incorporation
(69.3% correct) was found to be comparable to performance on items containing
contrasts in handshape (72% correct); performance on items containing contrasts in
verb inflection (39.1% correct) was slightly worse than performance on items
containing contrasts in movement (53%); and performance on items containing contrasts
in directionality (83.9% correct), which is described in terms of the location
parameter in current approaches to ASL phonology, was slightly better than
performance on items containing contrasts in location (77% correct). This pattern of
results suggests that the difficulty of complex morphology contrasts may tend to
reflect the difficulty of recognizing 4 In this regard, the results a contrast in the
associated phonological parameter. indicate that the subcategory of directionality
within complex morphology tends to be comparatively easy (as is the case with
location contrasts); the subcategory of number incorporation tends to be of
intermediate difficulty (as is the case with handshape contrasts); and the
subcategory of verb inflection tends to be most difficult (as is the case with
movement contrasts). However, it also must be mentioned that performance on the
category of noun classifier usage was quite poor (less than 35% correct), suggesting
that other factors influence the difficulty of complex morphology contrasts in
addition to the inherent difficulty of the associated phonological parameter. The
present study also included a category without any contrasting linguistic
information. Data indicate that "Same" items were approximately equal in difficulty
to complex morphology contrasts. The relative difficulty of "Same" items in this
study is surprising given the fact that "Same" items have proven to be exceptionally
easy in previous research using a similar discrimination task with speech stimuli
(Bochner et al. 1997, 2003) as well as in numerous other studies using same-different
judgments in perceptual comparisons (Bochner, Garrison, &amp; Palmer, 1992; Farell,
1985). Careful inspection of the data, however, indicates that the performance of the
native signers is consistent with expectations based on previous research using
discrimination tasks. The native signers' responses to "Same" items were correct 90%
of the time, demonstrating that these items were very easy for them. Therefore, the
surprisingly poor performance on "Same" items in this study may be attributed to the
fact that the participant sample was comprised primarily of language learners,
especially beginners, whose experience with ASL was very limited. It is likely that
learners often attend to small subphonemic differences in sign production and
incorrectly perceive utterance tokens that are the same as being similar (but not
identical) to one another. In this regard, Bohn (2002) pointed out that the
perception of phonetic similarity depends on factors such as the observer's language
background and experience and that similar utterance tokens (i.e., utterances that
are in close proximity to one another in phonetic space) are more difficult for L2
learners to categorize than dissimilar utterance tokens (i.e., utterances distal from
one another in phonetic space). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the
difficulty of "Same" items in the present study follows from participants' background
as spoken language users and their lack of experience with signed languages. As
occurs in the acquisition of L2 speech, learners' background and experience with the
target language influence their processing of phonetic similarity in the acquisition
of a signed language as an L2.<component x="65.52" y="71.72" width="310.86"

hierarchy of difficulty among linguistic properties of ASL found in this study has
potential application in projects involving the development and use of communication
technology for signed languages. For example, the hierarchy of difficulty may be used
in evaluating the efficacy of information transmission for sign language
communication via video technologies, such as computer video, video conferencing, and
videophones. Specifically, technologies that are best at transmitting movement
information are likely to provide the most effective media for communication using
signed languages. The results of this study emphasize the importance of
distinguishing contrastive from noncontrastive differences in the acquisition of
signed languages. Differentiating contrastive from noncontrastive differences in sign
formation presents an especially formidable challenge for learners at beginning
levels of proficiency (Mayberry, 1995). For learners having no prior experience with
signed languages, acquiring the sensorimotor (visual and spatial) and phonological
skills necessary for attaining proficiency is a need that educational programs must
address in a deliberate and systematic manner (Mirus, Rathmann, &amp; Meier, 2001;
Rosen, 2004). Students must learn to detect contrastive differences and overlook
noncontrastive differences in the course of acquiring linguistic knowledge.
Therefore, the development of ASL curricula and delivery of ASL instruction should
strive to facilitate learners' ability to identify fundamental linguistic contrasts
of the sort addressed in this study and, in so doing, address the important issue of
variation from the perspective of both allophonic variation and variation across
signers. Moreover, approaches to the assessment of ASL proficiency could benefit from
the evaluation of learners' ability to discriminate linguistic contrasts. In
particular, the discrimination procedure used in this study appears very promising
and should be considered in the development of a practical receptive measure of ASL
ability. Theoretical Implications The construct of language transfer plays an
important role in the acquisition of L2 phonology in spoken languages. In contrast,
the acquisition of ASL and other natural sign languages does not involve phonological
transfer in situations in which L1 is a spoken language and L2 is a signed language
because of fundamental differences between signed and spoken languages associated
with 5 Such differences are readily apparthe channel of information transmission. ent
when approached from the perspective of contrastive linguistics. Taking a contrastive
linguistics approach and combining it with Mayberry's (1995) findings concerning the
relationship of phonological errors to learners' experience with ASL (especially in
childhood) leads to the prediction that L2 learners of signed languages, especially
adult learners, will face a formidable challenge in acquiring the phonology of the
signed language in situations in which their L1 is a spoken language. Of course, the
relative difficulty of ASL phonology is ultimately a question that must be addressed
in empirical studies. At this point, however, our prediction concerning the
difficulty of ASL phonology may be considered a working hypothesis, and the results
of the present investigation 6 are consistent with this hypothesis. One specific
challenge facing learners of signed languages related to the difference between
speech and sign might pertain to the fact that the production of signs is directly
observable, but the production of speech is not. Speech production occurs largely
within the oral cavity, so the articulation of speech sounds cannot be directly
observed. In contrast, the production of signs occurs outside the body and is fully
accessible to observers. This distinction might have important implications with
regard to learners' processing of variation and the acquisition of phonetic
categories. In particular, Stevens (1972, 1989) described nonlinearities in the
relationship between vocal articulation (input) and the acoustic signal (output) in
terms of a quantal theory of speech. Quantal theory is associated with nonlinearities
in speech pertaining to the fact that large changes in articulation sometimes have
small effects on the acoustic characteristics of the signal, whereas, conversely,
small changes in articulation sometimes result in large changes in acoustic output.
In short, the quantal theory of speech is based largely on the fact that
"articulatory movements are not equal in their acoustic consequences" (Kent, 1997, p.
412) as well as on data indicating similar nonlinearities in auditory-acoustic
relations. Importantly, the nonlinear relationship between articulation and the
acoustic signal accommodates variation in vocal tract configurations and works
synergistically with auditory perception so that speech sounds with certain
well-defined acoustic attributes are perceived categorically. It also has been
suggested from a developmental and evolutionary perspective that the tendency for
nonlinear (quantal) relations among "acoustic, auditory and articulatory parameters
is a principal factor shaping the inventory of acoustic and articulatory attributes
that are used to signal distinctions in language" (Stevens, 1989, p. 3). Because the
production of signs is directly observable, the relationship between the articulation
of signs and the manual signal is completely linear because the articulation of signs
is the signal. The linear relationship between articulation and the signal may have
specific consequences for signed languages with regard to phonological variation and
the development of phonetic categories. If a nonlinear relationship accommodates
variation in speech, it may be assumed that a linear relationship would have the
opposite effect in sign, providing relatively limited tolerance for variation. This
is a provocative assumption, but it is clearly speculative and greatly oversimplified
because variation is abundant in ASL and other signed languages. An important area
for future research, therefore, is to describe variation in signed languages and its
impact on their acquisition from the perspectives of both production and perception.
In this regard, it is likely that a highly detailed phonetic transcription system for
signed languages recently developed by Johnson (2008) can facilitate such research
(Chen Pichler, 2009). Languages associate linguistic signals with meaning through a
set of principles or rules described by a grammar. Acoustic signals are associated
with meaning in the case of spoken languages, and visual-manual signals are
associated with meaning in the case of signed languages. In either case, users,
especially learners, must determine when changes in the linguistic signal correspond
to changes in meaning; that is, they must be able to discern when a difference is
really different. Accordingly, the use and acquisition of language depend crucially
on individuals' ability to effectively distinguish contrastive from noncontrastive
differences. The results of the present study strongly emphasize this point. The
ability to differentiate contrastive from noncontrastive differences in ASL, as in
any other language, serves as a foundation for communication and acquisition. As
such, the results of this study contribute to the field of applied linguistics, in
general, and have special relevance for the acquisition of signed languages, in
particular.<component x="55.18" y="71.71" width="310.86" height="60.67" page="19"

group of people who share a common language (ASL) and culture. Lowercase deaf denotes
people with hearing loss (Padden &amp; Humphries, 1988). 2 Although phonological
transfer cannot occur in the situation in which L1 is a spoken language and L2 is a
signed language, phonological (and cognitive) universals can still influence the
course of acquisition at an abstract, underlying level of structure. 3 Native
signers' performance on each of the six item categories was as follows: location 95%
correct; handshape 92.5% correct; orientation 92.5% correct; = = = movement 76.3%
correct; complex morphology 72.5% correct; "Same" 90% = = = correct. 4 For the two
items reflecting noun classifier usage, one contained a contrast in handshape and the
other contained a contrast in location. As such, a single comparison involving both
of these items was not possible. Performance on this category was very poor, with
participants scoring less than 35% correct. 5 It has been suggested that hearing
adult learners' familiarity with conventional communicative gestures may influence
their acquisition of handshape contrasts in ASL through the mechanism of transfer
(Chen Pichler, 2009, 2011). Even if this suggestion is supported by additional data,
the influence of communicative gestures cannot be considered a form of language
transfer because gestures fall outside the realm of language and within the domain of
paralinguistic or extralinguistic behavior. 2 .365) in this study indicates that

associated with participants' ASL proficiency and, as such, provides further evidence
that the effects of phonological processing observed in Mayberry's (1995) studies are

phonological processing also has an important influence on L2 acquisition.<component
