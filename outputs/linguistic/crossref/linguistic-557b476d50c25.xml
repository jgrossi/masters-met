constantly display assumptions about matters that they talk about. These assumptions
are not always correct and may be adjusted by other participants who present
themselves as having more information or more authority on the matter. In
interaction, different human experiences and perspectives are brought together,
expressed in the temporally constrained turns within sequences of action. Implicit
and explicit knowledge is displayed in speaker turns and it is also contested on the
turn-by-turn basis. All of this is enabled by grammars that allow speakers to express
various degrees of knowledge and may have developed special formats for carrying out
different kinds of social action. Many grammatical formats for expressing knowledge
states and sources have already been thoroughly described in the literature on
language. Evidential devices are used for showing the type of access the speaker has
to the information, epistemic markers indicate the degree of speaker certainty. In
addition, some grammatical devices are adapted to the task of conveying more subtle
assumptions about the matter at hand. For example, a question in a specific form
(positive/negative, with a tag or not) is heard as conducive of a certain kind of
answer, thereby displaying speaker assumptions on what the &#xA8; answer will be
(Sadock and Zwicky, 1985; Konig and Siemund, 2007). Thus, even though the authority
to answer is rendered to the recipient of the question, the asker may indicate the
degree of her own epistemic certainty. These assumptions and allusions need not be
explicit but occasionally their existence can be proven by the subsequent behavior of
other participants. Speakers can explicitly formulate an understanding of what the
recipient of the allusive formulation conveyed<component x="36.85" y="121.13"

articulate a 'missing' element of the addressee's preceding talk (Bolden, 2010),
making public something that was only implicitly present in another participant's
talk. Another example of a similar issue is that the first person to utter a
statement on a subject in a conversation also makes an implicit claim that she has
epistemic rights to the subject. Other participants may publicly confront this covert
assumption (Heritage and Raymond, 2005). One strategy for doing that in English is to
repeat the prior speaker's claim with a stress on the non-reduced copula (Stivers,
2005), another one in Finnish second assessments is to use the clitic -kin, which
indicates independent access to the topic (Hakulinen et al., 2004:808). These are
some examples of how linguistic structures can be employed to deal with matters that
were only implicit in a prior turn. The current study contributes to this line of
research, looking at the grammatical enclitic -gi/-ki in Estonian, which is used for
countering the assumptions expressed by a prior speaker or held previously by the
speaker herself. It is a device for the speaker of a subsequent turn to make salient
an epistemic gap between the current and a prior contribution and contest what was
assumed there. Occasionally, this implies that the just-prior action is not responded
to in the way the response was projected, resulting in a disaligning turn. Access to
knowledge and authority to express the knowledge are closely intertwined with
opportunities of alignment and affiliation in social interaction (as discussed across
many contributions in the recent volume by Stivers et al. (2011a)). The current paper
focuses on the Estonian enclitic in a specific sequential position: when it is used
in turns that are reactive to something that has just happened, either in the
conversation or in the context of talk. This position constitutes a subsection of the
overall usage of the enclitic, supposedly representing its most dialogic facet. A
clitic is a grammatically independent and phonologically dependent morpheme. A
proclitic attaches before the word and an enclitic after it. An enclitic can only
appear with a host, which in the case of gi/-ki is basically any word, including
nouns, verbs, adjectives and postpositions. -gi/-ki lacks prosodic independence, even
though it may occasionally carry the main stress of the utterance. The enclitic is
pronounced as a fortis (k) after voiceless sounds and as a lenis (g) after voiced
ones, which shows its phonological dependence. Examples of its application are
thus:<component x="41.16" y="450.8" width="466.26" height="238.08" page="2"

lateness="0.125" reference_score="4.71">The grammatical status of -gi/-ki is still
being discussed. It has been characterized as an affixal particle (Tauli, 1972:93)
but in the last comprehensive grammar it is interchangeably called an affix, a modal
adverb, and a particle (Erelt et al., 1993:39, 1995:159,164). Its functions have been
said to range from focusing to simple connecting, to marking of concessivity and
surprise (Tauli, 1980:213-215; Erelt et al., 1995). In Finnish grammar, which is a
close genealogical relative of Estonian, &#xA8; &#xA8; the corresponding item -kin
(-kaan/kaan in the negative) has been characterized as expressing speaker
expectations, showing that her expectations were confirmed or contradicted (Hakulinen
et al., 2004:807). It has also been suggested in the literature on Estonian that
-gi/-ki has to do with expectations (Erelt et al., 1995:100; Metslang, 2002; Sang,
1983:44-45). In short, the semantics and pragmatics of the enclitic have seemed quite
elusive. The -gi/-ki has also lexicalized with a number of adverbs, such as ikkagi
'still', pealegi 'in addition to', and siiski 'nevertheless', resulting in
morphologically non-transparent words for present-day speakers. Syntactically -gi/-ki
is not applied according to the order of the words in the clause. Instead, the
pragmatic effect it achieves depends on which type of word it is attached to
(Metslang, 2002). Therefore, it is important to study its functions separately in
different word classes, and the current paper only looks at verbs. At the same time,
the scope of -gi/-ki has been claimed to be the whole sentence, not a single word or
phrase (Tauli, 1980:212-215; Erelt et al., 1995:100). The present study shows that
its area of operation is even wider than the sentence, namely, conversational
sequence. The theoretical aim of the paper is to demonstrate how a bound grammatical
element functions across speakers and turns, dealing with the emergent status of
knowledge and rights to knowledge. Pragmatic particles have been shown to function
like that. For example, in Mandarin Chinese the final particles ou and a point out a
gap between participants' knowledge and display expectations about the matter at hand
(Wu, 2004). In order to explain the role of the enclitic -gi/-ki, it needs to be
similarly scrutinized in relation to prior talk and, crucially, with regard to what
the prior speaker has conveyed about his/her knowledge state and underlying
assumptions. The present paper aims to show that in interactional data the
contradicting or following of expectations can be empirically traced. One speaker
says something that reveals her underlying assumptions, which are explicitly refuted
by the next speaker with the help of the enclitic. The function of the enclitic can
be elucidated by taking into account what has happened in the conversation so far and
what the current speaker aims to do in relation to that. This is where the implicit
''expectations'' are at public display and may be explicitly oriented to by the next
speaker. Thereby the expectations also become empirically available for the
researcher and enable a functional analysis of the enclitic, grounded in
participants' observable actions. The study thus illustrates how intuitive matters
can be dealt with analytically.<component x="41.16" y="114.72" width="466.26"

face-to-face interaction have been used from a video recording of a preparation of a
Christmas dinner (2 hours) and from the publicly available Tartu corpus of Spoken
Estonian (http://www.cl.ut.ee/suuline/ Korpus.php), which includes shorter excerpts
of talk from a wide variety of situations. The corpus is constantly growing. The
version used for this study included about 300,000 words and 30 hours of talk. About
one-third of the data come from institutional settings but the enclitic does not seem
to reflect specifically institutional practices, apart from the bias that it is often
the representative of the institution who displays knowledge and authority on the
subject. In these two corpora 323 instances of -gi/-ki usage were registered
(excluding the lexicalized items). The majority of these, 226, were attached to
verbs, which are in focus here. The very frequent occurrence with verbs supports the
choice of pattern for this study. At least in spoken usage, the enclitic usage with
other word classes is much less frequent and functionally heterogeneous. For example,
its use with nouns generally implies addition, 'too, also', a function that should be
studied in its own right. As the aim of this paper is to reveal the interactional and
interpersonal facet of -gi/-ki, the core of the data is constituted by the dialogic
instances where the turn involving a verb + -gi/-ki is an immediate reaction to some
action by another participant or something that has just happened. The reason for
this delimitation is that earlier work on more monologic data has resulted in the
above broad accounts of ''expectations'', which are of course in some sense correct
but have nevertheless relied entirely on researcher intuition and native competence.
In contrast, a look at more dialogic cases reveals empirically how the expectations
are publicly displayed, recalibrated and reacted to by participants using grammar in
real time. For one thing, this approach reveals that even in cases that could
superficially be interpreted as ''following expectations'' actually subtly contradict
some aspect of the prior turn. The dialogic restriction leaves us with 111 cases.
Within this database, there appeared three general patterns, all of which have to do
with knowledge or authority 1 assumptions, either those previously held by the
speaker herself or the ones made by another participant. In the following, it will be
shown how a piece of bound grammar can be used to mark subtle turn-by-turn shifts in
relative knowledge status and oppose or adjust implicit assumptions in prior
talk.<component x="36.85" y="450.79" width="466.28" height="238.08" page="3"

pre-existing state, since access to knowledge may be granted in the course of an
interactive event. Participants' state of knowledge may change from moment to moment
when information is produced by other participants or discovered in the surround. The
speakers may mark the change-of-knowledge-state with turn-initial particles in
subsequent turns (Heritage, 1984) but they may also verbally expand on what exactly
the changed state is about. One grammatical option for doing the expansion in
Estonian is to use the verb + -gi/-ki pattern, as it underlines that something
previously held valid by the speaker has turned out to be not so. In example (1) Piia
is marking a change in her understanding of Anu's knowledge state, and related to
that, her prior assumption about Anu's knowledge. Before the excerpt Piia has been
telling about her mother receiving a TV-set as a present. The story comes to the end
in lines (1-4) where Piia summarizes that the TV-set was a surprise to the immediate
family. This statement is followed by a generic repair-initiator from Anu, displaying
problems with what Piia just said. Anu's 'what?' leads Piia to realize that this fact
was news to Anu, as we can see in her subsequent turn that involves a verb + enclitic
(line 6). All the names in the excerpts are pseudonyms. The pragmatically adequate
translation of -gi/-ki into English implies heavy stress on some element of the
clause or some syntactic focusing pattern. Therefore, the enclitic is often
untraceable in the idiomatic English line. Sometimes words such as indeed and really
provide a match.<component x="36.85" y="262.52" width="466.28" height="154.4"

demonstrated cases with negative formulations, which is not surprising since one of
the regular functions of the negative is to mark that an expectation is not
fulfilled. The enclitic, however, can equally well appear in a positive clause, which
shows that it marks a change in the speaker's state of knowledge independently of the
polarity. In excerpt (5) from the beginning of a phone call a speaker draws a
conclusion based on the circumstances, quite similarly to the prior excerpt. Esko
answers his job phone and Kaire concludes that he is at work, which is apparently
unexpected to the extent that it is mentioned. In line (4) Kaire marks that she has
just changed her assumption that the contrary may have been the case. Indeed, she has
called Esko's office and must have had some information as to his whereabouts.
However, place of the call-taker is not regularly formulated in calls to land lines
and if his presence at work was entirely commonplace, it would not have been worth
mentioning at all. With the help of the enclitic Kaire shows that she now has
epistemic access to the information that enables her to produce the statement. The
conclusion is formulated in positive polarity.<component x="41.16" y="311.73"

The enclitic formalizes the link backward in time, its domain is the current turn
plus the immediately prior discourse or context against which the change has taken
place. The temporal dimension of the domain varies in regard to the specific actions.
The affected action-span may be somewhat longer when it concerns an inappropriately
recipient-designed story (example 1) and somewhat shorter when it is a result of a
noticing in the physical surround (example 3). In any case, the domain of the
enclitic is larger than a single clause, sentence or turn. Based on occurrence
regularities and the qualitative analysis, it can be claimed that verb + enclitic is
a format used to express adjustments in the knowledge state in the form of a clause.
As could be seen in examples (4-6), the turn-initial change-of-state token need not
be used in the turns involving the verb + enclitic. The enclitic on its own can
accomplish identical action from within the clause, i.e. later in the turn than the
change-of-state token does. That in itself is an important interactional affordance,
as it enables marking the news in a syntactically embedded way.<component x="41.16"

-gi/-ki is regularly used in clauses that mark the just-accomplished change in the
speaker's knowledge state, either as a result of an other participant's action or
some contextual matter. In the current section the same mechanism is shown to
function across speakers: one speaker conveys an implicit assumption and another one
counters it, publicly marking the need to adjust the first speaker's state of
knowledge or claimed social-informational status. This illustrates, among other
things, how knowledge emerges in discourse across time and is negotiated among the
participants. As a supplement to earlier studies on evidentiality that look at how
speakers code their level of certainty of &#xA8;&#xA8; knowledge or its source (Chafe
and Nichols, 1986; Fox, 2001; Karkkainen, 2003), the current section demonstrates how
a grammatical device figures in interpersonal negotiations on access to knowledge and
authority. Conversation analytic research in particular has been interested in how
speakers manage presuppositions of epistemic access (Stivers et al., &#xA8; &#xA8;
2011b:10), epistemic stance (Karkkainen, 2003; Wu, 2004) and epistemic primacy. The
latter is defined as ''asymmetries in the depth, specificity or completeness'' of
participants' knowledge (Stivers et al., 2011b:13). Speakers may have differential
access to a subject, and their access may be of varying depth and specificity, which
implies that they also enjoy a different degree of authority in regard to the matter.
The section first shows how a participant may subtly challenge the assumptions
displayed in a prior turn and display her superior epistemic access to the subject at
hand. Second, a participant may address the prior speaker's epistemic rights and
authority. The verb + -gi/-ki pattern is used for both of these tasks, as they are
closely related: higher authority often comes with better access to the matter. The
examples are arranged to show more of an emphasis on access first, and more emphasis
on authority later. Finally, it will be argued that concerns of authority go beyond
epistemic matters and that the enclitic may be used generally for establishing
speaker rights to decide on interactional and interpersonal matters.<component

assumption that the call can also be made at other times during the day. In the
following turn, the telemarketer refutes this assumption by using a clause with verb
+ enclitic.<component x="41.16" y="263.03" width="466.35" height="39.31" page="8"

aligns and complies in line (6), as he agrees to call in the evening. However, he
also chooses to set the record right in terms of his work schedule. This clearly
concerns the telemarketer's area of expertise and knowledge that he has access to. In
the continuation after the complying jaa 'yeah' he expresses something that he has
authority to know, in contrast to what the prior speaker merely assumed. In this way,
the telemarketer's turnexpansion is an adjustment from an epistemically strong
position. The verb + enclitic format allows the telemarketer to accomplish the
compliance projected in the prior turn while adjusting the assumption displayed there
and claiming firsthand knowledge on the issue. Part of the proof of his better
epistemic access is the addition of time notions, 'always' and 'every day', which are
used as evidence of his detailed knowledge of the work schedule. Example (8) is a
case where the caller to an office does not understand that the person who has
answered the phone is the one she usually talks to. This is expressed in lines (2-4),
where it becomes clear that the caller assumes she is not talking to Viiu Sisask. In
her response, VS reverses the caller's assumption with a clause involving the
enclitic. She obviously has access to her own identity and can thus make such a claim
form an epistemically strong and authoritative position.<component x="36.85"

speaker aligns with the action trajectory projected by the prior speaker, such as
agreeing to call in the evening (example 7) or to become a conversation partner
''whoever'' (example 8). However, the speaker simultaneously challenges an assumption
conveyed by the prior speaker. The implication is that the prior speaker was
mistaken, which can also be socially awkward, as in the above case when the answerer
of the phone is not recognized. In both excerpts (7-8) the producer of the enclitic
reacts to what the prior speaker has just said. The enclitic marks that the current
utterance is reactively tied to the immediately prior talk, it functions as a formal
connection between the current and the prior turn. Thus, the pattern of verb +
enclitic among other things constitutes a part of the intersubjective reactive
grammar of Estonian. It is used to formulate reactions to a prior action or event.
One type of prior events is questions. Even though a question officially treats the
recipient as more knowledgeable, it may be designed in a way that already displays
significant assumptions on the matter asked about. Thus, the answer may be formatted
with the enclitic pattern. For example, in (9) the telemarketer asks whether the
potential client's disinterest in the paper is due to the subscription of other
newspapers. This question is not open to a variety of answers, as it seeks
confirmation for a very specific hypothesis. A positive jah 'yeah'-final question is
strongly conducive of a positive answer. The client, however, responds negatively and
provides an account that includes the verb + enclitic format.<component x="36.85"

the question by repeating the verb 'subscribe' (comp. lines 2 and 5) and is 3
therefore hearable as a direct response to it. The enclitic reinforces the crucial
word 'afford' in the response turn, which also carries the main stress in the clause.
This is the reason why -gi/-ki has been characterized as a marker of ''communicative
focus'' (Erelt et al., 1993:100). It regularly reinforces the item that is
prosodically and informationally in focus, as can be seen in examples (1-5, 7-9).
However, the prosodic focus is pragmatically grounded in the interpersonal access to
knowings and their adjustments. In the current example the verb + enclitic is used
for refuting the assumption in the question that the client can afford newspapers,
and the verb 'afford' is therefore focused. While refuting the assumption, the clause
makes public what is tacitly implied in the question. Another disaligning response to
a question is shown in example (10). In line (1) a future newspaper subscriber asks
how to mark the promised discount in the subscription form. The telemarketer discards
the whole question by saying that there is nothing that has to be marked, as
everything can be arranged on the phone (the continuation of TM's turn not shown).
The question thus remains unanswered, TM's response is disaligning, prohibiting the
sequence from proceeding the way it was projected by the client.<component x="41.16"

lateness="0.6875" reference_score="6.95">The telemarketer's turn includes the verb +
enclitic pattern and reveals that the main presupposition of the question - that a
form has to be filled out - does not hold. The telemarketer thereby demonstrates her
better access to the information, which of course follows from her participant role
in this interactional event. As a representative of the institution, she can claim
the right and authority to adjust false assumptions by the client. The epistemic
assumption-orientation of the enclitic thus becomes clear across a variety of
sequences, such as sequences initiated by directives, informings and questions. Next
speakers may either align or disalign. In examples (7-8) the responses involving
enclitics promote the course of action projected by the prior speaker. The verb +
-gi/-ki pattern can thus be used in turns that comply with the action but
nevertheless deal with the distribution of knowledge between the participants. It is
a device of establishing the current speaker's access to and authority on the
information previously assumed by the prior speaker. This may result in a quite
innocent and reassuring action, as in the case of wrongly assumed work hours in
example (7) but it may also constitute a socially problematic correction of facts, as
in example (8). In disalignments (excerpts 9-10), the verb + -gi/-ki pattern
similarly shows that the epistemic grounding of the prior turn was inadequate, and
the inadequacy is formulated as the reason for not doing the projected action. The
enclitic enhances the pragmatic focus of the clause while dealing with interpersonal
matters across turns. The verb + enclitic pattern accomplishes a specific social task
and the clauses are not replaceable by, for example, a clause without the enclitic.
The latter would have a different pragmatic focus, which would not necessarily deal
with the knowledge aspect.<component x="36.85" y="524.04" width="466.3"

of authority rather than access to knowledge seem to be the primary concern for the
speaker. Interactants may have similar access but still be concerned with who
possesses the rights and authority to the knowledge. A speaker may challenge the
authority of the producer of a piece of information and establish her own rights to
this particular information in the next turn (Stivers, 2005). As part of revising
what the prior speaker said or implied the current speaker may display herself as
more knowledgeable on the issue and with superior rights to the knowledge. This is 4
illustrated in example (11) where the speakers are talking about Ene's sister who has
recently moved to Holland. Upon hearing about her move, Kaido speculates that the
sister will get involved with a Dutch guy (line 2). This is formulated as a
prediction, something that might happen in the future. The speaker also downgrades
his epistemic certainty with the particle ega (Keevallik, 2009:150-155). Ene refutes
his assumption that this is a mere hypothetical prediction by claiming 5 that this is
indeed what will happen.<component x="36.85" y="388.03" width="466.26"

lateness="0.75" reference_score="8.18">Ene formulates her turn in line (3) as a
statement that is not epistemically downgraded. On the one hand she aligns and
confirms Kaido's prediction, but on the other she asserts her epistemic primacy
regarding the knowledge domain, her sister's life. First of all, Ene reuses the verb
from Kaido's turn to accomplish the confirmation, instead of simply using a
confirmative particle. That already establishes the relative independence of the
statement from the prior, as compared to a particle whose whole sense would have been
essentially dependent on the prior turn. A verb repeat is generally an option of a
response to yes/ no questions and other first pair parts in Estonian (Keevallik,
2010) but in this context a verb repeat could not have been used on its own. The
enclitic makes the response grammatical. It also functions as a reinforcement of the
response, accomplishing an even more independent establishment of the facts and
underlining speaker authority. Ene is indeed the only one in this conversation who is
in the position to confirm her sister's dating status, as Kaido and Ene have not been
in contact for several 6 years and neither have Kaido and Ene's sister. Ene has
better epistemic access to her sister's life and can appeal to the socially grounded
authority for her claim. The use of the grammatical pattern of verb + -gi/-ki is thus
closely intertwined with social matters of who knows what with how much authority in
comparison with another participant. What is a mere prediction for a participant with
no access to, or authority on, the matter may be authoritatively established as a
fact by an entitled participant. Extract (12) presents a case where epistemic
authority, and not access, is clearly the main issue. The topic of the talk is the
preparation of a Christmas steak. In line (3) Hele expresses concern about the time
the roasting is going to take. Confirming the roasting time in line (4), Kert
simultaneously establishes his authority on the topic of steak preparation. He uses
two verb + enclitic forms to reinforce his epistemic primacy, claiming deeper and
more accurate knowledge as compared to the prior speaker. He is also the one
physically handling the piece of meat during the excerpt, actually taking
responsibility for its preparation.<component x="41.16" y="442.63" width="466.32"

lateness="0.8125" reference_score="9.25">The turn in lines (4-5) refutes the
assumption displayed in the prior turn that a long preparation time should be
avoided, even though Kert agrees on the factual matter that the steak in its current
size will take time. The enclitic-enforced confirmation thus accomplishes the social
aim of claiming expertise and establishing the current speaker as more of an
authority than the producer of the initial statement. Kert's second clause 'it has
to' further underlines his authoritative stance. Even this clause contains the verb +
enclitic pattern. Cases such as this illustrate how the meaning of a grammatical
pattern arises within the sequential contingencies of speaker turns, rather than
being an expression of some pre-existing expectation on how things are. Kert here
addresses an issue implied in Hele's turn and displays an independent and different
stance to it, a task that is suitably carried out by the verb + enclitic pattern.
&#xA8; &#xA8; Relatedly, it has been argued that the Finnish corresponding enclitic
-kin(-kaan/kaan) in responsive position (in assessment sequences) displays that the
speaker has independent access to the topic at hand, even though she agrees
(Hakulinen et al., 2004:808). Verb + enclitic pattern is thus used in the two related
languages, Estonian and Finnish, to claim authority of knowledge about a matter in
the first hand expressed by another speaker. Along similar lines, Heritage and
Raymond (2005) have argued that the linguistic formats of tag-questions and negative
interrogatives in English, when used as second assessments, challenge the prior
speaker's claim of epistemic primacy. Language structures arise from and are adapted
to handling these kinds of interpersonal matters, including the establishment of
epistemic ecologies among the participants. Participants obviously sometimes aim to
set the records right when it comes to who is entitled to which piece of knowledge.
As a means of adjusting assumptions, the verb + enclitic pattern may be used for
framing the prior turn as a misinterpretation of what the current speaker had said
previously. Speaker A says something, B reacts, and A then adjusts the assumption
displayed in the reaction. Typically, the verb 'think' + -gi/-ki is used for
accomplishing this. The speakers in example (13) are discussing a common visit to the
birthday party of a former class-mate. In line (1), Mari states that she will be
looking for a present. Pire argues against this, suggesting that they make the
present together. In the subsequent turn, Mari claims to have meant precisely this -
that she will find a common present. She thus aligns with Pire on the matter of a
common present but with the help of verb + enclitic she simultaneously refutes Mari's
assumption that Pire did not mean that already in her first turn.<component x="41.16"

lateness="0.8125" reference_score="8.91">In order to understand what Mari
accomplishes here with the verb + -gi pattern, it is important to look closely at
Pire's turn in (3-4). Pire initiates it with a negation word, expressing maybe not a
blunt disagreement but definitely a turning point in the sequence. Her response does
not align. The turn is furthermore initiated at a moment when Mari has already
projected a continuation of hers, thus cutting into Mari's talk and not letting her
finish. Pire then continues to make a proposal in the form of a full clause, as if
accomplishing a first action in the sequence, which makes relevant a compliance as
the next action. Mari indeed complies immediately, supporting the analysis.
Crucially, Pire's turn does not show any understanding of the prior turn as having
been an offer. She formats her turn as an alternative to what Mari said, as it is
possible to hear Mari's turn in lines (1-2) as a statement about how she will go
about her own present. In lines (5-6) Mari re-establishes her authority and
authorship. She makes a point out of ensuring that this was indeed her idea too and
that she is not just complying with Pire's proposal. Here the enclitic is again
crucial, as it marks the explicit tie backwards to the earlier turn, achieving an
adjustment of the assumption displayed there. Without the enclitic and the pragmatic
focus on 'think' Mari's turn could sound like a simple offer to find the common
present. With the current formatting, the turn also takes the authoritative stance
that a joint present was Mari's idea from the start. The issue here is not primarily
epistemics, who knows what, but more the ownership of the idea and the proposal. It
is obviously important for speakers to claim primary authorship, even though they
align and agree, as happens in this excerpt. However, speakers may also challenge
others' assumptions in a more confrontative way, for example, by refusing to do the
next action and thereby undermining the local authority of the prior speaker. Excerpt
(14) illustrates that. It starts when a topic of a prospective rental arrangement is
coming to a close. In short, Pille has contacted a renter on behalf of Tiit,
apparently because they believe that girls have a better chance. Tiit has now called
to accuse Pille for messing things up with the contact person (referred to as
'aunty') to whom he has just talked to himself. Lines (20-24) can be heard as Pille's
defensive account. After this rather troublesome sequence where Tiit ends up silent
for a considerable time, Pille elicits a new<component x="36.85" y="54.46"

waiting for Tiit to do something more, which he noticeably refrains from. 'There is
nothing else to talk about' is a socially problematic way of discontinuing the
conversation, particularly because these two participants usually chat for half an
hour or so in the recordings. In short, Tiit uses the verb + enclitic pattern to
accomplish a disaligning action that challenges Pille's authority to extract
conversation topics from him in the ongoing call. To summarize the current section,
when a speaker declares another participant's assumptions invalid, she can deal with
it in two ways: either by aligning in terms of action, or by disaligning with what
the prior speaker projected. In extreme cases, the projected activity may be blocked
altogether. The verb + enclitic pattern is one grammatical option for refuting
assumptions while either aligning or disaligning in terms of action. The enclitic
functions within the interpersonal sphere, marking that the current speaker is not
going along with (all) the hearable assumptions in the prior turn. The enclitic deals
with interpersonal relations, relative knowledge and relative authority of the
participants. It is used in clauses that make explicit how the prior turn is
considered inadequate and which of its assumptions are declared invalid. At a more
general level, the enclitic is a cross-turn tying device, showing that the current
turn is done in relation to a prior. In this way, the enclitic functions within the
domain of the conversational sequence, where the speakers reveal their assumptions
and ''expectations'' as the talk evolves. In the dialogic setting studied in this
section, the ''expectations'' are assigned to the prior speaker, and concern access
to knowledge and level of authority. The enclitic -gi/-ki is used to counter either
an explicit or implicit assumption that has been evident in the prior speaker's talk
and to mark the epistemic primacy and authority of the current speaker on the topic
of that talk.<component x="41.16" y="513.55" width="466.34" height="175.32" page="16"

lateness="1.0" reference_score="8.57">The article looked at the usage of the enclitic
-gi/-ki in Estonian, the function of which has been difficult to formalize in
grammatical descriptions. It demonstrated that a subset of usages limited to verb +
enclitic pattern in conversational exchanges can be coherently described as
invalidating a prior assumption. The enclitic is used in clauses that refute,
correct, or adjust something that was implied earlier. The limiting of the dataset to
the verb-based pattern in reactive turns enabled us to see a functional regularity
that has so far been overshadowed by the general fuzzy picture of the occurrence of
the enclitic in a variety of grammatical positions and, assumedly, functions. The
verb + enclitic format ties the current turn to prior talk, either the speaker's own
or somebody else's, (re-)establishing authority over the claim and the epistemic
primacy of the current speaker on the matter. The enclitic -gi/-ki is therefore an
item whose full description in grammar needs to incorporate social matters, such as
distribution of knowledge among the participants, and their relative authority to
make statements on the topic at hand. The enclitic basically states ''I know better
than you/before and I am the one entitled to know''. Thus, it deals with the issue of
access and authority to knowledge (Stivers et al., 2011a), not simply epistemic
certainty. The speaker is not in the first hand characterizing her own stance towards
the piece of information being provided, but her supremacy in relation to the prior
speaker or her own prior self. The enclitic marks that the speaker herself used to
know/assume falsely or that the conversation partner knew/assumed falsely,
occasionally by claiming knowledge that does not in the first hand belong to him. The
enclitic enables accomplishment of a correction without explicitly telling the other
person that he is wrong, thus being a more subtle social device. The adjustment is
embedded within an explanatory clause. The grammatical device is used for dealing
with social selves in relationship to each other: who knows better and who has more
authority. The proffered account of the meaning of -gi/-ki is more precise than the
earlier ones that have generally claimed that the enclitic is a focusing device and
deals with expectations. Expectations are hard to document empirically. The paper
showed that speaker assumptions appear vividly in sequences of talk and action, as is
witnessed by next speaker reactions to them. This is why the sequential method of
conversation analysis is especially appropriate for studying patterns that deal with
the 'unsaid', and the enclitic in particular. Grammatical matters, such as the
polarity of the clause do not seem to be of much relevance when it comes to the
functioning of the enclitic. Accordingly, the regularity of function does not occur
within the morphological or syntactic structure of the language alone but can also be
found in the interpersonal sphere. Furthermore, it is not justified to see the
enclitic as only focusing the verb within the clause, as it deals with the
relationship between the current and some previous turn. However, the fact that it
appears on verbs in these patterns is relevant, as the same function is not achieved
when the enclitic is used with items from other word classes. Future studies could
analyze functions of -gi/-ki with nouns, adjectives, postpositions, etc. in dialogic
or monologic settings. This paper showed that the functional domain of an enclitic
can be a sequence of actions. A bound morpheme functions across speaker turns dealing
with interpersonal matters of mutual knowledge and relative authority.<component

constantly display assumptions about matters that they talk about. These assumptions
are not always correct and may be adjusted by other participants who present
themselves as having more information or more authority on the matter. In
interaction, different human experiences and perspectives are brought together,
expressed in the temporally constrained turns within sequences of action. Implicit
and explicit knowledge is displayed in speaker turns and it is also contested on the
turn-by-turn basis. All of this is enabled by grammars that allow speakers to express
various degrees of knowledge and may have developed special formats for carrying out
different kinds of social action. Many grammatical formats for expressing knowledge
states and sources have already been thoroughly described in the literature on
language. Evidential devices are used for showing the type of access the speaker has
to the information, epistemic markers indicate the degree of speaker certainty. In
addition, some grammatical devices are adapted to the task of conveying more subtle
assumptions about the matter at hand. For example, a question in a specific form
(positive/negative, with a tag or not) is heard as conducive of a certain kind of
answer, thereby displaying speaker assumptions on what the &#xA8; answer will be
(Sadock and Zwicky, 1985; Konig and Siemund, 2007). Thus, even though the authority
to answer is rendered to the recipient of the question, the asker may indicate the
degree of her own epistemic certainty. These assumptions and allusions need not be
explicit but occasionally their existence can be proven by the subsequent behavior of
other participants. Speakers can explicitly formulate an understanding of what the
recipient of the allusive formulation conveyed<component x="36.85" y="121.13"

articulate a 'missing' element of the addressee's preceding talk (Bolden, 2010),
making public something that was only implicitly present in another participant's
talk. Another example of a similar issue is that the first person to utter a
statement on a subject in a conversation also makes an implicit claim that she has
epistemic rights to the subject. Other participants may publicly confront this covert
assumption (Heritage and Raymond, 2005). One strategy for doing that in English is to
repeat the prior speaker's claim with a stress on the non-reduced copula (Stivers,
2005), another one in Finnish second assessments is to use the clitic -kin, which
indicates independent access to the topic (Hakulinen et al., 2004:808). These are
some examples of how linguistic structures can be employed to deal with matters that
were only implicit in a prior turn. The current study contributes to this line of
research, looking at the grammatical enclitic -gi/-ki in Estonian, which is used for
countering the assumptions expressed by a prior speaker or held previously by the
speaker herself. It is a device for the speaker of a subsequent turn to make salient
an epistemic gap between the current and a prior contribution and contest what was
assumed there. Occasionally, this implies that the just-prior action is not responded
to in the way the response was projected, resulting in a disaligning turn. Access to
knowledge and authority to express the knowledge are closely intertwined with
opportunities of alignment and affiliation in social interaction (as discussed across
many contributions in the recent volume by Stivers et al. (2011a)). The current paper
focuses on the Estonian enclitic in a specific sequential position: when it is used
in turns that are reactive to something that has just happened, either in the
conversation or in the context of talk. This position constitutes a subsection of the
overall usage of the enclitic, supposedly representing its most dialogic facet. A
clitic is a grammatically independent and phonologically dependent morpheme. A
proclitic attaches before the word and an enclitic after it. An enclitic can only
appear with a host, which in the case of gi/-ki is basically any word, including
nouns, verbs, adjectives and postpositions. -gi/-ki lacks prosodic independence, even
though it may occasionally carry the main stress of the utterance. The enclitic is
pronounced as a fortis (k) after voiceless sounds and as a lenis (g) after voiced
ones, which shows its phonological dependence. Examples of its application are
thus:<component x="41.16" y="450.8" width="466.26" height="238.08" page="2"

lateness="0.125" reference_score="4.71">The grammatical status of -gi/-ki is still
being discussed. It has been characterized as an affixal particle (Tauli, 1972:93)
but in the last comprehensive grammar it is interchangeably called an affix, a modal
adverb, and a particle (Erelt et al., 1993:39, 1995:159,164). Its functions have been
said to range from focusing to simple connecting, to marking of concessivity and
surprise (Tauli, 1980:213-215; Erelt et al., 1995). In Finnish grammar, which is a
close genealogical relative of Estonian, &#xA8; &#xA8; the corresponding item -kin
(-kaan/kaan in the negative) has been characterized as expressing speaker
expectations, showing that her expectations were confirmed or contradicted (Hakulinen
et al., 2004:807). It has also been suggested in the literature on Estonian that
-gi/-ki has to do with expectations (Erelt et al., 1995:100; Metslang, 2002; Sang,
1983:44-45). In short, the semantics and pragmatics of the enclitic have seemed quite
elusive. The -gi/-ki has also lexicalized with a number of adverbs, such as ikkagi
'still', pealegi 'in addition to', and siiski 'nevertheless', resulting in
morphologically non-transparent words for present-day speakers. Syntactically -gi/-ki
is not applied according to the order of the words in the clause. Instead, the
pragmatic effect it achieves depends on which type of word it is attached to
(Metslang, 2002). Therefore, it is important to study its functions separately in
different word classes, and the current paper only looks at verbs. At the same time,
the scope of -gi/-ki has been claimed to be the whole sentence, not a single word or
phrase (Tauli, 1980:212-215; Erelt et al., 1995:100). The present study shows that
its area of operation is even wider than the sentence, namely, conversational
sequence. The theoretical aim of the paper is to demonstrate how a bound grammatical
element functions across speakers and turns, dealing with the emergent status of
knowledge and rights to knowledge. Pragmatic particles have been shown to function
like that. For example, in Mandarin Chinese the final particles ou and a point out a
gap between participants' knowledge and display expectations about the matter at hand
(Wu, 2004). In order to explain the role of the enclitic -gi/-ki, it needs to be
similarly scrutinized in relation to prior talk and, crucially, with regard to what
the prior speaker has conveyed about his/her knowledge state and underlying
assumptions. The present paper aims to show that in interactional data the
contradicting or following of expectations can be empirically traced. One speaker
says something that reveals her underlying assumptions, which are explicitly refuted
by the next speaker with the help of the enclitic. The function of the enclitic can
be elucidated by taking into account what has happened in the conversation so far and
what the current speaker aims to do in relation to that. This is where the implicit
''expectations'' are at public display and may be explicitly oriented to by the next
speaker. Thereby the expectations also become empirically available for the
researcher and enable a functional analysis of the enclitic, grounded in
participants' observable actions. The study thus illustrates how intuitive matters
can be dealt with analytically.<component x="41.16" y="114.72" width="466.26"

face-to-face interaction have been used from a video recording of a preparation of a
Christmas dinner (2 hours) and from the publicly available Tartu corpus of Spoken
Estonian (http://www.cl.ut.ee/suuline/ Korpus.php), which includes shorter excerpts
of talk from a wide variety of situations. The corpus is constantly growing. The
version used for this study included about 300,000 words and 30 hours of talk. About
one-third of the data come from institutional settings but the enclitic does not seem
to reflect specifically institutional practices, apart from the bias that it is often
the representative of the institution who displays knowledge and authority on the
subject. In these two corpora 323 instances of -gi/-ki usage were registered
(excluding the lexicalized items). The majority of these, 226, were attached to
verbs, which are in focus here. The very frequent occurrence with verbs supports the
choice of pattern for this study. At least in spoken usage, the enclitic usage with
other word classes is much less frequent and functionally heterogeneous. For example,
its use with nouns generally implies addition, 'too, also', a function that should be
studied in its own right. As the aim of this paper is to reveal the interactional and
interpersonal facet of -gi/-ki, the core of the data is constituted by the dialogic
instances where the turn involving a verb + -gi/-ki is an immediate reaction to some
action by another participant or something that has just happened. The reason for
this delimitation is that earlier work on more monologic data has resulted in the
above broad accounts of ''expectations'', which are of course in some sense correct
but have nevertheless relied entirely on researcher intuition and native competence.
In contrast, a look at more dialogic cases reveals empirically how the expectations
are publicly displayed, recalibrated and reacted to by participants using grammar in
real time. For one thing, this approach reveals that even in cases that could
superficially be interpreted as ''following expectations'' actually subtly contradict
some aspect of the prior turn. The dialogic restriction leaves us with 111 cases.
Within this database, there appeared three general patterns, all of which have to do
with knowledge or authority 1 assumptions, either those previously held by the
speaker herself or the ones made by another participant. In the following, it will be
shown how a piece of bound grammar can be used to mark subtle turn-by-turn shifts in
relative knowledge status and oppose or adjust implicit assumptions in prior
talk.<component x="36.85" y="450.79" width="466.28" height="238.08" page="3"

pre-existing state, since access to knowledge may be granted in the course of an
interactive event. Participants' state of knowledge may change from moment to moment
when information is produced by other participants or discovered in the surround. The
speakers may mark the change-of-knowledge-state with turn-initial particles in
subsequent turns (Heritage, 1984) but they may also verbally expand on what exactly
the changed state is about. One grammatical option for doing the expansion in
Estonian is to use the verb + -gi/-ki pattern, as it underlines that something
previously held valid by the speaker has turned out to be not so. In example (1) Piia
is marking a change in her understanding of Anu's knowledge state, and related to
that, her prior assumption about Anu's knowledge. Before the excerpt Piia has been
telling about her mother receiving a TV-set as a present. The story comes to the end
in lines (1-4) where Piia summarizes that the TV-set was a surprise to the immediate
family. This statement is followed by a generic repair-initiator from Anu, displaying
problems with what Piia just said. Anu's 'what?' leads Piia to realize that this fact
was news to Anu, as we can see in her subsequent turn that involves a verb + enclitic
(line 6). All the names in the excerpts are pseudonyms. The pragmatically adequate
translation of -gi/-ki into English implies heavy stress on some element of the
clause or some syntactic focusing pattern. Therefore, the enclitic is often
untraceable in the idiomatic English line. Sometimes words such as indeed and really
provide a match.<component x="36.85" y="262.52" width="466.28" height="154.4"

demonstrated cases with negative formulations, which is not surprising since one of
the regular functions of the negative is to mark that an expectation is not
fulfilled. The enclitic, however, can equally well appear in a positive clause, which
shows that it marks a change in the speaker's state of knowledge independently of the
polarity. In excerpt (5) from the beginning of a phone call a speaker draws a
conclusion based on the circumstances, quite similarly to the prior excerpt. Esko
answers his job phone and Kaire concludes that he is at work, which is apparently
unexpected to the extent that it is mentioned. In line (4) Kaire marks that she has
just changed her assumption that the contrary may have been the case. Indeed, she has
called Esko's office and must have had some information as to his whereabouts.
However, place of the call-taker is not regularly formulated in calls to land lines
and if his presence at work was entirely commonplace, it would not have been worth
mentioning at all. With the help of the enclitic Kaire shows that she now has
epistemic access to the information that enables her to produce the statement. The
conclusion is formulated in positive polarity.<component x="41.16" y="311.73"

The enclitic formalizes the link backward in time, its domain is the current turn
plus the immediately prior discourse or context against which the change has taken
place. The temporal dimension of the domain varies in regard to the specific actions.
The affected action-span may be somewhat longer when it concerns an inappropriately
recipient-designed story (example 1) and somewhat shorter when it is a result of a
noticing in the physical surround (example 3). In any case, the domain of the
enclitic is larger than a single clause, sentence or turn. Based on occurrence
regularities and the qualitative analysis, it can be claimed that verb + enclitic is
a format used to express adjustments in the knowledge state in the form of a clause.
As could be seen in examples (4-6), the turn-initial change-of-state token need not
be used in the turns involving the verb + enclitic. The enclitic on its own can
accomplish identical action from within the clause, i.e. later in the turn than the
change-of-state token does. That in itself is an important interactional affordance,
as it enables marking the news in a syntactically embedded way.<component x="41.16"

-gi/-ki is regularly used in clauses that mark the just-accomplished change in the
speaker's knowledge state, either as a result of an other participant's action or
some contextual matter. In the current section the same mechanism is shown to
function across speakers: one speaker conveys an implicit assumption and another one
counters it, publicly marking the need to adjust the first speaker's state of
knowledge or claimed social-informational status. This illustrates, among other
things, how knowledge emerges in discourse across time and is negotiated among the
participants. As a supplement to earlier studies on evidentiality that look at how

and Nichols, 1986; Fox, 2001; Karkkainen, 2003), the current section demonstrates how
a grammatical device figures in interpersonal negotiations on access to knowledge and
authority. Conversation analytic research in particular has been interested in how
speakers manage presuppositions of epistemic access (Stivers et al., &#xA8; &#xA8;
2011b:10), epistemic stance (Karkkainen, 2003; Wu, 2004) and epistemic primacy. The
latter is defined as ''asymmetries in the depth, specificity or completeness'' of
participants' knowledge (Stivers et al., 2011b:13). Speakers may have differential
access to a subject, and their access may be of varying depth and specificity, which
implies that they also enjoy a different degree of authority in regard to the matter.
The section first shows how a participant may subtly challenge the assumptions
displayed in a prior turn and display her superior epistemic access to the subject at
hand. Second, a participant may address the prior speaker's epistemic rights and
authority. The verb + -gi/-ki pattern is used for both of these tasks, as they are
closely related: higher authority often comes with better access to the matter. The
examples are arranged to show more of an emphasis on access first, and more emphasis
on authority later. Finally, it will be argued that concerns of authority go beyond
epistemic matters and that the enclitic may be used generally for establishing
speaker rights to decide on interactional and interpersonal matters.<component

of targeting a knowledge assumption conveyed in a prior turn by another speaker. It
comes from a telemarketing call and in lines (1-4) the telemarketer offers to call
back. By asking him to call in the afternoon the client conveys an implicit
assumption that the call can also be made at other times during the day. In the
following turn, the telemarketer refutes this assumption by using a clause with verb
+ enclitic.<component x="41.16" y="263.03" width="466.35" height="39.31" page="8"

lateness="0.5625" reference_score="6.48">In terms of social action, the telemarketer
aligns and complies in line (6), as he agrees to call in the evening. However, he
also chooses to set the record right in terms of his work schedule. This clearly
concerns the telemarketer's area of expertise and knowledge that he has access to. In
the continuation after the complying jaa 'yeah' he expresses something that he has
authority to know, in contrast to what the prior speaker merely assumed. In this way,
the telemarketer's turnexpansion is an adjustment from an epistemically strong
position. The verb + enclitic format allows the telemarketer to accomplish the
compliance projected in the prior turn while adjusting the assumption displayed there
and claiming firsthand knowledge on the issue. Part of the proof of his better
epistemic access is the addition of time notions, 'always' and 'every day', which are
used as evidence of his detailed knowledge of the work schedule. Example (8) is a
case where the caller to an office does not understand that the person who has
answered the phone is the one she usually talks to. This is expressed in lines (2-4),
where it becomes clear that the caller assumes she is not talking to Viiu Sisask. In
her response, VS reverses the caller's assumption with a clause involving the
enclitic. She obviously has access to her own identity and can thus make such a claim
form an epistemically strong and authoritative position.<component x="36.85"

speaker aligns with the action trajectory projected by the prior speaker, such as
agreeing to call in the evening (example 7) or to become a conversation partner
''whoever'' (example 8). However, the speaker simultaneously challenges an assumption
conveyed by the prior speaker. The implication is that the prior speaker was
mistaken, which can also be socially awkward, as in the above case when the answerer
of the phone is not recognized. In both excerpts (7-8) the producer of the enclitic
reacts to what the prior speaker has just said. The enclitic marks that the current
utterance is reactively tied to the immediately prior talk, it functions as a formal
connection between the current and the prior turn. Thus, the pattern of verb +
enclitic among other things constitutes a part of the intersubjective reactive
grammar of Estonian. It is used to formulate reactions to a prior action or event.
One type of prior events is questions. Even though a question officially treats the
recipient as more knowledgeable, it may be designed in a way that already displays
significant assumptions on the matter asked about. Thus, the answer may be formatted
with the enclitic pattern. For example, in (9) the telemarketer asks whether the
potential client's disinterest in the paper is due to the subscription of other
newspapers. This question is not open to a variety of answers, as it seeks
confirmation for a very specific hypothesis. A positive jah 'yeah'-final question is
strongly conducive of a positive answer. The client, however, responds negatively and
provides an account that includes the verb + enclitic format.<component x="36.85"

lateness="0.625" reference_score="7.44">Syntactically, the clause in focus builds on
the question by repeating the verb 'subscribe' (comp. lines 2 and 5) and is 3
therefore hearable as a direct response to it. The enclitic reinforces the crucial
word 'afford' in the response turn, which also carries the main stress in the clause.
This is the reason why -gi/-ki has been characterized as a marker of ''communicative
focus'' (Erelt et al., 1993:100). It regularly reinforces the item that is
prosodically and informationally in focus, as can be seen in examples (1-5, 7-9).
However, the prosodic focus is pragmatically grounded in the interpersonal access to
knowings and their adjustments. In the current example the verb + enclitic is used
for refuting the assumption in the question that the client can afford newspapers,
and the verb 'afford' is therefore focused. While refuting the assumption, the clause
makes public what is tacitly implied in the question. Another disaligning response to
a question is shown in example (10). In line (1) a future newspaper subscriber asks
how to mark the promised discount in the subscription form. The telemarketer discards
the whole question by saying that there is nothing that has to be marked, as
everything can be arranged on the phone (the continuation of TM's turn not shown).
The question thus remains unanswered, TM's response is disaligning, prohibiting the
sequence from proceeding the way it was projected by the client.<component x="41.16"

lateness="0.6875" reference_score="6.95">The telemarketer's turn includes the verb +
enclitic pattern and reveals that the main presupposition of the question - that a
form has to be filled out - does not hold. The telemarketer thereby demonstrates her
better access to the information, which of course follows from her participant role
in this interactional event. As a representative of the institution, she can claim
the right and authority to adjust false assumptions by the client. The epistemic
assumption-orientation of the enclitic thus becomes clear across a variety of
sequences, such as sequences initiated by directives, informings and questions. Next
speakers may either align or disalign. In examples (7-8) the responses involving
enclitics promote the course of action projected by the prior speaker. The verb +
-gi/-ki pattern can thus be used in turns that comply with the action but
nevertheless deal with the distribution of knowledge between the participants. It is
a device of establishing the current speaker's access to and authority on the
information previously assumed by the prior speaker. This may result in a quite
innocent and reassuring action, as in the case of wrongly assumed work hours in
example (7) but it may also constitute a socially problematic correction of facts, as
in example (8). In disalignments (excerpts 9-10), the verb + -gi/-ki pattern
similarly shows that the epistemic grounding of the prior turn was inadequate, and
the inadequacy is formulated as the reason for not doing the projected action. The
enclitic enhances the pragmatic focus of the clause while dealing with interpersonal
matters across turns. The verb + enclitic pattern accomplishes a specific social task
and the clauses are not replaceable by, for example, a clause without the enclitic.
The latter would have a different pragmatic focus, which would not necessarily deal
with the knowledge aspect.<component x="36.85" y="524.04" width="466.3"

of authority rather than access to knowledge seem to be the primary concern for the
speaker. Interactants may have similar access but still be concerned with who
possesses the rights and authority to the knowledge. A speaker may challenge the
authority of the producer of a piece of information and establish her own rights to
this particular information in the next turn (Stivers, 2005). As part of revising
what the prior speaker said or implied the current speaker may display herself as
more knowledgeable on the issue and with superior rights to the knowledge. This is 4
illustrated in example (11) where the speakers are talking about Ene's sister who has
recently moved to Holland. Upon hearing about her move, Kaido speculates that the
sister will get involved with a Dutch guy (line 2). This is formulated as a
prediction, something that might happen in the future. The speaker also downgrades
his epistemic certainty with the particle ega (Keevallik, 2009:150-155). Ene refutes
his assumption that this is a mere hypothetical prediction by claiming 5 that this is
indeed what will happen.<component x="36.85" y="388.03" width="466.26"

lateness="0.75" reference_score="8.18">Ene formulates her turn in line (3) as a
statement that is not epistemically downgraded. On the one hand she aligns and
confirms Kaido's prediction, but on the other she asserts her epistemic primacy
regarding the knowledge domain, her sister's life. First of all, Ene reuses the verb
from Kaido's turn to accomplish the confirmation, instead of simply using a
confirmative particle. That already establishes the relative independence of the
statement from the prior, as compared to a particle whose whole sense would have been
essentially dependent on the prior turn. A verb repeat is generally an option of a
response to yes/ no questions and other first pair parts in Estonian (Keevallik,
2010) but in this context a verb repeat could not have been used on its own. The
enclitic makes the response grammatical. It also functions as a reinforcement of the
response, accomplishing an even more independent establishment of the facts and
underlining speaker authority. Ene is indeed the only one in this conversation who is
in the position to confirm her sister's dating status, as Kaido and Ene have not been
in contact for several 6 years and neither have Kaido and Ene's sister. Ene has
better epistemic access to her sister's life and can appeal to the socially grounded
authority for her claim. The use of the grammatical pattern of verb + -gi/-ki is thus
closely intertwined with social matters of who knows what with how much authority in
comparison with another participant. What is a mere prediction for a participant with
no access to, or authority on, the matter may be authoritatively established as a
fact by an entitled participant. Extract (12) presents a case where epistemic
authority, and not access, is clearly the main issue. The topic of the talk is the
preparation of a Christmas steak. In line (3) Hele expresses concern about the time
the roasting is going to take. Confirming the roasting time in line (4), Kert
simultaneously establishes his authority on the topic of steak preparation. He uses
two verb + enclitic forms to reinforce his epistemic primacy, claiming deeper and
more accurate knowledge as compared to the prior speaker. He is also the one
physically handling the piece of meat during the excerpt, actually taking
responsibility for its preparation.<component x="41.16" y="442.63" width="466.32"

lateness="0.8125" reference_score="9.25">The turn in lines (4-5) refutes the
assumption displayed in the prior turn that a long preparation time should be
avoided, even though Kert agrees on the factual matter that the steak in its current
size will take time. The enclitic-enforced confirmation thus accomplishes the social
aim of claiming expertise and establishing the current speaker as more of an
authority than the producer of the initial statement. Kert's second clause 'it has
to' further underlines his authoritative stance. Even this clause contains the verb +
enclitic pattern. Cases such as this illustrate how the meaning of a grammatical
pattern arises within the sequential contingencies of speaker turns, rather than
being an expression of some pre-existing expectation on how things are. Kert here
addresses an issue implied in Hele's turn and displays an independent and different
stance to it, a task that is suitably carried out by the verb + enclitic pattern.
&#xA8; &#xA8; Relatedly, it has been argued that the Finnish corresponding enclitic
-kin(-kaan/kaan) in responsive position (in assessment sequences) displays that the
speaker has independent access to the topic at hand, even though she agrees
(Hakulinen et al., 2004:808). Verb + enclitic pattern is thus used in the two related
languages, Estonian and Finnish, to claim authority of knowledge about a matter in
the first hand expressed by another speaker. Along similar lines, Heritage and
Raymond (2005) have argued that the linguistic formats of tag-questions and negative
interrogatives in English, when used as second assessments, challenge the prior
speaker's claim of epistemic primacy. Language structures arise from and are adapted
to handling these kinds of interpersonal matters, including the establishment of
epistemic ecologies among the participants. Participants obviously sometimes aim to
set the records right when it comes to who is entitled to which piece of knowledge.
As a means of adjusting assumptions, the verb + enclitic pattern may be used for
framing the prior turn as a misinterpretation of what the current speaker had said
previously. Speaker A says something, B reacts, and A then adjusts the assumption
displayed in the reaction. Typically, the verb 'think' + -gi/-ki is used for
accomplishing this. The speakers in example (13) are discussing a common visit to the
birthday party of a former class-mate. In line (1), Mari states that she will be
looking for a present. Pire argues against this, suggesting that they make the
present together. In the subsequent turn, Mari claims to have meant precisely this -
that she will find a common present. She thus aligns with Pire on the matter of a
common present but with the help of verb + enclitic she simultaneously refutes Mari's
assumption that Pire did not mean that already in her first turn.<component x="41.16"

lateness="0.8125" reference_score="8.91">In order to understand what Mari
accomplishes here with the verb + -gi pattern, it is important to look closely at
Pire's turn in (3-4). Pire initiates it with a negation word, expressing maybe not a
blunt disagreement but definitely a turning point in the sequence. Her response does
not align. The turn is furthermore initiated at a moment when Mari has already
projected a continuation of hers, thus cutting into Mari's talk and not letting her
finish. Pire then continues to make a proposal in the form of a full clause, as if
accomplishing a first action in the sequence, which makes relevant a compliance as
the next action. Mari indeed complies immediately, supporting the analysis.
Crucially, Pire's turn does not show any understanding of the prior turn as having
been an offer. She formats her turn as an alternative to what Mari said, as it is
possible to hear Mari's turn in lines (1-2) as a statement about how she will go
about her own present. In lines (5-6) Mari re-establishes her authority and
authorship. She makes a point out of ensuring that this was indeed her idea too and
that she is not just complying with Pire's proposal. Here the enclitic is again
crucial, as it marks the explicit tie backwards to the earlier turn, achieving an
adjustment of the assumption displayed there. Without the enclitic and the pragmatic
focus on 'think' Mari's turn could sound like a simple offer to find the common
present. With the current formatting, the turn also takes the authoritative stance
that a joint present was Mari's idea from the start. The issue here is not primarily
epistemics, who knows what, but more the ownership of the idea and the proposal. It
is obviously important for speakers to claim primary authorship, even though they
align and agree, as happens in this excerpt. However, speakers may also challenge
others' assumptions in a more confrontative way, for example, by refusing to do the
next action and thereby undermining the local authority of the prior speaker. Excerpt
(14) illustrates that. It starts when a topic of a prospective rental arrangement is
coming to a close. In short, Pille has contacted a renter on behalf of Tiit,
apparently because they believe that girls have a better chance. Tiit has now called
to accuse Pille for messing things up with the contact person (referred to as
'aunty') to whom he has just talked to himself. Lines (20-24) can be heard as Pille's
defensive account. After this rather troublesome sequence where Tiit ends up silent
for a considerable time, Pille elicits a new<component x="36.85" y="54.46"

waiting for Tiit to do something more, which he noticeably refrains from. 'There is
nothing else to talk about' is a socially problematic way of discontinuing the
conversation, particularly because these two participants usually chat for half an
hour or so in the recordings. In short, Tiit uses the verb + enclitic pattern to
accomplish a disaligning action that challenges Pille's authority to extract
conversation topics from him in the ongoing call. To summarize the current section,
when a speaker declares another participant's assumptions invalid, she can deal with
it in two ways: either by aligning in terms of action, or by disaligning with what
the prior speaker projected. In extreme cases, the projected activity may be blocked
altogether. The verb + enclitic pattern is one grammatical option for refuting
assumptions while either aligning or disaligning in terms of action. The enclitic
functions within the interpersonal sphere, marking that the current speaker is not
going along with (all) the hearable assumptions in the prior turn. The enclitic deals
with interpersonal relations, relative knowledge and relative authority of the
participants. It is used in clauses that make explicit how the prior turn is
considered inadequate and which of its assumptions are declared invalid. At a more
general level, the enclitic is a cross-turn tying device, showing that the current
turn is done in relation to a prior. In this way, the enclitic functions within the
domain of the conversational sequence, where the speakers reveal their assumptions
and ''expectations'' as the talk evolves. In the dialogic setting studied in this
section, the ''expectations'' are assigned to the prior speaker, and concern access
to knowledge and level of authority. The enclitic -gi/-ki is used to counter either
an explicit or implicit assumption that has been evident in the prior speaker's talk
and to mark the epistemic primacy and authority of the current speaker on the topic
of that talk.<component x="41.16" y="513.55" width="466.34" height="175.32" page="16"

lateness="1.0" reference_score="8.57">The article looked at the usage of the enclitic
-gi/-ki in Estonian, the function of which has been difficult to formalize in
grammatical descriptions. It demonstrated that a subset of usages limited to verb +
enclitic pattern in conversational exchanges can be coherently described as
invalidating a prior assumption. The enclitic is used in clauses that refute,
correct, or adjust something that was implied earlier. The limiting of the dataset to
the verb-based pattern in reactive turns enabled us to see a functional regularity
that has so far been overshadowed by the general fuzzy picture of the occurrence of
the enclitic in a variety of grammatical positions and, assumedly, functions. The
verb + enclitic format ties the current turn to prior talk, either the speaker's own
or somebody else's, (re-)establishing authority over the claim and the epistemic
primacy of the current speaker on the matter. The enclitic -gi/-ki is therefore an
item whose full description in grammar needs to incorporate social matters, such as
distribution of knowledge among the participants, and their relative authority to
make statements on the topic at hand. The enclitic basically states ''I know better
than you/before and I am the one entitled to know''. Thus, it deals with the issue of
access and authority to knowledge (Stivers et al., 2011a), not simply epistemic
certainty. The speaker is not in the first hand characterizing her own stance towards
the piece of information being provided, but her supremacy in relation to the prior
speaker or her own prior self. The enclitic marks that the speaker herself used to
know/assume falsely or that the conversation partner knew/assumed falsely,
occasionally by claiming knowledge that does not in the first hand belong to him. The
enclitic enables accomplishment of a correction without explicitly telling the other
person that he is wrong, thus being a more subtle social device. The adjustment is
embedded within an explanatory clause. The grammatical device is used for dealing
with social selves in relationship to each other: who knows better and who has more
authority. The proffered account of the meaning of -gi/-ki is more precise than the
earlier ones that have generally claimed that the enclitic is a focusing device and
deals with expectations. Expectations are hard to document empirically. The paper
showed that speaker assumptions appear vividly in sequences of talk and action, as is
witnessed by next speaker reactions to them. This is why the sequential method of
conversation analysis is especially appropriate for studying patterns that deal with
the 'unsaid', and the enclitic in particular. Grammatical matters, such as the
polarity of the clause do not seem to be of much relevance when it comes to the
functioning of the enclitic. Accordingly, the regularity of function does not occur
within the morphological or syntactic structure of the language alone but can also be
found in the interpersonal sphere. Furthermore, it is not justified to see the
enclitic as only focusing the verb within the clause, as it deals with the
relationship between the current and some previous turn. However, the fact that it
appears on verbs in these patterns is relevant, as the same function is not achieved
when the enclitic is used with items from other word classes. Future studies could
analyze functions of -gi/-ki with nouns, adjectives, postpositions, etc. in dialogic
or monologic settings. This paper showed that the functional domain of an enclitic
can be a sequence of actions. A bound morpheme functions across speaker turns dealing
with interpersonal matters of mutual knowledge and relative authority.<component
