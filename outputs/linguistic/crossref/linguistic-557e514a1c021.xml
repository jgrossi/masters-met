development of bilingual children is different from that of their monolingual peers,
but increasing evidence shows that nonverbal cognitive development is also affected
by bilingualism. These outcomes, however, are different. Linguistic tasks are often
performed more poorly by bilingual children than monolinguals, especially assessments
of vocabulary (Bialystok, Luk, Peets, &amp; Yang, 2010; Oller, Pearson, &amp;
Cobo-Lewis, 2007), although tests of metalinguistic awareness are generally performed
better by bilingual children (Bialystok, 1986; Cromdal, 1999; Ricciardelli, 1992). In
contrast, many tests of executive control are performed better by bilinguals
(Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok, Barac, Blaye, &amp; PoulinDubois, 2010; Bialystok &amp;
Martin, 2004; Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009; Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008;
Mezzacappa, 2004; Yang, Shih, &amp; Lust, 2005) although there is no effect for tasks
based on withholding a response even though that too is part of executive control
(Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Martin-Rhee &amp; Bialystok, 2008). Understanding
these effects is complicated by the fact that bilingualism is often correlated with
variables that may themselves influence performance. For example, Morton and Harper
(2007) claimed that the reported bilingual advantage was due to socioeconomic
differences between bilingual and monolingual children. There is no doubt that
socioeconomic status (SES) is a powerful influence on executive control, but it does
not undermine the body of literature for which bilingual advantages have been
recorded (Bialystok, 2009). Similarly, claims for cultural effects favoring Asian
children on tests of executive control (e.g., Sabbagh, Xu, Carlson, Moses, &amp; Lee,
2006) must be separated from the role of bilingualism in shaping this performance.
The present study addresses these issues by examining three groups of bilingual
children and one group of monolinguals performing verbal and nonverbal tasks. The
bilingual children differ in terms of similarity between English and their other
language, cultural background, and educational experience. It is not possible to
achieve a parametric manipulation of these variables, so our approach is to compare
specific groups to address each of these factors. Two previous studies have examined
the role of culture and immigration history on the cognitive outcomes of
bilingualism. Bialystok and Viswanathan (2009) compared three groups of 8-year-old
children on an executive control task. Children were matched on educational
experience and social class and were English-speaking monolinguals in Canada,
bilinguals in Canada (mixed cultural backgrounds, immigrants), or bilinguals in

results showed that the two bilingual groups outperformed the monolinguals on the
conflict conditions, with no difference between the two bilingual groups. In another
study, Bialystok, Barac, et al. (2010) compared a group of bilinguals with two
monolingual groups-an English-speaking group in Canada and a French-speaking group in
France. Again, there was no difference between the two monolingual groups and better
performance by the bilinguals on all the conflict tasks. Together, these results
support the generality of the bilingual effects over the influence of immigration and
culture on nonverbal tests of executive control. Unlike cognitive outcomes, different
groups of bilinguals do not perform comparably on linguistic tasks. Spanish-English
bilinguals outperformed both monolinguals and Chinese-English bilinguals on a test of
English phonological awareness, presumably because of the degree of similarity
between the languages (Bialystok, Majumder, &amp; Martin, 2003). Spanish orthography
is transparent in that it is based on consistent letter-sound mappings, and this
factor might also contribute to the enhanced performance of Spanish-English
bilinguals on phonological awareness tasks. In addition, phonological awareness
appears to transfer easily across languages. Cross-language correlations in
performance on phonological awareness tasks have been reported for English-Spanish
bilinguals (Lindsey, Manis, &amp; Bailey, 2003), English-French bilinguals (Comeau,
Cormier, Grandmaison, &amp; Lacroix, 1999), and English-Cantonese bilinguals (Luk
&amp; Bialystok, 2008) indicating a common basis for this ability across languages
irrespective of its rate of development. The same is not true for early reading: In a
study comparing Spanish-English, Hebrew-English, and Chinese-English bilingual
children on a decoding task in both languages, better performance than monolinguals
was found for the Spanish and Hebrew groups, with no advantage for the ChineseEnglish
group (Bialystok, Luk, &amp; Kwan, 2005). In these cases, the relation between the
languages contributed to performance, and in contrast to the study of phonological
awareness, there was no correlation in decoding ability across English and Chinese,
languages with different writing systems, but strong cross-language correlations with
English for both Spanish and Hebrew, languages with more similar writing systems.
Therefore, the relation between languages has different effects on the development of
basic metalinguistic and literacy concepts. No study to date has examined the effect
of bilingual experience for both verbal and nonverbal outcomes in the same children
to determine the role of bilingualism in each of these developmental outcomes. In the
present study, we examine the effects of specific language pairs, cultural
background, and educational experience on verbal and nonverbal performance. The
language factor reflects the possibility that the effect of bilingualism depends on
the relation between the two languages. Previous studies have used either
heterogeneous samples (i.e., children speaking a variety of language pairs; Bialystok
&amp; Senman, 2004; Bialystok &amp; Shapero, 2005) or homogeneous samples (i.e., all
children spoke the same two languages but with different languages across studies;
Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004, Study 2; Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Cromdal, 1999;
Martin-Rhee &amp; Bialystok, 2008, Study 1; Ricciardelli, 1992). Therefore, it is not
clear whether the specific language or the relation between the two languages
mediates the results. In the present study, we compared homogenous groups of
bilingual children and manipulated the similarity between the two languages.
Regarding culture, recent research has suggested that Chinese and Korean monolingual
children show more advanced executive function performance than English monolingual
children in North American and United Kingdom (e.g., Oh &amp; Lewis, 2008; Sabbagh et
al., 2006). Based on these findings, Carlson and Meltzoff (2008) argued that research
with bilingual children needs to be replicated using non-Chinese samples to account
for the possibility that results might be confounded by ''cultural differences in the
early socialization of self-control.'' However, these studies are vague about what
aspects of culture contribute to differences in executive control and what mechanism
underlies these cross-cultural differences. Lewis and colleagues, for instance,
proposed that multiple factors could explain the improved control in Asian children
including genetic factors, educational and parental practices, and language
characteristics such as frequent use of verbs with young children (Lewis et al.,
2009). Parmar, Harkness, and Super (2004) reported evidence that Asian- and
Euro-American parents of American preschoolers differed in their beliefs and
practices of raising children. Although these studies demonstrate that cultural
factors impact aspects of monolingual performance on certain tasks, it is still
unclear whether bilingual children of differentculturalbackgrounds (i.e., Asian,
non-Asian) who are raised in the same communities and attend the same schools would
show comparable patterns of linguistic and cognitive performance. The language of
education may also mediate the documented effects of bilingualism. The study by
Bialystok, Luk, et al. (2010) on English receptive vocabulary showed that words
associated with schooling were responded to equally well by monolingual and bilingual
children, whereas comprehension of words primarily associated with home was better in
monolinguals. Related evidence from English monolingual children demonstrated that
the development of emerging literacy skills (i.e., awareness of the characteristics
of the English writing system) was strongly predicted by the degree to which children
engaged in home activities involving reading and writing practice (Levy, Gong,
Hessels, Evans, &amp; Jared, 2006). However, research rarely controls for which
language is used in school even though vocabulary size is a predictor of children's
performance on tests of academic achievement such as spelling, reading, and
arithmetic (Smith, Smith, &amp; Dobbs, 1991) and is positively related to executive
control in preschoolers (Carlson &amp; Moses, 2001). No studies to date have compared
bilingual groups who are instructed in different languages to assess the effects on
language and cognitive functions. We compared bilingual children whose two languages
were English plus one of Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese), French, or Spanish, with a
group of English-speaking monolingual children. French and Spanish have some
similarity with English and have shared cognate words and comparable grammatical
structures (Finkenstaedt &amp; Wolff, 1973), but Chinese is different from the other
languages in these dimensions (Chen &amp; Zhou, 1999). At the phonological level,
Chinese is a tonal language whereas English, French, and Spanish are nontonal
languages (Ye &amp; Connine, 1999). In terms of writing system, French, Spanish, and
English use an alphabetic system (Goswami, Gombert, &amp; de Barrera, 1998), whereas
Chinese is a logographic language (Shen &amp; Forster, 1999). Morphologically,
Chinese differs from English and other alphabetic languages in the relative number of
compound words (i.e., snowman, toothpaste) such that they represent about 75% of all
words in the Chinese language but only a very small proportion in the alphabetic
languages (Chen, Hao, Geva, Zhu, &amp; Shu, 2009; Liu &amp; McBride-Chang, 2010).
Finally, the overall classification of languages places them in different language
families: English, French, and Spanish are Indo-European (with French and Spanish
being Latin) and Chinese is Sino-Tibetan (Comrie, 1987). Thus, by contrasting French
and Spanish bilinguals to Chinese bilinguals it is possible to understand how the
similarity between languages affects the linguistic and nonlinguistic outcomes of
bilingualism. The comparison between Chinese-English bilingual children and the other
two bilingual groups allowed for the examination of the role of culture in the
performance of these linguistic and executive control tasks by contrasting Asian
bilinguals with non-Asian bilinguals. Finally, all the children lived in an
English-speaking community, but the FrenchEnglish bilingual children attended schools
in which French was the medium of instruction while children in the other three
groups were instructed in English. All testing was conducted in English, so the
language of schooling might independently impact performance. Because cultural
background and language similarity are correlated, only tentative conclusions about
these factors will be offered, a point to which we return in the Discussion. Previous
research has demonstrated that differences in executive control for bilingual
children are not influenced by immigration history (Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan,
2009) or culture variables (Bialystok, Barac, et al. 2010), but the role of these
factors on language performance has been less explored. Therefore, the verbal tasks
in the present study covered three aspects of language proficiency: receptive
vocabulary, grammatical ability, and metalinguistic knowledge. The nonverbal task was
a task-switching paradigm. This task was chosen because it (a) involves processes
similar to those children use to switch attention between languages; (b)
distinguishes between global and local switch costs, each of which indexes different
cognitive processes with different developmental trajectories; and (c) has been used
with children (Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009) and adults (Bialystok, Craik, &amp;
Ryan, 2006; Costa, Hernandez, &amp; Sebastian-Galles, 2008) to show bilingual
advantages in global but not local costs. Moreover, previous research has
demonstrated bilingual advantages in inhibition using such tasks as the flanker ANT
task (Mezzacappa, 2004; Yang et al., 2005) and dimensional change card sort task
(Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004), but other executive control
components, particularly switching and flexibility, have been less studied. There are
two possibilities for the effect of language similarity on executive control. The
first is that languages that are more similar require more control to discriminate
and therefore lead to more enhanced control mechanisms. Conversely, it may be that
languages that are more distant require more switching and monitoring and that may be
the source of greater enhancement. Our hypothesis was that both types of experiences
should lead to equivalent enhancement because both require effortful attention. Thus,
we expected that all three bilingual groups would perform similarly on nonverbal test
of control but that the relation between the two languages and the language
experience in education would affect the outcomes of the verbal tasks, with better
performance by children whose two languages are more related (French and Spanish
groups) and whose education is in English, the language of testing (Spanish group).
Method Participants Participants were 104 children composed of 26 English monolingual
children, 30 Chinese-English bilingual children, 28 French-English bilingual
children, and 20 Spanish-English bilingual children. All the children lived in a
large multicultural city and attended public schools. The French-English bilinguals
attended a school in which the language of instruction was French, all other children
received school instruction in English. All parents completed the Language and Social
Background Questionnaire (LSBQ) in which they answered questions about language use
patterns on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 indicated the exclusive use of English, 5
indicated the exclusive use of a non-English language, and 3 indicated balanced use
of the two. The scales were combined to produce a mean score for language use at home
and a mean score for the language spoken by the child at home. These scores are
reported in Table 1. M SD The English monolingual group ( = 71.5 months, = 6.3, range

before testing. All tasks were administered in English. The battery consisted of two
background measures (Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test [KBIT], box completion), three
language measures (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III [PPVT-III], the Wugs test,
Formulated Sentences from the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals Test), and
a computerized executive control task (color-shape task switching). The tasks were
administered in a fixed order: Wugs, PPVT-III, Formulated Sentences, color- shape
task switching, box completion and KBIT. This order was chosen to ensure that there
was enough variety in the tasks to keep children's interest during the testing
session. Children were given stickers after the completion of each task. Kaufman
Brief Intelligence Test, 2nd edition (KBIT-2). The Matrices subtest of the KBIT-2 was
administered to assess fluid reasoning (Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 2004). The test
consists of 46 items divided into three sections of increasing difficulty. On each
trial, the child was presented with visual stimuli representing either drawings of
concrete objects or abstract figures. In the first part of the test the child saw one
target drawing at the centre of the page and five additional drawings below it and
was asked to identify one of the five stimuli matching the target image. For the
other two sections the &#xB7; &#xB7; child saw an incomplete display of 2 2 or 3 3
visual stimuli with one stimulus missing, and five stimuli below the display. The
task was to choose the stimulus to complete the displayed pattern. The testing,
scoring and standardization followed the standard procedure described in the manual.
Box completion. This task is a measure of psychomotor speed (Salthouse, 1996). The
child was presented with a letter-sized sheet of paper containing an array of 35
three-sided squares arranged in five columns and seven rows. The squares were
identical in size (side length of 1.9 cm). The child's task was to complete the
squares by filling in the fourth side as fast as possible using a crayon. Children
were shown examples of how to perform the task before testing began. The time to
complete the task (in seconds) was recorded from the moment the child started drawing
the first line to the moment the last square was finished. Peabody Picture Vocabulary
Test, 3rd edition. This is a standardized test of receptive vocabulary (Dunn &amp;
Dunn, 1997) in which children select a picture from four options to match a word
given by the experimenter. The testing and scoring were done according to the
procedures described in the manual. Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, 4th
edition (CELF-4). The Formulated Sentences subtest was used to assess children's
ability to construct sentences which are grammatically and semantically intact
(Semel, Wiig, &amp; Secord, 2003). For each item, children were presented with a
picture and a target word and were asked to create a sentence about the picture that
incorporated the target word. There were two practice trials before the
administration of the test items. Testing, scoring, and standardization followed the
standard procedure described in the manual. The Wugs test. This test assesses
children's ability to apply morphological rules of English (Berko, 1958) to
unfamiliar forms, thereby reflecting children's metalinguistic awareness. Children
were shown 27 pictures illustrating novel objects, animals, plants, and actions. The
experimenter pointed to each picture and read the associated text. Thirty of the 33
texts introduced a target nonsense word (e.g., wug, kazh, gutch, etc.) and the
remaining three included English target words (glass, melt, ring). Children needed to
complete the sentence using the target word by applying English morphology to the new
words. The rules were the formation of noun plural, past tense, third person singular
for simple present tense, singular and plural possessives, comparative and
superlative of adjectives, diminutives, derived adjectives, compounded words,
progressive, and derived agentive. Two practice trials in which children created
plurals for real English words (e.g., cat, dog) preceded the test. Each correct
answer received 1 point, with the maximum being 33. Color-shape task switching. This
test assesses children's ability to switch between tasks, a central component of the
executive function (Miyake et al., 2000). The task was programmed in Macromedia Flash
Player 7 and administered on a Lenovo X61 tablet computer with a 12-in. touch-screen
monitor. The stimuli were schematic drawings of a cow and horse that were red or
blue. A blue horse and a red cow appeared on the top of the screen, each surrounded
by a black square. On each trial, a stimulus red horse or blue cow) appeared on the
bottom center of the screen with a visual cue indicating whether the stimulus was to
be matched by color or shape to the targets. Children responded by touching the
target picture that matched the stimulus on the designated dimension. The cue for
color was a circular color wheel about 0.5 cm in diameter and the cue for shape was a
black-and-white starlike shape of similar size. There were 200 trials across two
nonswitch blocks (25 trials each) and three switch blocks (50 trials each). In
nonswitch blocks, all trials appeared with the same matching criterion, and in switch
blocks, the matching criterion for each trial was generated randomly by the program
with 50% of the trials containing each cue. In switch blocks, successive trials could
either have the same matching criterion (nonswitch trials) or different matching
criteria (switch trials). Blocks were administered in a fixed order starting with the
two nonswitch blocks and continuing with the three switch blocks. Half of the
children started the test with the nonswitch color block and the other half with the
nonswitch shape block. The stimulus remained on the screen until the child made a
response. Children were instructed to perform as quickly as possible without making
mistakes. Following the response, the next trial started after a delay of 1000 ms.
Reaction time (RT) and accuracy were recorded for each trial. Global and local switch
costs were calculated from the RTs of correct trials. Global cost was calculated as
the difference between mean RT for nonswitch trials in the two nonswitch blocks and
mean RT of nonswitch trials in the switch blocks. Local switch cost was calculated as
the difference between mean RT of nonswitch trials and mean RT of switch trials in
the switch blocks (Cepeda, Kramer, &amp; de Sather, 2001). Results Preliminary
two-way ANOVAs of gender and language group for each task indicated no main effects
of gender and no interaction between gender and language group in any analysis.
Consequently, the analyses reported below were performed by collapsing across gender
groups. All significant main effects of language group were followed up with post hoc
Bonferroni contrasts to adjust for multiple comparisons. Table 1 presents the mean
and standard deviations for the background measures. There were no F ns F differences
in age, (3, 100) = 1.95, , or SES, (3, ns 98) = 1.66, , as measured by parents' years
of education reported on the LSBQ. Similarly, one-way ANOVAs with language group as a
between-subject factor indicated no difference between groups for F KBIT-2 scores, or
box completion times, s &lt; 1. Table 2 presents the mean scores and standard
deviations for the language tasks. A one-way ANOVA on PPVT scores showed a main
effect of F p language group, (3, 100) = 8.27, &lt; .0001. Post hoc Bonferroni
contrasts indicated that the monolingual children and the Spanish-English bilingual
children outperformed the other two bilingual groups who did not differ from each
other. For scores from the CELF test, the one-way ANOVA also indicated a F main
effect of language group, (3, 100) = 4.35, p &lt; .01, with post hoc Bonferroni
contrasts showing that monolingual and Spanish-English bilingual children
outperformed the French-English bilingual group. Chinese-English bilinguals were not
significantly different from any of the other three language groups. Finally, the
ANOVA on Wug scores F showed a main effect of language group, (3, p 100) = 7.65, &lt;
.0001, in which the Spanish-English bilingual children outperformed the other three
groups. Mean accuracy and RTs for the switching task are presented in Table 3.
Accuracy data were analyzed by a two-way ANOVA for language group and block type and
showed a main effect of block F p type, (1, 99) = 48.47, &lt; .0001, with fewer
errors in the nonswitch blocks than switch blocks and no other effects. A similar
two-way ANOVA for RT F revealed a main effect of language group, (3, p 99) = 5.79,
&lt; .002, with all three bilingual groups showing faster RTs than the monolingual
children, F a main effect of block type, (1, 99) = 405.70, p &lt; .0001, with faster
RTs in the nonswitch blocks than in switch blocks, and an interaction between F p
them, (3, 99) = 6.23, &lt; .001. Tests for simple effects indicated no differences
among language F ns groups in nonswitch blocks, (3, 99) = 1.23, , but F a significant
difference in switch blocks, (3, p 99) = 6.52, &lt; .001. Post hoc Bonferroni tests
showed that all three bilingual groups had faster RTs than the monolingual children
with no difference among the three bilingual groups. Local and global switch costs
are displayed in Figure 1. Separate one-way ANOVAs for language group showed no
effect on local cost, F&lt; 1, but a significant effect of language group on global

to investigate the effects of language similarity, cultural background, and
educational experience on the verbal and nonverbal outcomes of bilingualism.
Six-yearold monolingual and bilingual children with equivalent psychomotor speed,
general cognitive level, and SES performed language tasks measuring vocabulary,
grammar, and metalinguistic knowledge, and a nonverbal executive control task
assessing task switching. The three bilingual groups differed on several factors yet
demonstrated similar performance in task switching, exceeding that of<component

research (e.g., Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009), bilingual children showed smaller
global switch costs than monolingual children. These results offer strong support for
the claim that bilingualism acts independently of variables such as language
similarity, cultural background, and language of schooling in influencing nonverbal
outcomes. In previous studies, East Asian preschoolers showed an advantage over
children from non-Asian cultures on both &#x2044; conflict inhibition measures (e.g.,
day night task, Luria's hand game task) and delay inhibition measures (e.g., gift
delay; e.g., Oh &amp; Lewis, 2008; Sabbagh et al., 2006). However, research with
bilinguals only shows advantages on conflict tasks with no advantage on delay tasks
(e.g., Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008). Therefore, it may be that influences of Asian
culture affect delay inhibition independently of bilingual effects on conflict
resolution. In the present study, Chinese-English bilinguals did not differ from the
Spanish- and French-English<component x="316.06" y="319.38" width="232.44"

lateness="0.8" reference_score="5.68">bilinguals on executive control, suggesting
that cultural background did not contribute to performance above and beyond
bilingualism. Taken together with other results (Bialystok, Barac, et al., 2010;
Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009), these findings demonstrate the generality of the
bilingual advantage in executive functioning. In contrast to nonverbal performance,
scores on the verbal tasks were mediated by language similarity and language of
schooling. The Spanish bilingual children outperformed the French bilingual children
on all three measures (receptive vocabulary, grammatical knowledge, and
metalinguistic awareness) and the Chinese bilinguals on two of them (receptive
vocabulary and metalinguistic awareness). Importantly, the Spanish bilinguals were
not different from the other two bilingual groups in terms of the amount of language
exposure and language production at home. The Spanish bilinguals and Chinese
bilinguals were both being educated in English, but English metalinguistic
performance was better only for the Spanish children, possibly because of greater
similarity between Spanish and English. This pattern is consistent with results
reported by Bialystok et al. (2003, Study 3) showing an interaction between language
similarity and bilingualism to determine verbal outcomes. In another study (Bialystok
et al., 2005), Spanish and Hebrew bilinguals showed more advanced performance in
learning to read in English than English monolinguals, with the Chinese bilinguals at
an intermediate level between these groups. These results were interpreted to suggest
both general and specific effects of bilingualism such that speaking two languages
boosts general knowledge related to print, but this facilitation is greater when the
two languages share the same writing system. Taken together, these studies suggest
that both language similarity and language of schooling contribute to performance on
linguistic and metalinguistic tasks by bilingual children. For the linguistic
assessments of English receptive vocabulary and grammatical structure, the
Spanish-English bilingual children obtained scores comparable with monolinguals;
French-English children spoke a language with some relation to English and
ChineseEnglish children were being educated in English, but each of these groups
lacked one of the essential experiences that characterized the Spanish-English
bilinguals and consequently obtained lower scores than the Spanish-English bilingual
and monolingual groups. However, the results are different for the metalinguistic
task. Unlike measures of linguistic knowledge, metalinguistic awareness has been
shown to develop earlier in bilingual children. The present results suggest that the
metalinguistic advantage for bilingual children depends on these linguistic measures
(i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammatical knowledge). Specifically, the
metalinguistic task was solved relatively better by the French-English and
Chinese-English bilinguals than were the linguistic tasks in that they performed as
well as the monolinguals instead of more poorly. Yet the Spanish-English bilinguals,
whose linguistic basis was equivalent to monolinguals performed better than
monolinguals on the metalinguistic task. Thus, all three bilingual groups showed an
advantage in the metalinguistic task relative to their performance in the linguistic
measures, with the French and Chinese groups reaching the level of monolinguals and
the Spanish group surpassing them. This pattern provides support for the idea that
the nature of that advantage depended on the relation between the languages and their
experiences in schooling. It is important to note that the majority of the literature
reporting metalinguistic advantages in bilingual children has compared monolingual
and bilingual children being educated in the same language with somewhat equivalent
linguistic ability in that language, as was the case for the Spanish bilinguals. The
present study provides evidence for the distinction between the linguistic and
cognitive outcomes of bilingualism. The results endorse the conclusion that
bilingualism itself is responsible for the increased levels of executive control
previously reported. Bilingual children were better able than monolinguals to
maintain a task set across a mixed block, an advantage found equally in all three
bilingual groups. In contrast, performance on the linguistic tasks varied with
educational experience and similarity between the two languages. Although cultural
background and language similarity are correlated for the Chinese group, their
effects are separable. The ChineseEnglish bilinguals were only different from the
other bilinguals on the language measures, and since it is hard to imagine how
cultural influences would be responsible, we attribute those effects to degree of
language similarity. In contrast, there were no differences among any of the
bilingual groups on the nonverbal measure, ruling out both language similarity and
cultural background as contributors to that performance. These results refine our
understanding of how experience in general, and bilingualism in particular, shape
development.<component x="46.77" y="62.11" width="232.45" height="643.66" page="8"

development of bilingual children is different from that of their monolingual peers,
but increasing evidence shows that nonverbal cognitive development is also affected
by bilingualism. These outcomes, however, are different. Linguistic tasks are often
performed more poorly by bilingual children than monolinguals, especially assessments
of vocabulary (Bialystok, Luk, Peets, &amp; Yang, 2010; Oller, Pearson, &amp;
Cobo-Lewis, 2007), although tests of metalinguistic awareness are generally performed
better by bilingual children (Bialystok, 1986; Cromdal, 1999; Ricciardelli, 1992). In
contrast, many tests of executive control are performed better by bilinguals
(Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok, Barac, Blaye, &amp; PoulinDubois, 2010; Bialystok &amp;
Martin, 2004; Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009; Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008;
Mezzacappa, 2004; Yang, Shih, &amp; Lust, 2005) although there is no effect for tasks
based on withholding a response even though that too is part of executive control
(Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Martin-Rhee &amp; Bialystok, 2008). Understanding
these effects is complicated by the fact that bilingualism is often correlated with
variables that may themselves influence performance. For example, Morton and Harper
(2007) claimed that the reported bilingual advantage was due to socioeconomic
differences between bilingual and monolingual children. There is no doubt that
socioeconomic status (SES) is a powerful influence on executive control, but it does
not undermine the body of literature for which bilingual advantages have been
recorded (Bialystok, 2009). Similarly, claims for cultural effects favoring Asian
children on tests of executive control (e.g., Sabbagh, Xu, Carlson, Moses, &amp; Lee,
2006) must be separated from the role of bilingualism in shaping this performance.
The present study addresses these issues by examining three groups of bilingual
children and one group of monolinguals performing verbal and nonverbal tasks. The
bilingual children differ in terms of similarity between English and their other
language, cultural background, and educational experience. It is not possible to
achieve a parametric manipulation of these variables, so our approach is to compare
specific groups to address each of these factors. Two previous studies have examined
the role of culture and immigration history on the cognitive outcomes of
bilingualism. Bialystok and Viswanathan (2009) compared three groups of 8-year-old
children on an executive control task. Children were matched on educational
experience and social class and were English-speaking monolinguals in Canada,
bilinguals in Canada (mixed cultural backgrounds, immigrants), or bilinguals in

results showed that the two bilingual groups outperformed the monolinguals on the
conflict conditions, with no difference between the two bilingual groups. In another
study, Bialystok, Barac, et al. (2010) compared a group of bilinguals with two
monolingual groups-an English-speaking group in Canada and a French-speaking group in
France. Again, there was no difference between the two monolingual groups and better
performance by the bilinguals on all the conflict tasks. Together, these results
support the generality of the bilingual effects over the influence of immigration and
culture on nonverbal tests of executive control. Unlike cognitive outcomes, different
groups of bilinguals do not perform comparably on linguistic tasks. Spanish-English
bilinguals outperformed both monolinguals and Chinese-English bilinguals on a test of
English phonological awareness, presumably because of the degree of similarity
between the languages (Bialystok, Majumder, &amp; Martin, 2003). Spanish orthography
is transparent in that it is based on consistent letter-sound mappings, and this
factor might also contribute to the enhanced performance of Spanish-English
bilinguals on phonological awareness tasks. In addition, phonological awareness
appears to transfer easily across languages. Cross-language correlations in
performance on phonological awareness tasks have been reported for English-Spanish
bilinguals (Lindsey, Manis, &amp; Bailey, 2003), English-French bilinguals (Comeau,
Cormier, Grandmaison, &amp; Lacroix, 1999), and English-Cantonese bilinguals (Luk
&amp; Bialystok, 2008) indicating a common basis for this ability across languages
irrespective of its rate of development. The same is not true for early reading: In a
study comparing Spanish-English, Hebrew-English, and Chinese-English bilingual
children on a decoding task in both languages, better performance than monolinguals
was found for the Spanish and Hebrew groups, with no advantage for the ChineseEnglish
group (Bialystok, Luk, &amp; Kwan, 2005). In these cases, the relation between the
languages contributed to performance, and in contrast to the study of phonological
awareness, there was no correlation in decoding ability across English and Chinese,
languages with different writing systems, but strong cross-language correlations with
English for both Spanish and Hebrew, languages with more similar writing systems.
Therefore, the relation between languages has different effects on the development of
basic metalinguistic and literacy concepts. No study to date has examined the effect
of bilingual experience for both verbal and nonverbal outcomes in the same children
to determine the role of bilingualism in each of these developmental outcomes. In the
present study, we examine the effects of specific language pairs, cultural
background, and educational experience on verbal and nonverbal performance. The
language factor reflects the possibility that the effect of bilingualism depends on
the relation between the two languages. Previous studies have used either
heterogeneous samples (i.e., children speaking a variety of language pairs; Bialystok
&amp; Senman, 2004; Bialystok &amp; Shapero, 2005) or homogeneous samples (i.e., all
children spoke the same two languages but with different languages across studies;
Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004, Study 2; Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008; Cromdal, 1999;
Martin-Rhee &amp; Bialystok, 2008, Study 1; Ricciardelli, 1992). Therefore, it is not
clear whether the specific language or the relation between the two languages
mediates the results. In the present study, we compared homogenous groups of
bilingual children and manipulated the similarity between the two languages.
Regarding culture, recent research has suggested that Chinese and Korean monolingual
children show more advanced executive function performance than English monolingual
children in North American and United Kingdom (e.g., Oh &amp; Lewis, 2008; Sabbagh et
al., 2006). Based on these findings, Carlson and Meltzoff (2008) argued that research
with bilingual children needs to be replicated using non-Chinese samples to account
for the possibility that results might be confounded by ''cultural differences in the
early socialization of self-control.'' However, these studies are vague about what
aspects of culture contribute to differences in executive control and what mechanism
underlies these cross-cultural differences. Lewis and colleagues, for instance,
proposed that multiple factors could explain the improved control in Asian children
including genetic factors, educational and parental practices, and language
characteristics such as frequent use of verbs with young children (Lewis et al.,
2009). Parmar, Harkness, and Super (2004) reported evidence that Asian- and
Euro-American parents of American preschoolers differed in their beliefs and
practices of raising children. Although these studies demonstrate that cultural
factors impact aspects of monolingual performance on certain tasks, it is still
unclear whether bilingual children of differentculturalbackgrounds (i.e., Asian,
non-Asian) who are raised in the same communities and attend the same schools would
show comparable patterns of linguistic and cognitive performance. The language of
education may also mediate the documented effects of bilingualism. The study by
Bialystok, Luk, et al. (2010) on English receptive vocabulary showed that words
associated with schooling were responded to equally well by monolingual and bilingual
children, whereas comprehension of words primarily associated with home was better in
monolinguals. Related evidence from English monolingual children demonstrated that
the development of emerging literacy skills (i.e., awareness of the characteristics
of the English writing system) was strongly predicted by the degree to which children
engaged in home activities involving reading and writing practice (Levy, Gong,
Hessels, Evans, &amp; Jared, 2006). However, research rarely controls for which
language is used in school even though vocabulary size is a predictor of children's
performance on tests of academic achievement such as spelling, reading, and
arithmetic (Smith, Smith, &amp; Dobbs, 1991) and is positively related to executive
control in preschoolers (Carlson &amp; Moses, 2001). No studies to date have compared
bilingual groups who are instructed in different languages to assess the effects on
language and cognitive functions. We compared bilingual children whose two languages
were English plus one of Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese), French, or Spanish, with a
group of English-speaking monolingual children. French and Spanish have some
similarity with English and have shared cognate words and comparable grammatical
structures (Finkenstaedt &amp; Wolff, 1973), but Chinese is different from the other
languages in these dimensions (Chen &amp; Zhou, 1999). At the phonological level,
Chinese is a tonal language whereas English, French, and Spanish are nontonal
languages (Ye &amp; Connine, 1999). In terms of writing system, French, Spanish, and
English use an alphabetic system (Goswami, Gombert, &amp; de Barrera, 1998), whereas
Chinese is a logographic language (Shen &amp; Forster, 1999). Morphologically,
Chinese differs from English and other alphabetic languages in the relative number of
compound words (i.e., snowman, toothpaste) such that they represent about 75% of all
words in the Chinese language but only a very small proportion in the alphabetic
languages (Chen, Hao, Geva, Zhu, &amp; Shu, 2009; Liu &amp; McBride-Chang, 2010).
Finally, the overall classification of languages places them in different language
families: English, French, and Spanish are Indo-European (with French and Spanish
being Latin) and Chinese is Sino-Tibetan (Comrie, 1987). Thus, by contrasting French
and Spanish bilinguals to Chinese bilinguals it is possible to understand how the
similarity between languages affects the linguistic and nonlinguistic outcomes of
bilingualism. The comparison between Chinese-English bilingual children and the other
two bilingual groups allowed for the examination of the role of culture in the
performance of these linguistic and executive control tasks by contrasting Asian
bilinguals with non-Asian bilinguals. Finally, all the children lived in an
English-speaking community, but the FrenchEnglish bilingual children attended schools
in which French was the medium of instruction while children in the other three
groups were instructed in English. All testing was conducted in English, so the
language of schooling might independently impact performance. Because cultural
background and language similarity are correlated, only tentative conclusions about
these factors will be offered, a point to which we return in the Discussion. Previous
research has demonstrated that differences in executive control for bilingual
children are not influenced by immigration history (Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan,
2009) or culture variables (Bialystok, Barac, et al. 2010), but the role of these
factors on language performance has been less explored. Therefore, the verbal tasks
in the present study covered three aspects of language proficiency: receptive
vocabulary, grammatical ability, and metalinguistic knowledge. The nonverbal task was
a task-switching paradigm. This task was chosen because it (a) involves processes
similar to those children use to switch attention between languages; (b)
distinguishes between global and local switch costs, each of which indexes different
cognitive processes with different developmental trajectories; and (c) has been used
with children (Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009) and adults (Bialystok, Craik, &amp;
Ryan, 2006; Costa, Hernandez, &amp; Sebastian-Galles, 2008) to show bilingual
advantages in global but not local costs. Moreover, previous research has
demonstrated bilingual advantages in inhibition using such tasks as the flanker ANT
task (Mezzacappa, 2004; Yang et al., 2005) and dimensional change card sort task
(Bialystok, 1999; Bialystok &amp; Martin, 2004), but other executive control
components, particularly switching and flexibility, have been less studied. There are
two possibilities for the effect of language similarity on executive control. The
first is that languages that are more similar require more control to discriminate
and therefore lead to more enhanced control mechanisms. Conversely, it may be that
languages that are more distant require more switching and monitoring and that may be
the source of greater enhancement. Our hypothesis was that both types of experiences
should lead to equivalent enhancement because both require effortful attention. Thus,
we expected that all three bilingual groups would perform similarly on nonverbal test
of control but that the relation between the two languages and the language
experience in education would affect the outcomes of the verbal tasks, with better
performance by children whose two languages are more related (French and Spanish
groups) and whose education is in English, the language of testing (Spanish group).
Method Participants Participants were 104 children composed of 26 English monolingual
children, 30 Chinese-English bilingual children, 28 French-English bilingual
children, and 20 Spanish-English bilingual children. All the children lived in a
large multicultural city and attended public schools. The French-English bilinguals
attended a school in which the language of instruction was French, all other children
received school instruction in English. All parents completed the Language and Social
Background Questionnaire (LSBQ) in which they answered questions about language use
patterns on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 indicated the exclusive use of English, 5
indicated the exclusive use of a non-English language, and 3 indicated balanced use
of the two. The scales were combined to produce a mean score for language use at home
and a mean score for the language spoken by the child at home. These scores are
reported in Table 1. M SD The English monolingual group ( = 71.5 months, = 6.3, range

before testing. All tasks were administered in English. The battery consisted of two
background measures (Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test [KBIT], box completion), three
language measures (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III [PPVT-III], the Wugs test,
Formulated Sentences from the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals Test), and
a computerized executive control task (color-shape task switching). The tasks were
administered in a fixed order: Wugs, PPVT-III, Formulated Sentences, color- shape
task switching, box completion and KBIT. This order was chosen to ensure that there
was enough variety in the tasks to keep children's interest during the testing
session. Children were given stickers after the completion of each task. Kaufman
Brief Intelligence Test, 2nd edition (KBIT-2). The Matrices subtest of the KBIT-2 was
administered to assess fluid reasoning (Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 2004). The test
consists of 46 items divided into three sections of increasing difficulty. On each
trial, the child was presented with visual stimuli representing either drawings of
concrete objects or abstract figures. In the first part of the test the child saw one
target drawing at the centre of the page and five additional drawings below it and
was asked to identify one of the five stimuli matching the target image. For the
other two sections the &#xB7; &#xB7; child saw an incomplete display of 2 2 or 3 3
visual stimuli with one stimulus missing, and five stimuli below the display. The
task was to choose the stimulus to complete the displayed pattern. The testing,
scoring and standardization followed the standard procedure described in the manual.
Box completion. This task is a measure of psychomotor speed (Salthouse, 1996). The
child was presented with a letter-sized sheet of paper containing an array of 35
three-sided squares arranged in five columns and seven rows. The squares were
identical in size (side length of 1.9 cm). The child's task was to complete the
squares by filling in the fourth side as fast as possible using a crayon. Children
were shown examples of how to perform the task before testing began. The time to
complete the task (in seconds) was recorded from the moment the child started drawing
the first line to the moment the last square was finished. Peabody Picture Vocabulary
Test, 3rd edition. This is a standardized test of receptive vocabulary (Dunn &amp;
Dunn, 1997) in which children select a picture from four options to match a word
given by the experimenter. The testing and scoring were done according to the
procedures described in the manual. Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, 4th
edition (CELF-4). The Formulated Sentences subtest was used to assess children's
ability to construct sentences which are grammatically and semantically intact
(Semel, Wiig, &amp; Secord, 2003). For each item, children were presented with a
picture and a target word and were asked to create a sentence about the picture that
incorporated the target word. There were two practice trials before the
administration of the test items. Testing, scoring, and standardization followed the
standard procedure described in the manual. The Wugs test. This test assesses
children's ability to apply morphological rules of English (Berko, 1958) to
unfamiliar forms, thereby reflecting children's metalinguistic awareness. Children
were shown 27 pictures illustrating novel objects, animals, plants, and actions. The
experimenter pointed to each picture and read the associated text. Thirty of the 33
texts introduced a target nonsense word (e.g., wug, kazh, gutch, etc.) and the
remaining three included English target words (glass, melt, ring). Children needed to
complete the sentence using the target word by applying English morphology to the new
words. The rules were the formation of noun plural, past tense, third person singular
for simple present tense, singular and plural possessives, comparative and
superlative of adjectives, diminutives, derived adjectives, compounded words,
progressive, and derived agentive. Two practice trials in which children created
plurals for real English words (e.g., cat, dog) preceded the test. Each correct
answer received 1 point, with the maximum being 33. Color-shape task switching. This
test assesses children's ability to switch between tasks, a central component of the
executive function (Miyake et al., 2000). The task was programmed in Macromedia Flash
Player 7 and administered on a Lenovo X61 tablet computer with a 12-in. touch-screen
monitor. The stimuli were schematic drawings of a cow and horse that were red or
blue. A blue horse and a red cow appeared on the top of the screen, each surrounded
by a black square. On each trial, a stimulus red horse or blue cow) appeared on the
bottom center of the screen with a visual cue indicating whether the stimulus was to
be matched by color or shape to the targets. Children responded by touching the
target picture that matched the stimulus on the designated dimension. The cue for
color was a circular color wheel about 0.5 cm in diameter and the cue for shape was a
black-and-white starlike shape of similar size. There were 200 trials across two
nonswitch blocks (25 trials each) and three switch blocks (50 trials each). In
nonswitch blocks, all trials appeared with the same matching criterion, and in switch
blocks, the matching criterion for each trial was generated randomly by the program
with 50% of the trials containing each cue. In switch blocks, successive trials could
either have the same matching criterion (nonswitch trials) or different matching
criteria (switch trials). Blocks were administered in a fixed order starting with the
two nonswitch blocks and continuing with the three switch blocks. Half of the
children started the test with the nonswitch color block and the other half with the
nonswitch shape block. The stimulus remained on the screen until the child made a
response. Children were instructed to perform as quickly as possible without making
mistakes. Following the response, the next trial started after a delay of 1000 ms.
Reaction time (RT) and accuracy were recorded for each trial. Global and local switch
costs were calculated from the RTs of correct trials. Global cost was calculated as
the difference between mean RT for nonswitch trials in the two nonswitch blocks and
mean RT of nonswitch trials in the switch blocks. Local switch cost was calculated as
the difference between mean RT of nonswitch trials and mean RT of switch trials in
the switch blocks (Cepeda, Kramer, &amp; de Sather, 2001). Results Preliminary
two-way ANOVAs of gender and language group for each task indicated no main effects
of gender and no interaction between gender and language group in any analysis.
Consequently, the analyses reported below were performed by collapsing across gender
groups. All significant main effects of language group were followed up with post hoc
Bonferroni contrasts to adjust for multiple comparisons. Table 1 presents the mean
and standard deviations for the background measures. There were no F ns F differences
in age, (3, 100) = 1.95, , or SES, (3, ns 98) = 1.66, , as measured by parents' years
of education reported on the LSBQ. Similarly, one-way ANOVAs with language group as a
between-subject factor indicated no difference between groups for F KBIT-2 scores, or
box completion times, s &lt; 1. Table 2 presents the mean scores and standard
deviations for the language tasks. A one-way ANOVA on PPVT scores showed a main
effect of F p language group, (3, 100) = 8.27, &lt; .0001. Post hoc Bonferroni
contrasts indicated that the monolingual children and the Spanish-English bilingual
children outperformed the other two bilingual groups who did not differ from each
other. For scores from the CELF test, the one-way ANOVA also indicated a F main
effect of language group, (3, 100) = 4.35, p &lt; .01, with post hoc Bonferroni
contrasts showing that monolingual and Spanish-English bilingual children
outperformed the French-English bilingual group. Chinese-English bilinguals were not
significantly different from any of the other three language groups. Finally, the
ANOVA on Wug scores F showed a main effect of language group, (3, p 100) = 7.65, &lt;
.0001, in which the Spanish-English bilingual children outperformed the other three
groups. Mean accuracy and RTs for the switching task are presented in Table 3.
Accuracy data were analyzed by a two-way ANOVA for language group and block type and
showed a main effect of block F p type, (1, 99) = 48.47, &lt; .0001, with fewer
errors in the nonswitch blocks than switch blocks and no other effects. A similar
two-way ANOVA for RT F revealed a main effect of language group, (3, p 99) = 5.79,
&lt; .002, with all three bilingual groups showing faster RTs than the monolingual
children, F a main effect of block type, (1, 99) = 405.70, p &lt; .0001, with faster
RTs in the nonswitch blocks than in switch blocks, and an interaction between F p
them, (3, 99) = 6.23, &lt; .001. Tests for simple effects indicated no differences
among language F ns groups in nonswitch blocks, (3, 99) = 1.23, , but F a significant
difference in switch blocks, (3, p 99) = 6.52, &lt; .001. Post hoc Bonferroni tests
showed that all three bilingual groups had faster RTs than the monolingual children

to investigate the effects of language similarity, cultural background, and

Six-yearold monolingual and bilingual children with equivalent psychomotor speed,

research (e.g., Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009), bilingual children showed smaller
global switch costs than monolingual children. These results offer strong support for
the claim that bilingualism acts independently of variables such as language
similarity, cultural background, and language of schooling in influencing nonverbal
outcomes. In previous studies, East Asian preschoolers showed an advantage over
children from non-Asian cultures on both &#x2044; conflict inhibition measures (e.g.,
day night task, Luria's hand game task) and delay inhibition measures (e.g., gift
delay; e.g., Oh &amp; Lewis, 2008; Sabbagh et al., 2006). However, research with
bilinguals only shows advantages on conflict tasks with no advantage on delay tasks
(e.g., Carlson &amp; Meltzoff, 2008). Therefore, it may be that influences of Asian
culture affect delay inhibition independently of bilingual effects on conflict
resolution. In the present study, Chinese-English bilinguals did not differ from the
Spanish- and French-English<component x="316.06" y="319.38" width="232.44"

lateness="0.8" reference_score="5.68">bilinguals on executive control, suggesting
that cultural background did not contribute to performance above and beyond
bilingualism. Taken together with other results (Bialystok, Barac, et al., 2010;
Bialystok &amp; Viswanathan, 2009), these findings demonstrate the generality of the
bilingual advantage in executive functioning. In contrast to nonverbal performance,
scores on the verbal tasks were mediated by language similarity and language of
schooling. The Spanish bilingual children outperformed the French bilingual children
on all three measures (receptive vocabulary, grammatical knowledge, and
metalinguistic awareness) and the Chinese bilinguals on two of them (receptive
vocabulary and metalinguistic awareness). Importantly, the Spanish bilinguals were
not different from the other two bilingual groups in terms of the amount of language
exposure and language production at home. The Spanish bilinguals and Chinese
bilinguals were both being educated in English, but English metalinguistic
performance was better only for the Spanish children, possibly because of greater
similarity between Spanish and English. This pattern is consistent with results
reported by Bialystok et al. (2003, Study 3) showing an interaction between language
similarity and bilingualism to determine verbal outcomes. In another study (Bialystok
et al., 2005), Spanish and Hebrew bilinguals showed more advanced performance in
learning to read in English than English monolinguals, with the Chinese bilinguals at
an intermediate level between these groups. These results were interpreted to suggest
both general and specific effects of bilingualism such that speaking two languages
boosts general knowledge related to print, but this facilitation is greater when the
two languages share the same writing system. Taken together, these studies suggest
that both language similarity and language of schooling contribute to performance on
linguistic and metalinguistic tasks by bilingual children. For the linguistic
assessments of English receptive vocabulary and grammatical structure, the
Spanish-English bilingual children obtained scores comparable with monolinguals;
French-English children spoke a language with some relation to English and
ChineseEnglish children were being educated in English, but each of these groups
lacked one of the essential experiences that characterized the Spanish-English
bilinguals and consequently obtained lower scores than the Spanish-English bilingual
and monolingual groups. However, the results are different for the metalinguistic
task. Unlike measures of linguistic knowledge, metalinguistic awareness has been
shown to develop earlier in bilingual children. The present results suggest that the
metalinguistic advantage for bilingual children depends on these linguistic measures
(i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammatical knowledge). Specifically, the
metalinguistic task was solved relatively better by the French-English and
Chinese-English bilinguals than were the linguistic tasks in that they performed as
well as the monolinguals instead of more poorly. Yet the Spanish-English bilinguals,
whose linguistic basis was equivalent to monolinguals performed better than
monolinguals on the metalinguistic task. Thus, all three bilingual groups showed an
advantage in the metalinguistic task relative to their performance in the linguistic
measures, with the French and Chinese groups reaching the level of monolinguals and
the Spanish group surpassing them. This pattern provides support for the idea that
the nature of that advantage depended on the relation between the languages and their
experiences in schooling. It is important to note that the majority of the literature
reporting metalinguistic advantages in bilingual children has compared monolingual
and bilingual children being educated in the same language with somewhat equivalent
linguistic ability in that language, as was the case for the Spanish bilinguals. The
present study provides evidence for the distinction between the linguistic and
cognitive outcomes of bilingualism. The results endorse the conclusion that
bilingualism itself is responsible for the increased levels of executive control
previously reported. Bilingual children were better able than monolinguals to
maintain a task set across a mixed block, an advantage found equally in all three
bilingual groups. In contrast, performance on the linguistic tasks varied with
educational experience and similarity between the two languages. Although cultural
background and language similarity are correlated for the Chinese group, their
effects are separable. The ChineseEnglish bilinguals were only different from the
other bilinguals on the language measures, and since it is hard to imagine how
cultural influences would be responsible, we attribute those effects to degree of
language similarity. In contrast, there were no differences among any of the
bilingual groups on the nonverbal measure, ruling out both language similarity and
cultural background as contributors to that performance. These results refine our
understanding of how experience in general, and bilingualism in particular, shape
development.<component x="46.77" y="62.11" width="232.45" height="643.66" page="8"
