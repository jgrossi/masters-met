ambiguity. Sentences can be ambiguous between multiple syntactic structures, words
can be ambiguous between multiple meanings or senses, and an acoustic signal can be
ambiguous between multiple words. Nevertheless, adults manage to resolve the vast
majority of linguistic ambiguity rapidly and accurately. Research in
psycholinguistics suggests that this accuracy is achieved through a cognitive
architecture in which a wide variety of information sources, both bottom-up and
top-down, are used to select the best interpretation from the multiple possible
alternatives (see, e.g., Altmann, 1998; Dahan &amp; Magnuson, 2006; MacDonald,
Pearlmutter, &amp; Seidenberg, 1994; Swinney, 1979). For example, the intended
meaning of a noun-verb homophone like duckcould be resolved using information from
the same level of representation, such as priming by a related word (e.g., quack) or
through top-down feedback from its syntactic context (e.g., whether it is preceded by
a definite article). Far less is known, however, about how the mechanisms of
ambiguity resolution develop. To what extent does the cognitive machinery that
children use for language comprehension relate to the machinery used by adults? In
fact, recent work suggests that, in many respects, child and adult language
processing are similar.<component x="57.0" y="248.05" width="240.09" height="239.24"

language quickly and incrementally: They make guesses about plausible interpretations
on the basis of the currently available evidence and do not hold off on interpreting
a sentence until it has finished (Fernald, Zangl, Portillo, &amp; Marchman, 2008;
Snedeker, 2009; Trueswell &amp; Gleitman, 2004; Trueswell, Sekerina, Hill, &amp;
Logrip, 1999). But, in other respects, children's ambiguity resolution is very
different. In particular, their coordination of different levels of linguistic
representation to ultimately choose an interpretation is distinctly not adultlike.
Research on syntactic ambiguity resolution suggests that although children have
little difficulty using bottom-up information in their decisions, they find the
integration of top-down information considerably more demanding. Evidence for this
distinction comes from children's ability to resolve ambiguous phrases such tickle
the frog with the feather as . Here, the ambiguity arises over with the feather where
to attach the prepositional phrase , as an instrument phrase attached to the verb
(tickling using the feather) or as a modifier of the noun (the frog holding the
feather). Five-year-olds can resolve these ambiguities using bottom-up cues such as
lexical statistics, the frequency with which a verb is found in a particular
syntactic structure. Because a prepositional tickle phrase subsequent to the verb
most frequently describes an instrument, children tend to attach all ambiguous
prepositional tickle phrases following as instruments, whereas for verbs that choose
the frog typically do not take an instrument phrase (e.g., with the feather the frog
), children take the phrase to modify (Kidd &amp; Bavin, 2005; Snedeker &amp;
Trueswell, 2004; Trueswell et al., 1999). This bottom-up facility extends to
additional cues, such as the prosodic rhythm and stress in a sentence (Snedeker &amp;
Yuan, 2008). However, children's use of top-down information is very different. For
instance, adults will quickly account for a cue called referential context tickle the
frog with the feather . If is uttered in front of two frogs, one holding a feather
and one empty-handed, adults immediately make the inference that the prepositional
phrase modifies the noun to disambiguate which of the two frogs is being referred to.
In contrast, 5-year-old children fail to make this inference and rely on lexical
statistics. It is only by around 7 years of age that children appear to use a
top-down cue like referential context (Snedeker &amp; Trueswell, 2004; Trueswell et
al., 1999). Building on this, Kidd and Bavin (2005) demonstrated that children 3
years 8 months old pay little attention to another chop the top-down cue, global
plausibility. Consider the phrase tree with the leaves . Even though choptypically
takes an instrument phrase, adults generally attach the prepositional phrase as a
modifier of the noun, because leaves are implausible instruments. By contrast, their
participants treated the phrase as an instrument 60% of the time; that is, they
implausibly took it as an instruction to chop the tree using some leaves (see also
Snedeker, Worek, &amp; Shafto, 2009). Finally, Hurewitz, Brown-Schmidt, Thorpe,
Gleitman, and Trueswell (2000) demonstrated that when 4.5-year-olds heard a question
that (for adults) should promote modifier interWhich frog went to pretations for
subsequent ambiguities (e.g., Mrs. Squid's house? ), it did not in fact do so. What
might cause this disparity in children's use of bottom-up and top-down cues? Snedeker
and Yuan (2008) discussed two possible interpretations. First, they suggested a
bottom-up hypothesis, in which young children's sentence processing shows a blanket
insensitivity to top-down information. This could arise if top-down processing is too
computationally arduous for children to deploy quickly and accurately or if children
do not know how to correctly align levels of representation. Second, Snedeker and
Yuan (2008) discussed an informativity account originally suggested by Trueswell and
colleagues (Snedeker &amp; Trueswell, 2004; Snedeker &amp; Yuan, 2008; Trueswell
&amp; Gleitman, 2007; Trueswell et al., 1999), who proposed that children can
potentially integrate a variety of information sources but that they instead choose
to base their decisions on a smaller set of highly frequent and reliable cues. Under
this informativity account, lexical statistics are used early because they are
invariably present, they are informative, and they can be calculated via a relatively
simple tabulation of frequencies. By contrast, referential context appears to be rare
and less reliable (Trueswell &amp; Gleitman, 2004), and so children rely on it less
heavily than adults might. At first glance, the viability of the bottom-up account
might appear to be challenged by evidence that children can use topdown information
when they are learning about the structure of their language rather than processing
it. Even 6-month-olds can use top-down lexical information to discover boundaries
between words in fluent speech (Bortfeld, Morgan, Golinkoff, &amp; Rathbun, 2005),
and there are many demonstrations that children can use higher level syntactic
information to guide their hypotheses in word learning (Naigles, 1996). However, it
is not obvious that the cognitive architectures underlying language acquisition and
processing are identical. In fact, differences in the tasks involved give reason to
believe that the two differ in a number of ways. During processing, children must
select from a small number of known alternative interpretations, but during
acquisition they have to create these interpretations themselves. This act of
creation will most likely take place slowly and rely on top-down information out of
necessity (for instance, in learning the meaning of a word, the arbitrary
relationship between a word's form and its meaning ensures that bottom-up information
is not particularly informative). By contrast, language processing requires children
to make a series of quick decisions, for which bottom-up information will be a useful
guide. In sum, evidence from language acquisition does not indubitably constrain
theories of language processing development. The critical issue for both the
informativity and the bottom-up accounts is not whether children are blind to
top-down information in toto but why they seem to have particular difficulty
integrating top-down information when resolving known linguistic ambiguities. The two
proposals ascribe quite different reasons for why children's language processing
architecture may differ from adults' and therefore make different predictions about
ambiguity resolution in other linguistic domains. The bottom-up hypothesis predicts
that topdown integration is generally difficult, and so children should ignore
top-down information when resolving any type of linguistic ambiguity. By contrast,
the informativity account predicts that those top-down cues that are not used for
syntactic ambiguity resolution might still be integrated for other types of
linguistic ambiguity.<component x="315.0" y="78.05" width="240.08" height="409.25"

processing might prove more relevant is the resolution of lexical ambiguity. Most
words are ambiguous. knight, bat, This is most obviously seen with homophones (like
or bark ), where two meanings are completely unrelated but share a phonological form
(e.g., as a result of contact between two languages). But comprehension also requires
facing the subtler challenges of polysemes, words that are ambiguous between multiple
senses that are related (e.g., lined academic paper, roastedor or angry chicken,
birthday playing card or or ). For instance, a birthday card and a playing card are
different things, but it does not seem to be an accident that they share a name
(i.e., because they are made of the same material). The ambiguity in polysemy is not
only subtler than in homophony, it is also more common: Most frequent words are
polysemous, many of them highly so (e.g., the Oxford English Dictionary lists 30
different senses for the word 1 line ). Recent work suggests children are relatively
flexible in assigning senses to words from an early age. By 4 years, they can switch
some paper some between mass and count senses of nouns ( vs. papers ; Barner &amp;
Snedeker, 2005), extend words to novel lexical can you lipstick the trashcan
categories (e.g., ? Bushnell &amp; Maratsos, 1984; Clark, 1981), and resolve
polysemes (Rabagliati, Marcus, &amp; Pylkka&#xA8;nen, 2010; Srinivasan &amp;
Snedeker, 2011). They also have an implicit understanding that homophonous meanings
are more arbitrary than polysemous senses: They assume that English homophones need
not be homophonous when translated into another language but that polysemes will
still be polysemous (Srinivasan &amp; Snedeker, 2011). Figure 1 illustrates two ways
in which ambiguous words could be resolved, one relying on information from within
the lexical level and one relying on top-down information based on the plausibility
of different interpretations. The lexical-level route<component x="315.0" y="128.05"

lateness="0.2857142857142857" reference_score="4.68">shows how children might be able
to resolve such ambiguities without resorting to top-down information. In particular,
they could use associations between different lexical items: Spreading activation
between the other words in a sentence or phrase (which context words we call the )
and the critical meanings or senses of the ambiguous word might result in increased
activation of the swing correct sense or meaning (e.g., the word might prime the
baseball meaning of bat). In addition, children could track cooccurrences between
context words and meanings or senses and use that information (which will be
correlated with priming) for disambiguation, in a manner that is similar to their
tracking of co-occurrences between syllables (Saffran, Aslin, &amp; Newport, 1996),
words (Bannard &amp; Matthews, 2008), and words and syntactic structures (Snedeker
&amp; Trueswell, 2004). Children's sensitivity to semantic priming (Petrey, 1977) and
co-occurrence statistics (Saffran et al., 1996) suggests that neither task should be
beyond them. But there is reason to suspect that lexical associations may not be
sufficient for accurate lexical ambiguity resolution. Discrimination based on lexical
associations will only work well when the two meanings or senses of a word usually
occur with different context words. This will happen if the ambiguous meanings or bat
senses are very different, as with (Miller &amp; Charles, 1991). But because most
ambiguous words are polysemous, they have similar or related senses (e.g., the word
linehas a queue sense and an elongated-mark-on-a-page sense), and so they occur with
similar the long line context words (e.g., the phrase is globally ambiguous). As a
result, attending solely to lexical associations will often lead to difficulty
determining the correct sense. To accurately resolve these senses, children need the
ability to construct the potential interpretations of each sentence and determine
which is more plausible. This is the second, top-down path shown in Figure 1. The
role of context in children's word recognition and processing has been quite heavily
investigated, although this work has focused on the processing skills of older
children learning to read rather than the processing skills of younger children
learning to parse spoken sentences (Simpson &amp; Foster, 1986; Simpson, Lorsbach,
&amp; Whitehouse, 1983; Stanovich, 1980; Stanovich, Nathan, West, &amp; Vala-Rossi,
1985). Within this literature, studies focusing on lexical ambiguity have tended to
find that young readers are relatively insensitive to context (e.g., Simpson &amp;
Foster, 1986). For instance, Booth, Harasaki, and Burman (2006) used a priming task
in which children read aloud sentences that biased a sentence-ending homophone toward
one of its meanings and then read aloud a target word that was related to one of
those meanings. For 9- and 10-year-olds, reading time for the target was unaffected
by the prior context, and only 12-year-old children showed evidence that they could
integrate context during lexical ambiguity resolution. But this insensitivity to
context is most likely due to reading difficulties, not language processing
difficulties. As evidence for this, Khanna and Boland (2010) had 7- to 10-year-old
children listen to (rather than read) a prime and then read a target out loud. When
the primes were two-word phrases containing ambiguous words (e.g., laser tag), the
reaction times of every age group varied on the basis of whether the target was
related to the selected meaning. This suggests that, during spoken language
processing, 7-yearold children can use context to resolve ambiguous words, although
whether they use lexical associations or additionally integrate top-down plausibility
is not clear. The informativity account provides a reason for thinking that children
should be able to use top-down cues. As discussed above, lexical association cues are
likely to be an unreliable guide for processing polysemous words, and so the
informativity account predicts that children should turn to top-down information.
Consistent with the necessity of topdown processing, there is some evidence that
children are better prepared to use top-down information in resolving lexical
ambiguities than syntactic ambiguities. For example, Rabagliati et al. (2010) argued
that children will for example, assigning a disk sense to the word sometimes assign
senses to words that adults consider unlicensed, movie. They demonstrated that 4- to
6-year-olds sometimes accept questions Could a movie be round like ? and then explain
their acceptance in terms of a shifted sense (e.g., a movie could be round because it
is on a DVD). Children presumably cannot use lexical associations or priming to
assign senses that they have not previously heard. Therefore, Rabagliati et al.
proposed that children use a process of situational fit to assign senses by building
a representation of each potential interpretation of a phrase and using the most
plausible interpretation to assign a word sense in a top-down down fashion (similar
to what is seen in Figure 1). However, the results of Rabagliati et al. (2010) are
not conclusive as to whether children use situational fit (and therefore topdown
information) in day-to-day sense resolution. First, the sense assigned was novel, so
the task was closer to word learning than ambiguity resolution. Second, only minimal
association information was available for the children: The dominant sense of the
word (e.g., film for movie) was unassociated with its context (e.g., round ), and the
to-be-shifted sense had never been encountered before. It may be that children only
use top-down cues when other cues are uninformative. This means that children's use
of top-down information in day-to-day lexical ambiguity resolution is still in
question. The experiments reported here therefore test whether 4-year-old children's
ability to resolve lexical ambiguities is fully dependent on cues such as lexical
associations, as the bottom-up hypothesis would predict, or whether they can go
beyond this and use topdown information like global plausibility.<component x="57.0"

lateness="0.2857142857142857" reference_score="6.6">Before we discuss the present
experiments, one concern remains. The recent studies that document children's
apparent facility in resolving the related senses of polysemous words contrast with
an earlier literature demonstrating children's difficulty resolving homophones, whose
meanings are unrelated. For example, Campbell and Macdonald (1983) reported that
children's accuracy resolving the subordinate (less frequent) meanings of ambiguous
words was less than 20%. Beveridge and Marsh (1991) found similar results, with only
a small improvement under highly constraining contexts. Although surprising at first
glance, a distinction between homophony and polysemy could conceivably be because the
two types of ambiguity have been argued to be represented and accessed in different
ways. In particular, although homophones are assumed to be two separate meanings that
inhibit one another during lexical access, polysemous words are often argued to have
a single underspecified meaning, elaborated by context (Nunberg, 1979; Rodd, Gaskell,
&amp; Marslen-Wilson, 2002). Without competitive inhibition, it should be easier to
access and use less-frequent senses than (inhibited) less-frequent homophonous
meanings, and this pattern has been found in adult reading time studies (Frazier
&amp; Rayner, 1990; Frisson, 2009). This difference in processing difficulty could
also make polysemes comparatively easier for children, in which case our current
investigation of lexical ambiguity would need to treat the two types separately. At
the same time, there are important limitations to earlier work. Campbell and
Macdonald (1983) used stimuli where the subordinate meaning was very low frequency
(e.g., hairand hare). If children did not know those meanings, accurately resolving

We assessed whether children rely on lexical associations to resolve lexical
ambiguity and also tested if resolution ability differed depending on whether the
ambiguity was a homophone or polyseme. We used an offline judgment task in which
4-year-old children listened to short vignettes that served Snoopy was outto
disambiguate a target ambiguous word (e.g., side. He [chased/swung] a bat, which was
big ; see Figure 2). They were then shown a grid of four pictures and were asked to
choose "the picture that goes with the story." Both the dominant (more frequent) and
subordinate (less frequent) senses of the target were depicted, alongside semantic
distracters for each sense. To control for children's vocabulary knowledge of
homophones and polysemes, we excluded items that participants misidentified in a
vocabulary posttest. To test whether children's behavior could be predicted only on
the basis of the use of lexical associations, we compared their performance with a
simple Bayesian algorithm (Gale, Church, &amp; Yarowsky, 1992), which computes the
probability of each sense or meaning of an ambiguous word given the other context
words in the vignette, on the basis of their previous co-occurrences within the Child
Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) corpus of child language (MacWhinney, 2000).
We assumed that this measure of co-occurrence statistics also provided a good proxy
for conceptual associations and priming. If children attend to lexical associations
over the global plausibility of a sentence, their choices should mimic the algorithm.
In Experiment 2, we used the same task to provide a more direct test of whether
children attend to lexical associations alone or also integrate global plausibility
by pitting the two in competition. More specifically, we compared children's accuracy
at resolving ambiguous words embedded in vignettes where one sense was both lexically
associated and globally plausible, compared with minimally different vignettes where
one sense was lexically associated but the other was globally plausible.<component

role of lexical associations in children's lexical ambiguity resolution. To do this,
we had children resolve ambiguous words embedded in vignettes, modeled what their
responses should have been if they only used the lexical associations, and then
compared the two. But before assessing the role of associations, we tested whether
children have more difficulty resolving the meanings of homophones than polysemes. We
contrasted homophones with two types of polysemes, regular and irregular. Regular
polysemes comprise a set of words whose senses fall into predictable patterns. For
example, English contains (among others) an organism-food polysemy pattern whereby
the names of plants and animals can be used to refer to the food they produce ( noisy
delicious chicken,or turkey , etc.). All of our regular polysemy items were drawn
from this pattern. Irregular polysemes are words whose senses are related but do not
exemplify a particular pattern, such as the senses letter capital love letter of ( or
). In our analysis, we first checked whether there was any difference in how children
resolve these ambiguity types and then assessed whether the model accurately
predicted their responses.<component x="315.0" y="78.05" width="240.06"

polysemous, because we reasoned that children would be very unlikely to perceive the
relationship. We used frequency of use in CHILDES to determine which meaning or sense
was dominant for each ambiguous word (see the Modeling Procedure section for
details). For homophones, the dominant meaning was used in 80% of cases; for
irregular polysemes, the dominant sense was used in 65% of cases; and for regular
polysemes, the dominant sense was used in 75% of cases. We produced current and prior
sentence context vignettes for both dominant and subordinate senses. For each
ambiguous word, we also created a grid of four images that depicted both the dominant
and the subordinate meanings or senses of the ambiguous word, along with two
distracters, which were chosen because they were semantically similar to each meaning
or sense and should be known by children. Although we did not pretest whether
children knew the distracters, we made sure to choose depictions of frequently used
words: The mean lexical frequency of the distracters (28,999 based on Hyperspace
Analogue to Language corpus frequency in the English Lexicon Project; Balota et al.,
2007) was 40% higher than the estimated frequency of the ambiguous word meanings
(20,890). Pictures were drawn from a range of sources, were typically clip art or
illustrations, and measured 2 approximately 20 cm . Procedure. At the start of each
trial, the experimenter introduced children to its protagonist (e.g., "This is a
story about Snoopy"). The experimenter then showed the protagonist's picture and
prompted the child to name him or her. The main trial began when they completed this
accurately. Children were then read the appropriate vignette, with the ambiguous word
stressed ("Snoopy bat was outside. He chased a , which was big"). After the vignette,
the experimenter produced the grid of four images and asked the child to choose which
one "went with" the story. Children received 24 test trials, hearing all 24 ambiguous
words but with sense used counterbalanced between children (12 dominant and 12
subordinate per child). Trials were presented in one of two random orders, and
pictures were arranged on the page in one of two random orders, making eight stimuli
lists in total. Prior to test trials, participants completed two warm-up trials that
used unambiguous target words, and those who answered either of them incorrectly were
excluded. After the test trials and a 5- to 10-min break, participants completed a
picture-pointing vocabulary posttest on the 48 meanings tested. Children pointed to
the picture that went with the word, from a selection that did not include the word's
alternative sense. We excluded trials from the main analysis when participants M SD (
M ( ( did not know the meaning of the tested word ( 4.0 per child, ( SD 2.9 per

have more difficulty resolving homophones than polysemes, in case we needed to
account for such a difference in how we modeled their use of lexical associations.
For both current and prior sentence contexts, we analyzed whether children
appropriately changed their choice of sense or meaning depending on which was
selected by the context and whether this varied across ambiguity types. We did this
using mixed-effects logistic regression models with random intercepts for subjects
and items, which are more appropriate for binary data than analysis of variance and
more robust to missing data. In our regressions, Outcome 1 was choosing the dominant
sense or meaning, and Outcome 0 was choosing the subordinate sense or meaning. For
both current and prior sentence contexts, Figure 3 shows the proportion of time
children chose the dominant sense or meaning (as opposed to the subordinate sense or
meaning), split by whether the context selected for the dominant or subordinate sense
or meaning. As can be seen, when context selected the dominant sense or meaning,
children chose it on a relatively high proportion of trials across all ambiguity
types (mean proportion of dominant M choices, , between 0.68 and 0.94). But
critically, and dominant contra Campbell and Macdonald (1983), the 4-year-old

reliant on lexical associations, or could they integrate top-down information as
well? Children's use of lexical associations: Modeling of Experiment 1. To predict
quantitatively how children should behave if they only use lexical associations such
as priming and cooccurrences, we appropriated a model from computational linguistics
(Gale et al., 1992). The model uses Bayes' rule and a corpus analysis to estimate
which sense or meaning an ambiguous word should take on the basis of (a) the relative
frequency of each sense or meaning and (b) the other words surrounding that ambiguous
word in each vignette and, in particular, how frequently those words have previously
co-occurred with each sense or meaning. This statistic therefore directly measures
co-occurrences and should also be strongly correlated with the amount of priming
between words (strong primes are likely to co-occur more frequently than weak
primes). We used a "bag of words" model, so named because it assumes that each
context word is conditionally independent (an assumption that greatly simplifies
computation but is not entirely plausiw bat s ble). In short, for an ambiguous word

reflected in the model? The bottom-up hypothesis proposes that children should pay
close attention to lexical associations, in accord with their dependence on lexical
associations for syntactic ambiguity resolution (Snedeker &amp; Trueswell, 2004). And
indeed, the children tested here had a very similar overall level of accuracy to the
model. For the current sentence contexts, the model's percentage correct was 69%,
whereas the children's accuracy was 70%. For the prior sentence contexts, the model's
accuracy was 67%, whereas children's accuracy was 68%. In addition, the model, like
the children, did better when context selected for the dominant sense or meaning (for
current sentence contexts, model accuracy 75%, child accuracy 80%; for prior sentence

reasonable fit to the children's data. Next, we evaluated if the model still provided
a good fit at a deeper level of analysis, testing whether the two learners-model and
child-made the same mistakes. We performed an item-based correlation between
children's proportion of correct answers and the probability that the model assigned

If children resolve ambiguous words using top-down plausibility, they ought to assign
reliably different senses or meanings across sentence pairs of this sort. By
contrast, if children resolve ambiguous words using lexical associations, they should
assign the same sense or meaning to both sentences. We used the same picture-pointing
task as before, with a mixture of six homophones and irregular polysemes that were
collapsed in our analysis. In addition, we compared children's performance with both
the association-based algorithm used in Experiment 1 and adult judgments to confirm
our manipulation. One concern was that the sentences were more complicated than in
Experiment 1, and any difficulty that children had with the task could result from
that. As a control, we therefore included a set of matched sentences where the target
word was unambiguous; difficulties with the task should be reflected in both
conditions. Method Participants. Sixteen 4-year-olds ( M(3 years 11 months, SD (0

arrangement of pictures on the page randomly varied between two different lists,
making eight lists total. Items are listed in Appendix B. Procedure. The basic trial
structure was equivalent to Experiment 1. Each child heard six test vignettes (three
with a plausible subordinate meaning and three with a plausible dominant meaning) and
six control vignettes, counterbalanced so that only one sentence from each pair was

unambiguous targets and were excluded if they failed any. We again analyzed the data
with mixed-effects logistic regressions including random intercepts for subjects and
items. The small number of items prevented an analysis of homophony-polysemy
differences. Adults were tested slightly differently. To derive a more sensitive
measure of the effects of plausibility and association in these stimuli, we had them
rate the acceptability of each picture on a 1-7 scale (the two target pictures only;
distracter pictures were not tested) for both the ambiguous and unambiguous control
items. As our dependent measure, we calculated the rating of the dominant sense as a
proportion of the summed ratings of both senses and analyzed this using a
mixed-effects linear regression with random subject and item intercepts. Finally, we

comprehension suggest the possibility that the development of linguistic ambiguity
resolution might be characterized by a broad dependence on bottom-up cues over
top-down information. To evaluate this, we tested whether that imbalance extends to
children's resolution of lexical ambiguities and instead found that even 4-year-old
children used a top-down cue like global plausibility information to resolve word
senses. That is not to say that children did not use bottom-up cues at all. In
Experiment 1, the Bayesian model offered a limited ability to predict children's
choices, and in Experiment 2, children's choices were clearly swayed by the
overwhelming association information. But critically, these results are not
consistent with any theory that assumes children's linguistic ambiguity resolution
has a blanket bottom-up quality. This suggests that children's language processing
differs from adults' by degree, not kind. These results are consistent with previous
work that assumed children could resolve senses and meanings on the basis of global
plausibility, such as Rabagliati et al.'s (2010) proposal that children use
situational fit in sense resolution, assigning senses on the basis of their fit with
a partial semantic context. They also fit within the framework of the informativity
account of syntactic ambiguity resolution (Trueswell &amp; Gleitman, 2004). Trueswell
proposed that children start to apply different cues at different ages as a result of
tracking each cue's general reliability. As we argued in the introduction, there are
reasons to suspect that although cues such as lexical statistics are more informative
than global plausibility for syntactic ambiguity resolution, they may be less useful
for lexical ambiguity resolution. This might force children to assign higher weight
to top-down plausibility information to resolve lexical ambiguities. Of course, the
informativity account is not the only possible explanation for the difference between
children's use of top-down information in syntactic and lexical ambiguity resolution.
One possibility is that skills learned during language acquisition might transfer to
language processing. Lexical ambiguity resolution resembles the act of word learning
quite closely, in that both require the child to use the surrounding context to
select between a set of candidate meanings. The major difference, of course, is that
the set of candidate meanings is much larger during word learning, but the structure
of the problem seems similar enough that the skills developed in one could plausibly
transfer to the other. Because many theories of word learning rely on the child being
able to determine the meaning of a novel word on the basis of its syntactic or
semantic context and the scene (Gleitman, 1990; Pinker, 1994), the use of this sort
of plausibility information may well transfer from word learning to lexical ambiguity
resolution. By contrast, it is not so obvious that plausibility (or referential
context) is particularly important for syntactic development and, as such, the use of
plausibility for syntactic processing may be underdeveloped when compared with its
use for lexical processing. What this means, in sum, is that our results cannot be
explained by accounts of children's language processing that postulate a blanket
top-down insensitivity (e.g., the bottom-up account described by Snedeker &amp; Yuan,
2008). Rather, they have to be explained under theories in which children are
differentially sensitive to different types of cues for different types of linguistic
ambiguities. Given that a variety of such theories exist, further work will be
necessary to pare down the members of this set. In their use of top-down
plausibility, the children tested here generally behaved in a relatively adult way,
but it is still notable that they had lower accuracy when resolving subordinate
senses or meanings than when resolving dominant senses or meanings in Experiment 1.
This suggests that children have difficulty fully integrating contextual cues and
rely too heavily on each sense or meaning's prior probability. To some extent, then,
this is consistent with a weaker version of Campbell and Macdonald's (1983) claim
that children cannot resolve the subordinate meanings of homophones, in which
subordinate meanings are simply dispreferred rather than ruled out entirely. We see a
number of potential explanations for this result. One possibility is that children
may have difficulty retrieving the subordinate meanings of words from memory.
Alternatively, it could reflect a difficulty modulating the activity of each
retrieved meaning, perhaps because of underdeveloped executive function abilities.
The role of executive function in language-processing development is currently a
topic of intense interest (Choi &amp; Trueswell, 2010; Mazuka, Jincho, &amp; Oishi,
2009; Novick, Trueswell, &amp; Thompson Schill, 2010). The majority of work in this
area has centered on children's failure to revise initial parses of temporally
ambiguous sentences that are eventually resolved to a less-frequent interpretation
(as in Trueswell et al., 1999). Novick and colleagues (Novick et al., 2010; Novick,
Trueswell, &amp; Thompson-Schill, 2005) argued that this "kindergarten-path effect"
is due to children lacking the ability to inhibit highly active representations, and
they suggest that children should exhibit similar behaviors for similar reanalysis
tasks, such as resolving an ambiguous word to its less-frequent meaning. Consistent
with this, Khanna and Boland (2010) showed that 7- to 10-year-old children's scores
on a battery of executive function tests predict their ability to resolve ambiguous
words. Although not intended to test the role of executive function, our
participants' greater difficulty resolving less-frequent meanings or senses is
consistent with Novick and colleagues' proposal. Note, though, that these differences
were much smaller than Trueswell et al.'s (1999) syntactic kindergarten-path effect.
This could be because executive function plays a smaller role in lexical ambiguity
resolution, or it could be because the disambiguating information in our stimuli
always preceded the ambiguity, minimizing the reanalysis demands. Beyond reanalysis,
there have also been suggestions (Mazuka et al., 2009) that children's executive
function difficulties may explain their failure to integrate top-down constraints. To
the best of our knowledge, there is little direct evidence that executive function
plays a facilitatory role in the use of top-down but not bottom-up information during
sentence processing, and we do not take our data to be consistent with this proposal.
In fact, if executive function is domain general (which most researchers assume it to
be), it would be very surprising if its underdevelopment impaired top-down processing
in syntactic ambiguity resolution but not in lexical ambiguity resolution. One
methodological note concerns the picture selection task used in both studies. Picture
selection is an offline task, which measures the factors that affect final
interpretations of ambiguous words, rather than the moment-by-moment processes of
ambiguity resolution. Our results suggest that children and adults use similar
information sources in resolving ambiguous words, but it is still open as to whether
the two populations use the same processes to integrate that information online, and
future work will address that topic. To assess whether different cues are integrated
in the same manner, we would need to use an online measure, like eye tracking. It
could be that all cues are integrated at the earliest moment they become available
(as would be expected under a fully interactive model of sentence processing
development, e.g., the informativity account), but there are alternatives. In
particular, children's integration of top-down cues may be delayed until a second
reanalysis stage (cf. two-stage parsing theories, e.g., Frazier, 1987), or our
offline task may have provided children with enough reflection time to use top-down
cues in the final moments of their decision. Our data, therefore, leave open a window
of hope for a modified version of the bottom-up hypothesis. In this version,
children's initial parsing decisions are governed by bottom-up information, and
top-down cues are integrated later if they are forced to make explicit decisions. Of
course, this account would still have to explain why our task allowed children to use
a decision stage, whereas the syntactic processing task from Snedeker and Trueswell
(2004) did not. One possibility is that our task presented the choice in a more
explicit way. Further work will also be needed to confirm the second main result of
the present study, that children resolve homophones with the same accuracy as they
achieve when they resolve polysemes. Although we found no gross interpretive
differences, it is possible that more fine-grained online measures may be able to
track such a developmental dissociation. We attribute our divergence from previous
results to the efforts made here to use homophones and polysemes that children knew
rather than low-frequency items. Although this null result could be taken as support
for theories in which homophony and polysemy are represented and resolved in the same
way (Foraker &amp; Murphy, 2009; Klein &amp; Murphy, 2001; Murphy, 2007), we caution
against immediately leaping to that conclusion. In particular, we did not test the
condition in which homophones and polysemes have previously diverged in adults,
reanalysis contexts in which the disambiguating region falls after the critical
ambiguous word.<component x="57.0" y="78.05" width="240.08" height="363.15" page="10"

children's lexical ambiguity resolution is sensitive to a variety of information
sources, including lexical associations but also top-down global plausibility
information. That is to say, children's lexical ambiguity resolution appears similar
to adults', and this is inconsistent with theories based on syntactic processing that
attribute a blanket insensitivity to top-down information. Instead, this
less-categorical pattern of successes and failures suggests that children's ambiguity
resolution is dependent on learning the value of individual information sources and
that the value of each information source varies for different types of linguistic
ambiguity. More broadly, our data present a picture of information-processing
development in which children are minimally constrained in which cues they can learn
to integrate and, in fact, can respond to the nature of the task when determining the
most relevant cues to use.<component x="315.0" y="483.31" width="240.07"

ambiguity. Sentences can be ambiguous between multiple syntactic structures, words
can be ambiguous between multiple meanings or senses, and an acoustic signal can be
ambiguous between multiple words. Nevertheless, adults manage to resolve the vast
majority of linguistic ambiguity rapidly and accurately. Research in
psycholinguistics suggests that this accuracy is achieved through a cognitive
architecture in which a wide variety of information sources, both bottom-up and
top-down, are used to select the best interpretation from the multiple possible
alternatives (see, e.g., Altmann, 1998; Dahan &amp; Magnuson, 2006; MacDonald,
Pearlmutter, &amp; Seidenberg, 1994; Swinney, 1979). For example, the intended
meaning of a noun-verb homophone like duckcould be resolved using information from
the same level of representation, such as priming by a related word (e.g., quack) or
through top-down feedback from its syntactic context (e.g., whether it is preceded by
a definite article). Far less is known, however, about how the mechanisms of
ambiguity resolution develop. To what extent does the cognitive machinery that
children use for language comprehension relate to the machinery used by adults? In
fact, recent work suggests that, in many respects, child and adult language
processing are similar.<component x="57.0" y="248.05" width="240.09" height="239.24"

language quickly and incrementally: They make guesses about plausible interpretations
on the basis of the currently available evidence and do not hold off on interpreting
a sentence until it has finished (Fernald, Zangl, Portillo, &amp; Marchman, 2008;
Snedeker, 2009; Trueswell &amp; Gleitman, 2004; Trueswell, Sekerina, Hill, &amp;
Logrip, 1999). But, in other respects, children's ambiguity resolution is very
different. In particular, their coordination of different levels of linguistic
representation to ultimately choose an interpretation is distinctly not adultlike.
Research on syntactic ambiguity resolution suggests that although children have
little difficulty using bottom-up information in their decisions, they find the
integration of top-down information considerably more demanding. Evidence for this
distinction comes from children's ability to resolve ambiguous phrases such tickle
the frog with the feather as . Here, the ambiguity arises over with the feather where
to attach the prepositional phrase , as an instrument phrase attached to the verb
(tickling using the feather) or as a modifier of the noun (the frog holding the
feather). Five-year-olds can resolve these ambiguities using bottom-up cues such as
lexical statistics, the frequency with which a verb is found in a particular
syntactic structure. Because a prepositional tickle phrase subsequent to the verb
most frequently describes an instrument, children tend to attach all ambiguous
prepositional tickle phrases following as instruments, whereas for verbs that choose
the frog typically do not take an instrument phrase (e.g., with the feather the frog
), children take the phrase to modify (Kidd &amp; Bavin, 2005; Snedeker &amp;
Trueswell, 2004; Trueswell et al., 1999). This bottom-up facility extends to
additional cues, such as the prosodic rhythm and stress in a sentence (Snedeker &amp;
Yuan, 2008). However, children's use of top-down information is very different. For
instance, adults will quickly account for a cue called referential context tickle the
frog with the feather . If is uttered in front of two frogs, one holding a feather
and one empty-handed, adults immediately make the inference that the prepositional
phrase modifies the noun to disambiguate which of the two frogs is being referred to.
In contrast, 5-year-old children fail to make this inference and rely on lexical
statistics. It is only by around 7 years of age that children appear to use a
top-down cue like referential context (Snedeker &amp; Trueswell, 2004; Trueswell et
al., 1999). Building on this, Kidd and Bavin (2005) demonstrated that children 3
years 8 months old pay little attention to another chop the top-down cue, global
plausibility. Consider the phrase tree with the leaves . Even though choptypically
takes an instrument phrase, adults generally attach the prepositional phrase as a
modifier of the noun, because leaves are implausible instruments. By contrast, their
participants treated the phrase as an instrument 60% of the time; that is, they
implausibly took it as an instruction to chop the tree using some leaves (see also
Snedeker, Worek, &amp; Shafto, 2009). Finally, Hurewitz, Brown-Schmidt, Thorpe,
Gleitman, and Trueswell (2000) demonstrated that when 4.5-year-olds heard a question
that (for adults) should promote modifier interWhich frog went to pretations for
subsequent ambiguities (e.g., Mrs. Squid's house? ), it did not in fact do so. What
might cause this disparity in children's use of bottom-up and top-down cues? Snedeker
and Yuan (2008) discussed two possible interpretations. First, they suggested a
bottom-up hypothesis, in which young children's sentence processing shows a blanket
insensitivity to top-down information. This could arise if top-down processing is too
computationally arduous for children to deploy quickly and accurately or if children
do not know how to correctly align levels of representation. Second, Snedeker and
Yuan (2008) discussed an informativity account originally suggested by Trueswell and
colleagues (Snedeker &amp; Trueswell, 2004; Snedeker &amp; Yuan, 2008; Trueswell
&amp; Gleitman, 2007; Trueswell et al., 1999), who proposed that children can
potentially integrate a variety of information sources but that they instead choose
to base their decisions on a smaller set of highly frequent and reliable cues. Under
this informativity account, lexical statistics are used early because they are
invariably present, they are informative, and they can be calculated via a relatively
simple tabulation of frequencies. By contrast, referential context appears to be rare
and less reliable (Trueswell &amp; Gleitman, 2004), and so children rely on it less
heavily than adults might. At first glance, the viability of the bottom-up account
might appear to be challenged by evidence that children can use topdown information
when they are learning about the structure of their language rather than processing
it. Even 6-month-olds can use top-down lexical information to discover boundaries
between words in fluent speech (Bortfeld, Morgan, Golinkoff, &amp; Rathbun, 2005),
and there are many demonstrations that children can use higher level syntactic
information to guide their hypotheses in word learning (Naigles, 1996). However, it
is not obvious that the cognitive architectures underlying language acquisition and
processing are identical. In fact, differences in the tasks involved give reason to
believe that the two differ in a number of ways. During processing, children must
select from a small number of known alternative interpretations, but during
acquisition they have to create these interpretations themselves. This act of
creation will most likely take place slowly and rely on top-down information out of
necessity (for instance, in learning the meaning of a word, the arbitrary
relationship between a word's form and its meaning ensures that bottom-up information
is not particularly informative). By contrast, language processing requires children
to make a series of quick decisions, for which bottom-up information will be a useful
guide. In sum, evidence from language acquisition does not indubitably constrain
theories of language processing development. The critical issue for both the
informativity and the bottom-up accounts is not whether children are blind to
top-down information in toto but why they seem to have particular difficulty
integrating top-down information when resolving known linguistic ambiguities. The two
proposals ascribe quite different reasons for why children's language processing
architecture may differ from adults' and therefore make different predictions about
ambiguity resolution in other linguistic domains. The bottom-up hypothesis predicts
that topdown integration is generally difficult, and so children should ignore
top-down information when resolving any type of linguistic ambiguity. By contrast,
the informativity account predicts that those top-down cues that are not used for
syntactic ambiguity resolution might still be integrated for other types of
linguistic ambiguity.<component x="315.0" y="78.05" width="240.08" height="409.25"

processing might prove more relevant is the resolution of lexical ambiguity. Most
words are ambiguous. knight, bat, This is most obviously seen with homophones (like
or bark ), where two meanings are completely unrelated but share a phonological form
(e.g., as a result of contact between two languages). But comprehension also requires
facing the subtler challenges of polysemes, words that are ambiguous between multiple
senses that are related (e.g., lined academic paper, roastedor or angry chicken,
birthday playing card or or ). For instance, a birthday card and a playing card are
different things, but it does not seem to be an accident that they share a name
(i.e., because they are made of the same material). The ambiguity in polysemy is not
only subtler than in homophony, it is also more common: Most frequent words are
polysemous, many of them highly so (e.g., the Oxford English Dictionary lists 30
different senses for the word 1 line ). Recent work suggests children are relatively
flexible in assigning senses to words from an early age. By 4 years, they can switch
some paper some between mass and count senses of nouns ( vs. papers ; Barner &amp;
Snedeker, 2005), extend words to novel lexical can you lipstick the trashcan
categories (e.g., ? Bushnell &amp; Maratsos, 1984; Clark, 1981), and resolve
polysemes (Rabagliati, Marcus, &amp; Pylkka&#xA8;nen, 2010; Srinivasan &amp;
Snedeker, 2011). They also have an implicit understanding that homophonous meanings
are more arbitrary than polysemous senses: They assume that English homophones need
not be homophonous when translated into another language but that polysemes will
still be polysemous (Srinivasan &amp; Snedeker, 2011). Figure 1 illustrates two ways
in which ambiguous words could be resolved, one relying on information from within
the lexical level and one relying on top-down information based on the plausibility
of different interpretations. The lexical-level route<component x="315.0" y="128.05"

to resolve such ambiguities without resorting to top-down information. In particular,
they could use associations between different lexical items: Spreading activation
between the other words in a sentence or phrase (which context words we call the )
and the critical meanings or senses of the ambiguous word might result in increased
activation of the swing correct sense or meaning (e.g., the word might prime the
baseball meaning of bat). In addition, children could track cooccurrences between
context words and meanings or senses and use that information (which will be
correlated with priming) for disambiguation, in a manner that is similar to their
tracking of co-occurrences between syllables (Saffran, Aslin, &amp; Newport, 1996),
words (Bannard &amp; Matthews, 2008), and words and syntactic structures (Snedeker
&amp; Trueswell, 2004). Children's sensitivity to semantic priming (Petrey, 1977) and
co-occurrence statistics (Saffran et al., 1996) suggests that neither task should be
beyond them. But there is reason to suspect that lexical associations may not be
sufficient for accurate lexical ambiguity resolution. Discrimination based on lexical
associations will only work well when the two meanings or senses of a word usually
occur with different context words. This will happen if the ambiguous meanings or bat
senses are very different, as with (Miller &amp; Charles, 1991). But because most
ambiguous words are polysemous, they have similar or related senses (e.g., the word
linehas a queue sense and an elongated-mark-on-a-page sense), and so they occur with
similar the long line context words (e.g., the phrase is globally ambiguous). As a
result, attending solely to lexical associations will often lead to difficulty
determining the correct sense. To accurately resolve these senses, children need the
ability to construct the potential interpretations of each sentence and determine
which is more plausible. This is the second, top-down path shown in Figure 1. The
role of context in children's word recognition and processing has been quite heavily
investigated, although this work has focused on the processing skills of older
children learning to read rather than the processing skills of younger children
learning to parse spoken sentences (Simpson &amp; Foster, 1986; Simpson, Lorsbach,
&amp; Whitehouse, 1983; Stanovich, 1980; Stanovich, Nathan, West, &amp; Vala-Rossi,
1985). Within this literature, studies focusing on lexical ambiguity have tended to
find that young readers are relatively insensitive to context (e.g., Simpson &amp;
Foster, 1986). For instance, Booth, Harasaki, and Burman (2006) used a priming task
in which children read aloud sentences that biased a sentence-ending homophone toward
one of its meanings and then read aloud a target word that was related to one of
those meanings. For 9- and 10-year-olds, reading time for the target was unaffected
by the prior context, and only 12-year-old children showed evidence that they could
integrate context during lexical ambiguity resolution. But this insensitivity to
context is most likely due to reading difficulties, not language processing
difficulties. As evidence for this, Khanna and Boland (2010) had 7- to 10-year-old
children listen to (rather than read) a prime and then read a target out loud. When
the primes were two-word phrases containing ambiguous words (e.g., laser tag), the
reaction times of every age group varied on the basis of whether the target was
related to the selected meaning. This suggests that, during spoken language
processing, 7-yearold children can use context to resolve ambiguous words, although
whether they use lexical associations or additionally integrate top-down plausibility
is not clear. The informativity account provides a reason for thinking that children
should be able to use top-down cues. As discussed above, lexical association cues are
likely to be an unreliable guide for processing polysemous words, and so the
informativity account predicts that children should turn to top-down information.
Consistent with the necessity of topdown processing, there is some evidence that
children are better prepared to use top-down information in resolving lexical
ambiguities than syntactic ambiguities. For example, Rabagliati et al. (2010) argued
that children will for example, assigning a disk sense to the word sometimes assign
senses to words that adults consider unlicensed, movie. They demonstrated that 4- to
6-year-olds sometimes accept questions Could a movie be round like ? and then explain
their acceptance in terms of a shifted sense (e.g., a movie could be round because it
is on a DVD). Children presumably cannot use lexical associations or priming to
assign senses that they have not previously heard. Therefore, Rabagliati et al.
proposed that children use a process of situational fit to assign senses by building
a representation of each potential interpretation of a phrase and using the most
plausible interpretation to assign a word sense in a top-down down fashion (similar
to what is seen in Figure 1). However, the results of Rabagliati et al. (2010) are
not conclusive as to whether children use situational fit (and therefore topdown
information) in day-to-day sense resolution. First, the sense assigned was novel, so
the task was closer to word learning than ambiguity resolution. Second, only minimal
association information was available for the children: The dominant sense of the
word (e.g., film for movie) was unassociated with its context (e.g., round ), and the
to-be-shifted sense had never been encountered before. It may be that children only
use top-down cues when other cues are uninformative. This means that children's use
of top-down information in day-to-day lexical ambiguity resolution is still in
question. The experiments reported here therefore test whether 4-year-old children's
ability to resolve lexical ambiguities is fully dependent on cues such as lexical
associations, as the bottom-up hypothesis would predict, or whether they can go
beyond this and use topdown information like global plausibility.<component x="57.0"

experiments, one concern remains. The recent studies that document children's
apparent facility in resolving the related senses of polysemous words contrast with
an earlier literature demonstrating children's difficulty resolving homophones, whose
meanings are unrelated. For example, Campbell and Macdonald (1983) reported that
children's accuracy resolving the subordinate (less frequent) meanings of ambiguous
words was less than 20%. Beveridge and Marsh (1991) found similar results, with only
a small improvement under highly constraining contexts. Although surprising at first
glance, a distinction between homophony and polysemy could conceivably be because the
two types of ambiguity have been argued to be represented and accessed in different
ways. In particular, although homophones are assumed to be two separate meanings that
inhibit one another during lexical access, polysemous words are often argued to have
a single underspecified meaning, elaborated by context (Nunberg, 1979; Rodd, Gaskell,
&amp; Marslen-Wilson, 2002). Without competitive inhibition, it should be easier to
access and use less-frequent senses than (inhibited) less-frequent homophonous
meanings, and this pattern has been found in adult reading time studies (Frazier
&amp; Rayner, 1990; Frisson, 2009). This difference in processing difficulty could
also make polysemes comparatively easier for children, in which case our current
investigation of lexical ambiguity would need to treat the two types separately. At
the same time, there are important limitations to earlier work. Campbell and
Macdonald (1983) used stimuli where the subordinate meaning was very low frequency
(e.g., hairand hare). If children did not know those meanings, accurately resolving

We assessed whether children rely on lexical associations to resolve lexical
ambiguity and also tested if resolution ability differed depending on whether the
ambiguity was a homophone or polyseme. We used an offline judgment task in which
4-year-old children listened to short vignettes that served Snoopy was outto
disambiguate a target ambiguous word (e.g., side. He [chased/swung] a bat, which was
big ; see Figure 2). They were then shown a grid of four pictures and were asked to
choose "the picture that goes with the story." Both the dominant (more frequent) and
subordinate (less frequent) senses of the target were depicted, alongside semantic
distracters for each sense. To control for children's vocabulary knowledge of
homophones and polysemes, we excluded items that participants misidentified in a
vocabulary posttest. To test whether children's behavior could be predicted only on
the basis of the use of lexical associations, we compared their performance with a
simple Bayesian algorithm (Gale, Church, &amp; Yarowsky, 1992), which computes the
probability of each sense or meaning of an ambiguous word given the other context
words in the vignette, on the basis of their previous co-occurrences within the Child
Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) corpus of child language (MacWhinney, 2000).
We assumed that this measure of co-occurrence statistics also provided a good proxy
for conceptual associations and priming. If children attend to lexical associations
over the global plausibility of a sentence, their choices should mimic the algorithm.
In Experiment 2, we used the same task to provide a more direct test of whether
children attend to lexical associations alone or also integrate global plausibility
by pitting the two in competition. More specifically, we compared children's accuracy
at resolving ambiguous words embedded in vignettes where one sense was both lexically
associated and globally plausible, compared with minimally different vignettes where
one sense was lexically associated but the other was globally plausible.<component

role of lexical associations in children's lexical ambiguity resolution. To do this,
we had children resolve ambiguous words embedded in vignettes, modeled what their
responses should have been if they only used the lexical associations, and then
compared the two. But before assessing the role of associations, we tested whether
children have more difficulty resolving the meanings of homophones than polysemes. We
contrasted homophones with two types of polysemes, regular and irregular. Regular
polysemes comprise a set of words whose senses fall into predictable patterns. For
example, English contains (among others) an organism-food polysemy pattern whereby
the names of plants and animals can be used to refer to the food they produce ( noisy
delicious chicken,or turkey , etc.). All of our regular polysemy items were drawn
from this pattern. Irregular polysemes are words whose senses are related but do not
exemplify a particular pattern, such as the senses letter capital love letter of ( or
). In our analysis, we first checked whether there was any difference in how children
resolve these ambiguity types and then assessed whether the model accurately

eight irregular polysemes, and eight regular polysemes (all from the organism-food
pattern discussed above) were used to construct vignettes in both the current and
prior sentence context conditions (see Figure 2, and see Appendix A for a full list
of the items and contexts). All of our stimuli were classified as polysemes or
homophones by the Oxford English Dictionary online (http://www.oed.com/; see footnote
1), except for nail(hardware/finger), which we treated as homophonous, rather than
polysemous, because we reasoned that children would be very unlikely to perceive the
relationship. We used frequency of use in CHILDES to determine which meaning or sense
was dominant for each ambiguous word (see the Modeling Procedure section for
details). For homophones, the dominant meaning was used in 80% of cases; for
irregular polysemes, the dominant sense was used in 65% of cases; and for regular
polysemes, the dominant sense was used in 75% of cases. We produced current and prior
sentence context vignettes for both dominant and subordinate senses. For each
ambiguous word, we also created a grid of four images that depicted both the dominant
and the subordinate meanings or senses of the ambiguous word, along with two
distracters, which were chosen because they were semantically similar to each meaning
or sense and should be known by children. Although we did not pretest whether
children knew the distracters, we made sure to choose depictions of frequently used
words: The mean lexical frequency of the distracters (28,999 based on Hyperspace
Analogue to Language corpus frequency in the English Lexicon Project; Balota et al.,
2007) was 40% higher than the estimated frequency of the ambiguous word meanings
(20,890). Pictures were drawn from a range of sources, were typically clip art or
illustrations, and measured 2 approximately 20 cm . Procedure. At the start of each
trial, the experimenter introduced children to its protagonist (e.g., "This is a
story about Snoopy"). The experimenter then showed the protagonist's picture and
prompted the child to name him or her. The main trial began when they completed this
accurately. Children were then read the appropriate vignette, with the ambiguous word
stressed ("Snoopy bat was outside. He chased a , which was big"). After the vignette,
the experimenter produced the grid of four images and asked the child to choose which
one "went with" the story. Children received 24 test trials, hearing all 24 ambiguous
words but with sense used counterbalanced between children (12 dominant and 12
subordinate per child). Trials were presented in one of two random orders, and
pictures were arranged on the page in one of two random orders, making eight stimuli
lists in total. Prior to test trials, participants completed two warm-up trials that
used unambiguous target words, and those who answered either of them incorrectly were
excluded. After the test trials and a 5- to 10-min break, participants completed a
picture-pointing vocabulary posttest on the 48 meanings tested. Children pointed to
the picture that went with the word, from a selection that did not include the word's
alternative sense. We excluded trials from the main analysis when participants M SD (

have more difficulty resolving homophones than polysemes, in case we needed to
account for such a difference in how we modeled their use of lexical associations.
For both current and prior sentence contexts, we analyzed whether children
appropriately changed their choice of sense or meaning depending on which was
selected by the context and whether this varied across ambiguity types. We did this
using mixed-effects logistic regression models with random intercepts for subjects
and items, which are more appropriate for binary data than analysis of variance and
more robust to missing data. In our regressions, Outcome 1 was choosing the dominant
sense or meaning, and Outcome 0 was choosing the subordinate sense or meaning. For
both current and prior sentence contexts, Figure 3 shows the proportion of time
children chose the dominant sense or meaning (as opposed to the subordinate sense or
meaning), split by whether the context selected for the dominant or subordinate sense
or meaning. As can be seen, when context selected the dominant sense or meaning,
children chose it on a relatively high proportion of trials across all ambiguity
types (mean proportion of dominant M choices, , between 0.68 and 0.94). But

reliant on lexical associations, or could they integrate top-down information as
well? Children's use of lexical associations: Modeling of Experiment 1. To predict
quantitatively how children should behave if they only use lexical associations such
as priming and cooccurrences, we appropriated a model from computational linguistics
(Gale et al., 1992). The model uses Bayes' rule and a corpus analysis to estimate
which sense or meaning an ambiguous word should take on the basis of (a) the relative
frequency of each sense or meaning and (b) the other words surrounding that ambiguous
word in each vignette and, in particular, how frequently those words have previously
co-occurred with each sense or meaning. This statistic therefore directly measures
co-occurrences and should also be strongly correlated with the amount of priming
between words (strong primes are likely to co-occur more frequently than weak
primes). We used a "bag of words" model, so named because it assumes that each
context word is conditionally independent (an assumption that greatly simplifies
computation but is not entirely plausiw bat s ble). In short, for an ambiguous word
(e.g., ) with a sense i baseball bat ( ) embedded in a vignette made up of a set of

reflected in the model? The bottom-up hypothesis proposes that children should pay
close attention to lexical associations, in accord with their dependence on lexical
associations for syntactic ambiguity resolution (Snedeker &amp; Trueswell, 2004). And
indeed, the children tested here had a very similar overall level of accuracy to the
model. For the current sentence contexts, the model's percentage correct was 69%,
whereas the children's accuracy was 70%. For the prior sentence contexts, the model's
accuracy was 67%, whereas children's accuracy was 68%. In addition, the model, like
the children, did better when context selected for the dominant sense or meaning (for
current sentence contexts, model accuracy 75%, child accuracy 80%; for prior sentence

reasonable fit to the children's data. Next, we evaluated if the model still provided
a good fit at a deeper level of analysis, testing whether the two learners-model and
child-made the same mistakes. We performed an item-based correlation between
children's proportion of correct answers and the probability that the model assigned

If children resolve ambiguous words using top-down plausibility, they ought to assign
reliably different senses or meanings across sentence pairs of this sort. By
contrast, if children resolve ambiguous words using lexical associations, they should
assign the same sense or meaning to both sentences. We used the same picture-pointing
task as before, with a mixture of six homophones and irregular polysemes that were
collapsed in our analysis. In addition, we compared children's performance with both
the association-based algorithm used in Experiment 1 and adult judgments to confirm
our manipulation. One concern was that the sentences were more complicated than in
Experiment 1, and any difficulty that children had with the task could result from
that. As a control, we therefore included a set of matched sentences where the target
word was unambiguous; difficulties with the task should be reflected in both
conditions. Method Participants. Sixteen 4-year-olds ( M(3 years 11 months, SD (0

arrangement of pictures on the page randomly varied between two different lists,

structure was equivalent to Experiment 1. Each child heard six test vignettes (three
with a plausible subordinate meaning and three with a plausible dominant meaning) and
six control vignettes, counterbalanced so that only one sentence from each pair was
used per list. Children also performed three pretest warm-up trials containing
unambiguous targets and were excluded if they failed any. We again analyzed the data
with mixed-effects logistic regressions including random intercepts for subjects and
items. The small number of items prevented an analysis of homophony-polysemy
differences. Adults were tested slightly differently. To derive a more sensitive
measure of the effects of plausibility and association in these stimuli, we had them
rate the acceptability of each picture on a 1-7 scale (the two target pictures only;
distracter pictures were not tested) for both the ambiguous and unambiguous control
items. As our dependent measure, we calculated the rating of the dominant sense as a
proportion of the summed ratings of both senses and analyzed this using a

Nevertheless, children did also use associations. They chose the plausible but

lateness="0.7857142857142857" reference_score="7.1">Adults process language quickly
and accurately. In particular, they rapidly resolve ambiguities by integrating both
bottom-up and top-down cues. How does this expert skill develop? Studies of syntactic
comprehension suggest the possibility that the development of linguistic ambiguity
resolution might be characterized by a broad dependence on bottom-up cues over
top-down information. To evaluate this, we tested whether that imbalance extends to
children's resolution of lexical ambiguities and instead found that even 4-year-old
children used a top-down cue like global plausibility information to resolve word
senses. That is not to say that children did not use bottom-up cues at all. In
Experiment 1, the Bayesian model offered a limited ability to predict children's
choices, and in Experiment 2, children's choices were clearly swayed by the
overwhelming association information. But critically, these results are not
consistent with any theory that assumes children's linguistic ambiguity resolution
has a blanket bottom-up quality. This suggests that children's language processing
differs from adults' by degree, not kind. These results are consistent with previous
work that assumed children could resolve senses and meanings on the basis of global
plausibility, such as Rabagliati et al.'s (2010) proposal that children use
situational fit in sense resolution, assigning senses on the basis of their fit with
a partial semantic context. They also fit within the framework of the informativity
account of syntactic ambiguity resolution (Trueswell &amp; Gleitman, 2004). Trueswell
proposed that children start to apply different cues at different ages as a result of
tracking each cue's general reliability. As we argued in the introduction, there are
reasons to suspect that although cues such as lexical statistics are more informative
than global plausibility for syntactic ambiguity resolution, they may be less useful
for lexical ambiguity resolution. This might force children to assign higher weight
to top-down plausibility information to resolve lexical ambiguities. Of course, the
informativity account is not the only possible explanation for the difference between
children's use of top-down information in syntactic and lexical ambiguity resolution.
One possibility is that skills learned during language acquisition might transfer to
language processing. Lexical ambiguity resolution resembles the act of word learning
quite closely, in that both require the child to use the surrounding context to
select between a set of candidate meanings. The major difference, of course, is that
the set of candidate meanings is much larger during word learning, but the structure
of the problem seems similar enough that the skills developed in one could plausibly
transfer to the other. Because many theories of word learning rely on the child being
able to determine the meaning of a novel word on the basis of its syntactic or
semantic context and the scene (Gleitman, 1990; Pinker, 1994), the use of this sort
of plausibility information may well transfer from word learning to lexical ambiguity
resolution. By contrast, it is not so obvious that plausibility (or referential
context) is particularly important for syntactic development and, as such, the use of
plausibility for syntactic processing may be underdeveloped when compared with its
use for lexical processing. What this means, in sum, is that our results cannot be
explained by accounts of children's language processing that postulate a blanket
top-down insensitivity (e.g., the bottom-up account described by Snedeker &amp; Yuan,
2008). Rather, they have to be explained under theories in which children are
differentially sensitive to different types of cues for different types of linguistic
ambiguities. Given that a variety of such theories exist, further work will be
necessary to pare down the members of this set. In their use of top-down
plausibility, the children tested here generally behaved in a relatively adult way,
but it is still notable that they had lower accuracy when resolving subordinate
senses or meanings than when resolving dominant senses or meanings in Experiment 1.
This suggests that children have difficulty fully integrating contextual cues and
rely too heavily on each sense or meaning's prior probability. To some extent, then,
this is consistent with a weaker version of Campbell and Macdonald's (1983) claim
that children cannot resolve the subordinate meanings of homophones, in which
subordinate meanings are simply dispreferred rather than ruled out entirely. We see a
number of potential explanations for this result. One possibility is that children
may have difficulty retrieving the subordinate meanings of words from memory.
Alternatively, it could reflect a difficulty modulating the activity of each
retrieved meaning, perhaps because of underdeveloped executive function abilities.
The role of executive function in language-processing development is currently a
topic of intense interest (Choi &amp; Trueswell, 2010; Mazuka, Jincho, &amp; Oishi,
2009; Novick, Trueswell, &amp; Thompson Schill, 2010). The majority of work in this
area has centered on children's failure to revise initial parses of temporally
ambiguous sentences that are eventually resolved to a less-frequent interpretation
(as in Trueswell et al., 1999). Novick and colleagues (Novick et al., 2010; Novick,
Trueswell, &amp; Thompson-Schill, 2005) argued that this "kindergarten-path effect"
is due to children lacking the ability to inhibit highly active representations, and
they suggest that children should exhibit similar behaviors for similar reanalysis
tasks, such as resolving an ambiguous word to its less-frequent meaning. Consistent
with this, Khanna and Boland (2010) showed that 7- to 10-year-old children's scores
on a battery of executive function tests predict their ability to resolve ambiguous
words. Although not intended to test the role of executive function, our
participants' greater difficulty resolving less-frequent meanings or senses is
consistent with Novick and colleagues' proposal. Note, though, that these differences
were much smaller than Trueswell et al.'s (1999) syntactic kindergarten-path effect.
This could be because executive function plays a smaller role in lexical ambiguity
resolution, or it could be because the disambiguating information in our stimuli
always preceded the ambiguity, minimizing the reanalysis demands. Beyond reanalysis,
there have also been suggestions (Mazuka et al., 2009) that children's executive
function difficulties may explain their failure to integrate top-down constraints. To
the best of our knowledge, there is little direct evidence that executive function
plays a facilitatory role in the use of top-down but not bottom-up information during
sentence processing, and we do not take our data to be consistent with this proposal.
In fact, if executive function is domain general (which most researchers assume it to
be), it would be very surprising if its underdevelopment impaired top-down processing
in syntactic ambiguity resolution but not in lexical ambiguity resolution. One
methodological note concerns the picture selection task used in both studies. Picture
selection is an offline task, which measures the factors that affect final
interpretations of ambiguous words, rather than the moment-by-moment processes of
ambiguity resolution. Our results suggest that children and adults use similar
information sources in resolving ambiguous words, but it is still open as to whether
the two populations use the same processes to integrate that information online, and
future work will address that topic. To assess whether different cues are integrated
in the same manner, we would need to use an online measure, like eye tracking. It
could be that all cues are integrated at the earliest moment they become available
(as would be expected under a fully interactive model of sentence processing
development, e.g., the informativity account), but there are alternatives. In
particular, children's integration of top-down cues may be delayed until a second
reanalysis stage (cf. two-stage parsing theories, e.g., Frazier, 1987), or our
offline task may have provided children with enough reflection time to use top-down
cues in the final moments of their decision. Our data, therefore, leave open a window
of hope for a modified version of the bottom-up hypothesis. In this version,
children's initial parsing decisions are governed by bottom-up information, and
top-down cues are integrated later if they are forced to make explicit decisions. Of
course, this account would still have to explain why our task allowed children to use
a decision stage, whereas the syntactic processing task from Snedeker and Trueswell
(2004) did not. One possibility is that our task presented the choice in a more
explicit way. Further work will also be needed to confirm the second main result of
the present study, that children resolve homophones with the same accuracy as they
achieve when they resolve polysemes. Although we found no gross interpretive
differences, it is possible that more fine-grained online measures may be able to
track such a developmental dissociation. We attribute our divergence from previous
results to the efforts made here to use homophones and polysemes that children knew
rather than low-frequency items. Although this null result could be taken as support
for theories in which homophony and polysemy are represented and resolved in the same
way (Foraker &amp; Murphy, 2009; Klein &amp; Murphy, 2001; Murphy, 2007), we caution
against immediately leaping to that conclusion. In particular, we did not test the
condition in which homophones and polysemes have previously diverged in adults,
reanalysis contexts in which the disambiguating region falls after the critical
ambiguous word.<component x="57.0" y="78.05" width="240.08" height="363.15" page="10"

children's lexical ambiguity resolution is sensitive to a variety of information
sources, including lexical associations but also top-down global plausibility
information. That is to say, children's lexical ambiguity resolution appears similar
to adults', and this is inconsistent with theories based on syntactic processing that
attribute a blanket insensitivity to top-down information. Instead, this
less-categorical pattern of successes and failures suggests that children's ambiguity
resolution is dependent on learning the value of individual information sources and
that the value of each information source varies for different types of linguistic
ambiguity. More broadly, our data present a picture of information-processing
development in which children are minimally constrained in which cues they can learn
to integrate and, in fact, can respond to the nature of the task when determining the
most relevant cues to use.<component x="315.0" y="483.31" width="240.07"
