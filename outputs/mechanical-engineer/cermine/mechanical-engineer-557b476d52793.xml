        <p>：Structural bionic design lacks mature and scientific theories, and the excellent structural characteristics of natural organisms sometimes cannot be transferred into engineering structures effectively. Aiming at overcoming the existing problems, this paper summarizes three related theories: similarity theory, fuzzy evaluation theory and optimization theory. Based on the related theories, a method of structural bionic design is introduced, which includes four steps: selecting the most useful structural characteristic of natural organism; analyzing the structural characteristic finally chosen for engineering problem; completing the structural bionic design for engineering structure; and verifying the structural bionic design. Similarity theory and fuzzy evaluation theory are employed to achieve Step 1. In Step 2 and Step 3, optimization theory is employed to analyze the parameters of structures. Together with the thoughts of simplification and grouping, optimization theory can reveal the relationship between organism structure and engineering structure, providing a way to structural bionic design. A general evaluation criterion is proposed in Step 4, which is feasible to evaluate the performance of different structures. Finally, based on the method, a structural bionic design of thin-walled cylindrical shell is introduced.</p>

structure is the best as a contrastive structure. When there is
more than one factor, the contrastive structure should be
designed conventionally, eliminating the influence of

summarized. They are the basis of the method proposed in this
paper.</p>
      <p>(2) Analyses of the structural characteristics of
organism for engineering problems, which are usually
neglected, are emphasized, and a feasible way is introduced.
This step is the main part, which builds bridges between
the structural characteristics of organisms and
engineering structures, and it is crucial for the method of
structural bionic design. Through simplifying organism
structure and grouping its parameters, the structural
characteristics of organisms can be extracted and transferred into
engineering structures.</p>
      <p>(3) A general evaluation criterion is proposed. It
can reflect the effect of both positive and negative
influencing factors in a right way, and is a quantitative
reference for the comparison between two different designs
for engineering problem.</p>
      <p>(4) This paper proposes a systematic method of
structural bionic design. Based on the method, a bionic
thin-walled cylindrical shell is designed, and its
loadbearing efficiency is improved by as much as 44.7%.
Through structural bionic design of the shell, the method
is confirmed to be a feasible and effective one.</p>
