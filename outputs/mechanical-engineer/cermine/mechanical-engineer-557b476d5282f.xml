        <p>-Stages through which welded items of power installations are designed in mechanical and techno logical respects are analyzed. Results obtained from theoretical and experimental studies of the criteria for local brittle fractures used during manufacture and operation of welded structures are given. The most effi cient methodological approach for designing constructions and technologies is substantiated. The main line in which modern power engineering is developed involves construction of economically efficient and reliable power installations, which is achieved through increasing their capacity and opti mizing their operating parameters (temperature and pressure of working medium). Use of new high strength materials for this purpose entails the need to achieve essentially better quality of technological and design elaborations. Under the conditions of strong competition, decreasing the net cost, and shortening the time taken to develop and manufacture the equip ment are becoming the main objectives. One of lines in which the above mentioned objectives can be achieved consists of applying welded items that make it possible to use combined constructions consisting of materials containing different alloys, as well as of bil lets fabricated as a result of various secondary conver sion processes (rolling, casting, and forging).</p>

      <p>Contradictions between the designers, specialists
in materials science, process engineers, and produc
tion structures always arise in the course of developing
new equipment. Lack of interaction between them
usually results in that equipment is designed with
poorer quality, that the materials are selected inade
quately, that nonoptimal technological processes of
equipment manufacture are developed, due to which
there is high probability that flaws (cracks and discon
tinuities) and zones with pronounced structural and
mechanical nonuniformity may appear during manu
facture and operation, and as a consequence, that the
actual performance characteristics of new equipment
will differ from the design ones. Work on finalizing the
design and technology at the stages of manufacture
and operation result in a considerably longer time
taken to develop a power installation and, accordingly,
in a higher net cost of this installation.</p>
      <p>Welding is one of the main technological processes
determining the operability of a construction. Use of
welding essentially alters the stressed state of a con
struction and mechanical properties of local zones in
welded connections. In addition, it results in a higher
risk of the occurrence of technological cracks and
plastic deformations causing distortion of the design
geometry of parts and assemblies. Application of the
optimal welding technology makes it possible to
achieve high quality and reliability of the construction.</p>
      <p>At the same time, it should be noted that even a slight
change in the design of welded items and correct
choice of materials can make it possible to use an
essentially simpler technology and apply the most
suitable welding methods. Therefore, welding tech
nology must be developed jointly with working out the
design and selecting the material.</p>
      <p>The general principles of combined mechanical
and technological designing were formulated by a
number of outstanding scientists, including
N.O. Okerblom, G.L. Petrov, G.A. Nikolaev, V.N. Ze
mzin, V.A. Vinokurov, N.N. Prokhorov, G.P. Karzov,
F.A. Khromchenko, and some others. The cycle of
combined mechanical and technological designing is
implemented in carrying out interconnected stages
through which equipment is developed. Feedforward
and feedback links are formed between the develop
ment of construction, selection of materials, elabora
tion of technology, and the stage of equipment manu
facture (Fig. 1). Below, interactions between the indi
vidual stages of developing a construction are
considered in more detail.</p>
      <p>Development of a construction (designing). The ini
tial stage of designing includes development of a draft
design with separation of individual items, preliminary
selection of the design makeup of the main items and
parts (all forged, cast, welded, welded and forged,
and welded and cast), determination of the tempera
ture and force parameters of operational loads, and
definition of strength requirements for materials and
welded connections. At the first stage of designing,
preliminary selection of materials can efficiently be
made using various nomographic charts demarcating
the application fields of materials depending on their</p>

mechanical and technological designing and manufactur
ing of welded constructions.
strength properties, safety margin, and stress concen
tration factors in the most heavily stressed zones of the
construction. An example of one nomographic chart is
given in [1].</p>
      <p>At the second stage of designing, design engineers,
working jointly with process engineers and specialists
in materials science, work out additional requirements
for materials of the main items in order to fulfill the
strength characteristics specified by the designer
(safety margins and strength degradation factors of
welded connections), the required design service life,
high resistance to brittle fracture, and technological
strength against fracturing (weldability). Concurrently
with this, the designer carries out the necessary
strength calculations and elaborates in more detain the
design makeup of items with direct participation of the
process engineer.</p>
      <p>In analyzing the overall strength and geometrical
stability of welded items, the designer can limit himself
or herself to consideration of equivalent working
stresses and averaged temperatures related to the
entire volume of the metal of a structural element.</p>
      <p>However, in estimating the integrity of a structure,
local stressed state must first of all be studied. The
majority of defects in and destructions of welded items
are local in nature and are connected exactly with
development of structural, mechanical, and chemical
nonuniformities in the zones of welded connections.</p>
      <p>Taking into account the results obtained from a study
of structural and mechanical nonuniformity of welded
connections, the designer can make calculations of
stressed and strain state essentially more confident and
change the design jointly with the process engineer by
placing welded joints away from the zone of increased
stresses. Despite the fact that various software systems
are presently available using which it is possible to sim
ulate operational effects on structural elements and
determine the distribution of temperatures, deforma
tions, and stresses taking into account the geometry of
items specified by the designer, a calculated analysis of
the hazard of local brittle fractures still involves certain
difficulties. A paradoxical situation occurs, in which
local stressed and strain state can be determined with
high trustworthiness by means of numerical computa
tion methods, whereas attempts to estimate the condi
tions under which brittle fracture occurs in welded
items at the stage of mechanical and technological
designing are not met with success due to lack of quan
titative engineering criteria for local brittle fracture.</p>
      <p>Criteria for local fracture must be sufficiently universal
and simple for the possibility of carrying out the anal
ysis and considering different versions of a construc
tion within the time scheduled for elaborating the
design.</p>
      <p>For carrying out a quantitative analysis of resis
tance to local fractures under creep conditions at high
temperatures, specialists of the Central Boiler–Tur
bine Institute (TsKTI) have developed a phenomeno
logical model of brittle fracture [2–15] and criteria
using which fast quantitative calculation assessments
can be carried out at the stage of mechanical and tech
nological designing. The model describes the kinetics
characterizing the accumulation with time of local
defects in individual zones of a construction and glo
bal defects outside of stress concentration zones. The
following engineering criteria have been proposed on
the basis of the theoretical fracture model and experi
mental studies: critical Kc and threshold KIcth [the let
ters in the subscript have the following meaning: I
denotes the type of loading (I means breaking off), c is
creep loading, and th denotes the threshold value)]
time characteristics of fracture resistance, isochronous
dependences of crack growth rates in time on the stress
intensity factor, using which one can predict all devel
opment stages of local fractures: conditions under
which cracks do not propagate, kinetics of slow crack
growth under creep conditions, and critical conditions
for spontaneous fracture in any zone of welded con

connections. At the first stage of calculation, the con
dition under which a crack does not propagate is
determined:</p>
      <p>As an example, Fig. 2 shows time dependences of
threshold and critical values of fracture toughness cor
responding to the local and global damageability of
Grade 12Kh1MF steel under creep conditions. The
figure also shows fracture graphs (fracture surfaces),
the dependence of fracture micromechanisms on the
fracture localization degree [15]. Table 1 gives the
threshold and critical values of fracture strength char
acteristics for different grades of steel tested under
creep conditions. The threshold values of KIcth are a
factor of 15–20 smaller than the critical values of K ,
c
and their values for welded connections of the above
mentioned grades of steel are still smaller. Table 2 gives
the values of KIcth for metal of the near weld zone
(NWZ), weld joint metal (WJM), and the base metal
(BM). The local fracture strength characteristics of
different zones differ considerably from each other
depending on the degree of alloying the material and
welding method. The threshold characteristics of frac
ture strength are used for estimating the service life of
different elements of power equipment and welded

[15].</p>
      <p>The permissible values of [n] and [a] in expressions
(1) and (2) are specified by the designer together with
the process engineer.</p>
      <p>Selection of structural materials. At this stage of
combined mechanical and process designing, the spe
cialist in materials science selects a steel grade or alloy
proceeding from the parameters of working medium,
levels of temperatures and stresses, and loading pat
tern (static, dynamic, or cyclic) specified by the
designer. Correct choice of materials made taking into
account their thermal and physical characteristics
(heat conductivity and linear expansion coefficients,
and heat capacity) is of special importance, because
these characteristics are used in design calculations for
determining thermally stressed state. In selecting the
materials, it is necessary to ensure the required level of
strength and plastic characteristics and stability of the
properties of materials throughout the entire design
service life. In selecting the materials, proper attention
should be paid to uniformity of properties over the
cross section of billets and susceptibility of materials to
localization of fractures due to the presence of metal
lurgical flaws (various sorts of discontinuities, foreign
inclusions, and liquation zones).</p>
      <p>The proposed structural materials must be esti
mated with respect to their suitability for welding. The
requirements for selected materials may be essentially
changed according to recommendations of process
engineers. In the cases when new materials have to be
used, the properties of metal must be investigated
according to programs developed jointly by the
designer, specialist in materials science, and process
engineer. The use of such an approach will make it
possible to considerably shorten the time taken to cre
ate a new material for concrete kinds of equipment
and achieve considerably lower probability of design
errors.</p>
      <p>Special attention must be paid to welded items
made of different grades of steel operating at high tem
peratures. Diffusion processes develop in the zones of
welded connections of different grades of steel charac
terized by considerable initial heterogeneity of their
properties under the conditions of long term loading
at high temperatures, which entail formation of brittle
and low strength interlayers and occurrence of local
stressed and strain state that is essentially different
from the design state. If the designer knows only the
properties of the main and deposited metal, he or she
cannot determine the safety factors and design service
life. In this case, a set of additional studies on estab
lishing the properties of metal in different zones with
determining the local fracture strength characteristics
must be carried out.</p>
      <p>For the designer be able to estimate the influence of
temperature effects on the level of stresses and on the
strain state within the framework of selecting the
materials, he or she must have the results from studies
of creep characteristics and relaxation of stresses for
the base metal and for different zones of welded con
nections.</p>
      <p>Information contained in all the above mentioned
characteristics of metal and welded connections must
allow the designer to perform trustworthy simulation
of the stressed and strain state of the construction for
ensuring its guaranteed service life.</p>
      <p>In developing a new power installation with an
increased power capacity that must comply with the
requirement of having a decreased metal intensity, the
designer is compelled to increase the level of stresses in
its components and, accordingly, to use high strength
materials. But as the strength of material increases, the
indicators characterizing the technological and opera
tional fracture strength of metal decrease considerably
and, consequently, there is an increased risk of brittle
fracture. The presence of structural stress concentra
tions, as well as metallurgical and technological (weld
ing) flaws facilitates development of brittle fractures.</p>
      <p>Figure 3 shows the decrease of the permissible size of
defects with increasing the yield strength (σ0.2) for
chromium–molybdenum–vanadium steels. It can be
seen that, as the strength level of steels increases by a
factor of 1.6–1.7, the permissible size of a defect with
respect to the condition of local brittle fracture
decreases by a factor of 9–10 [2–6, 11, 12, 15]. A con
clusion can be drawn from what was said above that in
selecting materials for welded parts it is necessary to
consider not only the strength characteristics of metal,
but also pay special attention to enhancement of
requirements to its metallurgical quality in the part of
imposing more stringent norms on the sizes of permis
sible flaws.</p>
      <p>Development of welding and surfacing technologies.</p>
      <p>At the first stage of the welding process, the process
engineer analyses the overall design of a welded item
and technical requirements for operating parameters,
and also the materials suggested for manufacture from
the viewpoint of ensuring weldability. Based on a pre
liminary analysis, he or she selects welding methods
and welding materials taking into account the strength
properties of metal specified by the designer and opti
mizes the design of welded items, versions of grooving
for welding, and the layout of weld joints.</p>
      <p>At the second stage, a program is developed for
determining the optimal parameters of technological
welding processes and thermal treatment. This stage is
commenced with the following: the welding process is
simulated, the temperature field in the welded con
nection is determined, the kinetics of change in the
stressed and strain state is evaluated, and the zones in
which structural and phase conversions evolve are esti
mated.</p>
      <p>The kinetic dependences are used for experimen
tally simulating the deformation and destruction of
material in different zones of welded connections dur
ing tests of samples of the studied metal and for deter
mining its resistance to technological cracks. Devel
opment of quantitative engineering criteria for tech
nological resistance to crack growth, as well as
metrologically supported test methods, is of the most
important significance for implementing such an
approach.</p>
      <p>The results obtained from long term studies and
theoretical elaborations carried out at TsKTI made it
possible to establish general regularities in the devel
opment of technological cracks during welding and
thermal treatment [16–27]. It was shown that hot and
cold cracks appearing during welding and cracks
resulting from thermal treatment develop according to
the mechanisms of brittle intergranular fracture under
the effect of temporary and residual welding stresses.</p>
      <p>The formation of these stresses is characterized by
kinetic regularities of creep and embrittlement in cer
tain temperature and time intervals corresponding to
nonequilibrium state of metal in the corresponding
zone of welded connection [23, 24]. An analysis of
phenomenological regularities in the development of
this type of failures makes it possible to describe tech
nological cracks in welded connections using the
statements of general creep fracture theory. New crite
ria for technological resistance to crack growth similar
to the fracture criteria under creep and stress relax
ation conditions have been developed. For quantita
tively assessing the resistance to cold cracks and cracks
appearing during thermal treatment, it has been pro
posed to use threshold fracture strength values deter
mined according to special procedures [28–30] under
creep and stress relaxation conditions. The loading
parameters are established based on the results of the
previous simulation. The resistance to hot cracks is
determined from the dip of plasticity in the tempera
ture interval and from the actual deformation rate
obtained from a preliminary calculation at the stage of
simulating the technological process of welding [27].</p>
      <p>The temperature and stressed and strained states
are simulated by means of the developed computer
program using the finite element method. The
mechanical model (the geometric relations and
schemes characterizing the state of deformed
medium) has been implemented according to the clas
sic theory of strains and stresses. In the physical model
characterizing the form of correlation between stresses
and strains, and which is based on the statements of
theory of nonisothermal plastic yield, the limiting
condition is adopted in Mises form, and the hypothe

sis of short term creep is used. The temperature prob
lem is based on the unsteady equation of heat conduc
tance with initial and boundary conditions. The load
ing history was traced by sequentially solving the
temperature and strain problems in nonlinear state
ment at each moment of time taking into account the
dependence of thermophysical and mechanical prop
erties of materials on the temperature and the thermo
kinetic diagrams of phase conversions.</p>
      <p>The use of the developed theoretical and numerical
models, methodological principles, fracture criteria,
and experimental methods makes it possible to quan
titatively analyze a large number of technological
alternatives within a short period of time and select the
most stable welding technologies application of which
ensures the highest safety margins (nk) with respect to
technological resistance to growth of cracks. Figure 4
shows the results from an analysis of technological
resistance to crack growth for the versions of surfacing
metal to the journals and thrust plates of the high and
intermediate pressure rotors of a 660 MW steam tur
bine. A comparison of margin factors with respect to
resistance to cold cracks in the near weld zone of
welded connections made of 11% chromium rotor
steel [27] was carried out. A total of 68 technological
versions were subjected to experimental and calculated
studies, and 13 versions giving the highest margins
with respect to technological resistance to crack
growth were selected from them for further investiga
tion based on the study results. The resistances to hot
cracks and cracks due to thermal treatment were esti
mated in a similar way. The results obtained from
determination of safety margins with respect to tech
nological strength are given in [27].

      <p>Application of the principles of combined mechan
ical and process designing makes it possible to con
struct new power installations within a considerably
shorter period of time while ensuring their high reli
ability and essentially reducing costs for their develop
