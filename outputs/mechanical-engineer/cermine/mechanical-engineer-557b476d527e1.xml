        <p>In this paper, a user-friendly and comprehensive control system design package called Control System Design Automation (CSDA) is described. The system consists of five main blocks: a requirement interpretation block, a modeling block, an analysis/design block, a database management and knowledge base block, and a verification block. The requirement interpretation block transforms the specifications in terms of the application to those in terms of control. The analysis/design block selects an optimal control structure and determines the controller parameters. In addition to the conventional design methods, CSDA also contains the more recent design methods such as the LMI design approach and the Kessler/Manabe method. The LMI approach can obtain a controller which satisfies multiple specification items at the same time. The configuration of the system as well as the analysis/design block are described in detail in this paper.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Currently, many control system design problems are tackled by skillful
control engineers in the industry. One objective of developing the Control System
Design Automation (CSDA) is to make control system design methods available
to more engineers so that they can carry out control system design and obtain a
satisfactory controller in a short time. The users of the CSDA system includes
robot designers and machine tool designers, whose training are more in the area
of mechanical engineering. The aim is that those engineers would have a
userfriendly and comprehensive control system design tool with them when they
carry out their design of mechanical systems. The particular targets are industrial
robots, X-Y tables, and transfer machines.</p>
      <p>Nowadays, the Computer-Aided Control System Design (CACSD) tools, such
as MATLAB/SIMULINK and MATRIXx, have high performance in analysis,
simulation and rapid prototyping. Those tools are very useful for a skilled
engineer to design a controller. Further work have been carried out in constructing
CACSD tools with which optimal control parameters for a given control
structure are automatically calculated [1, 2]. These tools, however, cannot transform
the requirements in the application to the specifications items for use in CACSD
tools. Furthermore, they do not select an optimal control structure
automatically. To overcome these problems, a high level and user-friendly control system
design package is constructed for controller design of mechanical systems. The
control system design environment is called CSDA. The special features of the
CSDA system include the following:
(1) The requirements in a particular application may not be expressed in terms
of the control design specifications. The CSDA system can transform those
application requirements to specifications which can be treated in the control
design package.
(2) The CSDA system has a comprehensive set of control design methodologies.</p>
      <p>Some of the more recent methods such as the LMI design approach and the
Kessler/Manabe method are included.
(3) The system can select an appropriate control structure automatically in
addition to determining a set of control parameters.
(4) A user-friendly interface has been developed using the Graphical User
Interface (GUI) in MATLAB.
(5) Analysis of the designed control system can be carried out with different
kinds of command input. The aim is to select a suitable command control
signal in the final control system.
(6) Verification of the control system design can be carried out with the DSP-CIT
system [24].
(7) A knowledge base module in the CSDA system can provide guidance to the
user during the design process. Heuristic knowledge from previous design
experience can be codified and make available to the user.
(8) A database management module in the system can help to organize the
design results of the user. A database on the past design activities can also
help the designer to decide on the appropriate control structure and controller
parameters. The objective is that users of the CSDA system can design
satisfactory controllers easily even if they do not have much experience in
control system design. Fine tuning of the controller can be carried out by a
parameter optimizer.</p>
      <p>In this paper, the configuration of the CSDA system is described in details.
Also, detailed description is given to the analysis/design block. The
analysis/design block is the most significant block of CSDA, which provides the desired
control system design automation.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>2. Configuration of the System</title>
      <p>The configuration of the CSDA system is shown in Figure 1. The CSDA system
consists of five blocks: a requirement interpretation block, a modeling block,
an analysis/design block, a database management and knowledge base block,
and a verification block. The modeling block, the analysis/design block, and
the simulation module of the verification block are constructed using MATLAB/
SIMULINK.DSP-CIT (developed by dSPACE GmbH) [21] is used for a rapid
prototyping module in the verification block.</p>
      <sec id="2-1">
        <title>2.1. REQUIREMENT INTERPRETATION BLOCK</title>
        <p>Sometimes, the requirements in a particular application may not be expressed in
terms of the control design specifications. In this block, the given requirements
from the application are transformed to specifications which can be treated in
the control design package. Since the requirements differ from application to
application, the requirement interpretation block has specified modules according
to each controlled object.</p>
        <p>For example, when the controlled object is an industry robot, the requirements
in the application are standard cycle-time, positioning accuracy, and tracking
accuracy. The control design specifications are crossover frequency, amount of
overshoot, and settling time. Acceleration time and deceleration time are
calculated, and standard cycle-time is transformed to settling time. The acceptable limit
of overshoot is calculated from the positioning accuracy. Crossover frequency is
decided according to the required tracking accuracy and maximum speed. The
specifications are then passed on to both the analysis/design and the modeling
blocks.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="2-2">
        <title>2.2. MODELING BLOCK</title>
        <p>In the modeling block, the model of a controlled object is obtained by an actual
measurement or from the design parameters of the controlled object. In case the
order of the model is too high for designing a controller, the order of the model
needs to be reduced. For example, a three-mass model is approximated by a
two-mass model if the resonant frequency of the second vibration mode is much
higher than the crossover frequency. The reduced order model is then sent to the
analysis/design block.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="2-3">
        <title>2.3. ANALYSIS/DESIGN BLOCK</title>
        <p>The analysis/design block has six modules: a control structure selection module,
a control parameters calculation module, a pre-design analysis module, a
postdesign analysis module, a command signal generation module and a parameter
optimizer module. The control structure selection module and the command
signal generation module would apply the appropriate module for control system
design. All of the modules in the analysis/design block are constructed using
MATLAB/SIMULINK.</p>
        <p>In this block, the structure and the parameters of a controller are designed
according to the interpreted requirements and the system model. In a conventional
CACSD system, users need to select the controller structure, such as PID. In
addition, the users need to give some of the criteria, such as cost functions, to
the CACSD system. The aim of developing the CSDA system is to automate
these processes by analyzing the given specifications and the model. Since it
is difficult to get the best controller automatically, the system requires some
redesigning process. If the results are not satisfactory, the users can modify the
design parameters during and/or after this process. If the specifications given by
the requirement interpretation block are satisfied, the designed command signal
and designed controller are sent to the verification block. If the specifications
are not satisfied, redesign demand is sent to the requirement interpretation block.
More details would be given in the next section.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="2-4">
        <title>2.4. VERIFICATION BLOCK</title>
        <p>In this block, simulations and/or experiments are carried out whether or not the
given specifications are satisfied. In the simulation of this block, the effects of the
sampling time, quantization, backlash, and friction are also taken into account.
Furthermore, the original higher order model could be used for the simulation.</p>
        <p>The simulation programs are written using MATLAB/SIMULINK M-files and
DSP-CIT is used for a rapid prototyping. If the given specifications are not
satisfied, redesign command would be sent to the requirement interpretation block, the
modeling block, or the analysis/design block. If the specifications are satisfied,
the process of designing a command signal and a controller is completed.</p>

        <title>2.5. DATABASE MANAGEMENT AND KNOWLEDGE BASE BLOCK</title>
        <sec id="2-5-1">
          <title>2.5.1. Database Management Module</title>
          <p>Many control system design packages do not provide any support for database
management. Control system design activities are carried out using the package or
design environment such as MATLAB. It is then up to the engineer to decide how
to store the design results and document the design activity. Very often, the results
are put in a data file in text format, and the file is given a meaningful file name.
Very few design package has a built-in database management facility as an
integral part of the CACSD environment. The database management module in the
CSDA system is a built-in facility for the user. The purposes of the facility are:</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="3">
      <title>1. To keep track and to organize the models, design specifications, controllers</title>
      <p>obtained and analysis results over the control system design life-cycle.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="4">
      <title>2. To automate the documentation of control system design activities by the</title>
      <p>engineer. This is to avoid manual organization of the large amount of data
and files created during the course of the design process.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="5">
      <title>3. To form a database on the past design activities which can help future design attempts. It should be easy to retrieve data and information by using a query facility on the database.</title>
      <p>The database is formed and updated after each design session. At the end
of every session, the system parameters, design specifications, control structure
selected, control parameters obtained, design analysis results as well as written
comments from the designer is stored as a relational database, together with basic
information of the design session such as identity number, date, time and name of
the designer. This is a very useful facility for the automated documentation of the
design session. As the current version of CSDA is concerned with linear control
system design only, the problem of traceability between derivative model [8] does
not appear. However, if CSDA is expanded in the future, then information on
relationships between different models has to be stored by introducing reference
pointers in each database item.</p>
      <sec id="5-1">
        <title>2.5.2. Knowledge Base Module</title>
        <p>The knowledge base module in the CSDA system contains the heuristic
knowledge of the control system design process. It is implemented using the control
system design package called MEDAL [9]. MEDAL is a sophisticated computing
environment developed at the University of Waterloo for mathematics,
simulation and expert system development [10, 11]. The unique feature of MEDAL
is that it provides an integrated environment for both numeric computation and
knowledge-based system development.</p>
        <p>The language syntax of MEDAL is an extension to the popular MATLAB
(Matrix Laboratory) language. For examples of the MEDAL language syntax,
please refer to [9–11]. MEDAL provides mathematical functions and the M-files
features similar to MATLAB. However, MEDAL also has command syntax for
(fuzzy) expert system development, as well as data structures like packed
matrices, rules and frames. Hence, MEDAL is an integrated expert system shell for
the development of knowledge-based systems which can perform sophisticated
numeric calculations. Knowledge can be represented using facts, rules, frames
and fuzzy logic.</p>
        <p>In our CSDA system, relevant information about the system model and the
desired specifications can be inputs to the knowledge base module. Findings
from the pre-design analysis will also be used for the knowledge base module.
The module in turns should provide advice to the user. The user can request
for results from the inferencing of the knowledge base module. At the end of a
design session, the user is asked to document his design and comments. These
design experiences are also useful for the update of the knowledge base module.</p>
        <p>As the current implementation of MEDAL is not coupled with MATLAB,
the designer has to open a separate window to run the MEDAL package. Data
exchange between MATLAB and MEDAL has to be carried out using external
data files. Thus, MEDAL is used as an auxiliary program to help organize the
knowledge base aspects of CSDA.</p>

      <title>3. Analysis/Design Block</title>
      <p>This block is the core of the CSDA system. Details of the control structure
selection module and the control parameters calculation module are explained here.
A pre-design analysis module and a post-design analysis module are mentioned
briefly. A command signal generation module and a parameter optimizer module
will be included in the future.</p>
      <p>The authors have examined several control algorithms to select a satisfactory
control structure and its parameters. These algorithms are written as user-defined
functions in MATLAB. One special feature of the CSDA system is an “Auto
design” button. This button aims to give an automated design solution to the
user. This includes a selection of the control structure and a suitable design of
the controller parameters. The previous results in designing a controller are also
saved. Hence, the system can also choose a satisfactory control structure and
decide on its parameters with reference to previous design results.</p>
      <sec id="6-1">
        <title>3.1. PRE-DESIGN ANALYSIS MODULE</title>
        <p>System model parameters are displayed or modified in this module. Various
diagrams for control system analysis can be displayed. Poles of the system,
antiresonant frequency, and resonant frequency of the model are also shown to help
the user to decide on the control structure and controller parameters. The results
from this module can also be passed to the knowledge base module, which could
provide some heuristic knowledge and advice to the user.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="6-2">
        <title>3.2. CONTROL STRUCTURE SELECTION MODULE</title>
        <p>A selection module, a two-mass module 1, a two-mass module 2, a one
massmodule, and so on are in this group. The selection module selects a suitable
module according to the reduced order system model. Then, a satisfactory control
structure is used in the selected module, see Figure 3. In case the reduced order
model is a two-mass model as shown in Figure 2 and the load position can be
measured, the two-mass module 1 will be selected.</p>
        <p>In the two-mass module 1, two types of state feedback controllers shown
in Figures 4 and 5 are possible. The controller shown in Figure 4 is a usual
state feedback controller without disturbance observer. The controller shown in</p>
        <p>Figure 5 is a state feedback controller with an additional disturbance observer
which contains a nominal inverse model of the load and the flexible joint. This
observer is introduced to suppress the influence of parameter variation in load
inertia and stiffness coefficient of the two-mass model. So in case the minimal
value of J1 is smaller than a half of its nominal value, controller 2 shown in
Figure 5 is selected in the auto design mode.</p>
        <p>When the load position cannot be measured, the two-mass module 2 is selected
instead of the two-mass module 1. In the two-mass module 2, a state feedback
controller with full order observer and four controllers with inner speed loop are
prepared. The four controllers are disturbance observer controller, state observer
controller, PI-D controller, and PI controller. In the two-mass module 2 a
satisfactory control structure is selected according to the anti-resonant frequency of
the controlled object and the required cutoff frequency. If the anti-resonant
frequency is higher than the cutoff frequency, a state observer controller is selected.
In another case, a disturbance observer controller is selected. Of course, the user
can also select a controller by himself.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="6-3">
        <title>3.3. CONTROL PARAMETERS CALCULATION MODULE</title>
        <p>Parameters of several control structures can be calculated using the same control
system design technique such as pole assignment or Kessler/Manabe approach.
The ways to calculate satisfactory parameters have something in common even if
the structure of the controllers are different. The main modules are LMI module,
pole assignment module, and the Kessler/Manabe [15, 16] approach module. The
parameters of the control structure selected are calculated in theses modules.</p>
        <sec id="6-3-1">
          <title>3.3.1. LMI Module</title>
          <p>Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) have started to be used in control system
design [5–7]. The advantage of the LMIs is that many analysis and synthesis
problems can be formulated as LMIs, e.g. H-1, H2, pole-assignment and more.
In addition, the LMIs can often be solved efficiently using modern numerical
algorithms. If a solution is found, it is the global optimal solution subject to the
LMI-constraints. The LMI concept is appealing because it makes it possible to
combine different control specifications or methods in the same framework. The
designer can then find an optimal controller constrained by the control
specifications. The optimal solution of the LMI problem is found through iterations.
Computing power required is very high and is enough to solve LMIs. In the
future, it will be even higher thus making it possible to solve more complex
problems faster.</p>
          <p>In the LMI module, three different specifications are combined. These
specifications are, H-1, pole-assignment, and parameter variations [7].
(A) H-1 LMI. H-1 is used to achieve a system with low sensitivity to
disturbances. In other words, an H-1 optimal controller is designed to minimize
the worst error which can result from any disturbance.
(B) Pole-Placement LMI. Pole-placement LMI is a means to specify system
performance. By assigning a pole-placement region, the time-response and
damping of the system can be controlled. This enables us to take
actuator limitations into account. For example the motor has only limited driving
torque, and hence the size of the feedback gains has to be limited. Also, the
degree of stability and time-response can be specified by moving the poles
from the origin.
(C) Plant Parameter Variations LMI. To enhance robustness, two specifications
are being used. First, the above described H-1 objective ensures low
sensitivity in the low frequency region. Secondly, parameter variations are being
accounted for. The controlled object is expressed by a descriptor form in
the LMI module, and LMIs are formed for every maximum/minimum value
of the parameters of the reduced order model. For example, the number of
LMIs becomes four when two parameters are varied.</p>
          <p>In this LMI module all poles are assigned in the area shown in Figure 7.
Users set the radius r, angle , and distance h. The values of r and are fixed.
If there is no solution, h is decreased and LMI is solved again.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="6-3-2">
          <title>3.3.2. Pole Assignment Module</title>
          <p>The pole assignment module has four algorithms:</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="7">
      <title>1. Algorithm 1: all poles are on the real axis in the left half plane.</title>
      <p>The poles are [− 0; − 0; − 0; − 0; : : :]
The poles are [− ; − ; : : : ; −2 ; −2 ; : : :]</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="8">
      <title>2. Algorithm 2: all poles are on the real axis in the left half plane.</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="9">
      <title>3. Algorithm 3: all poles are placed according to the Butterworth pattern. In case</title>
      <p>the Butterworth pattern is used, the characteristic polynomials are as follows.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="10">
      <title>4. Algorithm 4: all poles are placed according to the ITAE (Integral of Time multiplied by Absolute Error) minimum pattern. In case the ITAE minimum pattern is used, the characteristic polynomials are as follows.</title>
      <p>A state feedback controller and a full order observer can assign its poles at
will. Algorithm 1, algorithm 3, or algorithm 4 are used to assign the poles of such
controllers. For the nominal plant, the state feedback controller designed by
algorithm 1 has no overshoot, but the rise time is long. The state feedback controller
designed by algorithm 3 has large overshoot, and the response is oscillative. The
controller designed by algorithm 4 has a short rise time, but it has a small
overshoot. Algorithm 2 has a similar performance as algorithm 1. The robustness to
the parameter variation is the highest in the case of algorithm 2. According to
the features mentioned above, algorithm 2 is used in the Auto Design mode.</p>
      <sec id="10-1">
        <title>3.3.3. Kessler/Manabe Approach Module</title>
        <p>The Kessler/Manabe approach is an algebraic method, whose design philosophy
is based on the relative size of the closed-loop characteristic polynomial
coefficients. It was first proposed by Dr. Claus Kessler at Siemens in 1960 [15] and
then refined by Blaschke in 1974 [17]. A standard form of the design
parameters was suggested and the method has been used with great success for DC
and AC machine control. Important studies on the stability and robustness issues
was carried out by Lipatov [12] in 1978. Sufficient condition for stability and
instability of linear continuous systems were derived and these are expressed in
the form of inequalities based on the adjacent coefficients of the characteristic
polynomial.</p>
        <p>The method was applied successfully for the attitude control of satellites at
Mitsubishi Electric in Japan. Dr. Manabe has further developed the method by
introducing a graph and called it the Coefficient Diagram Method (CDM) [16].
He has also carried out extensive study on the design parameters and modified the
standard form suggested by Kessler. It has been used for steel mill control [18],
air heater control and regulation of an urban heating network differential
pressure [19]. Hence, the Kessler/Manabe [20] design approach has been known and
applied with great success in many industry applications, although the method is
not generally well-known in the academic circle.</p>
        <p>The design parameters in this approach are a set of stability indices γi and an
equivalent time constant . P (s) is a characteristic polynomial, and the stability
indices γi and the equivalent time constant are defined as follows:
P (s) = ansn +
γi = ai2
ai+1ai−1
a1
(i = 1; 2; : : : ; n − 1);
The default values for γi are [2:5; 2; 2; : : :] and those values are used in the
Auto Design mode. Of course, an expert user can set the values by himself.</p>
        <sec id="10-1-1">
          <title>3.4. POST-DESIGN ANALYSIS MODULE</title>
          <p>The post-design analysis module serves to give a preliminary assessment of the
control design. This will give an idea on the suitability of the control structure
selected and the control parameters obtained. More detailed analysis has to be
carried out in the Verification Block with a more detailed system model. Also,
fine tuning of the controller parameters could be done to further enhance the
control design in the parameter optimizer module.</p>
          <p>In this module, nine items related to the performance and robustness of the
system are examined. They are rise time, overshoot, maximum magnitude of
control signal, bandwidth, maximum drop when the step disturbance is added,
maximum gain from measurement noise to load angle, gain margin, phase
margin, and maximum tracking error when the velocity command is trapezoid. Five
figures can also be shown in this module. Those figures are step response of
the load position, torque command when a step input and a step disturbance are
added, tracking error when the velocity command is a trapezoid, open loop bode
diagram, and closed loop bode diagram.</p>
          <p>Whether the specifications are met or not can be examined by these nine
items and five figures. If the specifications are met, the result of the design and
the comments on the design are saved into the database, which will help future
design attempt. If the design result is not satisfactory, the user will return to the
previous module and design a controller by using another controller structure or
other controller parameters.</p>

      <title>4. Graphical User-Interface and Examples</title>
      <p>In order to make CSDA more user-friendly, an Graphical User-Interface (GUI)
is developed. Figures 8 and 9 give an example of the GUI in the analysis/design
block. Figure 8 shows the interface at the beginning of the block. Figure 9
shows the control structure selection module group. A user can go to the next
or previous step by clicking the relevant button. Static help files can be seen
by clicking the Info/Help button. The information is very useful for the user to
select a control structure and a control parameter calculation algorithm. When
the Auto Design button is clicked, control structure and control parameters are
automatically decided according to the experience of the authors. The display
button is used to show a block diagram of the control structure.</p>

jm = 0:0045 [kgm2]; jl = 0:001 [kgm2]; kb = 2:05 [Nm/rad];
dm = 0:0105 [Nms/rad]; dl = 0:0057 [Nms/rad]:</p>
        <p>The dotted lines are the results of the nominal system, and the solid lines are
the results of the real system. Figure 10 is the results when CSDA is used without
Auto Design. A state feedback controller is used in this case. Figure 11 is the
result when the Auto Design mode is used. A state feedback plus disturbance
observer controller is selected in this case.</p>
        <p>When the controlled object is a nominal model, the state feedback controller
has a similar performance as the state feedback controller with a disturbance
observer. The state feedback controller is, however, inferior to the state feedback
controller with a disturbance observer in the case that there is a large parameter
variation. The CSDA system has many control structures and many algorithms
to decide on the controller parameters. The CSDA system also has a knowledge
base/data base management block. With the help of the CSDA, a user can easily
obtain a controller whose performance is similar to the controller designed by
an expert control engineer.</p>

      <title>5. Future Developments</title>
      <p>In the future development of CSDA, a parameter optimizer module and a
command signal generation group will be included.</p>

        <title>5.1. PARAMETER OPTIMIZER MODULE</title>
        <p>In the Kessler/Manabe approach, the stability condition by Lipatov [12] gives the
mathematical basis for this approach. Several theorems on sufficient conditions
for stability have been derived. A standard form on the choice of the stability
index has been proposed by Manabe. Although the standard form has been found
very useful and usually results in a good design, it is believed that fine tuning
is always needed to get an optimal design. Also, because of different design
requirements and applications, the standard form should only be used as an initial
design. Hence, the controller design problem can be transformed into a search
for an optimal set of stability index and equivalent time constant. Hence, a search
technique can be used to find a set of stability indices and equivalent time constant
which can meet the specifications and minimize an objective function. This turns
the design problem into a multi-objective optimization problem [13, 14]. The
simplex algorithm in the MATLAB Optimization toolbox has been used for this
kind of search.</p>

        <title>5.2. COMMAND SIGNAL GENERATION MODULE</title>
        <p>This is a module to design a command signal. It is important to design an
optimal command signal which can satisfy the requirements in the application. The
knowledge on designing a command signal is stored in the database/knowledge
base block, and the users can select a satisfactory command signal and its
parameters according to the authors experiences or previous design results.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions A control system design environment called CSDA (Control System Design Automation) system has been developed. The CSDA system is very compre</title>
      <p>hensive and is consisted of a requirement interpretation block, a modeling block,
an analysis/design block, a data base/knowledge base block, and a verification
block. Regarding the current status of the package, the major portion of it has been
completed. The main structure of the package has been developed as described
in the paper. There are many different modules in the various blocks of the
system, and they are being completed. The system is being developed in the
MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. In this paper, the analysis/design block has
been described in detail. The main contributions of the system are that:
(a) Powerful control system tools and methodologies are made available to more
engineers. CSDA can help to obtain satisfactory control system design even
by an inexperienced engineer.
(b) The LMI design module was introduced for control parameter calculations.</p>
      <p>This module helps to satisfy multiple design specifications.
(c) The Kessler/Manabe design approach is also available in CSDA. This method
has been found very successful in many industrial applications.</p>
      <p>The CSDA system also has a user-friendly interface developed using GUI in
MATLAB. The effectiveness of the CSDA system for controller design has been
demonstrated with a two-mass model.
The authors would like to express their thanks to Mr. Tobias Ericsson in the Royal
Institute of Technology for his contribution in making up the LMI module.</p>
