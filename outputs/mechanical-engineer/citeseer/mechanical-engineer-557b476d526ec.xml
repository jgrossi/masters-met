				<p>This paper proposes an integrating rapid custom-ization design system which combines various technologies such as Web, knowledge based engineering (KBE), engineering database and Computer Aided Design (CAD) and has been used in elevator design. The whole system is set up on the base of engineering database technology, integrating Product Data Management (PDM), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) etc. It adopts Web technology to enable customers to individually customize products remo tely through the internet. The system also adopts KBE to manage and reuse product design knowledge, while combining the technology of product family modeling and technologies of feature modeling and parametric design, based on the assembly of the CAD system of Unigraphics Solutions Inc., to create a product family case library that achieves intelligent, rapid design customization.</p>

To adapt themselves to strong market competition, manufacturing enterprises have shifted their focus from production to market, the protagonist has changed from the enterprise to the customer, and the goal that enterprises endeavor for is satisfying each customer’s individual demand in all aspects of design, production, sale and services. Tsoi et al. presented a knowledge-based customization system of enterprise applications where the users can generically and speedily customize their enterprise applications through intelligent selection and configuration of components required [1].

In this context, product family modeling includes three views; functional view, technical view and structural view [6]. Product family includes a product platform and a set of related products deriving from the platform, which can satisfy different customers’ requirements. The product platform that usually has a relatively stable structure is the basis of the product family. It is a set of modules which can be shared and reused by a series of products. An effective product platform is the core of a product family, and it has the common characteristics of all products in a product family. Generalization, modularization, and standardization are the main issues of a product platform. An advanced hierarchy-decomp</context>

The product family case module can be realized by objectoriented technology. Every node is regarded as an object, and a common element node class is defined to represent product, sub-assembly, component and part in different layers. Relative element function class, element structure class, element parameter class and element knowledge rule class are also defined and embedded in the common element node class. Every specific product case is the instance of the node class. The related data of product cases are stored and managed in the engineering database [7]. Using this method, nodes can be composed or decomposed, appended or deleted at any time and in any location in the tree as you need, which reflects not only the dynamic and process-oriented characteristics of product design, but also the hierarchy and modularization of product information. It is helpful to reuse resources, improves the research retrieval efficiency and enhances the system’s maintainability and expandability. 3 Development tools The development tools should have mature technologies, strong functionality, high performance, and ease of use and ability to integration with other </context>

On the one hand, the UDFs encapsulate the knowledge of topology information and specific characteristic of geometry model, on the other hand, the UDFs enable the expression and operation on objects of product model at a higher level by retrieving characteristic parameters and achieving the variant design. Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) technology is fundamentally about reuse of knowledge. It deals with the ability to take advantage of any experience, expertise and other information relevant to each phase of the engineering life cycle of an end user product [8]. Knowledge Fusion (KF) is the kernel module of realizing intelligent design by incorporating knowledge based engineering technology. This module provides an interpreted object-oriented language named Knowledge Fusion language (KFL) that is simple, easy to learn and use. It has been designed to permit an end user to easily add engineering knowledge to the task at hand by creating engineering constraint rules, construct a knowledge library for product design that can express engineering constraints and the corresponding relationship, and can be reused.
