The first successful prosthetic mitral valve replacement was a device implanted by Nina Braunwald at the National Institutes of Health in 1959. This was a homemade device with artificial chordae made of polyurethane. However, it was not until the collaboration of Albert Starr, in Portland, and Lowell Edwards, an engineer in southern California, that the first reliable device for replacement of the mitral valve was produced on a commercial basis. The Starr-Edward ball-and-cage mitral valve, first implanted in 1961 [1], became the “gold standard”, until the late 1960s, when the second and the third generation prosthetic valves began to appear.

So far many studies for the improvement of the design of the mechanical heart valve prosthesis have been reported. Some of them are on the blood flow passing through the leaflet for a single cycle with inelastic artery wall [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Some of them are on the structural strength analysis of the mechanical heart valve leaflet [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. Intrinsically, the design problem of a bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis is characterized by multidisciplinary interactions in which fluid mechanics, rigid body dynamics, and structural mechanics are linked to another. These kinds of multidisciplinary analysis features in the design of the MHV prosthesis were studied very much by using computer-aided engineering systems in the previous studies [28, 29].

Therefore, comprehensive studies are required on the mechanical heart valve leaflet associated with the blood flow for the design of the MHV prosthesis. So far many studies for the improvement of the design of the mechanical heart valve prosthesis have been reported. Some of them are on the blood flow passing through the leaflet for a single cycle with inelastic artery wall [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Some of them are on the structural strength analysis of the mechanical heart valve leaflet [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. Intrinsically, the design problem of a bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis is characterized by multidisciplinary interactions in which fluid mechanics, rigid body dynamics, and structural mechanics are linked to another. These kinds of multidisciplinary analysis features in the design of the MHV prosthesis were studied very much by using computer-aided engineering systems in the previous studies [28, 29].

Since the large deformation occurring in the leaflet is only due to the high blood pressure, only geometric nonlinearity is assumed.

This result is quite reasonable and anticipated because the stress occurring in the leaflet should be proportional to the applied external blood pressure regardless of the analysis type (linear or nonlinear analysis) if the structure does not change itself. The thin leaflets are structurally weak because the stress occurring in the leaflet becomes larger and larger as the leaflet thickness becomes thinner and thinner as shown in Fig. 9(a). This result coincides with the previous studies [28, 29]. The structural strength of a structure is usually decided from the yield criterion (e.g., von Mises yield criterion, Tresca yield criterion, etc.). According to the von Mises yield criterion, if the maximum value of the equivalent stress occurring in the structure exceeds the yield stress of the structure material, the structure begins to yield for the applied external load.

However, these studies could not show clearly the structurally weaker leaflet whose thickness is not suitable for the in vivo use of the MHV prosthesis. These studies showed that the leaflet with analyzed thickness has enough strength to the applied single blood pressure. However, this result is questionable, because the blood pressure is applied to the leaflet surface constantly during the lifetime operation in the human heart. Hence, the fatigue and fracture structural analysis for the leaflet motion may be required for the determination of the structural strength of the valve leaflet [31]. However, equivalently a large blood pressure may be applied to the leaflet surface to determine and compare the structural strength of the leaflet for various leaflet thicknesses. A large deflection is expected to occur inside the leaflet for the high blood pressure and so the nonlinear structural analysis technique is required for the analysis. Thus both linear and nonlinear structural analysis techniques are adopted. The linear and nonlinear structural analyses results are compared to determine the structurally weaker leaflet thickness.
