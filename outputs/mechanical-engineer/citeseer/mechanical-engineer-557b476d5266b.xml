			<abstract>
				<p>Reverse engineering is a common design strategy in industry. It is a term that has come to encompass a large array of engineering and design activities in the literature; however, in its basic form, reverse engineering is simply the process of extracting information about a product from the product itself. Depending on its use, it may or may not be advantageous to utilize a reverse engineering strategy. As with any rational decision, reverse engineering is only favorable when the benefits from its use outweigh the investment. Therefore, a general understanding of the principles that increase the difficulty or investment required to reverse engineer mechanical products would be helpful for everyone affected by reverse engineering activities. In this paper, we articulate and explore these fundamental principles after reviewing examples from the literature and from our own experience. We then use the principles as a basis for the development of a methodology to build barriers to reverse engineering into new products.</p>

In Sect. 4, we introduce a barrier implementation methodology to assist original designers in creating products that are more difficult to reverse engineer. Finally, in Sec. 6, we provide concluding remarks. 2 Barriers in the reverse engineering process The general procedure of reverse engineering has been defined and examined in detail by both Ingle (1994) and Otto and Wood (2001). Additional techniques for digitizing physical objects for CAD applications have been presented by Varady (2001), Sarkar and Menq (1991), and Raja (2008). Though there exist multiple descriptions of the reverse engineering process, they can all be distilled to three simple steps as seen in Fig. 1. The three basic reverse engineering steps are: (i) planning, (ii) data collection, and (iii) data processing. As Fig. 1 suggests, the process can be iterative in nature. During data processing, for example, the reverse engineering team must validate extracted information, so as to know when the process is complete. If errors are discovered, due to missing or low quality data, the reverse engineering team must extract more information from the product</context>

The method used to quantify K; F, and P, does not matter so long as accuracy is ensured. The accuracy of the reverse engineering estimations of T, and B, are dependent upon the accuracy of K; F, and P. Numerous papers from the literature discuss how to reverse engineer geometric features utilizing CAD systems (Varady and Facello 2005; Stamati and Fudos 2007; Li et al. 2010. Toledo et al. (2008) present an efficient method by which geometric information may be determined, even from complicated systems, in an effort to determine original geometric data. Varady et al. (2007) present an automated approach to create CAD representations of structures that are accurate, capture design intent, and require little or no user assistance. Many of these methods may be used directly to estimate the quantity of geometric information, Kg, contained by a product.
