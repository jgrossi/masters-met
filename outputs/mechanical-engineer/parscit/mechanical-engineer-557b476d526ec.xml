consumers), the relationship between enterprises and the
customer is not exclusively that of business, but more personalized with customers increasingly participating in the whole
process of product design. To adapt themselves to strong
market competition, manufacturing enterprises have shifted
their focus from production to market, the protagonist has
changed from the enterprise to the customer, and the goal that
enterprises endeavor for is satisfying each customer’s individual demand in all aspects of design, production, sale and
services. Tsoi et al. presented a knowledge-based customization system of enterprise applications where the users can
generically and speedily customize their enterprise applications through intelligent selection and configuration of
components required [1]. Jian et al. studied the method of
constraint-based product family design. Building blocks are
regarded as basic product units which have a certain function
and structure. Constraints and configuration rules are
retrieved from building blocks. The building blocks and their
constraints can be reused for product customization and variations in design [2]. Zhao et al. proposed a methodology for
engineering design based on knowledge based engineering
(KBE), and the tools and methods for knowledge processing
are classified by geometry-relativity with design knowledge
[3]. Gzara et al. presented a product information system
setting up product models rapidly by reuse of patterns, and
two kinds of patterns are distinguished; business patterns
and software patterns [4]. Dr. Craig Chapman of Warwick
Manufacturing Group pointed out that in 2010, the importance of KBE to enterprises will be the same as that of Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Engineering/Computer
Aided Manufaturing (CAD/CAE/CAM) to manufacturing
industry in the 1990’s. For the purpose of adapting to volatile
market competition, implementing rapid response engineering strategy to develop new products speedily [5], taking full
advantage of an enterprise’s existing resources, implementing
knowledge reuse and intelligent design process, this paper
presents an approach on intelligent, rapid product design
that integrates KBE and Web technologies, product family
modeling, engineering database, feature based parametric
design of traditional CAD/CAE/CAM systems, creating a
product family case memory series, and realizes an Elevator

Product modeling design
Functional requirement, technical principle, and physical
realization are the main aspects of product design. In this
context, product family modeling includes three views;
functional view, technical view and structural view [6]. Product family includes a product platform and a set of related
products deriving from the platform, which can satisfy
different customers’ requirements. The product platform that
usually has a relatively stable structure is the basis of the
product family. It is a set of modules which can be shared and
reused by a series of products. An effective product platform
is the core of a product family, and it has the common characteristics of all products in a product family. Generalization,
modularization, and standardization are the main issues of a
product platform. An advanced hierarchy-decomposition tree
is used to establish the product family model representing
product case and its related knowledge in this paper.
The common model of product family case is shown in
Fig. 1. It is expressed by the hierarchy-decomposition tree. In
the present case tree, every node that is expressed by object
has a common structure, and it stands for elements of products at all levels, such as product, sub-assembly, component
and part etc. The AND node that can be divided is called a
composition tree. Its child nodes are AND relations. Father
node and child nodes are combination (a-part-of) relations;
the OR node that can be selected is called an optional tree. Its
child nodes are OR relations. Anyone of the child nodes can
be substituted by another, but only one node can be selected.
Father node and child nodes are an optional (a-kind-of)
relation. Moreover, we prescribe that if one optional child
node needs to be divided, it still can be re-divided into
sub-nodes further as a father node of the lower composition
nodes, as shown in the lowest level of Fig. 1.
It can be seen from the product family structure model
that the hierarchy-decomposition tree has the following
advantages in expressing product family case structure: 1) it
can express the product function and structure configuration
easily and exactly for design customization; 2) it has characteristics of generalization and modularization; it is especially
suitable for realizing general design and modular design
of products in mechanical field. For the nodes of different
products in the same level, which have the same functions and
structures, they may be extracted out and built as common
modules; and 3) it can accomplish design standardization and
series.
So customers and designers can do customization and
variant design through function and structure nodes of different levels in the product family case tree to achieve the design
that is characterized by product knowledge re-use and rapid
response.
The product family case module can be realized by objectoriented technology. Every node is regarded as an object, and
a common element node class is defined to represent product,
sub-assembly, component and part in different layers. Relative element function class, element structure class, element
parameter class and element knowledge rule class are also
defined and embedded in the common element node class.
Every specific product case is the instance of the node class.
The related data of product cases are stored and managed in
the engineering database [7]. Using this method, nodes can be
composed or decomposed, appended or deleted at any time
and in any location in the tree as you need, which reflects
not only the dynamic and process-oriented characteristics of
product design, but also the hierarchy and modularization
of product information. It is helpful to reuse resources,
improves the research retrieval efficiency and enhances the
system’s maintainability and expandability.

C++ 6.0 development tool, SQL Server 2000 database
management system, Internet Information Server (IIS), Web
server software, the Active Server Page (ASP) script, and
Java Script as assistant tools to handle Web page and optimize
user interface. Meanwhile, it also integrates the related
modules of Unigraphics (UG) CAD/CAM software. The
related modules of UG are introduced as follows.
The User defined features (UDFs) of UG solid modeling
module allows one to create one’s own form features module
as reused design elements. The UDFs can be stored to
construct a library of user defined features tailored to your
needs. The expressions, constraints and characteristic parameters of UDFs can be created in the meantime. On the one
hand, the UDFs encapsulate the knowledge of topology
information and specific characteristic of geometry model, on
the other hand, the UDFs enable the expression and operation
on objects of product model at a higher level by retrieving
characteristic parameters and achieving the variant design.
Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) technology is
fundamentally about reuse of knowledge. It deals with the
ability to take advantage of any experience, expertise and
other information relevant to each phase of the engineering
life cycle of an end user product [8]. Knowledge Fusion (KF)
is the kernel module of realizing intelligent design by
incorporating knowledge based engineering technology. This
module provides an interpreted object-oriented language
named Knowledge Fusion language (KFL) that is simple,
easy to learn and use. It has been designed to permit an end
user to easily add engineering knowledge to the task at hand
by creating engineering constraint rules, construct a knowledge library for product design that can express engineering
constraints and the corresponding relationship, and can be
reused. It breaks through the restriction of representing
product design knowledge merely by geometry model, and
realizes the intelligent design. The KFL has also the capability to access external knowledge sources, such as databases or
spreadsheets, and to interface to other applications such as
analysis or optimization packages.
UG/Open C++, UG/Open API, MenuScript and UIStyler
are advanced programming tool packages which provide
extensive and flexible circumstances for second development
in UG to establish special application program inside the
platform of UG. Their functions include: the visual editor for
constructing menus and dialog forms of UG style and the
program interface; it uses many of the current program
languages, such as C, C++, and Java, and provides programming interface of calling UG resources directly. This interface
is a truly object-oriented interface using C++ language,
which has all the object-oriented advantages, for example,
inheritance, encapsulation, and Polymorphism.

For the related knowledge of the node objects in the product
family case tree, we classify them as three layers: product
geometry layer, product rule layer and product data layer. The
product geometry layer is used to express geometry information of 3D solid model and 2D drawings; the product rule
layer is used to express engineering rules of design criteria,
experience formulae, distinguish conditions; the product data
layer is used to express design requirements, part parameters,
material specifications PDM data, Bill of Materials (BOM)

Product database is the bottom module and the base of all
modules in the system. The product database is to store all
kinds of product data used to define, design, manufacture,
maintain product and support product data share, transmission for all other sub-systems or function modules. The
product database has open interface to other systems such
as CAD/CAM, PDM, Manufacturing Resource Planning
(MRP II), and ERP, realizing data integration in a logical
united database environment.
The product family knowledge library mainly includes
product case library and rule library. In the knowledge library,
we set up the product design knowledge organization unit
according to the product family structure and provide a
product knowledge library management tool, combined with
Unigraphics CAD/CAM system, complete with the final
product design.
The Web customization management system is a webbased order system using browser/server structure. Customers can browse existing products and customize products
remotely over the internet.
Meanwhile, traditional CAD/CAE/CAM system (UG) is
integrated into this system to perform the subsequent
CAD detailed design and other tasks. The whole system is
controlled by an integrating environmental interface developed by UG/Open and C++ programming. Other sub-systems
have open interfaces to the integrating environment, so they
can be seamlessly connected to the system and the system
will then be easily extended in the future.

Through collecting, analyzing and inducing information
of structures and assemblies of existing products in the
enterprise according to whole product life cycle, the design
knowledge of product parts, components and assemblies are
extracted and classified. The model of the product family case
design expressed by hierarchy-decomposition tree is created
according to the method of product family design. Through
the UDF and UG solid modeling module, design parts, components, subassemblies, decide on expression constraints,
retrieve feature design parameters, and then create model
library supporting parametrical design. Through KF module
create the KF rule class package related to the model, including design constraints, assembly relations, experience formulae, selection rules of feature parameters, configuration rules
of components and parts, and organize them into the rule
library. Extract feature parameters from models, and create
respectively case database. According to existing product
series in the enterprise, design typical case template and case
index mechanism, and create product family case library.
Create knowledge library management system. It can modify,
add or delete cases and rules. Create Web customization
management system, adopting Browser/Server structure [9].
The system mainly includes customer information management, product information management, and order information management. The customer management includes
customer register, customer information modification etc.
Product information management includes new product

Applicable example
Firstly, the customer browses the typical product series over
the internet, selects type number, and specifies the main
parameters for customization. Refer to the customization
flow chart in Fig. 3, for example. The customizing parameters
are as follows: the selected Product Model No. is HSET9703,
the car’s total width A is 1 500 mm, total depth B is 1 400 mm,
the air draft style is middle air draft, the ceiling’s cut angle
mode adopts right cut angle, the side length of the cut angle R
is 150 mm, and the cut angle b is 45°. After the completion of
customization, the order list is stored in the database. Next,
the designers retrieve this order list through the system.
According to the similarity criteria, same or similar cases are
searched and retrieved. If matching cases are found, the best
cases are selected and modified for detail variant design to
conform to the new product’s specifications. On the contrary,
if no matching case is found, then an entirely new design
is made. Finally, after finishing the design, the product’s
structure and performance should be assessed. According to
the assessment, if the design satisfies the design requirements,
the design result will be stored in the case library as a new
case; otherwise, the system will return to the phase of detail
design and start a redesign. Figure 4 shows the assemblies of
HSET9703 elevator ceiling generated by the EIRCDS.
Fig. 3 The flow chart of design customization
In the system developed for this study, the design of an
elevator car is divided into design tasks of ceiling, door, wall,
platform, railing etc. Customers mainly present the product’s
contour size, installation structure and decoration configuration as per demand. The main customization demand includes:
1) size customization: the car’s contour sizes are decided by
the building’s well way, resulting in variation of parameters
to other relative parts, according to engineering rules and
experience. The car’s main contour size is: total width A and
total depth B; 2) function selection: the different functions

The product platform that usually has a relatively stable structure is the basis of the product family. It is a set of modules which can be shared and reused by a series of products. An effective product platform is the core of a product family, and it has the common characteristics of all products in a product family. Generalization, modularization, and standardization are the main issues of a product platform. An advanced hierarchy-decomp</context>

The product family case module can be realized by objectoriented technology. Every node is regarded as an object, and a common element node class is defined to represent product, sub-assembly, component and part in different layers. Relative element function class, element structure class, element parameter class and element knowledge rule class are also defined and embedded in the common element node class. Every specific product case is the instance of the node class. The related data of product cases are stored and managed in the engineering database [7]. Using this method, nodes can be composed or decomposed, appended or deleted at any time and in any location in the tree as you need, which reflects not only the dynamic and process-oriented characteristics of product design, but also the hierarchy and modularization of product information. It is helpful to reuse resources, improves the research retrieval efficiency and enhances the system’s maintainability and expandability. 3 Development tools The development tools should have mature technologies, strong functionality, high performance, and ease of use and ability to integration with other </context>

On the one hand, the UDFs encapsulate the knowledge of topology information and specific characteristic of geometry model, on the other hand, the UDFs enable the expression and operation on objects of product model at a higher level by retrieving characteristic parameters and achieving the variant design. Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) technology is fundamentally about reuse of knowledge. It deals with the ability to take advantage of any experience, expertise and other information relevant to each phase of the engineering life cycle of an end user product [8]. Knowledge Fusion (KF) is the kernel module of realizing intelligent design by incorporating knowledge based engineering technology. This module provides an interpreted object-oriented language named Knowledge Fusion language (KFL) that is simple, easy to learn and use. It has been designed to permit an end user to easily add engineering knowledge to the task at hand by creating engineering constraint rules, construct a knowledge library for product design that can express engineering constraints and the corresponding relationship, and can be reused. It breaks through the restriction of repre</context>
