Abstract: Innovation is a process of taking an original idea and converting it into a business value, in which the engineers face some
inventive problems which can be solved hardly by experience. TRIZ, as a new theory for companies in China, provides both conceptual
and procedural knowledge for finding and solving inventive problems. Because the government plays a leading role in the diffusion of
TRIZ, too many companies from different industries are waiting to be trained, but the quantity of the trainers mastering TRIZ is
incompatible with that requirement. In this context, to improve the training effect, an interactive training model of TRIZ for the
mechanical engineers in China is developed and the implementation in the form of training classes is carried out. The training process is
divided into 6 phases as follows: selecting engineers, training stage-1, finding problems, training stage-2, finding solutions and summing
up. The government, TRIZ institutions and companies to join the programs interact during the process. The government initiates and
monitors a project in form of a training class of TRIZ and selects companies to join the programs. Each selected companies choose a few
engineers to join the class and supervises the training result. The TRIZ institutions design the training courses and carry out training
curriculum. With the beginning of the class, an effective communication channel is established by means of interview, discussion face to
face, E-mail, QQ and so on. After two years training practices, the results show that innovative abilities of the engineers to join and pass
the final examinations increased distinctly, and most of companies joined the training class have taken congnizance of the power of
TRIZ for product innovation. This research proposes an interactive training model of TRIZ for mechanical engineers in China to
expedite the knowledge diffusion of TRIZ.

Introduction
Innovation is essential for the success and competitive
advantage of organizations or companies, as well as for
strong economies in the 21st century[1]. The innovation for
the organizations in China, such as in the manufacturing
industry, is also a fundamental choice for the further
development[2]. Researchers in China[3–5] also show that the
key factor to enhance the competitiveness for industries lies
in the improvement of capability of innovation. Many
manufacturing companies in China now have to pay more
attention to innovation than ever before.
There are nine factors influencing an organization’s
ability to innovation[6]. One of them is employees. This
factor takes into account the various personal characteristics
associated with employees and the motivation of employees
to become innovative. There are five categories of inventors

related to the innovation process[7], and they are
entrepreneurs with technology, industry-specific inventors,
professional inventors, grantsmen, and inveterate inventors.
If a part of employees are inventors, such as industryspecific inventors, the innovative ability of a company will
increase.
One of objectives of National Technological Innovation
Method and Tool Engineering Research Center is to carry
out a program to train many engineers for various industries,
and make them to become innovative engineers. But there
is no definition for an innovative engineer in China. In
order to push the training program forward, a clear
description of the functions for this kind of engineers is
needed. We define that an innovative engineer is an
industry-specific inventor, who creates specific technical
improvements for product designs or processes in which he
or she works in, usually for several years. Most of the
improvements are incremental innovations, but a few are
radical innovations.
The training program should include many training
classes. A training class should follow a process. The paper
shows the generation of the process, which is called an
interactive training model of TRIZ. The model is especially

Innovation is a process of taking an original idea and
converting it into a business value. The entire innovation
process is divided into three stages: fuzzy front end(FFE),
new product development(NPD), and commercialization[8].
The fuzzy front end is considered the first stage of the
innovation process and covers the sub-processes from the

generation, idea selection, and concept definition[8]. The
outputs of FFE are the ideas evaluated and the input of
NPD. In the NPD stage, the ideas from FFE are
transformed into products. There are two sub-processes in
NPD, design and manufacturing. In the design process there
are four sub-processes, design specification, conceptual
design, embodiment design, and detailed design[9]. In the
manufacturing process, the first is the process design and
then manufacturing. The commercialization is the last stage,
in which the products are put into the markets.
The engineers in a company always face some problems,
which appear in the innovation process. The problems
should be abstracted and solved. After that the solutions are
returned to the process. Fig. 1 shows the relations between
the problems and their solutions in an innovation process.
Innovation process with the problems and solutions
A problem can be defined as the gap between the present
and some desired state of affairs[10]. There are two types of
problems which are routine and inventive problems in
engineering by the definition of TRIZ[11]. If all the critical
steps from a problem to its solution are known, the problem
is a routine one. If at least one critical step to the solution as
well as the solution itself is unknown the problem is an
inventive problem.
So called creativity enhancing techniques or idea
generation techniques are used to solve problems[12]. There
are many creativity enhancing techniques in literatures. For
example, SMITH[13] carried out an extensive analysis of
172 techniques. Brainstorming, method 635, and synectics
are examples of this kind of techniques. The techniques do
assist many problem solvers or inventors to solve problems,
but they are not always successful because the creative
capacities of problem solvers have reached their limits in
finding novelties, especially when the artifacts are complex,
since the value of engineering-like concepts and
brainstorming-derived practices have been introduced[14]. If
they are useful, problem solvers may not be able to generate
ideas without the proper experience[15]. The hope of solving
this kind of problems appeared in the application of TRIZ,
which is theory of inventive problem solving(TRIZ)
developed in the former USSR. Some indication of its
success can be derived from inquiries within the German
industry classifying TRIZ as an effective approach to
problem solving, and indicating a ‘‘rather high’’ to ‘‘very
high’’ economic benefit obtained from using TRIZ for 57%
of companies[16].
TRIZ aims to create an algorithmic approach applying
inventive knowledge abstracted from patent bases all over
the world to solve inventive problems. TRIZ is a
methodology, a tool set, a knowledge base, and a
model-based technology for generating innovative ideas
and solutions for solving inventive problems. The toolkits
in TRIZ are problem formulation, system analysis, failure
analysis, patterns of system evolution, inventive principles,
standard solutions and ARIZ et al. All these assist inventors
to solve inventive problems quickly and efficiently.
Fig. 2 shows all the problems and their solving
techniques. When an obstacle appears in the innovation
process, a problem can be identified, which is a routine or
an inventive one. If it is a routine problem, a creativity
enhancing technique or common techniques is selected to

types of knowledge, which are conceptual and procedural
knowledge. Conceptual knowledge is usually viewed as
general and abstract knowledge of the core principles and
their interrelations in a domain. Procedural knowledge, in
contrast, is usually seen as knowledge of operators and the
conditions under which they can be applied to reach certain
goals[17–18].
In TRIZ, all the knowledge is also divided into
conceptual and procedural types. The basic concepts, such
as ideality, levels of inventions and resources, are
conceptual knowledge. To solve an inventive problem, both
conceptual and procedural knowledge is needed. 39
Engineering parameters, 40 inventive principles, 76
standard solutions, a list of effects, and law of technological
system evolution are applied to solve inventive problems,
which are all conceptual knowledge. The processes for
solving a problem, such as ARIZ, are procedural
knowledge. Table 1 shows the main conceptual and
procedural knowledge in TRIZ.

<bodyText confidence="0.99222516">
New knowledge for solving inventive problems is an
important factor to increase the competitive advantage of
engineers. The knowledge enables them to enhance their
effective activities which drive superior performances. In
turn the superior performances support engineers to create
new ideas and new technologies.
For the engineers working in enterprise in China the
conceptual and procedural knowledge in TRIZ are new for
them. If they can understand and apply TRIZ, they may
make new representations about the problems faced in an
innovation process. The new presentations about problems
mean different representations from these which are used
by their experiences. For example, a problem may be
described as a contradiction by the conceptual knowledge
in TRIZ. But there is no the concept of contradiction for
describing design or process by their experiences. For a
contradiction a 12-step sequential algorithm is used to solve
it. 39 engineering parameters, 40 inventive principles,
contradiction matrix in some steps are used. The difficulty
to solve the problem is reduced. The process of solving a
contradiction also shows that the conceptual and procedural
knowledge in TRIZ are applied together.
Fig. 3 shows a general process which from identifying a
problem to solving it for an engineer. The problematic
activity implies that some problem is existed. First,

TRIZ is all new to the engineers. If the engineers do
understand TRIZ and can apply freely, they perform in
higher quality than before in the process of finding and
solving problems.
Inventive problem solving process for engineers
Design of a Training Model
The TRIZ training process for organizations has been
studied for years. RANTANEN, et al[28], developed a
flowchart or a model for TRIZ training for an organization.
JUN, et al[29], also developed a flowchart for Samsung
TRIZ implementation. These flowcharts show that the
TRIZ experts outside the organization should carry out
TRIZ pilot project to show that TRIZ is powerful for
innovation in a company. This process is not suitable for
the situations in China.
We have no time to carry out a pilot project for a
company to test TRIZ because the local governments push
many companies to join a training class at the same time.
Before the beginning of the training program, most of the
companies do not know what TRIZ is. They only know that
the program will train some engineers and to increase the
innovative abilities of these persons. It should be a good
thing for the companies themselves too.
In order to increase the effectiveness of the application of
TRIZ, high quality should be assured for any training class.
The object of the program is to train “innovative engineers”
for the companies. We have the freedom to make a plan,
and to select education processes and courses. All the
trainers are from our institution, or we may invite trainers
from all over the world. But a new training process model
is needed for successful training programs, which is
different from the following[28–29]:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998673111111111">
(1) The companies to join the training program are
selected by local governments.
(2) The local governments pay more attention to the
training results, such as the attitudes of the engineers to join
the program, the patents applied from the classes.
(3) The evaluation made by companies which join the
program in the middle or after the finish of a training
process.
(4) The impressions of the classes on the companies

<bodyText confidence="0.951662866666666">
which do not join the program at first.
Fig. 4 is the TRIZ training model developed form a class
after two years training practices. There are six phases in
this process, from selecting engineers of the companies to
summing-up. The process lasts six to twelve months. The
governments, TRIZ institutions and companies to join the
programs will be interacted during the process.
In Fig. 4, an innovation process model with a fuzzy front
end is integrated. The inventive problems which the
engineers face in companies are always found in fuzzy front
ends, conceptual designs or manufacturing processes[30].
The solutions will return to these stages and will push
innovative activities forward in the companies.
The following is the work to be done in every phase in
the TRIZ based interactive training model.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.969257">
Phase 1: Selecting engineers
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992062818181818">
The local governments are responsible for selecting
companies to join the program. The companies selected
recommend the engineers to be trained. The numbers for
one training class are limited. The recommended age range
of the engineers is 30–50 years old. They should have been
responsible for some designs of products or manufacturing
processes and do have had some experience. The engineers
selected may not know TRIZ beforehand but their
experiences is an important factor in understanding the
general meanings of TRIZ and applying them in innovative
activities in short time.

The Innovation Method Society supported by the central
government of China, and the local governments together
push the training program in order to increase the
innovative abilities of the engineers in industries. The
National Technological Innovation Method and Tool
Engineering Research Center is one of major training
organizations. From 2008 to now, it has completed training
processes for twenty classes in China, and some of them are
shown in Table 2.
At first, an organizer selects the engineers from different
companies of a local region, for example Hebei Province or
Guangdong Province. Then they spend more than six
months to carry out the training process according to the
model shown in Fig. 4. Some selected engineers may not
follow the process and drop out from the class. In the end,
some engineers as the final engineers join the final oral
examinations, which number less than the originally
selected. The final engineers who pass the examination are
certificated as “Innovative Engineers”, level 1 or level 2.
There are three conditions which should be satisfied for
the engineers entering the final phase and passing the
examination. They are as follows: 1) Having found an
inventive problem from the innovation process of their
company; 2) Having solved the problem and had a good
solution; 3) Having made a credible presentation using PPT.
If they have found and solved an important problem or
sent an application for an inventive patent, they will be
certified as “Inventive Engineer”-level 2. Others are
certificate as level 1.

GD-1 was the first training class organized by
Guangdong Science and Technology Department in
Guangdong province, which is the organization of local
government for the development of sciences and
technologies. Seventy-five engineers were selected from
nineteen companies, including BYD, BROAD-OCEAN
and GAC, etc, were trained. Fifty-two passed the final
examination. Thirty of them were certificated as inventive
engineers level 2, and the others were level 1. All the
engineers found fifty-four inventive problems from the
innovative processes of seventeen different companies and
solved them at last. According to incomplete statistics
thirty-six patent applications, twenty-two patents for
inventions and fourteen patents for utility models have
been sent to SIPO(State Intellectual Property Office of the
PRC) and all application numbers have been got.
There are two engineers in the class from Broad-Ocean,
which is a company that produces micro-motors, located in
Zhongshan, Guangdong Province. One engineer developed
three new concepts for the structure of a traditional
micro-motor and applied five patents to SIPO. The function
analysis-standard solutions of TRIZ were used in his work.
Up to now, three new designs have been finished and the
new process design is being carried out. The cost for a new
product will be lowered by 1.98 RMB, and the efficiency
for manufacturing will increase to 13.2%. The new
products have been put into the Chinese market in 2012.
There were four engineers that joined the class from
Shengyi, which is a company located in Dongguan,
Guangdong Province. FR-4, CEM-1, CEM-3 and Prepreg
are currently the products in this company. Every engineer
found and solved at least one inventive problem of design
or process and sent applications for patents for inventions
and utility models. The new products based on the patents
applied have been put into markets. TRIZ has become an
efficient tool to help engineers make innovation in their
company.
Most of the engineers who joined the class did achieve
good results. Some of them have solved the problems that
had not been solved in their company for a long time. Their
ability to find problems in the design or process phase of a
product and to solve them efficiently increased. Some of
them have made presentations about basic principles of
TRIZ to their colleagues to form a circumstance for study
and apply TRIZ in their company.

At first, the engineer should study the situation for
improving as shown in Fig. 5. The headstock and tailstock
in a CRH are not changed for both running directions. The
headstock in one running direction is the tailstock in
reverse direction. The distribution of airflow on the surface
of headstock and tailstock are different, the air resistance
on the train mainly is pressure drag which rests with the
shapes of headstock and tailstock. Because the shape is
designed symmetrical so that the headstock and tailstock
can be interchanged, the drag reduction can not reach the
limit. Big drag will result in electrical energy lose. Drag

5.3.2 Inventive problem
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987104684210526">
To most of mechanical engineers, this problem is a
parameter optimization problem that the shape of headstock
(also is tailstock) should be optimized, and the
solution should be a trade-off to obtain a shape both for
headstock and tailstock in order to obtain the minimum
pressure drag.
The new design faces the problem: the drag should be
reduced further but this will change the structure for both
the headstock and tailstock. The change should be
controlled. This is an inventive problem.
5.3.3 Solving the inventive problem
Fig. 6 shows the process to solve the problem. The
engineer finds two parameters in the matrix of TRIZ, which
present the inventive problem well. Four inventive
principles are found, which are Transformation properties
(No. 35), Asymmetry(No. 4), Dynamics(No. 15) and Prior
action(No. 10). Also several cases using these principles
are identified for the analogous application.
Fig. 6. Process to solve the contradiction using TRIZ
In general speaking the principles and the cases selected
are specific TRIZ solutions for the problem. The designer
should transform them into domain solutions. In this
process the knowledge of design for high speed trains,
especially the headstocks and tailstocks, and the specific
TRIZ solutions are both important. From the specific TRIZ
solutions the engineer could find unexpected discoveries
(UXDs) [31] for triggering him or her to generate new ideas
for domain solutions.
In this case, No. 4 and No. 15 are used to produce new
concepts for solving the problem. For example, the shape
of the headstock and the tailstock should not be same
according to the principle No. 4 for reducing the drag, and
the shapes should be changed into each other when the
headstock and the tailstock interchange according to the
principle No. 15. So in one direction the headstock has a
specific shape and the tailstock has different shape for
reducing drag. When the train stops for reverse direction,
both the headstock and the tailstock interchanged rapidly.

case has been authorized by enterprise, Courtesy of
Tangshan Railway Vehicle Co., LTD, China). Using TRIZ
the designer could produce many possible solutions for the
problem. After evaluation a few are selected as accepted
solutions. Computer simulation and testing should be
carried out for selecting final solutions.
Fig. 7.
Improved CRH with new structured headstock
and tailstock
In Fig. 7, the headstock is shorter than the tailstock when
the train runs from right to left direction. When changing
direction the tailstock should be shortened and the
headstock should be elongated. The changing processes are
controlled easily.

TRIZ without a lot of difficult. But the training process is
not easy for every engineer to try to follow. Perseverance is
necessary for every engineer if they want to succeed.
(2) It is difficult for some of the engineers to find and
solve the first inventive problem from the innovation
process of their company. That the concept of an inventive
problem applied to a real situation is not easy at first.
(3) The trainers are needed to help one third of the
engineers to find or solve the first inventive problem. The
trainers as tutors of the engineers should always keep
relations with them through different ways, such as e-mail,
QQ, face to face, or telephone.

<listItem confidence="0.605885">
(4) After finding and solving the first inventive problem,

<bodyText confidence="0.9955975">
the engineers are eager to study in depth and to apply the
TRIZ to find and solve other inventive problems. The
creative ability is increased for most of the engineers after
joining the final oral examination.
(5) Some companies are organizing the engineers who
joined one of our classes to train other engineers of their
company, such as Broad-Ocean. The company is managing
to improve their ability for future innovation by applying
TRIZ in a systematic manner. This should be followed by
more and more companies in China.

Conclusions
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.946329766666667">
(1) The inventive problems in an innovation process of a
company are always faced in fuzzy front ends, conceptual
designs and manufacturing processes. TRIZ is a systematic
method to solve these kinds of problems. The urgent need
is to push the mechanical engineers of companies in China
to study and apply TRIZ to solve inventive problems that
exist in their working environment.
(2) Training is a choice to push the application forward.
An interactive model for training TRIZ is developed,
which is suitable not only for several companies at same
time in a region but also for one company. The activities in
this model have tight relationships with the activities in the
innovation processes of the companies. The engineers who
join the training class have to find and solve the inventive
problems of their own companies.
(3) The implementation of the model is carried out as a
program, in which there are twenty classes in different
provinces of China. The organizers are the Science and
Technology Department of local governments. Most of the
engineers who have passed the final oral examinations
have sent patent applications to SIPO. Some engineers
have developed new products for their companies. The
innovative ability for all the engineers to join the program
is increased to a degree. The organizers are satisfied with
the results.
The next step is to make more training classes in the
interactive model developed for different regions available,
to meet the increasing needs of manufacturing companies
in China.
