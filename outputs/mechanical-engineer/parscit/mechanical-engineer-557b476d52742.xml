Structural analysis, especially the thickness effect on the structural strength, of a bileaflet mechanical heart valve
prosthesis with curved leaflets is presented in this paper. Taking the wide variations of the blood flow pressure on the
leaflet surface, the structural stresses inside the leaflet and deflections of the leaflet are investigated by adopting both
linear and nonlinear structural analysis techniques for more accurate results comparison. The thickness of the curved
leaflet also varies considerably from 0.50 mm to 0.75 mm by 0.05 mm. These are very useful for the design of the mechanical heart valve (MHV) prosthesis. Linear and nonlinear structural mechanic analyses for the leaflet of the MHV
prosthesis are conducted to predict the structural strength variation of the leaflet as the leaflet thickness changes. Analysis results show that the structural strength of the leaflet decreases as the leaflet thickness becomes thinner and thinner,
and the nonlinear structural behaviors of thin leaflets are very conspicuous for large applied blood pressures. Hence,
these thin leaflets are not desirable for the in vivo use of the MHV prosthesis.

The structural analysis required in the structural design of a bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis is
presented in this paper. In particular, this paper discusses the thickness effects on the structural strength
of a bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis with
curved leaflets for the design of the mechanical heart
valve (MHV) prosthesis.
There are four different cardiac valves in the human heart: tricuspid valve, mitral valve, pulmonary
valve, and aortic valve. The function of these cardiac
valves is to regulate the biologic blood flow and to
avoid the regurgitation of blood. Congenital or ac†This paper was recommended for publication in revised form by Associate

quired diseases like rheumatic fever etc. may cause
the valve stenosis and the regurgitation of blood.
These diseased and nonrepairable cardiac valves, e.g.,
aortic or mitral valve, should be excised and replaced
by an artificial device. This artificial device is called a
prosthetic heart valve. The first successful prosthetic
mitral valve replacement was a device implanted by
Nina Braunwald at the National Institutes of Health in
1959. This was a homemade device with artificial
chordae made of polyurethane. However, it was not
until the collaboration of Albert Starr, in Portland, and
Lowell Edwards, an engineer in southern California,
that the first reliable device for replacement of the
mitral valve was produced on a commercial basis.
The Starr-Edward ball-and-cage mitral valve, first
implanted in 1961 [1], became the “gold standard”,
until the late 1960s, when the second and the third
generation prosthetic valves began to appear. After
the Starr-Edward ball-and-cage valve, the monoleaflet
Y. J. Kwon / Journal of Mechanical Science and Technology 22 (2008) 2038~2047
valves like Björk-Shilley Monostrut mechanical prosthetic valve [2], Sorin Allcarbon mechanical prosthetic valve, Medtronic Hall mechanical prosthetic
valve, and Omnicarbon mechanical prosthetic valve,
appeared throughout the 1960s and the 1970s. The
third generation prosthetic valve was developed in the
late 1970s and became the valve of the 1980s [3].
This was the bileaflet St. Jude Medical valve. Leaflet
opening was more complete, the hemodynamics was
improved, and the incidence of thromboembolism
was reduced. Nowadays, bileaflet mechanical heart
valves are the most commonly implanted prosthetic
heart valves like the St. Jude Medical bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis, the Edwards MIRA
bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis, and the
On-X® bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis.
Even though these bileaflet mechanical heart valve
prostheses are widely used for heart valve disease,
they still have many problems when they are implanted and replace the diseased cardiac aortic or
mitral valves of the human heart [4-6]. When the
bileaflet mechanical heart valves are fully open and
closed, high velocity jets through the gap between the
leaflets can be readily detected both in vivo and in
vitro [7-10]. This valve movement coupled with the
high velocity jets through the leaflets causes elevated
shear stress which may cause red blood cell damage
or platelet activation. Together with high shear stress,
increased coagulation due to blood stagnancy in contact with the artery wall may cause thrombosis and
thromboembolism, which should be avoided for cardiac patients. Moreover, the structural strength of the
valve leaflet may be reduced due to the periodic and
cyclic countless leaflet motions (approximately 38
million cycles per year), the geometric defect owing
to the shape of the leaflet, the inhomogeneous mechanical properties of the leaflet, the cavitation phenomenon [11] due to the blood pressure drop, and the
wear due to the friction between the leaflet and the
blood. These structural problems may cause the
cracking and the fracture of the valve leaflet and
eventually failure of the valve operation leading to the
death of the cardiac patient. Therefore, comprehensive studies are required on the mechanical heart
valve leaflet associated with the blood flow for the
design of the MHV prosthesis. So far many studies
for the improvement of the design of the mechanical
heart valve prosthesis have been reported. Some of
them are on the blood flow passing through the leaflet
for a single cycle with inelastic artery wall [12-21].

Some of them are on the structural strength analysis
of the mechanical heart valve leaflet [22-29]. Intrinsically, the design problem of a bileaflet mechanical
heart valve prosthesis is characterized by multidisciplinary interactions in which fluid mechanics, rigid
body dynamics, and structural mechanics are linked
to another. These kinds of multidisciplinary analysis
features in the design of the MHV prosthesis were
studied very much by using computer-aided engineering systems in the previous studies [28, 29]. These
studies adopted several thickness models of the leaflet
and revealed that the structural strength of the leaflet
was reduced as the leaflet thickness became thinner
and thinner. However, these studies could not show
clearly the structurally weaker leaflet whose thickness
is not suitable for the in vivo use of the MHV prosthesis. These studies showed that the leaflet with analyzed thickness has enough strength to the applied
single blood pressure. However, this result is questionable, because the blood pressure is applied to the
leaflet surface constantly during the lifetime operation
in the human heart. Hence, the fatigue and fracture
structural analysis for the leaflet motion may be required for the determination of the structural strength
of the valve leaflet [31]. However, equivalently a
large blood pressure may be applied to the leaflet
surface to determine and compare the structural
strength of the leaflet for various leaflet thicknesses.
A large deflection is expected to occur inside the leaflet for the high blood pressure and so the nonlinear
structural analysis technique is required for the analysis. Thus both linear and nonlinear structural analysis
techniques are adopted. The linear and nonlinear
structural analyses results are compared to determine
the structurally weaker leaflet thickness.
In the present study, the structural strength of the
leaflet in conjunction with the blood flow pressure
variations is to be investigated by using the numerical
technique, using the commercial finite element code
“NISA”. The bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis with curved leaflet is used for analysis in this
study.
2. Geometry and dimensions of the MHV prosthesis used for the analysis
The mechanical heart valve prosthesis used for the
analysis is the bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis with curved leaflet (Fig. 1). The diameter of the
mechanical heart valve prosthesis available commercially is 22.5 mm (Fig. 1) and the thickness of the

leaflet is 0.65 mm. Hence, the leaflet thickness varies
from 0.50 mm up to 0.75 mm by 0.05 mm, which is
0.1 mm thinner and 0.1 mm thicker than 0.65 mm in
this analysis. The mechanical heart valve prosthesis
features a curved leaflet profile as well as a slim, Carbofilm coated titanium-alloy housing. This combination is intended to optimize hemodynamic performance via a larger orifice, complementing the natural
flow pattern and minimizing turbulence. Designed to
reduce friction and wear, the valve’s rolling hinge
gives a constantly varying point of contact in the
hinge area between the leaflet and the housing. An
open channel in the hinge cavity allows continuous
hinge washing during the entire cardiac cycle. The
mechanical heart valve prosthesis has unique sewing
rings specifically designed for mitral and aortic applications, as well as a special aortic version for very
small annuli. Each sewing ring design enhances the
function of the valve in its position and size, including
the unique hyperbolic shape of the mitral valve and
the downstream extension of the aortic. Two semicircular leaflets open to 80º and the closing angle is 20º
(Fig. 2), resulting in a central, near laminar flow. The
housing stability is increased by a stellite stiffener
ring over the solid pyrolytic valve housing. The pivot
hinge mechanism is located within the housing, and
leaflet motion is by rotation and translation. Curved
leaflets enhance central flow and rapid closure. The
pivot ball and slot mechanism facilitate retrograde
washing by relatively high velocity jets. Leaflets
close on a circular ledge within the housing to reduce
regurgitation and stress on the hinge mechanism. The
pivot ball hinge closes by rotation and translation.
Downstream of the mechanical heart valve is located
the elastic artery wall with sinus. The artery wall is
assumed to be an elastic circular tube with diameter
of 25.0 mm.
The mechanical heart valve consists of three parts:
the leaflet which controls the blood flow, the orifice
ring which supports the leaflets, and the sewing cuff
which attaches and fixes the orifice ring to the tissue
of the heart muscle (Fig. 1). A kinematic model of the
mechanical heart valve consists of three links and
four joints. And the mobility of the valve movement

3. Structural analysis of the bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99242076">
The position of the leaflet where the blood fluid
force applied on the leaflet becomes the maximum
value was computed to be the closing position of the
leaflet through previous studies [28, 29]. Hence, the
structural mechanic analysis of the leaflet is carried
out at the closing position of the leaflet according to
the leaflet thickness variation to get the thickness
effects on the structural strength of the leaflet. A numerical analysis methodology (FEM) is used for the
structural mechanic analysis. The finite element
2041
model for the structural mechanic analysis of the leaflet is shown in Fig. 3(b). The number of element is
72,446, and the number of node is 81,526 (Table 3).
The sewing cuff and the orifice ring are neglected in
the structural analysis, because they do not affect the
analysis results. The orifice ring is assumed as a rigid
body. Three degrees of freedom (ux,uy,uz) are constrained at the hinge point and on the outer surface of
the leaflet which contacts the rigid orifice ring. The
symmetric boundary condition (uz=0) is applied on
the symmetric surface (z=0) of the model (Fig. 4).
Also the symmetric boundary condition (uy=0) is
applied on the symmetric surface (y=0), since both
leaflets contact this symmetric surface (Fig. 4). The
fluid force which is the external force acting on the
leaflet is exerted as normal uniform pressure onto the
leaflet surface (Fig. 4). The material of the leaflet is
assumed to be Si-Alloyed PyC (the yield stress is
407.7 MPa) (Table 4). Young&amp;apos;s modulus, Poisson&amp;apos;s
ratio and the density of the material used are 30.5GPa,
0.3 and 2,116 Kg/m3, respectively (Table 4). The
blood flow pressure applied to the curved leaflet surface is assumed to vary up to a very high value in the
analysis. Actually the maximum value of the single
blood flow pressure applied to the valve leaflet in the
human heart is 120 mmHg (about 16 KPa). The
MHV implanted in the human heart should be operated constantly (approximately 38 million cycles per
year) for life-long time. Hence, a very strong structural strength of the leaflet should be secured for the
safe operation of the MHV prosthesis in the human
heart. This severe condition requires much higher
blood flow pressure than a single blood flow pressure
applied on to the valve leaflet in the structural analysis. Therefore a thorough investigation of the stress
and deflection variations of the curved leaflet according to the high blood flow pressure variation is carried
out in this study by applying a very high blood flow
pressure at which the equivalent stress occurring inside the very thin leaflet (with 0.5 mm thickness) first
exceeds the yield stress (407.7 MPa) of the leaflet
material (see Table 5). A large deformation is also
expected to occur in the leaflet for the applied high
blood pressure to require the nonlinear structural
analysis. Since the large deformation occurring in the
leaflet is only due to the high blood pressure, only
geometric nonlinearity is assumed. Also linear structural analysis is simultaneously performed for comparison. In the previous studies [28, 29] only a linear
structural analysis was carried out for the applied

blood pressure up to 104KPa. The previous studies
[28, 29] revealed the kinetic and kinematic behavior
of the leaflet while the MHV prosthesis was working
in the human heart. According to the previous studies
[28, 29], the structural deformation of the leaflet is
expected at the closing position of the valve where the
maximum reaction force occurs at the hinge. Hence
both the linear and nonlinear structural mechanic
analyses for the curved leaflet are carried out for this
closing position of the valve in the present study.

The structural deformation and stress distribution
results obtained from the structural analysis of the
leaflet are shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, and Fig. 8.
The maximum deflection occurs at the lower central
part of the leaflet (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) and the maximum
stress occurs at the hinge of the leaflet (Part A in Fig.
7 and Fig. 8) for all leaflet thickness. Hence, the geometrically weak part is the hinge part for this curved
bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis, and so a
fracture may possibly occur in this hinge part. This
coincides with the in vivo leaflet fracture observation
made by Klepetko [32]. A large stress also occurs at
the lower sharp corner part of the leaflet end surface
(Part B in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8). Table 5 shows the variations of the mass and the weight of the leaflet and also
the computed equivalent stress variation according to
the leaflet thickness change for the applied blood

pressure of 500 KPa. Fig. 9 shows the maximum
deflection variations and the maximum von Mises
stress variations as the leaflet thickness varies from
the 0.5 mm to 0.75 mm by 0.05 mm and the blood
flow pressure varies up to 500 KPa.
As indicated in Fig. 9(a), the computed stresses do
not show any difference between the linear and the
nonlinear structural analysis results for each leaflet
thickness (i.e., the linearly computed stress and the
nonlinearly computed stress are almost same.) while
the computed stresses increase as the leaflet thickness
becomes thinner and thinner. This result is quite reasonable and anticipated because the stress occurring
in the leaflet should be proportional to the applied
external blood pressure regardless of the analysis type
(linear or nonlinear analysis) if the structure does not
change itself. The thin leaflets are structurally weak
because the stress occurring in the leaflet becomes
larger and larger as the leaflet thickness becomes
thinner and thinner as shown in Fig. 9(a). This result
coincides with the previous studies [28, 29]. The
structural strength of a structure is usually decided
from the yield criterion (e.g., von Mises yield criterion, Tresca yield criterion, etc.). According to the
von Mises yield criterion, if the maximum value of
the equivalent stress occurring in the structure exceeds the yield stress of the structure material, the
structure begins to yield for the applied external load.
From this point of view, Table 5 shows that the 0.5
mm thickness leaflet is expected to begin to yield for
the applied 500 KPa blood pressure because the computed maximum equivalent stress (411.88 MPa) in
the leaflet exceeds the yield stress (407.7 MPa) of the
leaflet material, while other thickness leaflets do not
seem to begin to yield. Table 5 also shows that the
structural strength is not directly proportional to the
leaflet thickness. The structural strength of the leaflet
increases at a higher rate than the leaflet weight (or
thickness), e.g., the structural strength of the 0.65 mm
thickness leaflet is 1.41 (the ratio of the equivalent
stresses of the 0.5 mm thickness leaflet and the 0.65
mm leaflet thickness leaflet) times as large as the
structural strength of the 0.5 mm thickness leaflet
while the weight of the 0.65 mm thickness leaflet is
1.3 times as large as the weight of the 0.5 mm thickness leaflet. From the design point of view, a safety
factor (defined as the ratio of the material yield stress
to the maximum stress occurring in the structure)
value of 2.0 is usually adopted as the design standard
of the structure. According to this standard, the
2043
maximum stress in the leaflet should not exceed the
half value (203.85 MPa) of the yield stress (407.7
MPa) of the leaflet material adopted in this analysis.
Hence, stresses larger than 203.85 MPa in Table 6 are
not desirable for the in vivo use of the leaflet in the
human heart. Table 6 shows that very thin 0.5 mm
and 0.55 mm thickness leaflets are not suitable for
blood pressure greater than 300 KPa, 0.6 mm and
0.65 mm thickness leaflets are not suitable for blood
pressure greater than 350 KPa, 0.7 mm thickness
leaflet is not suitable for blood pressure above 400
KPa, and 0.75 mm thickness leaflet is not suitable for
blood pressure greater than 450 KPa. These results
were not revealed in the previous studies [28, 29]
where the maximum blood pressure applied on to the
leaflet was 104 KPa.
By examining the computed deflections of the leaflet shown in Fig. 9(b), the result is quite different
from the stress results in Fig. 9(a). The computed
deflections of the leaflet increase as the leaflet thickness becomes thinner and thinner. This result coincides with the previous studies [28, 29]. However, the
difference between the linear structural analysis result
and the nonlinear structural analysis result becomes
larger and larger as the leaflet thickness becomes
thinner and thinner and as the applied blood pressure
becomes larger and larger. Hence, the geometric
nonlinearity is very conspicuous for the very thin
leaflet. Fig. 9(b) shows that the geometric nonlinear
deflections of the 0.5 mm thickness leaflet are conspicuous for blood pressure above 250 KPa; the geometric nonlinear deflection of the 0.55 mm thickness
leaflet is conspicuous for the blood pressure over 300
KPa; the geometric nonlinear deflection of the 0.60
mm and 0.65 mm thickness leaflets are conspicuous
for the blood pressure larger than 350 KPa; the geometric nonlinear deflection of the 0.70 mm thickness
leaflet is conspicuous for the blood pressure larger
than 400 KPa; and the geometric nonlinear deflection
of the 0.75 mm thickness leaflet is conspicuous for
the blood pressure larger than 450 KPa. Hence, geometric nonlinear deflections occur in the very thin
leaflet (e.g., 0.5 mm and 0.55 mm thickness leaflets)
for high blood pressures (300-500 KPa) applied to the
leaflet surface, and so these thin leaflets are not desirable for in vivo use in the human heart. Therefore, a
nonlinear structural analysis seems to be useful for
the accurate design of the bileaflet MHV prosthesis
for high applied blood pressures.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999372857142857">
In this paper the linear and nonlinear structural
analyses required in the design of a bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis with curved leaflet are executed. The analysis results show that the geometric
nonlinear deflections of the very thin leaflets are conspicuous for high applied blood pressures. Hence, the
nonlinear structural analysis seems to be useful for
the design of the MHV prosthesis. Through the linear
and nonlinear structural analyses, this paper presents
the moderate thickness leaflet for the applied blood
pressure as shown in Fig. 9 and in Table 6, and discusses the validity of the structural strength of the
leaflet according to the leaflet thickness variation and
the applied blood pressure variation. These results
were not revealed in the previous studies [28, 29].
And the structurally weak part, i.e., the hinge part
revealed in this study coincides with the in vivo leaflet fracture part observed in the existing study which
proves the validity of this numerical study.

Structural analysis of the bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis The position of the leaflet where the blood fluid force applied on the leaflet becomes the maximum value was computed to be the closing position of the leaflet through previous studies [28, 29]. Hence, the structural mechanic analysis of the leaflet is carried out at the closing position of the leaflet according to the leaflet thickness variation to get the thickness effects on the structural strength of the leaflet. A numerical analysis methodology (FEM) is used for the structural mechanic analysis. The finite element 2041 model for the structural mechanic analysis of the leaflet is shown in Fig. 3(b).

A large deformation is also expected to occur in the leaflet for the applied high blood pressure to require the nonlinear structural analysis. Since the large deformation occurring in the leaflet is only due to the high blood pressure, only geometric nonlinearity is assumed.

This result is quite reasonable and anticipated because the stress occurring in the leaflet should be proportional to the applied external blood pressure regardless of the analysis type (linear or nonlinear analysis) if the structure does not change itself. The thin leaflets are structurally weak because the stress occurring in the leaflet becomes larger and larger as the leaflet thickness becomes thinner and thinner as shown in Fig. 9(a). This result coincides with the previous studies [28, 29]. The structural strength of a structure is usually decided from the yield criterion (e.g., von Mises yield criterion, Tresca yield criterion, etc.). According to the von Mises yield criterion, if the maximum value of the equivalent stress occurring in the structure exceeds the yield stress of the structure material, the structure begins to yield for the applied external load.

However, these studies could not show clearly the structurally weaker leaflet whose thickness is not suitable for the in vivo use of the MHV prosthesis. These studies showed that the leaflet with analyzed thickness has enough strength to the applied single blood pressure. However, this result is questionable, because the blood pressure is applied to the leaflet surface constantly during the lifetime operation in the human heart. Hence, the fatigue and fracture structural analysis for the leaflet motion may be required for the determination of the structural strength of the valve leaflet [31]. However, equivalently a large blood pressure may be applied to the leaflet surface to determine and compare the structural strength of the leaflet for various leaflet thicknesses. A large deflection is expected to occur inside the leaflet for the high blood pressure and so the nonlinear structural analysis technique is required for the analysis. Thus both linear and nonlinear structural analysis techniques are adopted. The linear and nonlinear structural analyses results are compared to determine the structurally weaker leaflet thickness. In the present study, the structural strength of the </context>

The maximum deflection occurs at the lower central part of the leaflet (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) and the maximum stress occurs at the hinge of the leaflet (Part A in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8) for all leaflet thickness. Hence, the geometrically weak part is the hinge part for this curved bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis, and so a fracture may possibly occur in this hinge part. This coincides with the in vivo leaflet fracture observation made by Klepetko [32]. A large stress also occurs at the lower sharp corner part of the leaflet end surface (Part B in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8).
