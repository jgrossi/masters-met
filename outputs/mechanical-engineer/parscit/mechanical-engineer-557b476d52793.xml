Abstract：Structural bionic design lacks mature and scientific theories, and the excellent structural characteristics of
natural organisms sometimes cannot be transferred into engineering structures effectively. Aiming at overcoming the
existing problems, this paper summarizes three related theories: similarity theory, fuzzy evaluation theory and optimization theory. Based on the related theories, a method of structural bionic design is introduced, which includes four
steps: selecting the most useful structural characteristic of natural organism; analyzing the structural characteristic
finally chosen for engineering problem; completing the structural bionic design for engineering structure; and verifying the structural bionic design. Similarity theory and fuzzy evaluation theory are employed to achieve Step 1. In Step
2 and Step 3, optimization theory is employed to analyze the parameters of structures. Together with the thoughts of
simplification and grouping, optimization theory can reveal the relationship between organism structure and engineering structure, providing a way to structural bionic design. A general evaluation criterion is proposed in Step 4, which is
feasible to evaluate the performance of different structures. Finally, based on the method, a structural bionic design of
thin-walled cylindrical shell is introduced.
Keywords：structural bionic design; similarity theory; fuzzy evaluation; optimization; evaluation criterion
In human history, many creative design and innovation were invented through inspiration from nature[1]. For
natural organisms, billions of years of evolution was a slow
but effective process of optimization, and many excellent
properties and ingenious frames, which artificial design
could not always match, have been developed. They provide a new way to solve engineering problems[2,3].
Design of mechanical structure is an important engineering field. Light structure is needed in aircraft, because it is one of the most important ways to improve the
mobility of aircraft. The development of high speed machining tool demands structures with high stiffness and
light weight. As a result, high demands are put forward to
structure design, and light weight design, drag reduction
design etc become the key issues[4,5]. However, some of
the issues have been well solved by natural organisms.
Zhao et al[6] improved the specific stiffness of a machine
tool column with bionic stiffening ribs, inspired by biological skeleton and sandwich stem. By analyzing the
structural characteristic of dragonfly wing, Ma et al [7]
designed a bionic aircraft reinforced frame, and its specific stiffness and specific strength were increased by
2% — 6% and 1% — 8%, respectively. Inspired by soilburrowing animals like dung beetle, Ren et al [8] designed
bulldozer blades with rough surfaces, and found that the
bionic surfaces could reduce the mean draft force compared with smooth ones. Selecting the dung beetle as bionic prototype, Gao et al [9] designed the working layer of
an impregnated diamond bit, and their tests showed that
the bionic bit improved the drilling speed and lifetime by
44% and 74%, respectively, compared with a common bit.
Through learning from natural organisms, some researchers have done structural bionic design for engineering
structures successfully. However, they could not provide
a systematic method of applying the structural characteristics of natural organisms to engineering structures.
Some efforts have been made to approach a systematic method of structural bionic design. Ren[10] summarized several types of geometric constitutive units on the
body surfaces of soil animals, which was very helpful for
drag reduction design of a structure. Vincent and
Mann[11] compared solutions of some engineering problems such as cleaning and joining surfaces by natural
organisms with those by TRIZ (Teoriya Resheniya Izo-

TRIZ seemed to have the main qualifications of an effective bridge between biology and engineering. However,
they gave a good proposal rather than a systematic

characteristics can help engineers with the structure design. If a structural characteristic is very similar to the

the three, it may be useful, and should be picked out. In
this way, several possibly helpful structural characteristics can be found.

nally chosen for the engineering problem. After the structural characteristics, such as non-smooth surfaces, graded
structures, hierarchical structures, is picked out, it cannot
be used in structure design directly, because it is just a
guideline. To transfer this guideline into structural bionic
design, the following analyses should be done.
(1) Simplifying the structure of natural organism.
The structure of natural organism, which is usually complex, is not suitable to be analyzed and machined, so
simplification is needed. Aiming at solving engineering
problem, simplification should be done according to the
function of engineering structure. The function of engineering structure indicates which parts of organisms are
important, while the others are not. For example, if the
function of engineering structure is to reduce drag force,
the surface characteristics of organism should be paid
more attention, while the internal structure is not important.
Considering manufacturability, some simple geometric models such as circles, rectangles and cuboids are
employed here. Through division, a complex structure of
organism can usually be divided into several less complex parts, which may contain surfaces and inner supporting parts. If surfaces are important, some points on surfaces are measured, and then surface fitting method is
used to build the complex model. If surfaces are not important, the combined surface from simple surfaces like
planes, cylinder surfaces and spherical surfaces will make
sense. Common structures in engineering like cylinder
bars and cuboid beams can replace the inner supporting
parts of organism structure. Fig.1 is an example, which
shows the structural bionic design for a thin-walled cylindrical shell based on the cross-section structure of
bamboo. In the process of simplification, combined structure of big rings and small rings replace the complex one
in bamboo cross-section.
Fig.1
Simplification of bamboo cross-section[13]
(2) Extracting and analyzing the parameters of the
simplified structure. The parameters could be found
mostly from parameters of the simple geometric models
used in the simplified structure. For example, the parameters of the simplified structure in Fig.1 are those of the
rings. For each parameter, single-factor optimization is
done in finite element analysis software, taking the performance of achieving the function of engineering structure as the objective and the result indicates how the parameter affects the structure of organism. According to
the effect, these parameters will be divided into two
groups, Groups A and B, and they will be treated differently in the following step. If the optimal value of a parameter makes the structural characteristics of the simplified structure agree with that of organism, it will be included in Group A; otherwise, it will be put into Group B.
Step 3 Completing the structural bionic design for

they should be designed using the simple geometric models, which are employed in the simplified structure of
organism, gradually, hierarchically or in branch style according to the chosen structural characteristics. By
changing the diameters of different rings according to
engineering problem, the simplified structure in Fig.1 can
be designed as the preliminary bionic structure.
The parameters of the preliminary bionic structure
can be found from those of the simple geometric models,
which are employed here.
(2) Assigning the values of parameters. After the
preliminary bionic structure was achieved, it is time to
handle the parameters. If a parameter is in Group A, its
final value is the optimal value coming from single-factor
optimization of the preliminary bionic structure. Values
of parameters in Group B will be decided by multi-factor
optimization. However, there is a possibility that the preliminary bionic structure is too complex to do multifactor optimization. If so, do several single-factor optimizations to give every parameter an initial value, and then
search groups of values nearby by hand, and find the best
group among them. Once the values of all parameters are
assigned, the bionic structure is completed.
Step 4 Verifying the structural bionic design. There
are two important points, the evaluation criterion for
comparison and design of the contrastive structure.
