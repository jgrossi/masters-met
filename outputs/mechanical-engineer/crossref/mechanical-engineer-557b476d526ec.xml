enterprises and the customer is not exclusively that of business, but more
personalized with customers increasingly participating in the whole process of
product design. To adapt themselves to strong market competition, manufacturing
enterprises have shifted their focus from production to market, the protagonist has
changed from the enterprise to the customer, and the goal that enterprises endeavor
for is satisfying each customer's individual demand in all aspects of design,
production, sale and services. Tsoi et al. presented a knowledge-based customization
system of enterprise applications where the users can generically and speedily
customize their enterprise applications through intelligent selection and
configuration of components required [1]. Jian et al. studied the method of
constraint-based product family design. Building blocks are regarded as basic product
units which have a certain function and structure. Constraints and configuration
rules are retrieved from building blocks. The building blocks and their constraints
can be reused for product customization and variations in design [2]. Zhao et al.
proposed a methodology for engineering design based on knowledge based engineering
(KBE), and the tools and methods for knowledge processing are classified by
geometry-relativity with design knowledge [3]. Gzara et al. presented a product
information system setting up product models rapidly by reuse of patterns, and two
kinds of patterns are distinguished; business patterns and software patterns [4]. Dr.
Craig Chapman of Warwick Manufacturing Group pointed out that in 2010, the importance
of KBE to enterprises will be the same as that of Computer Aided Design/Computer
Aided Engineering/Computer Aided Manufaturing (CAD/CAE/CAM) to manufacturing industry
in the 1990's. For the purpose of adapting to volatile market competition,
implementing rapid response engineering strategy to develop new products speedily
[5], taking full advantage of an enterprise's existing resources, implementing
knowledge reuse and intelligent design process, this paper presents an approach on
intelligent, rapid product design that integrates KBE and Web technologies, product
family modeling, engineering database, feature based parametric design of traditional
CAD/CAE/CAM systems, creating a product family case memory series, and realizes an
Elevator Integrating Rapid Customization Design System (EIRCDS).<component x="315.83"

physical realization are the main aspects of product design. In this context, product
family modeling includes three views; functional view, technical view and structural
view [6]. Product family includes a product platform and a set of related products
deriving from the platform, which can satisfy different customers' requirements. The
product platform that usually has a relatively stable structure is the basis of the
product family. It is a set of modules which can be shared and reused by a series of
products. An effective product platform is the core of a product family, and it has
the common characteristics of all products in a product family. Generalization,
modularization, and standardization are the main issues of a product platform. An
advanced hierarchy-decomposition tree is used to establish the product family model
representing product case and its related knowledge in this paper. The common model
of product family case is shown in Fig. 1. It is expressed by the
hierarchy-decomposition tree. In the present case tree, every node that is expressed
by object has a common structure, and it stands for elements of products at all
levels, such as product, sub-assembly, component and part etc. The AND node that can
be divided is called a composition tree. Its child nodes are AND relations. Father
node and child nodes are combination (a-part-of) relations; the OR node that can be
selected is called an optional tree. Its child nodes are OR relations. Anyone of the
child nodes can be substituted by another, but only one node can be selected. Father
node and child nodes are an optional (a-kind-of) relation. Moreover, we prescribe
that if one optional child node needs to be divided, it still can be re-divided into
sub-nodes further as a father node of the lower composition nodes, as shown in the
lowest level of Fig. 1. It can be seen from the product family structure model that
the hierarchy-decomposition tree has the following advantages in expressing product
family case structure: 1) it can express the product function and structure
configuration easily and exactly for design customization; 2) it has characteristics
of generalization and modularization; it is especially suitable for realizing general
design and modular design of products in mechanical field. For the nodes of different
products in the same level, which have the same functions and structures, they may be
extracted out and built as common modules; and 3) it can accomplish design
standardization and series. So customers and designers can do customization and
variant design through function and structure nodes of different levels in the
product family case tree to achieve the design that is characterized by product
knowledge re-use and rapid response. The product family case module can be realized
by objectoriented technology. Every node is regarded as an object, and a common
element node class is defined to represent product, sub-assembly, component and part
in different layers. Relative element function class, element structure class,
element parameter class and element knowledge rule class are also defined and
embedded in the common element node class. Every specific product case is the
instance of the node class. The related data of product cases are stored and managed
in the engineering database [7]. Using this method, nodes can be composed or
decomposed, appended or deleted at any time and in any location in the tree as you
need, which reflects not only the dynamic and process-oriented characteristics of
product design, but also the hierarchy and modularization of product information. It
is helpful to reuse resources, improves the research retrieval efficiency and
enhances the system's maintainability and expandability.<component x="36.0"

technologies, strong functionality, high performance, and ease of use and ability to
integration with other tools. This system adopts Windows 2000 Server operating
system, Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 development tool, SQL Server 2000 database
management system, Internet Information Server (IIS), Web server software, the Active
Server Page (ASP) script, and Java Script as assistant tools to handle Web page and
optimize user interface. Meanwhile, it also integrates the related modules of
Unigraphics (UG) CAD/CAM software. The related modules of UG are introduced as
follows. The User defined features (UDFs) of UG solid modeling module allows one to
create one's own form features module as reused design elements. The UDFs can be
stored to construct a library of user defined features tailored to your needs. The
expressions, constraints and characteristic parameters of UDFs can be created in the
meantime. On the one hand, the UDFs encapsulate the knowledge of topology information
and specific characteristic of geometry model, on the other hand, the UDFs enable the
expression and operation on objects of product model at a higher level by retrieving
characteristic parameters and achieving the variant design. Knowledge Based
Engineering (KBE) technology is fundamentally about reuse of knowledge. It deals with
the ability to take advantage of any experience, expertise and other information
relevant to each phase of the engineering life cycle of an end user product [8].
Knowledge Fusion (KF) is the kernel module of realizing intelligent design by
incorporating knowledge based engineering technology. This module provides an
interpreted object-oriented language named Knowledge Fusion language (KFL) that is
simple, easy to learn and use. It has been designed to permit an end user to easily
add engineering knowledge to the task at hand by creating engineering constraint
rules, construct a knowledge library for product design that can express engineering
constraints and the corresponding relationship, and can be reused. It breaks through
the restriction of representing product design knowledge merely by geometry model,
and realizes the intelligent design. The KFL has also the capability to access
external knowledge sources, such as databases or spreadsheets, and to interface to
other applications such as analysis or optimization packages. UG/Open C++, UG/Open
API, MenuScript and UIStyler are advanced programming tool packages which provide
extensive and flexible circumstances for second development in UG to establish
special application program inside the platform of UG. Their functions include: the
visual editor for constructing menus and dialog forms of UG style and the program
interface; it uses many of the current program languages, such as C, C++, and Java,
and provides programming interface of calling UG resources directly. This interface
is a truly object-oriented interface using C++ language, which has all the
object-oriented advantages, for example, inheritance, encapsulation, and
Polymorphism.<component x="291.45" y="264.18" width="245.98" height="47.07" page="2"

base of all modules in the system. The product database is to store all kinds of
product data used to define, design, manufacture, maintain product and support
product data share, transmission for all other sub-systems or function modules. The
product database has open interface to other systems such as CAD/CAM, PDM,
Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II), and ERP, realizing data integration in a
logical united database environment. The product family knowledge library mainly
includes product case library and rule library. In the knowledge library, we set up
the product design knowledge organization unit according to the product family
structure and provide a product knowledge library management tool, combined with
Unigraphics CAD/CAM system, complete with the final product design. The Web
customization management system is a webbased order system using browser/server
structure. Customers can browse existing products and customize products remotely
over the internet. Meanwhile, traditional CAD/CAE/CAM system (UG) is integrated into
this system to perform the subsequent CAD detailed design and other tasks. The whole
system is controlled by an integrating environmental interface developed by UG/Open
and C++ programming. Other sub-systems have open interfaces to the integrating
environment, so they can be seamlessly connected to the system and the system will
then be easily extended in the future. The main developing process is as follows. 92
Through collecting, analyzing and inducing information of structures and assemblies
of existing products in the enterprise according to whole product life cycle, the
design knowledge of product parts, components and assemblies are extracted and
classified. The model of the product family case design expressed by
hierarchy-decomposition tree is created according to the method of product family
design. Through the UDF and UG solid modeling module, design parts, components,
subassemblies, decide on expression constraints, retrieve feature design parameters,
and then create model library supporting parametrical design. Through KF module
create the KF rule class package related to the model, including design constraints,
assembly relations, experience formulae, selection rules of feature parameters,
configuration rules of components and parts, and organize them into the rule library.
Extract feature parameters from models, and create respectively case database.
According to existing product series in the enterprise, design typical case template
and case index mechanism, and create product family case library. Create knowledge
library management system. It can modify, add or delete cases and rules. Create Web
customization management system, adopting Browser/Server structure [9]. The system
mainly includes customer information management, product information management, and
order information management. The customer management includes customer register,
customer information modification etc. Product information management includes new
product definition, product information maintenance etc. Order management include
creating new order, order maintenance etc. Figure 3 is the flow chart of design

customization demand includes: 1) size customization: the car's contour sizes are
decided by the building's well way, resulting in variation of parameters to other
relative parts, according to engineering rules and experience. The car's main contour
size is: total width A and total depth B; 2) function selection: the different
functions of control and operation decide the car's structure, for example, the style
of the air draft can be either a side air draft or middle air draft; 3) decoration

product series over the internet, selects type number, and specifies the main
parameters for customization. Refer to the customization flow chart in Fig. 3, for
example. The customizing parameters are as follows: the selected Product Model No. is
HSET9703, the car's total width A is 1 500 mm, total depth B is 1 400 mm, the air
draft style is middle air draft, the ceiling's cut angle mode adopts right cut angle,
the side length of the cut angle R b is 150 mm, and the cut angle is 45&#xB0;. After
the completion of customization, the order list is stored in the database. Next, the
designers retrieve this order list through the system. According to the similarity
criteria, same or similar cases are searched and retrieved. If matching cases are
found, the best cases are selected and modified for detail variant design to conform
to the new product's specifications. On the contrary, if no matching case is found,
then an entirely new design is made. Finally, after finishing the design, the
product's structure and performance should be assessed. According to the assessment,
if the design satisfies the design requirements, the design result will be stored in
the case library as a new case; otherwise, the system will return to the phase of
detail design and start a redesign. Figure 4 shows the assemblies of HSET9703

enterprises and the customer is not exclusively that of business, but more
personalized with customers increasingly participating in the whole process of
product design. To adapt themselves to strong market competition, manufacturing
enterprises have shifted their focus from production to market, the protagonist has
changed from the enterprise to the customer, and the goal that enterprises endeavor
for is satisfying each customer's individual demand in all aspects of design,
production, sale and services. Tsoi et al. presented a knowledge-based customization
system of enterprise applications where the users can generically and speedily
customize their enterprise applications through intelligent selection and
configuration of components required [1]. Jian et al. studied the method of
constraint-based product family design. Building blocks are regarded as basic product
units which have a certain function and structure. Constraints and configuration
rules are retrieved from building blocks. The building blocks and their constraints
can be reused for product customization and variations in design [2]. Zhao et al.
proposed a methodology for engineering design based on knowledge based engineering
(KBE), and the tools and methods for knowledge processing are classified by
geometry-relativity with design knowledge [3]. Gzara et al. presented a product
information system setting up product models rapidly by reuse of patterns, and two
kinds of patterns are distinguished; business patterns and software patterns [4]. Dr.
Craig Chapman of Warwick Manufacturing Group pointed out that in 2010, the importance
of KBE to enterprises will be the same as that of Computer Aided Design/Computer
Aided Engineering/Computer Aided Manufaturing (CAD/CAE/CAM) to manufacturing industry
in the 1990's. For the purpose of adapting to volatile market competition,
implementing rapid response engineering strategy to develop new products speedily
[5], taking full advantage of an enterprise's existing resources, implementing
knowledge reuse and intelligent design process, this paper presents an approach on
intelligent, rapid product design that integrates KBE and Web technologies, product
family modeling, engineering database, feature based parametric design of traditional
CAD/CAE/CAM systems, creating a product family case memory series, and realizes an
Elevator Integrating Rapid Customization Design System (EIRCDS).<component x="315.83"

physical realization are the main aspects of product design. In this context, product
family modeling includes three views; functional view, technical view and structural
view [6]. Product family includes a product platform and a set of related products
deriving from the platform, which can satisfy different customers' requirements. The
product platform that usually has a relatively stable structure is the basis of the
product family. It is a set of modules which can be shared and reused by a series of
products. An effective product platform is the core of a product family, and it has
the common characteristics of all products in a product family. Generalization,
modularization, and standardization are the main issues of a product platform. An
advanced hierarchy-decomposition tree is used to establish the product family model
representing product case and its related knowledge in this paper. The common model
of product family case is shown in Fig. 1. It is expressed by the
hierarchy-decomposition tree. In the present case tree, every node that is expressed
by object has a common structure, and it stands for elements of products at all
levels, such as product, sub-assembly, component and part etc. The AND node that can
be divided is called a composition tree. Its child nodes are AND relations. Father
node and child nodes are combination (a-part-of) relations; the OR node that can be
selected is called an optional tree. Its child nodes are OR relations. Anyone of the
child nodes can be substituted by another, but only one node can be selected. Father
node and child nodes are an optional (a-kind-of) relation. Moreover, we prescribe
that if one optional child node needs to be divided, it still can be re-divided into
sub-nodes further as a father node of the lower composition nodes, as shown in the
lowest level of Fig. 1. It can be seen from the product family structure model that
the hierarchy-decomposition tree has the following advantages in expressing product
family case structure: 1) it can express the product function and structure
configuration easily and exactly for design customization; 2) it has characteristics
of generalization and modularization; it is especially suitable for realizing general
design and modular design of products in mechanical field. For the nodes of different
products in the same level, which have the same functions and structures, they may be
extracted out and built as common modules; and 3) it can accomplish design
standardization and series. So customers and designers can do customization and
variant design through function and structure nodes of different levels in the
product family case tree to achieve the design that is characterized by product
knowledge re-use and rapid response. The product family case module can be realized
by objectoriented technology. Every node is regarded as an object, and a common
element node class is defined to represent product, sub-assembly, component and part
in different layers. Relative element function class, element structure class,
element parameter class and element knowledge rule class are also defined and
embedded in the common element node class. Every specific product case is the
instance of the node class. The related data of product cases are stored and managed
in the engineering database [7]. Using this method, nodes can be composed or
decomposed, appended or deleted at any time and in any location in the tree as you
need, which reflects not only the dynamic and process-oriented characteristics of
product design, but also the hierarchy and modularization of product information. It
is helpful to reuse resources, improves the research retrieval efficiency and
enhances the system's maintainability and expandability.<component x="36.0"

technologies, strong functionality, high performance, and ease of use and ability to
integration with other tools. This system adopts Windows 2000 Server operating
system, Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 development tool, SQL Server 2000 database
management system, Internet Information Server (IIS), Web server software, the Active
Server Page (ASP) script, and Java Script as assistant tools to handle Web page and
optimize user interface. Meanwhile, it also integrates the related modules of
Unigraphics (UG) CAD/CAM software. The related modules of UG are introduced as
follows. The User defined features (UDFs) of UG solid modeling module allows one to
create one's own form features module as reused design elements. The UDFs can be
stored to construct a library of user defined features tailored to your needs. The
expressions, constraints and characteristic parameters of UDFs can be created in the
meantime. On the one hand, the UDFs encapsulate the knowledge of topology information
and specific characteristic of geometry model, on the other hand, the UDFs enable the
expression and operation on objects of product model at a higher level by retrieving
characteristic parameters and achieving the variant design. Knowledge Based
Engineering (KBE) technology is fundamentally about reuse of knowledge. It deals with
the ability to take advantage of any experience, expertise and other information
relevant to each phase of the engineering life cycle of an end user product [8].
Knowledge Fusion (KF) is the kernel module of realizing intelligent design by
incorporating knowledge based engineering technology. This module provides an
interpreted object-oriented language named Knowledge Fusion language (KFL) that is
simple, easy to learn and use. It has been designed to permit an end user to easily
add engineering knowledge to the task at hand by creating engineering constraint
rules, construct a knowledge library for product design that can express engineering
constraints and the corresponding relationship, and can be reused. It breaks through
the restriction of representing product design knowledge merely by geometry model,
and realizes the intelligent design. The KFL has also the capability to access
external knowledge sources, such as databases or spreadsheets, and to interface to
other applications such as analysis or optimization packages. UG/Open C++, UG/Open
API, MenuScript and UIStyler are advanced programming tool packages which provide
extensive and flexible circumstances for second development in UG to establish
special application program inside the platform of UG. Their functions include: the
visual editor for constructing menus and dialog forms of UG style and the program
interface; it uses many of the current program languages, such as C, C++, and Java,
and provides programming interface of calling UG resources directly. This interface
is a truly object-oriented interface using C++ language, which has all the
object-oriented advantages, for example, inheritance, encapsulation, and
Polymorphism.<component x="291.45" y="264.18" width="245.98" height="47.07" page="2"

base of all modules in the system. The product database is to store all kinds of
product data used to define, design, manufacture, maintain product and support
product data share, transmission for all other sub-systems or function modules. The
product database has open interface to other systems such as CAD/CAM, PDM,
Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II), and ERP, realizing data integration in a
logical united database environment. The product family knowledge library mainly
includes product case library and rule library. In the knowledge library, we set up
the product design knowledge organization unit according to the product family
structure and provide a product knowledge library management tool, combined with
Unigraphics CAD/CAM system, complete with the final product design. The Web
customization management system is a webbased order system using browser/server
structure. Customers can browse existing products and customize products remotely
over the internet. Meanwhile, traditional CAD/CAE/CAM system (UG) is integrated into
this system to perform the subsequent CAD detailed design and other tasks. The whole
system is controlled by an integrating environmental interface developed by UG/Open
and C++ programming. Other sub-systems have open interfaces to the integrating
environment, so they can be seamlessly connected to the system and the system will
then be easily extended in the future. The main developing process is as follows. 92
Through collecting, analyzing and inducing information of structures and assemblies
of existing products in the enterprise according to whole product life cycle, the
design knowledge of product parts, components and assemblies are extracted and
classified. The model of the product family case design expressed by
hierarchy-decomposition tree is created according to the method of product family
design. Through the UDF and UG solid modeling module, design parts, components,
subassemblies, decide on expression constraints, retrieve feature design parameters,
and then create model library supporting parametrical design. Through KF module
create the KF rule class package related to the model, including design constraints,
assembly relations, experience formulae, selection rules of feature parameters,
configuration rules of components and parts, and organize them into the rule library.
Extract feature parameters from models, and create respectively case database.
According to existing product series in the enterprise, design typical case template
and case index mechanism, and create product family case library. Create knowledge
library management system. It can modify, add or delete cases and rules. Create Web
customization management system, adopting Browser/Server structure [9]. The system
mainly includes customer information management, product information management, and
order information management. The customer management includes customer register,
customer information modification etc. Product information management includes new
product definition, product information maintenance etc. Order management include
creating new order, order maintenance etc. Figure 3 is the flow chart of design

decided by the building's well way, resulting in variation of parameters to other
relative parts, according to engineering rules and experience. The car's main contour
size is: total width A and total depth B; 2) function selection: the different
functions of control and operation decide the car's structure, for example, the style
of the air draft can be either a side air draft or middle air draft; 3) decoration

product series over the internet, selects type number, and specifies the main
parameters for customization. Refer to the customization flow chart in Fig. 3, for
example. The customizing parameters are as follows: the selected Product Model No. is
HSET9703, the car's total width A is 1 500 mm, total depth B is 1 400 mm, the air
draft style is middle air draft, the ceiling's cut angle mode adopts right cut angle,
the side length of the cut angle R b is 150 mm, and the cut angle is 45&#xB0;. After
the completion of customization, the order list is stored in the database. Next, the
designers retrieve this order list through the system. According to the similarity
criteria, same or similar cases are searched and retrieved. If matching cases are
found, the best cases are selected and modified for detail variant design to conform
to the new product's specifications. On the contrary, if no matching case is found,
then an entirely new design is made. Finally, after finishing the design, the
product's structure and performance should be assessed. According to the assessment,
if the design satisfies the design requirements, the design result will be stored in
the case library as a new case; otherwise, the system will return to the phase of
detail design and start a redesign. Figure 4 shows the assemblies of HSET9703
