structural design of a bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis is presented in
this paper. In particular, this paper discusses the thickness effects on the
structural strength of a bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis with curved
leaflets for the design of the mechanical heart valve (MHV) prosthesis. There are
four different cardiac valves in the human heart: tricuspid valve, mitral valve,
pulmonary valve, and aortic valve. The function of these cardiac valves is to
regulate the biologic blood flow and to avoid the regurgitation of blood. Congenital

cause the valve stenosis and the regurgitation of blood. These diseased and
nonrepairable cardiac valves, e.g., aortic or mitral valve, should be excised and
replaced by an artificial device. This artificial device is called a prosthetic heart
valve. The first successful prosthetic mitral valve replacement was a device
implanted by Nina Braunwald at the National Institutes of Health in 1959. This was a
homemade device with artificial chordae made of polyurethane. However, it was not
until the collaboration of Albert Starr, in Portland, and Lowell Edwards, an engineer
in southern California, that the first reliable device for replacement of the mitral
valve was produced on a commercial basis. The Starr-Edward ball-and-cage mitral
valve, first implanted in 1961 [1], became the "gold standard", until the late 1960s,
when the second and the third generation prosthetic valves began to appear. After the
Starr-Edward ball-and-cage valve, the monoleaflet valves like Bj&#xF6;rk-Shilley
Monostrut mechanical prosthetic valve [2], Sorin Allcarbon mechanical prosthetic
valve, Medtronic Hall mechanical prosthetic valve, and Omnicarbon mechanical
prosthetic valve, appeared throughout the 1960s and the 1970s. The third generation
prosthetic valve was developed in the late 1970s and became the valve of the 1980s
[3]. This was the bileaflet St. Jude Medical valve. Leaflet opening was more
complete, the hemodynamics was improved, and the incidence of thromboembolism was
reduced. Nowadays, bileaflet mechanical heart valves are the most commonly implanted
prosthetic heart valves like the St. Jude Medical bileaflet mechanical heart valve
prosthesis, the Edwards MIRA bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis, and the
bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis. On-X Even though these bileaflet
mechanical heart valve prostheses are widely used for heart valve disease, they still
have many problems when they are implanted and replace the diseased cardiac aortic or
mitral valves of the human heart [4-6]. When the bileaflet mechanical heart valves
are fully open and closed, high velocity jets through the gap between the leaflets
can be readily detected both in vivo and in vitro [7-10]. This valve movement coupled
with the high velocity jets through the leaflets causes elevated shear stress which
may cause red blood cell damage or platelet activation. Together with high shear
stress, increased coagulation due to blood stagnancy in contact with the artery wall
may cause thrombosis and thromboembolism, which should be avoided for cardiac
patients. Moreover, the structural strength of the valve leaflet may be reduced due
to the periodic and cyclic countless leaflet motions (approximately 38 million cycles
per year), the geometric defect owing to the shape of the leaflet, the inhomogeneous
mechanical properties of the leaflet, the cavitation phenomenon [11] due to the blood
pressure drop, and the wear due to the friction between the leaflet and the blood.
These structural problems may cause the cracking and the fracture of the valve
leaflet and eventually failure of the valve operation leading to the death of the
cardiac patient. Therefore, comprehensive studies are required on the mechanical
heart valve leaflet associated with the blood flow for the design of the MHV
prosthesis. So far many studies for the improvement of the design of the mechanical
heart valve prosthesis have been reported. Some of them are on the blood flow passing
through the leaflet for a single cycle with inelastic artery wall [12-21]. Some of
them are on the structural strength analysis of the mechanical heart valve leaflet
[22-29]. Intrinsically, the design problem of a bileaflet mechanical heart valve
prosthesis is characterized by multidisciplinary interactions in which fluid
mechanics, rigid body dynamics, and structural mechanics are linked to another. These
kinds of multidisciplinary analysis features in the design of the MHV prosthesis were
studied very much by using computer-aided engineer[28, 29]. These ing systems in the
previous studies studies adopted several thickness models of the leaflet and revealed
that the structural strength of the leaflet was reduced as the leaflet thickness
became thinner and thinner. However, these studies could not show clearly the
structurally weaker leaflet whose thickness is not suitable for the in vivo use of
the MHV prosthesis. These studies showed that the leaflet with analyzed thickness has
enough strength to the applied single blood pressure. However, this result is
questionable, because the blood pressure is applied to the leaflet surface constantly
during the lifetime operation in the human heart. Hence, the fatigue and fracture
structural analysis for the leaflet motion may be required for the determination of
the structural strength of the valve leaflet [31]. However, equivalently a large
blood pressure may be applied to the leaflet surface to determine and compare the
structural strength of the leaflet for various leaflet thicknesses. A large
deflection is expected to occur inside the leaflet for the high blood pressure and so
the nonlinear structural analysis technique is required for the analysis. Thus both
linear and nonlinear structural analysis techniques are adopted. The linear and
nonlinear structural analyses results are compared to determine the structurally
weaker leaflet thickness. In the present study, the structural strength of the
leaflet in conjunction with the blood flow pressure variations is to be investigated
by using the numerical technique, using the commercial finite element code "NISA".
The bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis with curved leaflet is used for
analysis in this study. 2. Geometry and dimensions of the MHV prosthesis used for the
analysis The mechanical heart valve prosthesis used for the analysis is the bileaflet
mechanical heart valve prosthesis with curved leaflet (Fig. 1). The diameter of the
mechanical heart valve prosthesis available commercially is 22.5 mm (Fig. 1) and the
thickness of the leaflet is 0.65 mm. Hence, the leaflet thickness varies from 0.50 mm
up to 0.75 mm by 0.05 mm, which is 0.1 mm thinner and 0.1 mm thicker than 0.65 mm in
this analysis. The mechanical heart valve prosthesis features a curved leaflet
profile as well as a slim, Carbofilm coated titanium-alloy housing. This combination
is intended to optimize hemodynamic performance via a larger orifice, complementing
the natural flow pattern and minimizing turbulence. Designed to reduce friction and
wear, the valve's rolling hinge gives a constantly varying point of contact in the
hinge area between the leaflet and the housing. An open channel in the hinge cavity
allows continuous hinge washing during the entire cardiac cycle. The mechanical heart
valve prosthesis has unique sewing rings specifically designed for mitral and aortic
applications, as well as a special aortic version for very small annuli. Each sewing
ring design enhances the function of the valve in its position and size, including
the unique hyperbolic shape of the mitral valve and the downstream extension of the
aortic. Two semicircular leaflets open to 80&#xBA; and the closing angle is 20&#xBA;
(Fig. 2), resulting in a central, near laminar flow. The housing stability is
increased by a stellite stiffener ring over the solid pyrolytic valve housing. The
pivot hinge mechanism is located within the housing, and leaflet motion is by
rotation and translation. Curved leaflets enhance central flow and rapid closure. The
pivot ball and slot mechanism facilitate retrograde washing by relatively high
velocity jets. Leaflets close on a circular ledge within the housing to reduce
regurgitation and stress on the hinge mechanism. The pivot ball hinge closes by
rotation and translation. Downstream of the mechanical heart valve is located the
elastic artery wall with sinus. The artery wall is assumed to be an elastic circular
tube with diameter of 25.0 mm. The mechanical heart valve consists of three parts:
the leaflet which controls the blood flow, the orifice ring which supports the
leaflets, and the sewing cuff which attaches and fixes the orifice ring to the tissue
of the heart muscle (Fig. 1). A kinematic model of the mechanical heart valve
consists of three links and four joints. And the mobility of the valve movement is
two. A kinematic diagram of the MHV is shown in Fig. 2. A computational solid model
of the curved leaflet for the structural analysis is shown in Fig. 3(a). Tables 1 and
2 show the dimensions of the bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis (aortic and
mitral valves) on sale commercially.<component x="305.99" y="182.72" width="202.07"

mechanical heart valve prosthesis The position of the leaflet where the blood fluid
force applied on the leaflet becomes the maximum value was computed to be the closing
position of the leaflet through previous studies [28, 29]. Hence, the structural
mechanic analysis of the leaflet is carried out at the closing position of the
leaflet according to the leaflet thickness variation to get the thickness effects on
the structural strength of the leaflet. A numerical analysis methodology (FEM) is
used for the structural mechanic analysis. The finite element model for the
structural mechanic analysis of the leaflet is shown in Fig. 3(b). The number of
element is 72,446, and the number of node is 81,526 (Table 3). The sewing cuff and
the orifice ring are neglected in the structural analysis, because they do not affect
the analysis results. The orifice ring is assumed as a rigid ,u ,u ) are conbody.
Three degrees of freedom (u x y z strained at the hinge point and on the outer
surface of the leaflet which contacts the rigid orifice ring. The =0) is applied on
symmetric boundary condition (u z the symmetric surface (z=0) of the model (Fig. 4).
=0) is Also the symmetric boundary condition (u y applied on the symmetric surface
(y=0), since both leaflets contact this symmetric surface (Fig. 4). The fluid force
which is the external force acting on the leaflet is exerted as normal uniform
pressure onto the leaflet surface (Fig. 4). The material of the leaflet is assumed to
be Si-Alloyed PyC (the yield stress is 407.7 MPa) (Table 4). Young's modulus,
Poisson's ratio and the density of the material used are 30.5GPa, 3 , respectively
(Table 4). The 0.3 and 2,116 Kg/m blood flow pressure applied to the curved leaflet
surface is assumed to vary up to a very high value in the analysis. Actually the
maximum value of the single blood flow pressure applied to the valve leaflet in the
human heart is 120 mmHg (about 16 KPa). The MHV implanted in the human heart should
be operated constantly (approximately 38 million cycles per year) for life-long time.
Hence, a very strong structural strength of the leaflet should be secured for the
safe operation of the MHV prosthesis in the human heart. This severe condition
requires much higher blood flow pressure than a single blood flow pressure applied on
to the valve leaflet in the structural analysis. Therefore a thorough investigation
of the stress and deflection variations of the curved leaflet according to the high
blood flow pressure variation is carried out in this study by applying a very high
blood flow pressure at which the equivalent stress occurring inside the very thin
leaflet (with 0.5 mm thickness) first exceeds the yield stress (407.7 MPa) of the
leaflet material (see Table 5). A large deformation is also expected to occur in the
leaflet for the applied high blood pressure to require the nonlinear structural
analysis. Since the large deformation occurring in the leaflet is only due to the
high blood pressure, only geometric nonlinearity is assumed. Also linear structural
analysis is simultaneously performed for comparison. In the previous studies [28, 29]
only a linear structural analysis was carried out for the applied<component x="90.6"

studies [28, 29] revealed the kinetic and kinematic behavior of the leaflet while the
MHV prosthesis was working in the human heart. According to the previous studies [28,
29], the structural deformation of the leaflet is expected at the closing position of
the valve where the maximum reaction force occurs at the hinge. Hence both the linear
and nonlinear structural mechanic analyses for the curved leaflet are carried out for
this closing position of the valve in the present study. 4. Analysis results and
discussions The structural deformation and stress distribution results obtained from
the structural analysis of the leaflet are shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, and Fig.
8. The maximum deflection occurs at the lower central part of the leaflet (Fig. 5,
Fig. 6) and the maximum stress occurs at the hinge of the leaflet (Part A in Fig. 7
and Fig. 8) for all leaflet thickness. Hence, the geometrically weak part is the
hinge part for this curved bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis, and so a
fracture may possibly occur in this hinge part. This coincides with the in vivo
leaflet fracture observation made by Klepetko [32]. A large stress also occurs at the
lower sharp corner part of the leaflet end surface (Part B in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8).
Table 5 shows the variations of the mass and the weight of the leaflet and also the
computed equivalent stress variation according to the leaflet thickness change for
the applied blood pressure of 500 KPa. Fig. 9 shows the maximum deflection variations
and the maximum von Mises stress variations as the leaflet thickness varies from the
0.5 mm to 0.75 mm by 0.05 mm and the blood flow pressure varies up to 500 KPa. As
indicated in Fig. 9(a), the computed stresses do not show any difference between the
linear and the nonlinear structural analysis results for each leaflet thickness
(i.e., the linearly computed stress and the nonlinearly computed stress are almost
same.) while the computed stresses increase as the leaflet thickness becomes thinner
and thinner. This result is quite reasonable and anticipated because the stress
occurring in the leaflet should be proportional to the applied external blood
pressure regardless of the analysis type (linear or nonlinear analysis) if the
structure does not change itself. The thin leaflets are structurally weak because the
stress occurring in the leaflet becomes larger and larger as the leaflet thickness
becomes thinner and thinner as shown in Fig. 9(a). This result coincides with the
previous studies [28, 29]. The structural strength of a structure is usually decided
from the yield criterion (e.g., von Mises yield criterion, Tresca yield criterion,
etc.). According to the von Mises yield criterion, if the maximum value of the
equivalent stress occurring in the structure exceeds the yield stress of the
structure material, the structure begins to yield for the applied external load. From
this point of view, Table 5 shows that the 0.5 mm thickness leaflet is expected to
begin to yield for the applied 500 KPa blood pressure because the computed maximum
equivalent stress (411.88 MPa) in the leaflet exceeds the yield stress (407.7 MPa) of
the leaflet material, while other thickness leaflets do not seem to begin to yield.
Table 5 also shows that the structural strength is not directly proportional to the
leaflet thickness. The structural strength of the leaflet increases at a higher rate
than the leaflet weight (or thickness), e.g., the structural strength of the 0.65 mm
thickness leaflet is 1.41 (the ratio of the equivalent stresses of the 0.5 mm
thickness leaflet and the 0.65 mm leaflet thickness leaflet) times as large as the
structural strength of the 0.5 mm thickness leaflet while the weight of the 0.65 mm
thickness leaflet is 1.3 times as large as the weight of the 0.5 mm thickness
leaflet. From the design point of view, a safety factor (defined as the ratio of the
material yield stress to the maximum stress occurring in the structure) value of 2.0
is usually adopted as the design standard of the structure. According to this
standard, the maximum stress in the leaflet should not exceed the half value (203.85
MPa) of the yield stress (407.7 MPa) of the leaflet material adopted in this
analysis. Hence, stresses larger than 203.85 MPa in Table 6 are not desirable for the
in vivo use of the leaflet in the human heart. Table 6 shows that very thin 0.5 mm
and 0.55 mm thickness leaflets are not suitable for blood pressure greater than 300
KPa, 0.6 mm and 0.65 mm thickness leaflets are not suitable for blood pressure
greater than 350 KPa, 0.7 mm thickness leaflet is not suitable for blood pressure
above 400 KPa, and 0.75 mm thickness leaflet is not suitable for blood pressure
greater than 450 KPa. These results were not revealed in the previous studies [28,
29] where the maximum blood pressure applied on to the leaflet was 104 KPa. By
examining the computed deflections of the leaflet shown in Fig. 9(b), the result is
quite different from the stress results in Fig. 9(a). The computed deflections of the
leaflet increase as the leaflet thickness becomes thinner and thinner. This result
coincides with the previous studies [28, 29]. However, the difference between the
linear structural analysis result and the nonlinear structural analysis result
becomes larger and larger as the leaflet thickness becomes thinner and thinner and as
the applied blood pressure becomes larger and larger. Hence, the geometric
nonlinearity is very conspicuous for the very thin leaflet. Fig. 9(b) shows that the
geometric nonlinear deflections of the 0.5 mm thickness leaflet are conspicuous for
blood pressure above 250 KPa; the geometric nonlinear deflection of the 0.55 mm
thickness leaflet is conspicuous for the blood pressure over 300 KPa; the geometric
nonlinear deflection of the 0.60 mm and 0.65 mm thickness leaflets are conspicuous
for the blood pressure larger than 350 KPa; the geometric nonlinear deflection of the
0.70 mm thickness leaflet is conspicuous for the blood pressure larger than 400 KPa;
and the geometric nonlinear deflection of the 0.75 mm thickness leaflet is
conspicuous for the blood pressure larger than 450 KPa. Hence, geometric nonlinear
deflections occur in the very thin leaflet (e.g., 0.5 mm and 0.55 mm thickness
leaflets) for high blood pressures (300-500 KPa) applied to the leaflet surface, and
so these thin leaflets are not desirable for in vivo use in the human heart.
Therefore, a nonlinear structural analysis seems to be useful for the accurate design
of the bileaflet MHV prosthesis for high applied blood pressures. Conclusively, from
the present analysis very thin<component x="306.0" y="423.72" width="202.42"

nonlinear structural analyses required in the design of a bileaflet mechanical heart
valve prosthesis with curved leaflet are executed. The analysis results show that the
geometric nonlinear deflections of the very thin leaflets are conspicuous for high
applied blood pressures. Hence, the nonlinear structural analysis seems to be useful
for the design of the MHV prosthesis. Through the linear and nonlinear structural
analyses, this paper presents the moderate thickness leaflet for the applied blood
pressure as shown in Fig. 9 and in Table 6, and discusses the validity of the
structural strength of the leaflet according to the leaflet thickness variation and
the applied blood pressure variation. These results were not revealed in the previous
studies [28, 29]. And the structurally weak part, i.e., the hinge part revealed in
this study coincides with the in vivo leaflet fracture part observed in the existing
study which proves the validity of this numerical study. Acknowledgment This work was

cause the valve stenosis and the regurgitation of blood. These diseased and
nonrepairable cardiac valves, e.g., aortic or mitral valve, should be excised and
replaced by an artificial device. This artificial device is called a prosthetic heart
valve. The first successful prosthetic mitral valve replacement was a device
implanted by Nina Braunwald at the National Institutes of Health in 1959. This was a
homemade device with artificial chordae made of polyurethane. However, it was not
until the collaboration of Albert Starr, in Portland, and Lowell Edwards, an engineer
in southern California, that the first reliable device for replacement of the mitral
valve was produced on a commercial basis. The Starr-Edward ball-and-cage mitral
valve, first implanted in 1961 [1], became the "gold standard", until the late 1960s,
when the second and the third generation prosthetic valves began to appear. After the
Starr-Edward ball-and-cage valve, the monoleaflet valves like Bj&#xF6;rk-Shilley
Monostrut mechanical prosthetic valve [2], Sorin Allcarbon mechanical prosthetic
valve, Medtronic Hall mechanical prosthetic valve, and Omnicarbon mechanical
prosthetic valve, appeared throughout the 1960s and the 1970s. The third generation
prosthetic valve was developed in the late 1970s and became the valve of the 1980s
[3]. This was the bileaflet St. Jude Medical valve. Leaflet opening was more
complete, the hemodynamics was improved, and the incidence of thromboembolism was
reduced. Nowadays, bileaflet mechanical heart valves are the most commonly implanted
prosthetic heart valves like the St. Jude Medical bileaflet mechanical heart valve
prosthesis, the Edwards MIRA bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis, and the
bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis. On-X Even though these bileaflet
mechanical heart valve prostheses are widely used for heart valve disease, they still
have many problems when they are implanted and replace the diseased cardiac aortic or
mitral valves of the human heart [4-6]. When the bileaflet mechanical heart valves
are fully open and closed, high velocity jets through the gap between the leaflets
can be readily detected both in vivo and in vitro [7-10]. This valve movement coupled
with the high velocity jets through the leaflets causes elevated shear stress which
may cause red blood cell damage or platelet activation. Together with high shear
stress, increased coagulation due to blood stagnancy in contact with the artery wall
may cause thrombosis and thromboembolism, which should be avoided for cardiac
patients. Moreover, the structural strength of the valve leaflet may be reduced due
to the periodic and cyclic countless leaflet motions (approximately 38 million cycles
per year), the geometric defect owing to the shape of the leaflet, the inhomogeneous
mechanical properties of the leaflet, the cavitation phenomenon [11] due to the blood
pressure drop, and the wear due to the friction between the leaflet and the blood.
These structural problems may cause the cracking and the fracture of the valve
leaflet and eventually failure of the valve operation leading to the death of the
cardiac patient. Therefore, comprehensive studies are required on the mechanical
heart valve leaflet associated with the blood flow for the design of the MHV
prosthesis. So far many studies for the improvement of the design of the mechanical
heart valve prosthesis have been reported. Some of them are on the blood flow passing
through the leaflet for a single cycle with inelastic artery wall [12-21]. Some of
them are on the structural strength analysis of the mechanical heart valve leaflet
[22-29]. Intrinsically, the design problem of a bileaflet mechanical heart valve
prosthesis is characterized by multidisciplinary interactions in which fluid
mechanics, rigid body dynamics, and structural mechanics are linked to another. These
kinds of multidisciplinary analysis features in the design of the MHV prosthesis were
studied very much by using computer-aided engineer[28, 29]. These ing systems in the
previous studies studies adopted several thickness models of the leaflet and revealed
that the structural strength of the leaflet was reduced as the leaflet thickness
became thinner and thinner. However, these studies could not show clearly the
structurally weaker leaflet whose thickness is not suitable for the in vivo use of
the MHV prosthesis. These studies showed that the leaflet with analyzed thickness has
enough strength to the applied single blood pressure. However, this result is
questionable, because the blood pressure is applied to the leaflet surface constantly
during the lifetime operation in the human heart. Hence, the fatigue and fracture
structural analysis for the leaflet motion may be required for the determination of
the structural strength of the valve leaflet [31]. However, equivalently a large
blood pressure may be applied to the leaflet surface to determine and compare the
structural strength of the leaflet for various leaflet thicknesses. A large
deflection is expected to occur inside the leaflet for the high blood pressure and so
the nonlinear structural analysis technique is required for the analysis. Thus both
linear and nonlinear structural analysis techniques are adopted. The linear and
nonlinear structural analyses results are compared to determine the structurally
weaker leaflet thickness. In the present study, the structural strength of the
leaflet in conjunction with the blood flow pressure variations is to be investigated
by using the numerical technique, using the commercial finite element code "NISA".
The bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis with curved leaflet is used for
analysis in this study. 2. Geometry and dimensions of the MHV prosthesis used for the
analysis The mechanical heart valve prosthesis used for the analysis is the bileaflet
mechanical heart valve prosthesis with curved leaflet (Fig. 1). The diameter of the
mechanical heart valve prosthesis available commercially is 22.5 mm (Fig. 1) and the
thickness of the leaflet is 0.65 mm. Hence, the leaflet thickness varies from 0.50 mm
up to 0.75 mm by 0.05 mm, which is 0.1 mm thinner and 0.1 mm thicker than 0.65 mm in
this analysis. The mechanical heart valve prosthesis features a curved leaflet
profile as well as a slim, Carbofilm coated titanium-alloy housing. This combination
is intended to optimize hemodynamic performance via a larger orifice, complementing
the natural flow pattern and minimizing turbulence. Designed to reduce friction and
wear, the valve's rolling hinge gives a constantly varying point of contact in the
hinge area between the leaflet and the housing. An open channel in the hinge cavity
allows continuous hinge washing during the entire cardiac cycle. The mechanical heart
valve prosthesis has unique sewing rings specifically designed for mitral and aortic
applications, as well as a special aortic version for very small annuli. Each sewing
ring design enhances the function of the valve in its position and size, including
the unique hyperbolic shape of the mitral valve and the downstream extension of the
aortic. Two semicircular leaflets open to 80&#xBA; and the closing angle is 20&#xBA;
(Fig. 2), resulting in a central, near laminar flow. The housing stability is
increased by a stellite stiffener ring over the solid pyrolytic valve housing. The
pivot hinge mechanism is located within the housing, and leaflet motion is by
rotation and translation. Curved leaflets enhance central flow and rapid closure. The
pivot ball and slot mechanism facilitate retrograde washing by relatively high
velocity jets. Leaflets close on a circular ledge within the housing to reduce
regurgitation and stress on the hinge mechanism. The pivot ball hinge closes by
rotation and translation. Downstream of the mechanical heart valve is located the
elastic artery wall with sinus. The artery wall is assumed to be an elastic circular
tube with diameter of 25.0 mm. The mechanical heart valve consists of three parts:
the leaflet which controls the blood flow, the orifice ring which supports the
leaflets, and the sewing cuff which attaches and fixes the orifice ring to the tissue
of the heart muscle (Fig. 1). A kinematic model of the mechanical heart valve
consists of three links and four joints. And the mobility of the valve movement is
two. A kinematic diagram of the MHV is shown in Fig. 2. A computational solid model
of the curved leaflet for the structural analysis is shown in Fig. 3(a). Tables 1 and
2 show the dimensions of the bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis (aortic and
mitral valves) on sale commercially.<component x="305.99" y="182.72" width="202.07"

mechanical heart valve prosthesis The position of the leaflet where the blood fluid
force applied on the leaflet becomes the maximum value was computed to be the closing
position of the leaflet through previous studies [28, 29]. Hence, the structural
mechanic analysis of the leaflet is carried out at the closing position of the
leaflet according to the leaflet thickness variation to get the thickness effects on
the structural strength of the leaflet. A numerical analysis methodology (FEM) is
used for the structural mechanic analysis. The finite element model for the
structural mechanic analysis of the leaflet is shown in Fig. 3(b). The number of
element is 72,446, and the number of node is 81,526 (Table 3). The sewing cuff and
the orifice ring are neglected in the structural analysis, because they do not affect
the analysis results. The orifice ring is assumed as a rigid ,u ,u ) are conbody.
Three degrees of freedom (u x y z strained at the hinge point and on the outer

symmetric boundary condition (u z the symmetric surface (z=0) of the model (Fig. 4).
=0) is Also the symmetric boundary condition (u y applied on the symmetric surface
(y=0), since both leaflets contact this symmetric surface (Fig. 4). The fluid force
which is the external force acting on the leaflet is exerted as normal uniform
pressure onto the leaflet surface (Fig. 4). The material of the leaflet is assumed to
be Si-Alloyed PyC (the yield stress is 407.7 MPa) (Table 4). Young's modulus,
Poisson's ratio and the density of the material used are 30.5GPa, 3 , respectively
(Table 4). The 0.3 and 2,116 Kg/m blood flow pressure applied to the curved leaflet
surface is assumed to vary up to a very high value in the analysis. Actually the
maximum value of the single blood flow pressure applied to the valve leaflet in the
human heart is 120 mmHg (about 16 KPa). The MHV implanted in the human heart should
be operated constantly (approximately 38 million cycles per year) for life-long time.
Hence, a very strong structural strength of the leaflet should be secured for the
safe operation of the MHV prosthesis in the human heart. This severe condition
requires much higher blood flow pressure than a single blood flow pressure applied on
to the valve leaflet in the structural analysis. Therefore a thorough investigation
of the stress and deflection variations of the curved leaflet according to the high
blood flow pressure variation is carried out in this study by applying a very high
blood flow pressure at which the equivalent stress occurring inside the very thin
leaflet (with 0.5 mm thickness) first exceeds the yield stress (407.7 MPa) of the
leaflet material (see Table 5). A large deformation is also expected to occur in the
leaflet for the applied high blood pressure to require the nonlinear structural
analysis. Since the large deformation occurring in the leaflet is only due to the
high blood pressure, only geometric nonlinearity is assumed. Also linear structural
analysis is simultaneously performed for comparison. In the previous studies [28, 29]
only a linear structural analysis was carried out for the applied<component x="90.6"

studies [28, 29] revealed the kinetic and kinematic behavior of the leaflet while the
MHV prosthesis was working in the human heart. According to the previous studies [28,
29], the structural deformation of the leaflet is expected at the closing position of
the valve where the maximum reaction force occurs at the hinge. Hence both the linear
and nonlinear structural mechanic analyses for the curved leaflet are carried out for
this closing position of the valve in the present study. 4. Analysis results and
discussions The structural deformation and stress distribution results obtained from
the structural analysis of the leaflet are shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, and Fig.
8. The maximum deflection occurs at the lower central part of the leaflet (Fig. 5,
Fig. 6) and the maximum stress occurs at the hinge of the leaflet (Part A in Fig. 7
and Fig. 8) for all leaflet thickness. Hence, the geometrically weak part is the
hinge part for this curved bileaflet mechanical heart valve prosthesis, and so a
fracture may possibly occur in this hinge part. This coincides with the in vivo
leaflet fracture observation made by Klepetko [32]. A large stress also occurs at the
lower sharp corner part of the leaflet end surface (Part B in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8).
Table 5 shows the variations of the mass and the weight of the leaflet and also the
computed equivalent stress variation according to the leaflet thickness change for
the applied blood pressure of 500 KPa. Fig. 9 shows the maximum deflection variations
and the maximum von Mises stress variations as the leaflet thickness varies from the
0.5 mm to 0.75 mm by 0.05 mm and the blood flow pressure varies up to 500 KPa. As
indicated in Fig. 9(a), the computed stresses do not show any difference between the
linear and the nonlinear structural analysis results for each leaflet thickness
(i.e., the linearly computed stress and the nonlinearly computed stress are almost
same.) while the computed stresses increase as the leaflet thickness becomes thinner
and thinner. This result is quite reasonable and anticipated because the stress
occurring in the leaflet should be proportional to the applied external blood
pressure regardless of the analysis type (linear or nonlinear analysis) if the
structure does not change itself. The thin leaflets are structurally weak because the
stress occurring in the leaflet becomes larger and larger as the leaflet thickness
becomes thinner and thinner as shown in Fig. 9(a). This result coincides with the
previous studies [28, 29]. The structural strength of a structure is usually decided
from the yield criterion (e.g., von Mises yield criterion, Tresca yield criterion,
etc.). According to the von Mises yield criterion, if the maximum value of the
equivalent stress occurring in the structure exceeds the yield stress of the
structure material, the structure begins to yield for the applied external load. From
this point of view, Table 5 shows that the 0.5 mm thickness leaflet is expected to
begin to yield for the applied 500 KPa blood pressure because the computed maximum
equivalent stress (411.88 MPa) in the leaflet exceeds the yield stress (407.7 MPa) of
the leaflet material, while other thickness leaflets do not seem to begin to yield.
Table 5 also shows that the structural strength is not directly proportional to the
leaflet thickness. The structural strength of the leaflet increases at a higher rate
than the leaflet weight (or thickness), e.g., the structural strength of the 0.65 mm
thickness leaflet is 1.41 (the ratio of the equivalent stresses of the 0.5 mm
thickness leaflet and the 0.65 mm leaflet thickness leaflet) times as large as the
structural strength of the 0.5 mm thickness leaflet while the weight of the 0.65 mm
thickness leaflet is 1.3 times as large as the weight of the 0.5 mm thickness
leaflet. From the design point of view, a safety factor (defined as the ratio of the
material yield stress to the maximum stress occurring in the structure) value of 2.0
is usually adopted as the design standard of the structure. According to this
standard, the maximum stress in the leaflet should not exceed the half value (203.85
MPa) of the yield stress (407.7 MPa) of the leaflet material adopted in this
analysis. Hence, stresses larger than 203.85 MPa in Table 6 are not desirable for the
in vivo use of the leaflet in the human heart. Table 6 shows that very thin 0.5 mm
and 0.55 mm thickness leaflets are not suitable for blood pressure greater than 300
KPa, 0.6 mm and 0.65 mm thickness leaflets are not suitable for blood pressure
greater than 350 KPa, 0.7 mm thickness leaflet is not suitable for blood pressure
above 400 KPa, and 0.75 mm thickness leaflet is not suitable for blood pressure
greater than 450 KPa. These results were not revealed in the previous studies [28,
29] where the maximum blood pressure applied on to the leaflet was 104 KPa. By
examining the computed deflections of the leaflet shown in Fig. 9(b), the result is
quite different from the stress results in Fig. 9(a). The computed deflections of the
leaflet increase as the leaflet thickness becomes thinner and thinner. This result
coincides with the previous studies [28, 29]. However, the difference between the
linear structural analysis result and the nonlinear structural analysis result
becomes larger and larger as the leaflet thickness becomes thinner and thinner and as
the applied blood pressure becomes larger and larger. Hence, the geometric
nonlinearity is very conspicuous for the very thin leaflet. Fig. 9(b) shows that the
geometric nonlinear deflections of the 0.5 mm thickness leaflet are conspicuous for
blood pressure above 250 KPa; the geometric nonlinear deflection of the 0.55 mm
thickness leaflet is conspicuous for the blood pressure over 300 KPa; the geometric
nonlinear deflection of the 0.60 mm and 0.65 mm thickness leaflets are conspicuous
for the blood pressure larger than 350 KPa; the geometric nonlinear deflection of the
0.70 mm thickness leaflet is conspicuous for the blood pressure larger than 400 KPa;
and the geometric nonlinear deflection of the 0.75 mm thickness leaflet is
conspicuous for the blood pressure larger than 450 KPa. Hence, geometric nonlinear
deflections occur in the very thin leaflet (e.g., 0.5 mm and 0.55 mm thickness
leaflets) for high blood pressures (300-500 KPa) applied to the leaflet surface, and
so these thin leaflets are not desirable for in vivo use in the human heart.
Therefore, a nonlinear structural analysis seems to be useful for the accurate design
of the bileaflet MHV prosthesis for high applied blood pressures. Conclusively, from
the present analysis very thin<component x="306.0" y="423.72" width="202.42"

nonlinear structural analyses required in the design of a bileaflet mechanical heart
valve prosthesis with curved leaflet are executed. The analysis results show that the
geometric nonlinear deflections of the very thin leaflets are conspicuous for high
applied blood pressures. Hence, the nonlinear structural analysis seems to be useful
for the design of the MHV prosthesis. Through the linear and nonlinear structural
analyses, this paper presents the moderate thickness leaflet for the applied blood
pressure as shown in Fig. 9 and in Table 6, and discusses the validity of the
structural strength of the leaflet according to the leaflet thickness variation and
the applied blood pressure variation. These results were not revealed in the previous
studies [28, 29]. And the structurally weak part, i.e., the hinge part revealed in
this study coincides with the in vivo leaflet fracture part observed in the existing
study which proves the validity of this numerical study. Acknowledgment This work was
