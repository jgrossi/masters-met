industry. It is a term that has come to encompass a large array of engineering and
design activities in the literature; however, in its basic form, reverse engineering
is simply the process of extracting information about a product from the product
itself. Depending on its use, it may or may not be advantageous to utilize a reverse
engineering strategy. As with any rational decision, reverse engineering is only
favorable when the benefits from its use outweigh the investment. Therefore, a
general understanding of the principles that increase the difficulty or investment
required to reverse engineer mechanical products would be helpful for everyone
affected by reverse engineering activities. In this paper, we articulate and explore
these fundamental principles after reviewing examples from the literature and from
our own experience. We then use the principles as a basis for the development of a
methodology to build barriers to reverse engineering into new products.<component

various connotations in different industry settings. At one end of the spectrum,
reverse engineering is associated with design theft and piracy with the intent to
plagiarize and capitalize on the work of others (Naumovich and Memon 2003; Grimm
2004). On the other hand, reverse engineering can be as conventional as competitive
benchmarking (Ulrich and Eppinger 2004) or as benign as the dissection of a popular
product by a curious consumer (McLoughlin 2008). Regardless of the motivation behind
its use, we adopt the following definition for this paper: Reverse engineering is the
process of extracting information about a product from the product itself (Harston
and Mattson 2010b). Notice that the definition of reverse engineering used here is
different from imitation, which we define as the process of replicating the
performance of an existing product in one or more of its performance areas (Knight et
al. 2009). Reverse engineering often leads to imitation; however, the definition of
reverse engineering as defined here limits the discussion to simply the
information-extraction process. There are many reasons to employ reverse engineering
as a viable engineering design tactic. A few common reasons are listed below:
&#x2022; To compare products through competitive benchmarking (Harrington 1991; Raja
2008) In preparation for imitating a product (Musker 1998) To obtain technical data
that do not exist (Pal et al. 2006; Creehan and Bidanda 2006; Urbanic and ElMaraghy
2009) To obtain technical data that the original supplier is no longer willing or

forced to spend additional time and resources in developing their own competing
technology, or, at a minimum, spend additional resources on extracting the
information (Grand 2004). Consequently, the original product is likely to maintain
larger portion of the market share for a longer period of time. Not all products
benefit from incorporating barriers to reverse engineering. Some products may be so
simple, or sold at low margins, so that incorporating barriers to reverse engineering
is not practical. Deciding which products are suitable for barrier implementation is
a critical question that can be answered by the methodology presented in this paper.
In this paper, we characterize the fundamental types of barriers to reverse engineer
mechanical components. We provide examples and theories from related fields to
illustrate how these barriers can potentially stymie reverse engineering efforts. In
so doing, we provide valuable insight into how one can either increase or decrease
the magnitude of a barrier to reverse engineering. Our tenet is that the difficulty
to reverse engineer a product can (i) be controlled and (ii) designed in a strategic
manner. Further, the methods presented in this paper facilitate the implementation of
our tenet. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we define
and explain the fundamental types of barriers to reverse engineering. Section 3
presents two metrics that may be used to analyze barriers to reverse engineer a
product. In Sect. 4, we introduce a barrier implementation methodology to assist
original designers in creating products that are more difficult to reverse engineer.
Finally, in Sec. 6, we provide concluding remarks.<component x="65.59" y="647.99"

reverse engineering has been defined and examined in detail by both Ingle (1994) and
Otto and Wood (2001). Additional techniques for digitizing physical objects for CAD
applications have been presented by Varady (2001), Sarkar and Menq (1991), and Raja
(2008). Though there exist multiple descriptions of the reverse engineering process,
they can all be distilled to three simple steps as seen in Fig. 1. The three basic
reverse engineering steps are: (i) planning, (ii) data collection, and (iii) data
processing. As Fig. 1 suggests, the process can be iterative in nature. During data
processing, for example, the reverse engineering team must validate extracted
information, so as to know when the process is complete. If errors are discovered,
due to missing or low quality data, the reverse engineering team must extract more
information from the product. When barriers to reverse engineering<component

product acquisition was done legitimately (Samuelson and Scotchmer 2002; McLoughlin
2008). These laws are justified by many, since the time and effort required to
reverse engineer a product is often viewed as substantial enough to allow the
original designer to maintain a large market share (Samuelson and Scotchmer 2002).
Interestingly, patents facilitate reverse engineering as they disclose critical
product information and key technologies. In some cases, laws are outright violated
and products are continually built directly from patent information even though the
patent owners have claimed patent infringement and seek compensation (Maskus et al.
1998). Thus, it may not be wise for an original designer to rely solely on legal
barriers to mitigate reverse engineering attempts of their product. The remainder of
this section investigates in greater detail how these three barrier categories
interact to create information-extraction difficulties during the reverse engineering
process.<component x="306.14" y="498.28" width="238.11" height="233.12" page="3"

measured with traditional measurement devices such as micrometers or calipers
(Campbell and Flynn 2001); therefore, their complexity could be potentially difficult
to capture during the data-collection step, as they require more expensive, and user
intensive, measurement equipment. This is exemplified by Soo et al. in (2005) where
the difficulties of digitally capturing the complicated and arbitrary curves of a
Chinese bamboo-net handicraft are discussed in detail. Additionally, the physical
size of the measurement can have a large impact on the information stickiness. For
instance, as computer chips have decreased in size, they have become increasingly
more difficult to reverse engineer (James 2006). Products can contain a large amount
of information. One challenge for the reverse engineering team lies in
distinsuperfluous guishing between information that is and information that is
pertinentto product performance (Harston and Mattson 2010b). This distinction can be
difficult to make, especially when products contain a plethora of nonessential
information or when essential information is disguised to appear trivial (McLoughlin
2008). Extracting superfluous information will decrease the return on reverse
engineering investment, as resources are wasted on information that does not provide
significant benefits. Therefore, it is important for the reverse engineering team to
make this distinction, if possible in the planning step (see Fig. 1), before
collecting data from the product. Additionally, one must ensure that all pertinent
information is extracted from the product. This is typically done during the
data-processing step. McEvily (2005) presents a case study of reverse engineering
failure, where a butterfly valve in an aircraft engine caused the plane to crash. He
original alloy and part dimensions [of the states that the butterfly valve] were
accurately duplicated ; however, the firm reverse engineering the valve failed to
extract the heat treating process required to properly reconstruct the valve. As a
result, the valve was inadequately manufactured and failed in use. Another aspect of
product complexity is the accessibility of pertinent information. Products can be
difficult to dissect; essential components of the product can be enclosed in the
product in such a way that nondestructive disassembly is nearly impossible (Pooley
and Graves 2008). This is the case with many computer chips, where the coating on the
chip is designed so that when the coating is removed, one or more layers of the chip
are also destroyed, thereby making the rest of the chip difficult, if not impossible,
to reverse engineer (Dam and Lin 1996). Another way to limit accessibility of
pertinent information is to add locks to a product. For mechanical products, this may
be in the form of custom made fasteners (Campbell and Flynn 2001; Grand 2004). In
general, the harder it is to access the information, the stickier the information
becomes. The fundamental principles to understand about the technical complexity of
barriers to reverse engineering can be summarized with the following: &#x2022; The
technical complexity of a product or feature is an internal barrier to reverse
engineering-the original designer has a direct influence over the magnitude of this
barrier. When sticky information interacts with other sticky information in a
product, the result is a powerful barrier to reverse engineering. The stickiness of
pertinent information can be increased by reducing its accessibility or including
more superfluous information in the product to disguise pertinent features. We note
that in Sect. 4, a list of specific actions to increase product complexity is
provided.<component x="51.02" y="87.31" width="238.11" height="644.08" page="4"

lateness="0.29411764705882354" reference_score="6.51">We now turn our attention to
external barriers to reverse engineering; specifically, the barriers associated with
the availability of necessary resources. By necessary resources, we mean required
tools (including tools for disassembly, performance analysis, data synthesis,
measurement etc.), samples of the product, and any other object or software that is
required to successfully extract information from the product itself. Unlike internal
barriers, the original designer can only indirectly influence the magnitude of
external barriers as they may not be able to control the resources extrinsic to the
product. However, by strategically designing the product, original designers can
require those reverse engineering to use resources that are expensive or not readily
available in order to be successful at reverse engineering. While there may be more
than one approach to extract information from a product, some information can only be
acquired with the correct tools such as the material microstructure of a custom made
material that is critical for proper performance of the product. On the other hand, a
reverse engineering team can overcome many barriers by acquiring essential resources.
First and foremost, the product or system being analyzed needs to be accessible. Even
if a product is readily available on the market, it may be expensive or may only be
available in limited quantities, thereby discouraging others from attempting to
reverse engineer the product as the required investment increases. Often times, it is
of interest to those reverse engineering to know how the original product fails,
possibly to prevent or improve the conditions of failure. Clearly, when only a few
sample parts are available, extracting this type of information can be difficult
(Ingle 1994). Second, equipment used during the data-collection step (see step two of
Fig. 1) needs to be available. Often, a high level of precision and accuracy is
needed when collecting information from a product. This is much easier to accomplish
with appropriate equipment, which for geometric information could include
micrometers, gages, coordinate measuring machines, and optical scanning equipment
(Thompson et al. 1999) or for material microstructure information could include a
scanning electron microscope (Adams et al. 2005). At the same time, a significant
amount of skill and experience, see Sect. 2.3, may be needed to operate these
measuring tools, as well as to understand their limitations and shortcomings (Varady
et al. 1997, 2005; Ali et al. 2008; Grimm 2006b). Third, converting collected data
into a usable form during the data-processing step (see step three of Fig. 1) can
also be challenging. For geometric information, this form is often digital, meaning
in the form of a CAD model or drawing. This, of course, requires CAD or CAE software.
Much care is needed during this process to ensure that minimal error is introduced
when processing the data (Bradley and Currie 2005; Creehan and Bidanda 2006). For
material microstructure information, the data collected through scanning electron
microscopy needs to be analyzed with orientation image microscopy (OIM) software
(Adams et al. 2005). Clearly, if this equipment is unavailable, the magnitude of the
barrier to reverse engineering will be large. Finally, proper testing and validation
of extracted data are vital to the success of a reverse engineering project.

relevance, need to be verified as the data collected may or may not actually be
pertinent. Additionally, some information may still be needed to adequately reverse
engineer the product. Verification can take on many different forms, each requiring
specific resources. CAD systems can help verify that all the needed geometric
dimensions have been extracted. CAE systems can further aid in this process by
analyzing motion, stress, heat transfer, and failure modes. If the necessary
equipment is available, prototypes can be built and subsequently tested for the
purpose of verification. For example, the non-circular brass gears in Fig. 2a were
originally part of a photocopy machine. As part of this study, we reverse engineered
the gears to illustrate the verification process. The gears were measured using an
optical comparator, and the data were manually entered into a CAD system. The
resulting CAD model appears in Fig. 2b. A motion analysis was done using CAE software
to verify that the gears properly meshed. Acrylic prototypes were then manufactured
using a laser cutter and are shown in Fig. 2c. The acrylic prototype was made five
times larger, to accommodate for the resolution of the laser cutter. Finally, brass
gears were cut in true scale using wire electric discharge machining (EDM), as shown
in Fig. 2d. Multiple tools were needed to verify that we extracted the correct
information about the non-circular gears. In fact, the prototypes revealed some flaws
in our extracted data, as the reconstructed brass gears did not perform as well as
the original gears. If the necessary resources were not readily available (optical
comparator, CAD and CAE software, laser cutter, wire EDM), then this process would
have taken a different path characterized by its own difficulty. Therefore, we can
see that the resources available to the reverse engineering team influence the
difficulty to reverse engineer the product. The fundamental principles to understand
about the resource-availability category of barriers can be summarized with the
following: &#x2022; The availability of the necessary resources is an external
barrier to reverse engineering-the original designer typically has an indirect
influence on this barrier. When few or no samples of the product are available, the
magnitude of this barrier increases dramatically. Proper equipment is often required
for efficient product dissection, information extraction, and data processing. The
absence of this equipment could severely reduce the quality of collected data. The
barrier can be made larger by embedding information that requires specialized and/or
unavailable tools to extract. Section 4 provides specific actions that can be taken
to increase the magnitude of this type of barriers.<component x="306.14" y="323.95"

lateness="0.4117647058823529" reference_score="7.07">The third and last category of
barriers to reverse engineering is the skill of the reverse engineering team.
Clearly, when required skills are absent, the barrier to reverse engineering is
larger. Skill can be considered from two perspectives. First, a familiarity or basic
understanding of the science governing the system being analyzed is often essential
for effective reverse engineering. For instance, a working knowledge of chemistry is
necessary to extract chemical information from a battery. Second, expertise and
experience with the reverse engineering process and its associated tools is also
extremely important. More than likely, a successful reverse engineering project will
require the synergy and collaboration of a group of professionals with different
skill sets-economists, market analysts, accountants, engineers, managers, etc. Thus,
skills in multidisciplinary design and project management are valuable. The reverse
engineering team must begin by considering the purpose for reverse engineering in the
planning step of Fig. 1. This will determine whether or not there is a need to
capture as-builtinformation from the product ordesign intent information (Grimm
2006a). In its extreme form, the as-built approach aims to copy every bit of
information from a product to the best ability of the team. Even though the as-built
approach focuses on copying all information, it is likely that some assumptions will
be made, i.e. assuming that bolts in a system are consistent sizes therefore not
requiring a detailed analysis of each bolt of a similar shape and size. Some
deviation from the original product may also occur due to manufacturing tolerances
and errors made during the reverse engineering process. On the other hand, design
intent attempts to determine the nominal performance and understand the desired
relationship between components. For simple features, recovering design intent may be
straight forward; however, with more complex features such as a turbine blade
(Mohaghegh et al. 2007), distinguishing between manufacturing variations and design
intent becomes significantly more difficult, or in other words, the likelihood of
making an invalid assumption increases. Although methodologies do exist for
extracting design intent when reverse engineering (Barbero 2009), recovering design
intent is likely to require more resources and time (Grimm 2006a) when compared to
the as-built approach. Therefore, experience with reverse engineering would help in
selecting an appropriate extraction strategy. A well-known historical example that
illustrates this type of barrier to reverse engineering occurred during World War II.
After a forced landing in the former Soviet Union, an American B-29 bomber, pictured
in Fig. 3a, was reverse engineered by the Soviets to yield the Tupolev Tu-4 bomber,
shown in Fig. 3b. Josef Stalin ordered that the downed B-29 (eventually, a total of
four such aircraft came under exactly Soviet control) be copied (Boyne 2009; Suvorov
1981), so as to ensure that all the separate components would assemble correctly. It
has even been rumored that existing damage on the B-29 fuselage (Danelek 2008) and
manufacturing defects such as a small, misplaced rivet hole on the B-29 left wing
(Suvorov 1981) were incorporated into the original Tu-4 design. This would indicate
that the Soviets took more of an as-built approach to reverse engineering the B-29.
As a result, the Tu-4 is nearly an exact replica of the B-29, with the exception of
some subsystems such as the Soviet manufactured engines and cannons (Boyne 2009 ).
Additionally, the Soviet's thought it beneficial to extract information in the native
units of the design (English units). Therefore, the Soviets needed to buy measuring
equipment in Canada, England, and the United States and retrain thousands of
engineers and technicians to work with the new measurement system (Suvorov 1981).
Although the magnitude of the total barrier to reverse engineer the B-29 was large,
the Soviets were able to utilize nearly unlimited resources in conjunction with
enough skill to successfully reverse engineer the B-29. The fundamental principles to
understand about the barriers associated with the skill of the reverse engineering
team can be summarized with the following: &#x2022; A reverse engineering team is
more likely to succeed if they have a basic understanding of the science being
analyzed anda familiarity with the process and tools of reverse engineering. Knowing
which approach is needed-as-built, design intent, or a combination of both-will help
maximize the return on reverse engineering investment. Similar to technical
complexity and availability of resources previously discussed, in Sect. 4, we provide
a list of ways to make a product more difficult to reverse engineer. In this section,
Sect. 2, we have explored the fundamentals of barriers that can stymie reverse
engineering efforts during any step of the reverse engineering process. We have
demonstrated that by increasing the complexity of a product-such as making
information inaccessible and introducing complicated information interactions-we can
increase the reverse engineering barrier. An example of a reverse-engineered
butterfly valve that failed demonstrated the difficulty of extracting information
that interacts with other information, and to extract information that is difficult
to access. We next demonstrated how reverse engineering can be made more difficult
when competitors lack necessary resources. Although original designers may not have
direct control over the resources available to competitors, when a product design
requires special tools or materials that the competitors are likely not to have, the
barrier to reverse engineering is increased. An example of non-circular gears was
given which shows that resources available influence the reverse engineering
difficulty. Finally, we demonstrated how the skills of the reverse engineering team
also affect the reverse engineering barrier. Similar to resources available, the
original designers can only indirectly affect what skills are required, since they
cannot control what skills the reverse engineering team will have. The example of the
Soviet replicate of an American B-29 bomber demonstrates that even technically
complex products can be adequately reverse engineered when the team has the proper
skill set. In the next section, we add to this anecdotal understanding of what
affects barriers to reverse engineering and present metrics that have been developed
to systematically characterize the reverse engineering barrier. This systematic
barrier characterization enables designers to quantify what barriers are most
effective and efficient in specific design applications. This can even be done in

present two metrics that have been published in the literature that are used for
characterizing the barrier to reverse engineer any product. The purpose of this
section is not to present the full development of the metrics, but to give a brief
summary for convenience to the reader and to facilitate the discussion in Sect. 4.
Qualitative quantitative as well as metrics exist for characterizing reverse
engineering difficulty. One qualitaattack difficulty tive measure has been termed the
(Weingart et al. 1990) and is summarized in Table 1. This classification system
ranges from 1 to 6 based on the tools and skills required to reverse engineer a
product. Similar qualitative classifications have been presented by Christiansen
(2006) and Abraham et al. (1991). An advantage of these measures is that they are
intuitive, and can be easily evaluated in the early stages of the product development
process. Quantitative metrics may be less intuitive, but can be used with numerical
optimization techniques to literally maximize the time and barrier to reverse
engineer a product (Harston and Mattson 2010b) and its tolerances (Curtis et al.
2009). We provide a brief overview here of the fundamental metrics presented by
Harston and Mattson in (2010b), and we refer the reader to their work for a more
detailed explanation of the equations and variables in the metrics. Harston and
Mattson adapted Ohm's law (Ohm 1827) to meaningfully (with an average error of 12.2%)
quantify the time and barrier to reverse engineer products. They observed that the
rate at which information can be extracted from a product is dependent upon the ratio
of known information to the total information contained by a product. This is similar
to how the discharge rate of a<component x="306.14" y="76.6" width="238.11"

reverse engineering, between unextracted information and time, and for the capacitor,

example, consider a large flat plate with numerous holes of various sizes throughout.
There is a small barrier to measure the ( B diameter of any single hole (indicating a

engineering time relatively large. The qualitative and quantitative metrics are
related in that when the tool complexity and skill required increase, then the metric
also increases. However, there is not a direct correlation between the two measures,
i.e., a level 3 attack difficulty does not directly correlate with a specified ( B
range of . This is because the quantitative metrics are also influenced by the
relative amounts of each information type contained by a product, while the
qualitative metrics are not. Ultimately, these metrics can be used to quantify and
compare the effectiveness of multiple types of barriers and help designers select
which barriers will be efficient and effective for the desired application. Due to
the numerical nature of the metrics, numerical optimization may be used to ( B

achieved when a firm successfully develops an innovative product acts as the driving
force for technological progress. However, if a competing firm can successfully
reverse engineer the innovative product, then the market advantage of the original
firm is quickly lost (Macmillan et al. 1985). When this occurs, the incentive for
innovation is reduced (Shapiro 1985). Therefore, it is in the best interest of
original designers to design products that are difficult to reverse engineer. A
product can be made difficult to reverse engineer simply by making one critical
component difficult to reverse engineer. For example, consider how the performance of
an entire aircraft system was influenced by a single critical component, namely the
butterfly valve described in Sect. 2.1. While critical component selection is the
subject of another paper by the authors, in the current paper, we assume that the
critical components for receiving barriers to reverse engineering have been
previously determined. As a note, components that are heavily constrained are often
the best candidates for implementing barriers. The more a component is constrained by
specifications or interactions with other components, the less likely competitors
will be able to design around the barriers, thus requiring competitors to overcome
the barriers. Other guidelines have been presented in Table 2 to facilitate
implementation of barriers into products. For the remainder<component x="51.02"

the perspective of the original designer, as we present a methodology to implement
barriers to reverse engineering. A five step process is used to implement barriers to
reverse engineering as illustrated in the flow chart in Fig. 4. The first step is to
gather information (what is the barrier trying to protect, what are the time and
budget constraints, how many barriers are required, etc.) and specify target values
(target B T;, attack difficulty level, etc.). It is important to understand what
information the barrier is trying to protect, as well as understand the competitor's
ability to extract that information. Different barriers are more effective in
different scenarios. If the goal is to impede consumers from discovering what
components are used in an electrical circuit, some have found an effective barrier to
be encoding labels for resistors and capacitors in the electronics (McLoughlin 2008).
If the goal is to protect proprietary information, creating a product that cannot be
opened without destruction of critical components may be a sufficient barrier. If the
goal is to increase the required skills and resources of competitors, one may use
material microstructures that are anisotropic, heterogeneous, and are difficult to
detect or reproduce. By understanding what information needs to be protected, the
design team can determine if multiple small barriers will be more effective or a
single large barrier. Multiple small barriers are beneficial as they require
competitors to solve several problems that may be completely independent. A careful
review of the metrics in Sect. 3 shows that the difficulty of overcoming multiple
independent barriers is more than the sum of those same barriers. If only a single
barrier is implemented, and competitors are able to efficiently overcome the barrier,
the information may not be adequately protected. However, a<component x="306.14"

(Reed and DeFillippi 1990) Avoid explicitly disclosing information such as labels on

Design and implement multiple functionally-equivalent configurations of the same
product (Dube et al. 2008) While not all of these candidate barriers may always be
practical to implement, the goal is to make the competitors spend time and resources
on gathering information that is either not needed or require them to extract
information that is expensive (either in time and/or resources). Ideally, any barrier
introduced would require multiple iterations through the reverse engineering process
(seen in Fig. 1). It is important to note that a barrier does not need to be
impossible to overcome. Some believe that a barrier is sufficient when competitors
spend as much time and resources as was spent in developing the original product,
(Dam and Lin 1996; Grand 2004) while others believe that a barrier is sufficient if
it can keep competitors out of the market until market saturation (Knight et al.
2009). Following the flow chart in Fig. 4, the third step is to compare the
performance of the candidate barriers to the target values of B Tand . This is done
by utilizing the metrics presented in Sect. 3. Candidate barriers that do not meet
the specified requirements are removed. For the fourth step, the designer must either
choose one (or more) of the remaining barriers or generate additional candidates with
more favorable characteristics. While some implementable barriers may simultaneously
increase product performance (Harston and Mattson 2010a), other barriers may have
adverse effects in other performance areas of the product (Christiansen et al. 2006).
In the case of the latter, the designer must balance the benefits of increased
security against potentially increased implementation costs, decreased system
performance, and increased maintenance costs (Christiansen et al. 2006). This
selection process can be facilitated with any multiobjective optimization routine, a
weighted algorithm, or a scoring matrix similar to those used in a product
development process (Ulrich and Eppinger 2004). The final box in Fig. 4 is to
establish barrier related requirements. In a typical product development process,
product requirements are derived from customer specifications. The barrier related
product requirements are additional product requirements that must be met to
effectively implement the desired barrier(s) into the product. Contingent upon a
successful product development process with the new requirements, the added/improved
feature(s) will increase the difficulty to reverse engineer the product without
greatly degrading the performance of other product features, and in some cases
improve product performance.<component x="320.71" y="81.24" width="223.54"

is to illustrate how to strategically make a simple device more difficult to reverse
engineer, using the principles of the barrier implementation methodology presented in
Sec. 4. We begin with a simple cantilever L-beam of pure copper, as shown by the
benchmark L-beam in Fig. 5. One end of the beam is rigidly attached while a force is
applied to the free end to d make the end of the beam undergo a deflection, . A
similar beam is actually located in some cell phones as part of an electrical
connector assembly (Knight et al. 2009), and it plays an important role in keeping
consistent electrical contact in the circuitry of a phone. Thus, it would be
reasonable to need to protect this device against comparable cell phone
manufacturers, who may attempt to reverse engineer the L-beam for numerous reasons
(see Sect. 1). The first step of the barrier implementation methodology, as discussed
in Sect. 4, is to gather information and specify target values. For the design of the
L-beam, we determined what skills and resources are available and what skills and
resources are likely unavailable to competitors. We have the ability to analyze and
design for both geometry andmaterial microstructures. Microstructure analysis and
design requires uncommon skills and tools (scanning electron microscope, orientation
imaging software, etc.). It is likely that the entities that are interested in
reverse engineering the L-beam electrical connector will not have access to these
resources. Therefore, we sought to incorporate barriers that utilize microstructure
design. Ideally, we would design and implement a reverse engineering barrier into the
L-beam that is practically impossible to overcome. However, that large of a barrier
may require a significant amount of time and resources to develop and implement. A
more reasonable barrier is one that requires competitors to spend at least as much
time reverse engineering the L-beam as we spent developing the original product. With

out of pure, homogeneous, isotropic copper. The L-beam can be reverse engineered with
common tools such as vernier calipers and radius gages. Candidate A This candidate
takes the benchmark design and subtracts three elliptical holes, thereby adding more
geometric information to the L-beam. While there is more information to extract, the
same extraction tools that can be used to reverse engineer the benchmark can be used
to reverse engineer this candidate. Candidate B This candidate adds curves to the
exterior of the benchmark L-beam. These curves require uncommon measurement tools to
be reverse engineered easily, such as an optical comparator or a coordinate measuring
machine. Candidate C This candidate couples the geometry of the benchmark L-beam with
a single, strategically oriented, anisotropic copper layer. The material
microstructure now plays an integral part in the L-beam's performance, thereby
requiring this information to be extracted from the product. This requires highly
specialized skills and tools such as a scanning electron microscope and OIM software.
Candidate D This candidate combines the geometry of Candidate B with the material
anisotropy of Candidate C. Candidate E This candidate is composed of a heterogeneous
copper material, created by a process called friction stir welding (Owen 2006). This
L-beam can be reverse engineered with the same tools as candidates C and D; however,
there are two material microstructures that need to be identified and analyzed.
Candidate F This candidate utilizes ultrasonic consolidation (Harston and Mattson
2010a) to create an L-beam with four, thin, anisotropic, copper layers, each
independently oriented, to achieve the desired performance. This results in four
different material microstructures, each of which needs to be identified and
analyzed. Furthermore, ultrasonic consolidation can be virtually undetectable to the
naked eye, potentially disguising the layers as one single layer to anyone reverse
engineering the L-beam. We first analyzed each L-beam with the finite element
analysis software ANSYS to ensure that (i) the L-beam -4 achieved the desired
deflection of -1.50 * 10 m under a load of about 0.60 N and (ii) the L-beam did not
plastically deform. We also determined, qualitatively and quantitatively, the reverse
engineering barrier and time for each L-beam candidate. As discussed in Sect. 3, we
need to first K identify the quantity of information, , the rate at which F P that
information can be extracted, , and the effort, , put into extracting the information
contained by the L-beams (i.e., geometry, material, and material microstructure). K F

dependent upon the accuracy of K F P;, and . Numerous papers from the literature
discuss how to reverse engineer geometric features utilizing CAD systems (Varady and
Facello 2005; Stamati and Fudos 2007; Li et al. 2010. Toledo et al. (2008) present an
efficient method by which geometric information may be determined, even from
complicated systems, in an effort to determine original geometric data. Varady et al.
(2007) present an automated approach to create CAD representations of structures that
are accurate, capture design intent, and require little or no user assistance. Many
of these methods may be used directly to K estimate the quantity of geometric
information, , cong tained by a product. By recording the length of time to extract
the geometric information, an estimation of the rate F at which geometric information
is extracted, , can also be g determined. While the information-extraction methods
presented above may be effective for large systems, for simple parts, such as the
cantilever L-beam, it may be better to simply count the quantity of geometric
information. The method that we use to quantify the geometric features of simple
parts is based upon the degrees-of-freedom analysis often found in many CAD systems

used for the L-beam candidates in determining the quantity of geometric information.
To account for the thickness dimension of each L-beam, K we add one (1) to the
obtained with Eq. 11. Note that g we did not assume that lines are parallel or
perpendicular, and we also did not assume that the arcs have the same radii. If
desired, Eq. 11 can be modified to represent additional constraints. While this
method of determining geometric information may be used for any product or feature,
the automated CAD approaches (de Toledo et al. 2008; Varady et al. 2007) are likely
to be more efficient when analyzing complicated products and systems. While
understanding geometric information is critical to developing (or overcoming)
barriers to reverse engineering, arguably the most efficient barriers will be
material related.(Harston and Mattson 2010a). As such, we also analyze the L-beams
from the material perspective. The amount of K material information, is determined by
how many different m materials (without regard to material microstructure) each
L-beam candidate includes. Likewise, the amount of material K , contained by each
L-beamis microstructure information, mm based on the number of unique microstructures
present. F The flow rate, , for each information type was determined from the
authors' experience and with informationextraction tests similar to those described
in Harston and Mattson (2010b). Additionally, We took a conservative P approach by
assuming to be equal to one (1) for all information types in each candidate, implying
that a competitor would exert a full effort in their reverse engineering attempts.
These parameters are listed in Table 3. K F P; With , and defined, we used Eqs. 1, 3,
4, 6 and 7 to ( ( B T determine the and of each candidate L-beam. The results of this
analysis are listed in Table 4. Using these results, the barrier selection
process-the fourth step of the barrier implementation methodology- becomes
significantly easier to perform. Candidates A and B do not meet the reverse
engineering time requirement 5 ( T ( greater than 1.00 * 10 s), while Candidate D
does not 4 ( B meet the barrier requirement ( greater than 5.00 * 10 ). Therefore,
they are removed from the candidate pool. An interesting result is that Candidate C
has a larger barrier than Candidate D, although Candidate D would appear to be more
complex. This phenomena is explained by ( B examining the meaning of , which is a
measure of the any difficulty to extract pertinent information from the device. We
see that since Candidate D contains more geometric information, which comparatively
is easier to extract than material or microstructure information, it has a lower
barrier than Candidate C. In other words, the average difficulty to extract a unit of
pertinent information from Candidate D is less than the average difficulty to extract
a unit of pertinent information from Candidate C. In this case, the time required to
reverse engineer Candidate D is larger, simply because there is more information to
extract. ( ( B T This exemplifies the distinct nature of and . As all the remaining
candidates meet the established reverse engineering requirements, additional criteria

candidates from one another. If manufacturing cost is the most important objective,
than Candidate C may be optimal, as it only requires the material to be strategically
oriented during the manufacturing process with no need for expensive welding
equipment. The fifth and final step of the barrier implementation methodology is to
establish barrier related product requirements. Assuming Candidate C was selected to
be implemented, some additional product requirements might include: material
properties must be homogeneous, L-beam must be manufactured in a single plane, and
material thickness is constrained since it is difficult to obtain thick sheets of
strongly anisotropic materials. It is clear from the results of this case study that
the barrier and time to reverse engineer a mechanical component can be manipulated in
a strategic manner. For instance, the predicted time to reverse engineer Candidate F
is about 160 times greater than the benchmark. This is a significant increase,
especially considering that a conservative approach was used. Conservative because we
assumed that a reverse engineering team would immediately discern the existence of
four disparate material microstructures without iteratively performing the reverse
engineering process. In reality, the team reverse engineering the L-beams would
likely initially miss this information, as layers that are welded together with
ultrasonic consolidation are difficult to detect without the proper skills and
equipment. Even if the team has the required skills and equipment, it is still likely
to require multiple iterations before the microstructure is reverse engineered.
Additionally, we note that the L-beam is a simple device. If this methodology were
applied to a more technically complex product-which may include multiple component
interactions-then the methodology can aid in potentially creating powerful, if not
insurmountable, barriers to reverse engineering.<component x="51.02" y="153.64"

can influence the magnitude of internal barriers to reverse engineering, while those

methodology-which is used in conjunction with the traditional product development
process-that enables designers to strategically design products with built-in
barriers to reverse engineering. When implemented, these barriers to reverse
engineering impede competitors from extracting critical information from innovative

industry. It is a term that has come to encompass a large array of engineering and
design activities in the literature; however, in its basic form, reverse engineering
is simply the process of extracting information about a product from the product
itself. Depending on its use, it may or may not be advantageous to utilize a reverse
engineering strategy. As with any rational decision, reverse engineering is only
favorable when the benefits from its use outweigh the investment. Therefore, a
general understanding of the principles that increase the difficulty or investment
required to reverse engineer mechanical products would be helpful for everyone
affected by reverse engineering activities. In this paper, we articulate and explore
these fundamental principles after reviewing examples from the literature and from
our own experience. We then use the principles as a basis for the development of a
methodology to build barriers to reverse engineering into new products.<component

various connotations in different industry settings. At one end of the spectrum,
reverse engineering is associated with design theft and piracy with the intent to
plagiarize and capitalize on the work of others (Naumovich and Memon 2003; Grimm
2004). On the other hand, reverse engineering can be as conventional as competitive
benchmarking (Ulrich and Eppinger 2004) or as benign as the dissection of a popular
product by a curious consumer (McLoughlin 2008). Regardless of the motivation behind
its use, we adopt the following definition for this paper: Reverse engineering is the
process of extracting information about a product from the product itself (Harston
and Mattson 2010b). Notice that the definition of reverse engineering used here is
different from imitation, which we define as the process of replicating the
performance of an existing product in one or more of its performance areas (Knight et
al. 2009). Reverse engineering often leads to imitation; however, the definition of
reverse engineering as defined here limits the discussion to simply the
information-extraction process. There are many reasons to employ reverse engineering
as a viable engineering design tactic. A few common reasons are listed below:
&#x2022; To compare products through competitive benchmarking (Harrington 1991; Raja
2008) In preparation for imitating a product (Musker 1998) To obtain technical data
that do not exist (Pal et al. 2006; Creehan and Bidanda 2006; Urbanic and ElMaraghy

forced to spend additional time and resources in developing their own competing
technology, or, at a minimum, spend additional resources on extracting the
information (Grand 2004). Consequently, the original product is likely to maintain
larger portion of the market share for a longer period of time. Not all products
benefit from incorporating barriers to reverse engineering. Some products may be so
simple, or sold at low margins, so that incorporating barriers to reverse engineering
is not practical. Deciding which products are suitable for barrier implementation is
a critical question that can be answered by the methodology presented in this paper.
In this paper, we characterize the fundamental types of barriers to reverse engineer
mechanical components. We provide examples and theories from related fields to
illustrate how these barriers can potentially stymie reverse engineering efforts. In
so doing, we provide valuable insight into how one can either increase or decrease
the magnitude of a barrier to reverse engineering. Our tenet is that the difficulty
to reverse engineer a product can (i) be controlled and (ii) designed in a strategic
manner. Further, the methods presented in this paper facilitate the implementation of
our tenet. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we define
and explain the fundamental types of barriers to reverse engineering. Section 3
presents two metrics that may be used to analyze barriers to reverse engineer a
product. In Sect. 4, we introduce a barrier implementation methodology to assist
original designers in creating products that are more difficult to reverse engineer.
Finally, in Sec. 6, we provide concluding remarks.<component x="65.59" y="647.99"

reverse engineering has been defined and examined in detail by both Ingle (1994) and
Otto and Wood (2001). Additional techniques for digitizing physical objects for CAD
applications have been presented by Varady (2001), Sarkar and Menq (1991), and Raja
(2008). Though there exist multiple descriptions of the reverse engineering process,
they can all be distilled to three simple steps as seen in Fig. 1. The three basic
reverse engineering steps are: (i) planning, (ii) data collection, and (iii) data
processing. As Fig. 1 suggests, the process can be iterative in nature. During data
processing, for example, the reverse engineering team must validate extracted
information, so as to know when the process is complete. If errors are discovered,
due to missing or low quality data, the reverse engineering team must extract more
information from the product. When barriers to reverse engineering<component

product acquisition was done legitimately (Samuelson and Scotchmer 2002; McLoughlin
2008). These laws are justified by many, since the time and effort required to
reverse engineer a product is often viewed as substantial enough to allow the
original designer to maintain a large market share (Samuelson and Scotchmer 2002).
Interestingly, patents facilitate reverse engineering as they disclose critical
product information and key technologies. In some cases, laws are outright violated
and products are continually built directly from patent information even though the
patent owners have claimed patent infringement and seek compensation (Maskus et al.
1998). Thus, it may not be wise for an original designer to rely solely on legal
barriers to mitigate reverse engineering attempts of their product. The remainder of
this section investigates in greater detail how these three barrier categories
interact to create information-extraction difficulties during the reverse engineering
process.<component x="306.14" y="498.28" width="238.11" height="233.12" page="3"

measured with traditional measurement devices such as micrometers or calipers
(Campbell and Flynn 2001); therefore, their complexity could be potentially difficult
to capture during the data-collection step, as they require more expensive, and user
intensive, measurement equipment. This is exemplified by Soo et al. in (2005) where
the difficulties of digitally capturing the complicated and arbitrary curves of a
Chinese bamboo-net handicraft are discussed in detail. Additionally, the physical
size of the measurement can have a large impact on the information stickiness. For
instance, as computer chips have decreased in size, they have become increasingly
more difficult to reverse engineer (James 2006). Products can contain a large amount
of information. One challenge for the reverse engineering team lies in
distinsuperfluous guishing between information that is and information that is
pertinentto product performance (Harston and Mattson 2010b). This distinction can be
difficult to make, especially when products contain a plethora of nonessential
information or when essential information is disguised to appear trivial (McLoughlin
2008). Extracting superfluous information will decrease the return on reverse
engineering investment, as resources are wasted on information that does not provide
significant benefits. Therefore, it is important for the reverse engineering team to
make this distinction, if possible in the planning step (see Fig. 1), before
collecting data from the product. Additionally, one must ensure that all pertinent
information is extracted from the product. This is typically done during the
data-processing step. McEvily (2005) presents a case study of reverse engineering
failure, where a butterfly valve in an aircraft engine caused the plane to crash. He
original alloy and part dimensions [of the states that the butterfly valve] were
accurately duplicated ; however, the firm reverse engineering the valve failed to
extract the heat treating process required to properly reconstruct the valve. As a
result, the valve was inadequately manufactured and failed in use. Another aspect of
product complexity is the accessibility of pertinent information. Products can be
difficult to dissect; essential components of the product can be enclosed in the
product in such a way that nondestructive disassembly is nearly impossible (Pooley
and Graves 2008). This is the case with many computer chips, where the coating on the
chip is designed so that when the coating is removed, one or more layers of the chip
are also destroyed, thereby making the rest of the chip difficult, if not impossible,
to reverse engineer (Dam and Lin 1996). Another way to limit accessibility of
pertinent information is to add locks to a product. For mechanical products, this may
be in the form of custom made fasteners (Campbell and Flynn 2001; Grand 2004). In
general, the harder it is to access the information, the stickier the information
becomes. The fundamental principles to understand about the technical complexity of
barriers to reverse engineering can be summarized with the following: &#x2022; The
technical complexity of a product or feature is an internal barrier to reverse
engineering-the original designer has a direct influence over the magnitude of this
barrier. When sticky information interacts with other sticky information in a
product, the result is a powerful barrier to reverse engineering. The stickiness of
pertinent information can be increased by reducing its accessibility or including
more superfluous information in the product to disguise pertinent features. We note
that in Sect. 4, a list of specific actions to increase product complexity is
provided.<component x="51.02" y="87.31" width="238.11" height="644.08" page="4"

lateness="0.29411764705882354" reference_score="6.51">We now turn our attention to
external barriers to reverse engineering; specifically, the barriers associated with
the availability of necessary resources. By necessary resources, we mean required
tools (including tools for disassembly, performance analysis, data synthesis,
measurement etc.), samples of the product, and any other object or software that is
required to successfully extract information from the product itself. Unlike internal
barriers, the original designer can only indirectly influence the magnitude of
external barriers as they may not be able to control the resources extrinsic to the
product. However, by strategically designing the product, original designers can
require those reverse engineering to use resources that are expensive or not readily
available in order to be successful at reverse engineering. While there may be more
than one approach to extract information from a product, some information can only be
acquired with the correct tools such as the material microstructure of a custom made
material that is critical for proper performance of the product. On the other hand, a
reverse engineering team can overcome many barriers by acquiring essential resources.
First and foremost, the product or system being analyzed needs to be accessible. Even
if a product is readily available on the market, it may be expensive or may only be
available in limited quantities, thereby discouraging others from attempting to
reverse engineer the product as the required investment increases. Often times, it is
of interest to those reverse engineering to know how the original product fails,
possibly to prevent or improve the conditions of failure. Clearly, when only a few
sample parts are available, extracting this type of information can be difficult
(Ingle 1994). Second, equipment used during the data-collection step (see step two of
Fig. 1) needs to be available. Often, a high level of precision and accuracy is
needed when collecting information from a product. This is much easier to accomplish
with appropriate equipment, which for geometric information could include
micrometers, gages, coordinate measuring machines, and optical scanning equipment
(Thompson et al. 1999) or for material microstructure information could include a
scanning electron microscope (Adams et al. 2005). At the same time, a significant
amount of skill and experience, see Sect. 2.3, may be needed to operate these
measuring tools, as well as to understand their limitations and shortcomings (Varady
et al. 1997, 2005; Ali et al. 2008; Grimm 2006b). Third, converting collected data
into a usable form during the data-processing step (see step three of Fig. 1) can
also be challenging. For geometric information, this form is often digital, meaning
in the form of a CAD model or drawing. This, of course, requires CAD or CAE software.
Much care is needed during this process to ensure that minimal error is introduced
when processing the data (Bradley and Currie 2005; Creehan and Bidanda 2006). For
material microstructure information, the data collected through scanning electron
microscopy needs to be analyzed with orientation image microscopy (OIM) software
(Adams et al. 2005). Clearly, if this equipment is unavailable, the magnitude of the
barrier to reverse engineering will be large. Finally, proper testing and validation
of extracted data are vital to the success of a reverse engineering project.

relevance, need to be verified as the data collected may or may not actually be
pertinent. Additionally, some information may still be needed to adequately reverse
engineer the product. Verification can take on many different forms, each requiring
specific resources. CAD systems can help verify that all the needed geometric
dimensions have been extracted. CAE systems can further aid in this process by
analyzing motion, stress, heat transfer, and failure modes. If the necessary
equipment is available, prototypes can be built and subsequently tested for the
purpose of verification. For example, the non-circular brass gears in Fig. 2a were
originally part of a photocopy machine. As part of this study, we reverse engineered
the gears to illustrate the verification process. The gears were measured using an
optical comparator, and the data were manually entered into a CAD system. The
resulting CAD model appears in Fig. 2b. A motion analysis was done using CAE software
to verify that the gears properly meshed. Acrylic prototypes were then manufactured
using a laser cutter and are shown in Fig. 2c. The acrylic prototype was made five
times larger, to accommodate for the resolution of the laser cutter. Finally, brass
gears were cut in true scale using wire electric discharge machining (EDM), as shown
in Fig. 2d. Multiple tools were needed to verify that we extracted the correct
information about the non-circular gears. In fact, the prototypes revealed some flaws
in our extracted data, as the reconstructed brass gears did not perform as well as
the original gears. If the necessary resources were not readily available (optical
comparator, CAD and CAE software, laser cutter, wire EDM), then this process would
have taken a different path characterized by its own difficulty. Therefore, we can
see that the resources available to the reverse engineering team influence the
difficulty to reverse engineer the product. The fundamental principles to understand
about the resource-availability category of barriers can be summarized with the
following: &#x2022; The availability of the necessary resources is an external
barrier to reverse engineering-the original designer typically has an indirect
influence on this barrier. When few or no samples of the product are available, the
magnitude of this barrier increases dramatically. Proper equipment is often required
for efficient product dissection, information extraction, and data processing. The
absence of this equipment could severely reduce the quality of collected data. The
barrier can be made larger by embedding information that requires specialized and/or
unavailable tools to extract. Section 4 provides specific actions that can be taken
to increase the magnitude of this type of barriers.<component x="306.14" y="323.95"

barriers to reverse engineering is the skill of the reverse engineering team.
Clearly, when required skills are absent, the barrier to reverse engineering is
larger. Skill can be considered from two perspectives. First, a familiarity or basic
understanding of the science governing the system being analyzed is often essential
for effective reverse engineering. For instance, a working knowledge of chemistry is
necessary to extract chemical information from a battery. Second, expertise and
experience with the reverse engineering process and its associated tools is also
extremely important. More than likely, a successful reverse engineering project will
require the synergy and collaboration of a group of professionals with different
skill sets-economists, market analysts, accountants, engineers, managers, etc. Thus,
skills in multidisciplinary design and project management are valuable. The reverse
engineering team must begin by considering the purpose for reverse engineering in the
planning step of Fig. 1. This will determine whether or not there is a need to
capture as-builtinformation from the product ordesign intent information (Grimm
2006a). In its extreme form, the as-built approach aims to copy every bit of
information from a product to the best ability of the team. Even though the as-built
approach focuses on copying all information, it is likely that some assumptions will
be made, i.e. assuming that bolts in a system are consistent sizes therefore not
requiring a detailed analysis of each bolt of a similar shape and size. Some
deviation from the original product may also occur due to manufacturing tolerances
and errors made during the reverse engineering process. On the other hand, design
intent attempts to determine the nominal performance and understand the desired
relationship between components. For simple features, recovering design intent may be
straight forward; however, with more complex features such as a turbine blade
(Mohaghegh et al. 2007), distinguishing between manufacturing variations and design
intent becomes significantly more difficult, or in other words, the likelihood of
making an invalid assumption increases. Although methodologies do exist for
extracting design intent when reverse engineering (Barbero 2009), recovering design
intent is likely to require more resources and time (Grimm 2006a) when compared to
the as-built approach. Therefore, experience with reverse engineering would help in
selecting an appropriate extraction strategy. A well-known historical example that
illustrates this type of barrier to reverse engineering occurred during World War II.
After a forced landing in the former Soviet Union, an American B-29 bomber, pictured
in Fig. 3a, was reverse engineered by the Soviets to yield the Tupolev Tu-4 bomber,
shown in Fig. 3b. Josef Stalin ordered that the downed B-29 (eventually, a total of
four such aircraft came under exactly Soviet control) be copied (Boyne 2009; Suvorov
1981), so as to ensure that all the separate components would assemble correctly. It
has even been rumored that existing damage on the B-29 fuselage (Danelek 2008) and
manufacturing defects such as a small, misplaced rivet hole on the B-29 left wing
(Suvorov 1981) were incorporated into the original Tu-4 design. This would indicate
that the Soviets took more of an as-built approach to reverse engineering the B-29.
As a result, the Tu-4 is nearly an exact replica of the B-29, with the exception of
some subsystems such as the Soviet manufactured engines and cannons (Boyne 2009 ).
Additionally, the Soviet's thought it beneficial to extract information in the native
units of the design (English units). Therefore, the Soviets needed to buy measuring
equipment in Canada, England, and the United States and retrain thousands of
engineers and technicians to work with the new measurement system (Suvorov 1981).
Although the magnitude of the total barrier to reverse engineer the B-29 was large,
the Soviets were able to utilize nearly unlimited resources in conjunction with
enough skill to successfully reverse engineer the B-29. The fundamental principles to
understand about the barriers associated with the skill of the reverse engineering
team can be summarized with the following: &#x2022; A reverse engineering team is
more likely to succeed if they have a basic understanding of the science being
analyzed anda familiarity with the process and tools of reverse engineering. Knowing
which approach is needed-as-built, design intent, or a combination of both-will help
maximize the return on reverse engineering investment. Similar to technical
complexity and availability of resources previously discussed, in Sect. 4, we provide
a list of ways to make a product more difficult to reverse engineer. In this section,
Sect. 2, we have explored the fundamentals of barriers that can stymie reverse
engineering efforts during any step of the reverse engineering process. We have
demonstrated that by increasing the complexity of a product-such as making
information inaccessible and introducing complicated information interactions-we can
increase the reverse engineering barrier. An example of a reverse-engineered
butterfly valve that failed demonstrated the difficulty of extracting information
that interacts with other information, and to extract information that is difficult
to access. We next demonstrated how reverse engineering can be made more difficult
when competitors lack necessary resources. Although original designers may not have
direct control over the resources available to competitors, when a product design
requires special tools or materials that the competitors are likely not to have, the
barrier to reverse engineering is increased. An example of non-circular gears was
given which shows that resources available influence the reverse engineering
difficulty. Finally, we demonstrated how the skills of the reverse engineering team
also affect the reverse engineering barrier. Similar to resources available, the
original designers can only indirectly affect what skills are required, since they
cannot control what skills the reverse engineering team will have. The example of the
Soviet replicate of an American B-29 bomber demonstrates that even technically
complex products can be adequately reverse engineered when the team has the proper
skill set. In the next section, we add to this anecdotal understanding of what
affects barriers to reverse engineering and present metrics that have been developed

barrier characterization enables designers to quantify what barriers are most

present two metrics that have been published in the literature that are used for
characterizing the barrier to reverse engineer any product. The purpose of this
section is not to present the full development of the metrics, but to give a brief
summary for convenience to the reader and to facilitate the discussion in Sect. 4.
Qualitative quantitative as well as metrics exist for characterizing reverse
engineering difficulty. One qualitaattack difficulty tive measure has been termed the
(Weingart et al. 1990) and is summarized in Table 1. This classification system
ranges from 1 to 6 based on the tools and skills required to reverse engineer a
product. Similar qualitative classifications have been presented by Christiansen
(2006) and Abraham et al. (1991). An advantage of these measures is that they are
intuitive, and can be easily evaluated in the early stages of the product development
process. Quantitative metrics may be less intuitive, but can be used with numerical
optimization techniques to literally maximize the time and barrier to reverse
engineer a product (Harston and Mattson 2010b) and its tolerances (Curtis et al.
2009). We provide a brief overview here of the fundamental metrics presented by
Harston and Mattson in (2010b), and we refer the reader to their work for a more
detailed explanation of the equations and variables in the metrics. Harston and
Mattson adapted Ohm's law (Ohm 1827) to meaningfully (with an average error of 12.2%)
quantify the time and barrier to reverse engineer products. They observed that the
rate at which information can be extracted from a product is dependent upon the ratio
of known information to the total information contained by a product. This is similar
to how the discharge rate of a<component x="306.14" y="76.6" width="238.11"

reverse engineering, between unextracted information and time, and for the capacitor,

There is a small barrier to measure the ( B diameter of any single hole (indicating a

engineering time relatively large. The qualitative and quantitative metrics are
related in that when the tool complexity and skill required increase, then the metric
also increases. However, there is not a direct correlation between the two measures,
i.e., a level 3 attack difficulty does not directly correlate with a specified ( B
range of . This is because the quantitative metrics are also influenced by the
relative amounts of each information type contained by a product, while the
qualitative metrics are not. Ultimately, these metrics can be used to quantify and
compare the effectiveness of multiple types of barriers and help designers select
which barriers will be efficient and effective for the desired application. Due to
the numerical nature of the metrics, numerical optimization may be used to ( B

achieved when a firm successfully develops an innovative product acts as the driving
force for technological progress. However, if a competing firm can successfully
reverse engineer the innovative product, then the market advantage of the original
firm is quickly lost (Macmillan et al. 1985). When this occurs, the incentive for
innovation is reduced (Shapiro 1985). Therefore, it is in the best interest of
original designers to design products that are difficult to reverse engineer. A
product can be made difficult to reverse engineer simply by making one critical
component difficult to reverse engineer. For example, consider how the performance of
an entire aircraft system was influenced by a single critical component, namely the
butterfly valve described in Sect. 2.1. While critical component selection is the
subject of another paper by the authors, in the current paper, we assume that the
critical components for receiving barriers to reverse engineering have been
previously determined. As a note, components that are heavily constrained are often
the best candidates for implementing barriers. The more a component is constrained by
specifications or interactions with other components, the less likely competitors
will be able to design around the barriers, thus requiring competitors to overcome
the barriers. Other guidelines have been presented in Table 2 to facilitate
implementation of barriers into products. For the remainder<component x="51.02"

the perspective of the original designer, as we present a methodology to implement
barriers to reverse engineering. A five step process is used to implement barriers to
reverse engineering as illustrated in the flow chart in Fig. 4. The first step is to
gather information (what is the barrier trying to protect, what are the time and
budget constraints, how many barriers are required, etc.) and specify target values
(target B T;, attack difficulty level, etc.). It is important to understand what
information the barrier is trying to protect, as well as understand the competitor's
ability to extract that information. Different barriers are more effective in
different scenarios. If the goal is to impede consumers from discovering what
components are used in an electrical circuit, some have found an effective barrier to
be encoding labels for resistors and capacitors in the electronics (McLoughlin 2008).
If the goal is to protect proprietary information, creating a product that cannot be
opened without destruction of critical components may be a sufficient barrier. If the
goal is to increase the required skills and resources of competitors, one may use
material microstructures that are anisotropic, heterogeneous, and are difficult to
detect or reproduce. By understanding what information needs to be protected, the
design team can determine if multiple small barriers will be more effective or a
single large barrier. Multiple small barriers are beneficial as they require
competitors to solve several problems that may be completely independent. A careful
review of the metrics in Sect. 3 shows that the difficulty of overcoming multiple
independent barriers is more than the sum of those same barriers. If only a single
barrier is implemented, and competitors are able to efficiently overcome the barrier,
the information may not be adequately protected. However, a<component x="306.14"

(Reed and DeFillippi 1990) Avoid explicitly disclosing information such as labels on

Design and implement multiple functionally-equivalent configurations of the same
product (Dube et al. 2008) While not all of these candidate barriers may always be
practical to implement, the goal is to make the competitors spend time and resources
on gathering information that is either not needed or require them to extract
information that is expensive (either in time and/or resources). Ideally, any barrier
introduced would require multiple iterations through the reverse engineering process
(seen in Fig. 1). It is important to note that a barrier does not need to be
impossible to overcome. Some believe that a barrier is sufficient when competitors
spend as much time and resources as was spent in developing the original product,
(Dam and Lin 1996; Grand 2004) while others believe that a barrier is sufficient if
it can keep competitors out of the market until market saturation (Knight et al.
2009). Following the flow chart in Fig. 4, the third step is to compare the
performance of the candidate barriers to the target values of B Tand . This is done
by utilizing the metrics presented in Sect. 3. Candidate barriers that do not meet
the specified requirements are removed. For the fourth step, the designer must either
choose one (or more) of the remaining barriers or generate additional candidates with
more favorable characteristics. While some implementable barriers may simultaneously
increase product performance (Harston and Mattson 2010a), other barriers may have
adverse effects in other performance areas of the product (Christiansen et al. 2006).
In the case of the latter, the designer must balance the benefits of increased
security against potentially increased implementation costs, decreased system
performance, and increased maintenance costs (Christiansen et al. 2006). This
selection process can be facilitated with any multiobjective optimization routine, a
weighted algorithm, or a scoring matrix similar to those used in a product
development process (Ulrich and Eppinger 2004). The final box in Fig. 4 is to
establish barrier related requirements. In a typical product development process,
product requirements are derived from customer specifications. The barrier related
product requirements are additional product requirements that must be met to
effectively implement the desired barrier(s) into the product. Contingent upon a
successful product development process with the new requirements, the added/improved
feature(s) will increase the difficulty to reverse engineer the product without
greatly degrading the performance of other product features, and in some cases
improve product performance.<component x="320.71" y="81.24" width="223.54"

is to illustrate how to strategically make a simple device more difficult to reverse
engineer, using the principles of the barrier implementation methodology presented in
Sec. 4. We begin with a simple cantilever L-beam of pure copper, as shown by the
benchmark L-beam in Fig. 5. One end of the beam is rigidly attached while a force is
applied to the free end to d make the end of the beam undergo a deflection, . A
similar beam is actually located in some cell phones as part of an electrical
connector assembly (Knight et al. 2009), and it plays an important role in keeping
consistent electrical contact in the circuitry of a phone. Thus, it would be
reasonable to need to protect this device against comparable cell phone
manufacturers, who may attempt to reverse engineer the L-beam for numerous reasons
(see Sect. 1). The first step of the barrier implementation methodology, as discussed
in Sect. 4, is to gather information and specify target values. For the design of the
L-beam, we determined what skills and resources are available and what skills and
resources are likely unavailable to competitors. We have the ability to analyze and
design for both geometry andmaterial microstructures. Microstructure analysis and
design requires uncommon skills and tools (scanning electron microscope, orientation
imaging software, etc.). It is likely that the entities that are interested in
reverse engineering the L-beam electrical connector will not have access to these
resources. Therefore, we sought to incorporate barriers that utilize microstructure
design. Ideally, we would design and implement a reverse engineering barrier into the
L-beam that is practically impossible to overcome. However, that large of a barrier
may require a significant amount of time and resources to develop and implement. A
more reasonable barrier is one that requires competitors to spend at least as much
time reverse engineering the L-beam as we spent developing the original product. With

out of pure, homogeneous, isotropic copper. The L-beam can be reverse engineered with
common tools such as vernier calipers and radius gages. Candidate A This candidate
takes the benchmark design and subtracts three elliptical holes, thereby adding more
geometric information to the L-beam. While there is more information to extract, the
same extraction tools that can be used to reverse engineer the benchmark can be used
to reverse engineer this candidate. Candidate B This candidate adds curves to the
exterior of the benchmark L-beam. These curves require uncommon measurement tools to
be reverse engineered easily, such as an optical comparator or a coordinate measuring
machine. Candidate C This candidate couples the geometry of the benchmark L-beam with
a single, strategically oriented, anisotropic copper layer. The material
microstructure now plays an integral part in the L-beam's performance, thereby
requiring this information to be extracted from the product. This requires highly
specialized skills and tools such as a scanning electron microscope and OIM software.
Candidate D This candidate combines the geometry of Candidate B with the material
anisotropy of Candidate C. Candidate E This candidate is composed of a heterogeneous
copper material, created by a process called friction stir welding (Owen 2006). This
L-beam can be reverse engineered with the same tools as candidates C and D; however,
there are two material microstructures that need to be identified and analyzed.
Candidate F This candidate utilizes ultrasonic consolidation (Harston and Mattson
2010a) to create an L-beam with four, thin, anisotropic, copper layers, each
independently oriented, to achieve the desired performance. This results in four
different material microstructures, each of which needs to be identified and
analyzed. Furthermore, ultrasonic consolidation can be virtually undetectable to the
naked eye, potentially disguising the layers as one single layer to anyone reverse
engineering the L-beam. We first analyzed each L-beam with the finite element
analysis software ANSYS to ensure that (i) the L-beam -4 achieved the desired
deflection of -1.50 * 10 m under a load of about 0.60 N and (ii) the L-beam did not
plastically deform. We also determined, qualitatively and quantitatively, the reverse
engineering barrier and time for each L-beam candidate. As discussed in Sect. 3, we
need to first K identify the quantity of information, , the rate at which F P that
information can be extracted, , and the effort, , put into extracting the information
contained by the L-beams (i.e., geometry, material, and material microstructure). K F

dependent upon the accuracy of K F P;, and . Numerous papers from the literature
discuss how to reverse engineer geometric features utilizing CAD systems (Varady and
Facello 2005; Stamati and Fudos 2007; Li et al. 2010. Toledo et al. (2008) present an
efficient method by which geometric information may be determined, even from
complicated systems, in an effort to determine original geometric data. Varady et al.
(2007) present an automated approach to create CAD representations of structures that
are accurate, capture design intent, and require little or no user assistance. Many
of these methods may be used directly to K estimate the quantity of geometric
information, , cong tained by a product. By recording the length of time to extract
the geometric information, an estimation of the rate F at which geometric information
is extracted, , can also be g determined. While the information-extraction methods
presented above may be effective for large systems, for simple parts, such as the
cantilever L-beam, it may be better to simply count the quantity of geometric
information. The method that we use to quantify the geometric features of simple
parts is based upon the degrees-of-freedom analysis often found in many CAD systems

used for the L-beam candidates in determining the quantity of geometric information.
To account for the thickness dimension of each L-beam, K we add one (1) to the
obtained with Eq. 11. Note that g we did not assume that lines are parallel or
perpendicular, and we also did not assume that the arcs have the same radii. If
desired, Eq. 11 can be modified to represent additional constraints. While this
method of determining geometric information may be used for any product or feature,
the automated CAD approaches (de Toledo et al. 2008; Varady et al. 2007) are likely
to be more efficient when analyzing complicated products and systems. While
understanding geometric information is critical to developing (or overcoming)
barriers to reverse engineering, arguably the most efficient barriers will be
material related.(Harston and Mattson 2010a). As such, we also analyze the L-beams
from the material perspective. The amount of K material information, is determined by
how many different m materials (without regard to material microstructure) each
L-beam candidate includes. Likewise, the amount of material K , contained by each
L-beamis microstructure information, mm based on the number of unique microstructures
present. F The flow rate, , for each information type was determined from the
authors' experience and with informationextraction tests similar to those described
in Harston and Mattson (2010b). Additionally, We took a conservative P approach by
assuming to be equal to one (1) for all information types in each candidate, implying
that a competitor would exert a full effort in their reverse engineering attempts.
These parameters are listed in Table 3. K F P; With , and defined, we used Eqs. 1, 3,
4, 6 and 7 to ( ( B T determine the and of each candidate L-beam. The results of this
analysis are listed in Table 4. Using these results, the barrier selection
process-the fourth step of the barrier implementation methodology- becomes
significantly easier to perform. Candidates A and B do not meet the reverse
engineering time requirement 5 ( T ( greater than 1.00 * 10 s), while Candidate D
does not 4 ( B meet the barrier requirement ( greater than 5.00 * 10 ). Therefore,
they are removed from the candidate pool. An interesting result is that Candidate C
has a larger barrier than Candidate D, although Candidate D would appear to be more
complex. This phenomena is explained by ( B examining the meaning of , which is a
measure of the any difficulty to extract pertinent information from the device. We
see that since Candidate D contains more geometric information, which comparatively
is easier to extract than material or microstructure information, it has a lower
barrier than Candidate C. In other words, the average difficulty to extract a unit of
pertinent information from Candidate D is less than the average difficulty to extract
a unit of pertinent information from Candidate C. In this case, the time required to
reverse engineer Candidate D is larger, simply because there is more information to
extract. ( ( B T This exemplifies the distinct nature of and . As all the remaining

candidates from one another. If manufacturing cost is the most important objective,
than Candidate C may be optimal, as it only requires the material to be strategically
oriented during the manufacturing process with no need for expensive welding
equipment. The fifth and final step of the barrier implementation methodology is to
establish barrier related product requirements. Assuming Candidate C was selected to
be implemented, some additional product requirements might include: material
properties must be homogeneous, L-beam must be manufactured in a single plane, and
material thickness is constrained since it is difficult to obtain thick sheets of
strongly anisotropic materials. It is clear from the results of this case study that
the barrier and time to reverse engineer a mechanical component can be manipulated in
a strategic manner. For instance, the predicted time to reverse engineer Candidate F
is about 160 times greater than the benchmark. This is a significant increase,
especially considering that a conservative approach was used. Conservative because we
assumed that a reverse engineering team would immediately discern the existence of
four disparate material microstructures without iteratively performing the reverse
engineering process. In reality, the team reverse engineering the L-beams would
likely initially miss this information, as layers that are welded together with
ultrasonic consolidation are difficult to detect without the proper skills and
equipment. Even if the team has the required skills and equipment, it is still likely
to require multiple iterations before the microstructure is reverse engineered.
Additionally, we note that the L-beam is a simple device. If this methodology were
applied to a more technically complex product-which may include multiple component
interactions-then the methodology can aid in potentially creating powerful, if not
insurmountable, barriers to reverse engineering.<component x="51.02" y="153.64"

can influence the magnitude of internal barriers to reverse engineering, while those

methodology-which is used in conjunction with the traditional product development
process-that enables designers to strategically design products with built-in
barriers to reverse engineering. When implemented, these barriers to reverse
engineering impede competitors from extracting critical information from innovative
