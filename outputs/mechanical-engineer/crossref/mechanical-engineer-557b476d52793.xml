natural organisms sometimes cannot be transferred into engineering structures

overcome the existing problems. 1 Summarization of related theories Although it
solves many engineering problems successfully, structural bionic design lacks mature
and scientific theories. Here, three related theories are summarized: similarity
theory, fuzzy evaluation theory and optimization theory. They are employed in the
following method of structural bionic design. Similarity theory is the basic theory
to find the similar characteristics between different objects. This theory can help
designers with the search of organisms, which are similar to engineering structure.
Fuzzy evaluation theory is a quantitative evaluation method for multi-factor problem.
It gives a quantitative value by calculating the weighted average of all the factors.
Fuzzy evaluation theory provides a feasible way to find the most useful structural
characteristic of organism among several ones. Optimization theory is to optimize the
objective function by mathematical iteration in the design domain. Optimization
theory is used during structural bionic design to reveal how parameters affect the
whole structure and the function of an organism, and to optimize some of the
parameters for the engineering. 2 Method of structural bionic design<component

lateness="0.8" reference_score="8.55">The method of structural bionic design includes
four steps. Step 1 Selecting the most useful structural characteristic of natural
organism. There are many excellent structural characteristics in nature, but not all
of them are suitable for the structure design of the engineering problem that needs
to be solved. Hence, useful structural characteristics should be chosen from them.
(1) Several structural characteristics, which are possibly helpful for the structure
design, should be picked out. Usually, function, load and geometric structure are the
factors, which almost represent an engineering problem, so similarity degree between
the structural characteristics of organism and the engineering problem in these three
factors represents to what extent the structural characteristics can help engineers
with the structure design. If a structural characteristic is very similar to the
structure design of engineering problem in any factor of the three, it may be useful,
and should be picked out. In this way, several possibly helpful structural
characteristics can be found. (2) The most useful structural characteristic should be
chosen from those ones. To achieve this, fuzzy evaluation theory, which uses weighted
evaluation vector to evaluate similarity, is employed. The weighted evaluation vector
can be expressed as B W R B , B , B , 1 = &#xD7; = 1 2 3 [ ] where B is the weighted
evaluation vector; W the weight vector; and R the evaluation matrix. The former three
factors, which can mostly describe the engineering problem, are chosen to be the
factors in fuzzy evaluation. W is defined as W w ,w ,w 0.45,0.35,0.2 2 = = 1 2 3 [ ]
[ ] where w , w and w represent weighting coefficients of 1 2 3 function, load and
geometric structure respectively. Function is the most important factor of the three,
because structural characteristics with different functions is much less useful for
the engineering problem. Hence, it is assigned the maximum value. Geometric structure
is what needs to be improved, so it is assigned the minimum value. R is defined as R
R R 11 12 13 ,, , R R R R R R R 3 = = 1 2 3 21 22 23 [ ] R R R 31 32 33 The
evaluation matrix of structural characteristic number i is R i, and R , R and R
represent its evaluation 1i 2i 3i value for the factor of function, load and
geometric struc, R and R should be ture, respectively. Values of R 1i 2i 3i carefully
assigned according to the similarity between the structural characteristics of
organism and engineering problem, because they can affect the weighted evaluation
vector, which is the basis to choose the structural characteristics to be used in
structural bionic design for the engineering problem. By comparison of the values in
the weighted evaluation vector, the one with the maximum value, which is also the
most useful, will be chosen. Step 2 Analyzing the structural characteristics finally
chosen for the engineering problem. After the structural characteristics, such as
non-smooth surfaces, graded structures, hierarchical structures, is picked out, it
cannot be used in structure design directly, because it is just a guideline. To
transfer this guideline into structural bionic design, the following analyses should
be done. 1 Simplifying the structure of natural organism. The structure of natural
organism, which is usually complex, is not suitable to be analyzed and machined, so
simplification is needed. Aiming at solving engineering problem, simplification
should be done according to the function of engineering structure. The function of
engineering structure indicates which parts of organisms are important, while the
others are not. For example, if the function of engineering structure is to reduce
drag force, the surface characteristics of organism should be paid more attention,
while the internal structure is not important. Considering manufacturability, some
simple geometric models such as circles, rectangles and cuboids are employed here.
Through division, a complex structure of organism can usually be divided into several
less complex parts, which may contain surfaces and inner supporting parts. If
surfaces are important, some points on surfaces are measured, and then surface
fitting method is used to build the complex model. If surfaces are not important, the
combined surface from simple surfaces like planes, cylinder surfaces and spherical
surfaces will make sense. Common structures in engineering like cylinder bars and
cuboid beams can replace the inner supporting parts of organism structure. Fig.1 is
an example, which shows the structural bionic design for a thin-walled cylindrical
shell based on the cross-section structure of bamboo. In the process of
simplification, combined structure of big rings and small rings replace the complex
one in bamboo cross-section. 2 Extracting and analyzing the parameters of the
simplified structure. The parameters could be found mostly from parameters of the
simple geometric models used in the simplified structure. For example, the parameters
of the simplified structure in Fig.1 are those of the rings. For each parameter,
single-factor optimization is done in finite element analysis software, taking the
performance of achieving the function of engineering structure as the objective and
the result indicates how the parameter affects the structure of organism. According
to the effect, these parameters will be divided into two groups, Groups A and B, and
they will be treated differently in the following step. If the optimal value of a
parameter makes the structural characteristics of the simplified structure agree with
that of organism, it will be included in Group A; otherwise, it will be put into
Group B. Step 3 Completing the structural bionic design for engineering structure. 1
Designing a preliminary bionic structure. If surfaces are important, the approximate
surfaces will be applied to the design of the preliminary bionic structure by surface
fitting method with some structural adjustment in its parameters. If the inner
supporting parts are important, they should be designed using the simple geometric
models, which are employed in the simplified structure of organism, gradually,
hierarchically or in branch style according to the chosen structural characteristics.
By changing the diameters of different rings according to engineering problem, the
simplified structure in Fig.1 can be designed as the preliminary bionic structure.
The parameters of the preliminary bionic structure can be found from those of the
simple geometric models, which are employed here. 2 Assigning the values of
parameters. After the preliminary bionic structure was achieved, it is time to handle
the parameters. If a parameter is in Group A, its final value is the optimal value
coming from single-factor optimization of the preliminary bionic structure. Values of
parameters in Group B will be decided by multi-factor optimization. However, there is
a possibility that the preliminary bionic structure is too complex to do multifactor
optimization. If so, do several single-factor optimizations to give every parameter
an initial value, and then search groups of values nearby by hand, and find the best
group among them. Once the values of all parameters are assigned, the bionic
structure is completed. Step 4 Verifying the structural bionic design. There are two
important points, the evaluation criterion for comparison and design of the
contrastive structure. 1 The evaluation criterion for comparison is usually dependent
on the requirement of the engineering problem. The evaluation criterion should
reflect the effect of both positive and negative influencing factors. A general
evaluation criterion proposed in this paper is expressed as n m F f = &#x3B7; i j
&#x220F; &#x220F; 4 i j 0 0 = = F f 1, 1 = = 0 0 where is evaluation value; F i
positive factor; f negative j factor; n number of positive factors; m number of
negative factors. can reflect every factor in a right way, and, to some extent, it
can be a quantitative reference for comparison. 2 The conventional design for
engineering structure is the best as a contrastive structure. When there is more than
one factor, the contrastive structure should be designed conventionally, eliminating
the influence of minor factors. Designing two structures with the same values in
minor factors is a good way to eliminate their influences. There are two ways to
compare the two structures. One is through finite element analysis software. Some
software like ANSYS is a powerful tool to analyze mechanical properties of
structures. Besides, experimental verification is the other effective way for
comparison. Compare the bionic structure with the contrastive one. If the bionic one
is better, the structural bionic design for the engineering problem is effective.
Otherwise, the design fails, and some other structural characteristics in the
weighted evaluation vector are needed to be added into Step 2, which means that the
design should restart from Step 2. Under this condition, more than one structural
characteristic are used, and they should be combined and analyzed in Step

most common structures, and it is widely used in the manufacturing of aircraft,
automobiles, missile, boilers, pipelines etc. However, thin-walled cylindrical shells
are easy to buckle, and this may significantly reduce the resistance of the shell
against other forces like bending. Meanwhile, thin-walled cylindrical shells should
be designed as light as possible, which is beneficial especially to aircraft. Hence,
there is a great need to improve its buckling load against axial compression and
reduce its weight. The process of structural bionic design can be described as
follows. The function of the shell is to improve the loadbearing ability in axial
direction and avoid buckling. Buckling problem of thin-walled cylindrical shells is
shown in Fig.2. One end of the shell is simply supported radial displacement is
constrained , and bears an axial uniform pressure P. The other end is clamped.
According to the similarity in the factors of function, load and geometric structure,
three kinds of structural characteristics of organisms were found: gradient structure
of bamboo cross-section, porous structure of wood and layered composite structure of
seashells. The weighted evaluation vector was calculated in Eq. 5 , and gradient
structure of bamboo cross-section got the maximum value, 0.845. Gradient structure
was chosen for the structural bionic design of thin-walled cylindrical shell. 0.9 0.6

Small cylindrical shells were employed in the process, and they were simple and easy
to machine. For the simplified structure, seven parameters were found to describe it
shown in Fig.3(a . The basic parameters affecting the performance and distribution
were d and T. The function of the shell was to improve the buckling load, so the
buckling load was taken as the objective. Meantime, the total mass was kept
invariant. Through analysis in finite element software ANSYS, it was found that the
value of d made the structural characteristics of the simplified structure agree with
gradient distribution of bamboo cross-section. Parameter T made the structure tend
toward a uniform distribution. Hence, d 1 and d were 2 included in Group A, and the
others were in Group B. As mentioned above, the simplified structure in Fig.3 a could
be used as the preliminary bionic structure with some structural adjustment in its
parameters. Values of parameters d 1 and d were assigned through 2 single-factor
optimization, and values of other parameters were given by searching among groups of
values. There are two factors influencing the evaluation of the thinwalled
cylindrical shell against buckling, i.e., the buck<component x="49.62" y="77.37"

whole structure and the function of an organism, and to optimize some of the
parameters for the engineering. 2 Method of structural bionic design<component

four steps. Step 1 Selecting the most useful structural characteristic of natural
organism. There are many excellent structural characteristics in nature, but not all
of them are suitable for the structure design of the engineering problem that needs
to be solved. Hence, useful structural characteristics should be chosen from them.
(1) Several structural characteristics, which are possibly helpful for the structure
design, should be picked out. Usually, function, load and geometric structure are the
factors, which almost represent an engineering problem, so similarity degree between
the structural characteristics of organism and the engineering problem in these three
factors represents to what extent the structural characteristics can help engineers
with the structure design. If a structural characteristic is very similar to the
structure design of engineering problem in any factor of the three, it may be useful,
and should be picked out. In this way, several possibly helpful structural
characteristics can be found. (2) The most useful structural characteristic should be
chosen from those ones. To achieve this, fuzzy evaluation theory, which uses weighted
evaluation vector to evaluate similarity, is employed. The weighted evaluation vector
can be expressed as B W R B , B , B , 1 = &#xD7; = 1 2 3 [ ] where B is the weighted
evaluation vector; W the weight vector; and R the evaluation matrix. The former three
factors, which can mostly describe the engineering problem, are chosen to be the
factors in fuzzy evaluation. W is defined as W w ,w ,w 0.45,0.35,0.2 2 = = 1 2 3 [ ]
[ ] where w , w and w represent weighting coefficients of 1 2 3 function, load and
geometric structure respectively. Function is the most important factor of the three,
because structural characteristics with different functions is much less useful for
the engineering problem. Hence, it is assigned the maximum value. Geometric structure
is what needs to be improved, so it is assigned the minimum value. R is defined as R
R R 11 12 13 ,, , R R R R R R R 3 = = 1 2 3 21 22 23 [ ] R R R 31 32 33 The
evaluation matrix of structural characteristic number i is R i, and R , R and R
represent its evaluation 1i 2i 3i value for the factor of function, load and
geometric struc, R and R should be ture, respectively. Values of R 1i 2i 3i carefully
assigned according to the similarity between the structural characteristics of
organism and engineering problem, because they can affect the weighted evaluation
vector, which is the basis to choose the structural characteristics to be used in
structural bionic design for the engineering problem. By comparison of the values in
the weighted evaluation vector, the one with the maximum value, which is also the
most useful, will be chosen. Step 2 Analyzing the structural characteristics finally
chosen for the engineering problem. After the structural characteristics, such as
non-smooth surfaces, graded structures, hierarchical structures, is picked out, it
cannot be used in structure design directly, because it is just a guideline. To
transfer this guideline into structural bionic design, the following analyses should
be done. 1 Simplifying the structure of natural organism. The structure of natural
organism, which is usually complex, is not suitable to be analyzed and machined, so
simplification is needed. Aiming at solving engineering problem, simplification
should be done according to the function of engineering structure. The function of
engineering structure indicates which parts of organisms are important, while the
others are not. For example, if the function of engineering structure is to reduce
drag force, the surface characteristics of organism should be paid more attention,
while the internal structure is not important. Considering manufacturability, some
simple geometric models such as circles, rectangles and cuboids are employed here.
Through division, a complex structure of organism can usually be divided into several
less complex parts, which may contain surfaces and inner supporting parts. If
surfaces are important, some points on surfaces are measured, and then surface
fitting method is used to build the complex model. If surfaces are not important, the
combined surface from simple surfaces like planes, cylinder surfaces and spherical
surfaces will make sense. Common structures in engineering like cylinder bars and
cuboid beams can replace the inner supporting parts of organism structure. Fig.1 is
an example, which shows the structural bionic design for a thin-walled cylindrical
shell based on the cross-section structure of bamboo. In the process of
simplification, combined structure of big rings and small rings replace the complex
one in bamboo cross-section. 2 Extracting and analyzing the parameters of the
simplified structure. The parameters could be found mostly from parameters of the
simple geometric models used in the simplified structure. For example, the parameters
of the simplified structure in Fig.1 are those of the rings. For each parameter,
single-factor optimization is done in finite element analysis software, taking the
performance of achieving the function of engineering structure as the objective and
the result indicates how the parameter affects the structure of organism. According
to the effect, these parameters will be divided into two groups, Groups A and B, and
they will be treated differently in the following step. If the optimal value of a
parameter makes the structural characteristics of the simplified structure agree with
that of organism, it will be included in Group A; otherwise, it will be put into
Group B. Step 3 Completing the structural bionic design for engineering structure. 1
Designing a preliminary bionic structure. If surfaces are important, the approximate
surfaces will be applied to the design of the preliminary bionic structure by surface
fitting method with some structural adjustment in its parameters. If the inner
supporting parts are important, they should be designed using the simple geometric
models, which are employed in the simplified structure of organism, gradually,
hierarchically or in branch style according to the chosen structural characteristics.
By changing the diameters of different rings according to engineering problem, the
simplified structure in Fig.1 can be designed as the preliminary bionic structure.
The parameters of the preliminary bionic structure can be found from those of the
simple geometric models, which are employed here. 2 Assigning the values of
parameters. After the preliminary bionic structure was achieved, it is time to handle
the parameters. If a parameter is in Group A, its final value is the optimal value
coming from single-factor optimization of the preliminary bionic structure. Values of
parameters in Group B will be decided by multi-factor optimization. However, there is
a possibility that the preliminary bionic structure is too complex to do multifactor
optimization. If so, do several single-factor optimizations to give every parameter
an initial value, and then search groups of values nearby by hand, and find the best
group among them. Once the values of all parameters are assigned, the bionic
structure is completed. Step 4 Verifying the structural bionic design. There are two
important points, the evaluation criterion for comparison and design of the
contrastive structure. 1 The evaluation criterion for comparison is usually dependent
on the requirement of the engineering problem. The evaluation criterion should
reflect the effect of both positive and negative influencing factors. A general
evaluation criterion proposed in this paper is expressed as n m F f = &#x3B7; i j
&#x220F; &#x220F; 4 i j 0 0 = = F f 1, 1 = = 0 0 where is evaluation value; F i
positive factor; f negative j factor; n number of positive factors; m number of
negative factors. can reflect every factor in a right way, and, to some extent, it
can be a quantitative reference for comparison. 2 The conventional design for
engineering structure is the best as a contrastive structure. When there is more than
one factor, the contrastive structure should be designed conventionally, eliminating
the influence of minor factors. Designing two structures with the same values in
minor factors is a good way to eliminate their influences. There are two ways to
compare the two structures. One is through finite element analysis software. Some
software like ANSYS is a powerful tool to analyze mechanical properties of
structures. Besides, experimental verification is the other effective way for
comparison. Compare the bionic structure with the contrastive one. If the bionic one
is better, the structural bionic design for the engineering problem is effective.
Otherwise, the design fails, and some other structural characteristics in the
weighted evaluation vector are needed to be added into Step 2, which means that the
design should restart from Step 2. Under this condition, more than one structural
characteristic are used, and they should be combined and analyzed in Step
2.<component x="49.62" y="74.79" width="246.07" height="142.13" page="2"

most common structures, and it is widely used in the manufacturing of aircraft,
automobiles, missile, boilers, pipelines etc. However, thin-walled cylindrical shells
are easy to buckle, and this may significantly reduce the resistance of the shell
against other forces like bending. Meanwhile, thin-walled cylindrical shells should
be designed as light as possible, which is beneficial especially to aircraft. Hence,
there is a great need to improve its buckling load against axial compression and
reduce its weight. The process of structural bionic design can be described as
follows. The function of the shell is to improve the loadbearing ability in axial
direction and avoid buckling. Buckling problem of thin-walled cylindrical shells is
shown in Fig.2. One end of the shell is simply supported radial displacement is
constrained , and bears an axial uniform pressure P. The other end is clamped.
According to the similarity in the factors of function, load and geometric structure,
three kinds of structural characteristics of organisms were found: gradient structure
of bamboo cross-section, porous structure of wood and layered composite structure of
seashells. The weighted evaluation vector was calculated in Eq. 5 , and gradient
structure of bamboo cross-section got the maximum value, 0.845. Gradient structure
was chosen for the structural bionic design of thin-walled cylindrical shell. 0.9 0.6

0.845,0.675,0.58 5 [ ] Fig.1 shows the process of simplifying bamboo cross-section.
Small cylindrical shells were employed in the process, and they were simple and easy
to machine. For the simplified structure, seven parameters were found to describe it
shown in Fig.3(a . The basic parameters affecting the performance and distribution
were d and T. The function of the shell was to improve the buckling load, so the
buckling load was taken as the objective. Meantime, the total mass was kept
invariant. Through analysis in finite element software ANSYS, it was found that the
value of d made the structural characteristics of the simplified structure agree with
gradient distribution of bamboo cross-section. Parameter T made the structure tend
toward a uniform distribution. Hence, d 1 and d were 2 included in Group A, and the
others were in Group B. As mentioned above, the simplified structure in Fig.3 a could
be used as the preliminary bionic structure with some structural adjustment in its
parameters. Values of parameters d 1 and d were assigned through 2 single-factor
optimization, and values of other parameters were given by searching among groups of
values. There are two factors influencing the evaluation of the thinwalled
cylindrical shell against buckling, i.e., the buck<component x="49.62" y="77.37"

fuzzy evaluation theory and optimization theory, are summarized. They are the basis
of the method proposed in this paper. 2 Analyses of the structural characteristics of
organism for engineering problems, which are usually neglected, are emphasized, and a
feasible way is introduced. This step is the main part, which builds bridges between
the structural characteristics of organisms and engineering structures, and it is
crucial for the method of structural bionic design. Through simplifying organism
structure and grouping its parameters, the structural characteristics of organisms
can be extracted and transferred into engineering structures. 3 A general evaluation
criterion is proposed. It can reflect the effect of both positive and negative
influencing factors in a right way, and is a quantitative reference for the
comparison between two different designs for engineering problem. 4 This paper
proposes a systematic method of structural bionic design. Based on the method, a
bionic thin-walled cylindrical shell is designed, and its loadbearing efficiency is
improved by as much as 44.7. Through structural bionic design of the shell, the
method is confirmed to be a feasible and effective one.<component x="49.62" y="163.4"
