power engineering is developed involves construction of economically efficient and
reliable power installations, which is achieved through increasing their capacity and
opti( mizing their operating parameters (temperature and pressure of working medium).
Use of new high( strength materials for this purpose entails the need to achieve
essentially better quality of technological and design elaborations. Under the
conditions of strong competition, decreasing the net cost, and shortening the time
taken to develop and manufacture the equip( ment are becoming the main objectives.
One of lines in which the above(mentioned objectives can be achieved consists of
applying welded items that make it possible to use combined constructions consisting
of materials containing different alloys, as well as of bil( lets fabricated as a
result of various secondary conver( sion processes (rolling, casting, and forging).
Contradictions between the designers, specialists in materials science, process
engineers, and produc( tion structures always arise in the course of developing new
equipment. Lack of interaction between them usually results in that equipment is
designed with poorer quality, that the materials are selected inade( quately, that
nonoptimal technological processes of equipment manufacture are developed, due to
which there is high probability that flaws (cracks and discon( tinuities) and zones
with pronounced structural and mechanical nonuniformity may appear during manu(
facture and operation, and as a consequence, that the actual performance
characteristics of new equipment will differ from the design ones. Work on finalizing
the design and technology at the stages of manufacture and operation result in a
considerably longer time taken to develop a power installation and, accordingly, in a
higher net cost of this installation. Welding is one of the main technological
processes determining the operability of a construction. Use of welding essentially
alters the stressed state of a con( struction and mechanical properties of local
zones in welded connections. In addition, it results in a higher risk of the
occurrence of technological cracks and plastic deformations causing distortion of the
design geometry of parts and assemblies. Application of the optimal welding
technology makes it possible to achieve high quality and reliability of the
construction. At the same time, it should be noted that even a slight change in the
design of welded items and correct choice of materials can make it possible to use an
essentially simpler technology and apply the most suitable welding methods.
Therefore, welding tech( nology must be developed jointly with working out the design
and selecting the material. The general principles of combined mechanical and
technological designing were formulated by a number of outstanding scientists,
including N.O. Okerblom, G.L. Petrov, G.A. Nikolaev, V.N. Ze( mzin, V.A. Vinokurov,
N.N. Prokhorov, G.P. Karzov, F.A. Khromchenko, and some others. The cycle of combined
mechanical and technological designing is implemented in carrying out interconnected
stages through which equipment is developed. Feedforward and feedback links are
formed between the develop( ment of construction, selection of materials, elabora(
tion of technology, and the stage of equipment manu( facture (Fig. 1). Below,
interactions between the indi( vidual stages of developing a construction are
considered in more detail. The ini( Development of a construction (designing). tial

individual items, preliminary selection of the design makeup of the main items and

science, work out additional requirements for materials of the main items in order to
fulfill the strength characteristics specified by the designer (safety margins and
strength degradation factors of welded connections), the required design service

equivalent working stresses and averaged temperatures related to the entire volume of
the metal of a structural element. However, in estimating the integrity of a
structure, local stressed state must first of all be studied. The majority of defects
in and destructions of welded items are local in nature and are connected exactly
with development of structural, mechanical, and chemical nonuniformities in the zones
of welded connections. Taking into account the results obtained from a study of
structural and mechanical nonuniformity of welded connections, the designer can make
calculations of stressed and strain state essentially more confident and change the
design jointly with the process engineer by placing welded joints away from the zone
of increased stresses. Despite the fact that various software systems are presently
available using which it is possible to sim( ulate operational effects on structural
elements and determine the distribution of temperatures, deforma( tions, and stresses
taking into account the geometry of items specified by the designer, a calculated
analysis of the hazard of local brittle fractures still involves certain
difficulties. A paradoxical situation occurs, in which local stressed and strain
state can be determined with high trustworthiness by means of numerical computa( tion
methods, whereas attempts to estimate the condi( tions under which brittle fracture
occurs in welded items at the stage of mechanical and technological designing are not
met with success due to lack of quan( titative engineering criteria for local brittle
fracture. Criteria for local fracture must be sufficiently universal and simple for
the possibility of carrying out the anal( ysis and considering different versions of
a construc( tion within the time scheduled for elaborating the design. For carrying
out a quantitative analysis of resis( tance to local fractures under creep conditions
at high temperatures, specialists of the Central Boiler-Tur( bine Institute (TsKTI)
have developed a phenomeno( logical model of brittle fracture [2-15] and criteria
using which fast quantitative calculation assessments can be carried out at the stage
of mechanical and tech( nological designing. The model describes the kinetics

safety factors and design service life. In this case, a set of additional studies on
estab( lishing the properties of metal in different zones with determining the local
fracture strength characteristics must be carried out. For the designer be able to
estimate the influence of temperature effects on the level of stresses and on the
strain state within the framework of selecting the materials, he or she must have the
results from studies of creep characteristics and relaxation of stresses for the base
metal and for different zones of welded con( nections. Information contained in all
the above(mentioned characteristics of metal and welded connections must allow the
designer to perform trustworthy simulation of the stressed(and strain state of the
construction for ensuring its guaranteed service life. In developing a new power
installation with an increased power capacity that must comply with the requirement
of having a decreased metal intensity, the designer is compelled to increase the
level of stresses in its components and, accordingly, to use high(strength materials.
But as the strength of material increases, the indicators characterizing the
technological and opera( tional fracture strength of metal decrease considerably and,
consequently, there is an increased risk of brittle fracture. The presence of
structural stress concentra( tions, as well as metallurgical and technological (weld(
ing) flaws facilitates development of brittle fractures. Figure 3 shows the decrease
of the permissible size of &#x3C3; ) for defects with increasing the yield strength (
0.2 chromium-molybdenum-vanadium steels. It can be seen that, as the strength level
of steels increases by a factor of 1.6-1.7, the permissible size of a defect with
respect to the condition of local brittle fracture decreases by a factor of 9-10
[2-6, 11, 12, 15]. A con( clusion can be drawn from what was said above that in
selecting materials for welded parts it is necessary to consider not only the
strength characteristics of metal, but also pay special attention to enhancement of
requirements to its metallurgical quality in the part of imposing more stringent
norms on the sizes of permis( sible flaws. Development of welding and surfacing

analyses the overall design of a welded item and technical requirements for operating
parameters, and also the materials suggested for manufacture from the viewpoint of
ensuring weldability. Based on a pre( liminary analysis, he or she selects welding
methods and welding materials taking into account the strength properties of metal
specified by the designer and opti( mizes the design of welded items, versions of
grooving for welding, and the layout of weld joints. At the second stage, a program
is developed for determining the optimal parameters of technological welding
processes and thermal treatment. This stage is commenced with the following: the

conversions evolve are esti( mated. The kinetic dependences are used for experimen(
tally simulating the deformation and destruction of material in different zones of
welded connections dur( ing tests of samples of the studied metal and for deter(
mining its resistance to technological cracks. Devel( opment of quantitative
engineering criteria for tech( nological resistance to crack growth, as well as
metrologically supported test methods, is of the most important significance for
implementing such an approach. The results obtained from long(term studies and
theoretical elaborations carried out at TsKTI made it possible to establish general
regularities in the devel( opment of technological cracks during welding and thermal
treatment [16-27]. It was shown that hot and cold cracks appearing during welding and
cracks resulting from thermal treatment develop according to the mechanisms of
brittle intergranular fracture under the effect of temporary and residual welding
stresses. The formation of these stresses is characterized by kinetic regularities of
creep and embrittlement in cer( tain temperature and time intervals corresponding to
nonequilibrium state of metal in the corresponding zone of welded connection [23,
24]. An analysis of phenomenological regularities in the development of this type of
failures makes it possible to describe tech( nological cracks in welded connections
using the statements of general creep fracture theory. New crite( ria for
technological resistance to crack growth similar to the fracture criteria under creep
and stress relax( ation conditions have been developed. For quantita( tively
assessing the resistance to cold cracks and cracks appearing during thermal
treatment, it has been pro( posed to use threshold fracture strength values deter(
mined according to special procedures [28-30] under creep and stress relaxation
conditions. The loading parameters are established based on the results of the
previous simulation. The resistance to hot cracks is determined from the dip of
plasticity in the tempera( ture interval and from the actual deformation rate
obtained from a preliminary calculation at the stage of simulating the technological
process of welding [27]. The temperature and stressed(and(strained states are
simulated by means of the developed computer program using the finite(element method.
The mechanical model (the geometric relations and schemes characterizing the state of
deformed medium) has been implemented according to the clas( sic theory of strains
and stresses. In the physical model characterizing the form of correlation between
stresses and strains, and which is based on the statements of theory of nonisothermal

power engineering is developed involves construction of economically efficient and
reliable power installations, which is achieved through increasing their capacity and
opti( mizing their operating parameters (temperature and pressure of working medium).
Use of new high( strength materials for this purpose entails the need to achieve
essentially better quality of technological and design elaborations. Under the
conditions of strong competition, decreasing the net cost, and shortening the time
taken to develop and manufacture the equip( ment are becoming the main objectives.
One of lines in which the above(mentioned objectives can be achieved consists of
applying welded items that make it possible to use combined constructions consisting
of materials containing different alloys, as well as of bil( lets fabricated as a
result of various secondary conver( sion processes (rolling, casting, and forging).
Contradictions between the designers, specialists in materials science, process
engineers, and produc( tion structures always arise in the course of developing new
equipment. Lack of interaction between them usually results in that equipment is
designed with poorer quality, that the materials are selected inade( quately, that
nonoptimal technological processes of equipment manufacture are developed, due to
which there is high probability that flaws (cracks and discon( tinuities) and zones
with pronounced structural and mechanical nonuniformity may appear during manu(
facture and operation, and as a consequence, that the actual performance
characteristics of new equipment will differ from the design ones. Work on finalizing
the design and technology at the stages of manufacture and operation result in a
considerably longer time taken to develop a power installation and, accordingly, in a
higher net cost of this installation. Welding is one of the main technological
processes determining the operability of a construction. Use of welding essentially
alters the stressed state of a con( struction and mechanical properties of local
zones in welded connections. In addition, it results in a higher risk of the
occurrence of technological cracks and plastic deformations causing distortion of the
design geometry of parts and assemblies. Application of the optimal welding
technology makes it possible to achieve high quality and reliability of the
construction. At the same time, it should be noted that even a slight change in the
design of welded items and correct choice of materials can make it possible to use an
essentially simpler technology and apply the most suitable welding methods.
Therefore, welding tech( nology must be developed jointly with working out the design
and selecting the material. The general principles of combined mechanical and
technological designing were formulated by a number of outstanding scientists,
including N.O. Okerblom, G.L. Petrov, G.A. Nikolaev, V.N. Ze( mzin, V.A. Vinokurov,
N.N. Prokhorov, G.P. Karzov, F.A. Khromchenko, and some others. The cycle of combined
mechanical and technological designing is implemented in carrying out interconnected
stages through which equipment is developed. Feedforward and feedback links are
formed between the develop( ment of construction, selection of materials, elabora(
tion of technology, and the stage of equipment manu( facture (Fig. 1). Below,
interactions between the indi( vidual stages of developing a construction are
considered in more detail. The ini( Development of a construction (designing). tial

structure, local stressed state must first of all be studied. The majority of defects
in and destructions of welded items are local in nature and are connected exactly
with development of structural, mechanical, and chemical nonuniformities in the zones
of welded connections. Taking into account the results obtained from a study of
structural and mechanical nonuniformity of welded connections, the designer can make
calculations of stressed and strain state essentially more confident and change the
design jointly with the process engineer by placing welded joints away from the zone
of increased stresses. Despite the fact that various software systems are presently
available using which it is possible to sim( ulate operational effects on structural
elements and determine the distribution of temperatures, deforma( tions, and stresses
taking into account the geometry of items specified by the designer, a calculated
analysis of the hazard of local brittle fractures still involves certain
difficulties. A paradoxical situation occurs, in which local stressed and strain
state can be determined with high trustworthiness by means of numerical computa( tion
methods, whereas attempts to estimate the condi( tions under which brittle fracture
occurs in welded items at the stage of mechanical and technological designing are not
met with success due to lack of quan( titative engineering criteria for local brittle

the possibility of carrying out the anal( ysis and considering different versions of

estab( lishing the properties of metal in different zones with determining the local

estimate the influence of temperature effects on the level of stresses and on the
strain state within the framework of selecting the materials, he or she must have the
results from studies of creep characteristics and relaxation of stresses for the base
metal and for different zones of welded con( nections. Information contained in all
the above(mentioned characteristics of metal and welded connections must allow the
designer to perform trustworthy simulation of the stressed(and strain state of the
construction for ensuring its guaranteed service life. In developing a new power
installation with an increased power capacity that must comply with the requirement
of having a decreased metal intensity, the designer is compelled to increase the
level of stresses in its components and, accordingly, to use high(strength materials.
But as the strength of material increases, the indicators characterizing the
technological and opera( tional fracture strength of metal decrease considerably and,
consequently, there is an increased risk of brittle fracture. The presence of
structural stress concentra( tions, as well as metallurgical and technological (weld(
ing) flaws facilitates development of brittle fractures. Figure 3 shows the decrease
of the permissible size of &#x3C3; ) for defects with increasing the yield strength (
0.2 chromium-molybdenum-vanadium steels. It can be seen that, as the strength level
of steels increases by a factor of 1.6-1.7, the permissible size of a defect with
respect to the condition of local brittle fracture decreases by a factor of 9-10
[2-6, 11, 12, 15]. A con( clusion can be drawn from what was said above that in
selecting materials for welded parts it is necessary to consider not only the
strength characteristics of metal, but also pay special attention to enhancement of
requirements to its metallurgical quality in the part of imposing more stringent
norms on the sizes of permis( sible flaws. Development of welding and surfacing

methods and welding materials taking into account the strength properties of metal
specified by the designer and opti( mizes the design of welded items, versions of
grooving for welding, and the layout of weld joints. At the second stage, a program

tally simulating the deformation and destruction of material in different zones of
welded connections dur( ing tests of samples of the studied metal and for deter(
mining its resistance to technological cracks. Devel( opment of quantitative
engineering criteria for tech( nological resistance to crack growth, as well as
metrologically supported test methods, is of the most important significance for
implementing such an approach. The results obtained from long(term studies and
theoretical elaborations carried out at TsKTI made it possible to establish general
regularities in the devel( opment of technological cracks during welding and thermal
treatment [16-27]. It was shown that hot and cold cracks appearing during welding and
cracks resulting from thermal treatment develop according to the mechanisms of
brittle intergranular fracture under the effect of temporary and residual welding
stresses. The formation of these stresses is characterized by kinetic regularities of
creep and embrittlement in cer( tain temperature and time intervals corresponding to
nonequilibrium state of metal in the corresponding zone of welded connection [23,
24]. An analysis of phenomenological regularities in the development of this type of
failures makes it possible to describe tech( nological cracks in welded connections
using the statements of general creep fracture theory. New crite( ria for
technological resistance to crack growth similar to the fracture criteria under creep
and stress relax( ation conditions have been developed. For quantita( tively
assessing the resistance to cold cracks and cracks appearing during thermal
treatment, it has been pro( posed to use threshold fracture strength values deter(
mined according to special procedures [28-30] under creep and stress relaxation
conditions. The loading parameters are established based on the results of the
previous simulation. The resistance to hot cracks is determined from the dip of
plasticity in the tempera( ture interval and from the actual deformation rate
obtained from a preliminary calculation at the stage of simulating the technological
process of welding [27]. The temperature and stressed(and(strained states are
simulated by means of the developed computer program using the finite(element method.
