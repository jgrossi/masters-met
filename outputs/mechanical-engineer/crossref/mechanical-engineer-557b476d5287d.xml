essential for the success and competitive advantage of organizations or companies, as
well as for [1] strong economies in the 21st century . The innovation for the
organizations in China, such as in the manufacturing industry, is also a fundamental
choice for the further [2] [3-5] development . Researchers in China also show that
the key factor to enhance the competitiveness for industries lies in the improvement
of capability of innovation. Many manufacturing companies in China now have to pay
more attention to innovation than ever before. There are nine factors influencing an
organization's [6] ability to innovation . One of them is employees. This factor
takes into account the various personal characteristics associated with employees and
the motivation of employees to become innovative. There are five categories of

process , and they are entrepreneurs with technology, industry-specific inventors,
professional inventors, grantsmen, and inveterate inventors. If a part of employees
are inventors, such as industry- specific inventors, the innovative ability of a
company will increase. One of objectives of National Technological Innovation Method
and Tool Engineering Research Center is to carry out a program to train many
engineers for various industries, and make them to become innovative engineers. But
there is no definition for an innovative engineer in China. In order to push the
training program forward, a clear description of the functions for this kind of
engineers is needed. We define that an innovative engineer is an industry-specific
inventor, who creates specific technical improvements for product designs or
processes in which he or she works in, usually for several years. Most of the
improvements are incremental innovations, but a few are radical innovations. The
training program should include many training classes. A training class should follow
a process. The paper shows the generation of the process, which is called an
interactive training model of TRIZ. The model is especially A problem can be defined
as the gap between the present [10] and some desired state of affairs . There are two
types of problems which are routine and inventive problems in [11] engineering by the
definition of TRIZ . If all the critical steps from a problem to its solution are
known, the problem is a routine one. If at least one critical step to the solution as
well as the solution itself is unknown the problem is an inventive problem. So called
creativity enhancing techniques or idea [12] generation techniques are used to solve
problems . There are many creativity enhancing techniques in literatures. For [13]
example, SMITH carried out an extensive analysis of 172 techniques. Brainstorming,
method 635, and synectics are examples of this kind of techniques. The techniques do
assist many problem solvers or inventors to solve problems, but they are not always
successful because the creative capacities of problem solvers have reached their
limits in finding novelties, especially when the artifacts are complex, since the
value of engineering-like concepts and [14] brainstorming-derived practices have been
introduced . If they are useful, problem solvers may not be able to generate [15]
ideas without the proper experience . The hope of solving this kind of problems
appeared in the application of TRIZ, which is theory of inventive problem
solving(TRIZ) developed in the former USSR. Some indication of its success can be
derived from inquiries within the German industry classifying TRIZ as an effective
approach to problem solving, and indicating a ''rather high'' to ''very high''
economic benefit obtained from using TRIZ for 57% [16] of companies . TRIZ aims to
create an algorithmic approach applying inventive knowledge abstracted from patent
bases all over the world to solve inventive problems. TRIZ is a methodology, a tool
set, a knowledge base, and a model-based technology for generating innovative ideas
and solutions for solving inventive problems. The toolkits in TRIZ are problem
formulation, system analysis, failure analysis, patterns of system evolution,
inventive principles, standard solutions and ARIZ et al. All these assist inventors
to solve inventive problems quickly and efficiently. Fig. 2 shows all the problems
and their solving techniques. When an obstacle appears in the innovation process, a
problem can be identified, which is a routine or an inventive one. If it is a routine
problem, a creativity enhancing technique or common techniques is selected to solve
the problem. If the problem is an inventive problem,<component x="303.34" y="49.95"

TRIZ training process for organizations has been [28] studied for years. RANTANEN, et
al , developed a flowchart or a model for TRIZ training for an organization. [29]
JUN, et al , also developed a flowchart for Samsung TRIZ implementation. These
flowcharts show that the TRIZ experts outside the organization should carry out TRIZ
pilot project to show that TRIZ is powerful for innovation in a company. This process
is not suitable for the situations in China. We have no time to carry out a pilot
project for a company to test TRIZ because the local governments push many companies
to join a training class at the same time. Before the beginning of the training
program, most of the companies do not know what TRIZ is. They only know that the
program will train some engineers and to increase the innovative abilities of these
persons. It should be a good thing for the companies themselves too. In order to
increase the effectiveness of the application of TRIZ, high quality should be assured
for any training class. The object of the program is to train "innovative engineers"
for the companies. We have the freedom to make a plan, and to select education
processes and courses. All the trainers are from our institution, or we may invite
trainers from all over the world. But a new training process model is needed for
successful training programs, which is [28-29] different from the following : (1) The
companies to join the training program are selected by local governments. (2) The
local governments pay more attention to the training results, such as the attitudes
of the engineers to join the program, the patents applied from the classes. (3) The
evaluation made by companies which join the program in the middle or after the finish
of a training process. (4) The impressions of the classes on the companies which do
not join the program at first. Fig. 4 is the TRIZ training model developed form a
class after two years training practices. There are six phases in this process, from
selecting engineers of the companies to summing-up. The process lasts six to twelve
months. The governments, TRIZ institutions and companies to join the programs will be
interacted during the process. In Fig. 4, an innovation process model with a fuzzy
front end is integrated. The inventive problems which the engineers face in companies
are always found in fuzzy front [30] ends, conceptual designs or manufacturing
processes . The solutions will return to these stages and will push innovative
activities forward in the companies. The following is the work to be done in every
phase in the TRIZ based interactive training model. Phase 1: Selecting engineers The
local governments are responsible for selecting companies to join the program. The
companies selected recommend the engineers to be trained. The numbers for one
training class are limited. The recommended age range of the engineers is 30-50 years
old. They should have been responsible for some designs of products or manufacturing
processes and do have had some experience. The engineers selected may not know TRIZ
beforehand but their experiences is an important factor in understanding the general
meanings of TRIZ and applying them in innovative activities in short time. Phase 2:
Training stage-1 The selected engineers are gathered together as a class and trained
for seven days continuously. The conceptual knowledge and some procedural knowledge
in TRIZ are presented by a group of trainers. Every day, there are oral explanations
of about six hours on TRIZ, with no discussions or dialogs. And every night, there is
a two hours' discussion on any problems studied or encountered during the day. The
engineers are free to join the discussions at any time. Phase 3: Finding problems The
engineers return to their companies to find inventive problems which were not found
and not solved before. This phase needs one or two months. During this period, the
trainers will go to every company to discusses the problems with the engineers and
decide if the problems are suitable for the following use or not. After the end of
this phase every engineer in the class has found at least one inventive problem to be
solved in the company. Phases 4: Training stage-2 The selected engineers are gathered
together again and trained for another three or four days continuously. The courses
are designed after considering all the problems that the engineers selected. The main
points of the courses are the systematic methods integrating TRIZ, P&amp;B, QFD,
axiomatic design theory et al, which are mainly procedural knowledge. Several case
studies are presented step by step. Phases 5: Finding solutions The engineers return
to their companies and solve the problems selected. At the same time they do some
routine work at his or her position for the companies. During this phase, the
trainers may go to every company a few times to discuss the problems and possible
solutions if the engineers need it. In the end, most engineers do find solutions to
the problems. They may make application for patents. This phase is lasts for about
four months. Phases 6: Summing up The final oral examination is made and every
engineer will present his/her results using PPT files. Members of a committee
specific for the examination make discussions with them. An evaluation is made and a
certificate is presented to every engineer. 5 Implementation of the Training Program
5.1 General information The Innovation Method Society supported by the central
government of China, and the local governments together push the training program in
order to increase the innovative abilities of the engineers in industries. The
National Technological Innovation Method and Tool Engineering Research Center is one
of major training organizations. From 2008 to now, it has completed training
processes for twenty classes in China, and some of them are shown in Table 2. At
first, an organizer selects the engineers from different companies of a local region,
for example Hebei Province or Guangdong Province. Then they spend more than six
months to carry out the training process according to the model shown in Fig. 4. Some
selected engineers may not follow the process and drop out from the class. In the
end, some engineers as the final engineers join the final oral examinations, which
number less than the originally selected. The final engineers who pass the
examination are certificated as "Innovative Engineers", level 1 or level 2. There are
three conditions which should be satisfied for the engineers entering the final phase
and passing the examination. They are as follows: 1) Having found an inventive
problem from the innovation process of their company; 2) Having solved the problem
and had a good solution; 3) Having made a credible presentation using PPT. If they
have found and solved an important problem or sent an application for an inventive
patent, they will be certified as "Inventive Engineer"-level 2. Others are
certificate as level 1.<component x="50.99" y="60.8" width="243.96" height="446.75"

first training class organized by Guangdong Science and Technology Department in
Guangdong province, which is the organization of local government for the development
of sciences and technologies. Seventy-five engineers were selected from nineteen
companies, including BYD, BROAD-OCEAN and GAC, etc, were trained. Fifty-two passed
the final examination. Thirty of them were certificated as inventive engineers level
2, and the others were level 1. All the engineers found fifty-four inventive problems
from the innovative processes of seventeen different companies and solved them at
last. According to incomplete statistics thirty-six patent applications, twenty-two
patents for inventions and fourteen patents for utility models have been sent to
SIPO(State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC) and all application numbers have
been got. There are two engineers in the class from Broad-Ocean, which is a company
that produces micro-motors, located in Zhongshan, Guangdong Province. One engineer
developed three new concepts for the structure of a traditional micro-motor and
applied five patents to SIPO. The function analysis-standard solutions of TRIZ were
used in his work. Up to now, three new designs have been finished and the new process
design is being carried out. The cost for a new product will be lowered by 1.98 RMB,
and the efficiency for manufacturing will increase to 13.2%. The new products have
been put into the Chinese market in 2012. There were four engineers that joined the
class from Shengyi, which is a company located in Dongguan, Guangdong Province. FR-4,
CEM-1, CEM-3 and Prepreg are currently the products in this company. Every engineer
found and solved at least one inventive problem of design or process and sent
applications for patents for inventions and utility models. The new products based on
the patents<component x="50.88" y="44.69" width="252.28" height="463.17" page="6"

markets. TRIZ has become an efficient tool to help engineers make innovation in their
company. Most of the engineers who joined the class did achieve good results. Some of
them have solved the problems that had not been solved in their company for a long
time. Their ability to find problems in the design or process phase of a product and
to solve them efficiently increased. Some of them have made presentations about basic
principles of TRIZ to their colleagues to form a circumstance for study and apply
TRIZ in their company. 5.3 Case 2: New structured headstock and tailstock of CRH
Tangshan Railway Vehicle Co. Ltd located in Tangshan, Hebei Province, produces high
speed train called China Railways Highspeed(CRH) or "Harmony Express". We organized a
class for this company from May 2012 to December 2012. At first 60 engineers in
different working posts were joined the class and 28 engineers followed the whole
training process. One engineer has gotten a few patents for the new structured
headstocks and tailstocks of CRH. In the process of finding and solving an inventive
problem for improving the CRH, TRIZ is applied. 5.3.1 Situation analysis At first,
the engineer should study the situation for improving as shown in Fig. 5. The
headstock and tailstock in a CRH are not changed for both running directions. The
headstock in one running direction is the tailstock in reverse direction. The
distribution of airflow on the surface of headstock and tailstock are different, the
air resistance on the train mainly is pressure drag which rests with the shapes of
headstock and tailstock. Because the shape is designed symmetrical so that the
headstock and tailstock can be interchanged, the drag reduction can not reach the
limit. Big drag will result in electrical energy lose. Drag<component x="304.64"

of mechanical engineers, this problem is a parameter optimization problem that the
shape of headstock In general speaking the principles and the cases selected are
specific TRIZ solutions for the problem. The designer should transform them into
domain solutions. In this process the knowledge of design for high speed trains,
especially the headstocks and tailstocks, and the specific TRIZ solutions are both
important. From the specific TRIZ solutions the engineer could find unexpected
discoveries [31] (UXDs) for triggering him or her to generate new ideas for domain
solutions. In this case, No. 4 and No. 15 are used to produce new concepts for
solving the problem. For example, the shape of the headstock and the tailstock should
not be same according to the principle No. 4 for reducing the drag, and the shapes
should be changed into each other when the headstock and the tailstock interchange
according to the principle No. 15. So in one direction the headstock has a specific
shape and the tailstock has different shape for reducing drag. When the train stops
for reverse direction, both the headstock and the tailstock interchanged rapidly.
5.3.4 One accepted solution Fig. 7 shows one accepted solution(the publication of the
case has been authorized by enterprise, Courtesy of 5.3.3 Solving the inventive
problem Fig. 6 shows the process to solve the problem. The engineer finds two
parameters in the matrix of TRIZ, which present the inventive problem well. Four
inventive principles are found, which are Transformation properties (No. 35),
Asymmetry(No. 4), Dynamics(No. 15) and Prior action(No. 10). Also several cases using
these principles are identified for the analogous application. Tangshan Railway
Vehicle Co., LTD, China). Using TRIZ the designer could produce many possible
solutions for the problem. After evaluation a few are selected as accepted solutions.
Computer simulation and testing should be carried out for selecting final solutions.
the headstock is shorter than the tailstock when In Fig. 7, the train runs from right
to left direction. When changing direction the tailstock should be shortened and the
headstock should be elongated. The changing processes are controlled easily. 5.4

innovation process of a company are always faced in fuzzy front ends, conceptual
designs and manufacturing processes. TRIZ is a systematic method to solve these kinds
of problems. The urgent need is to push the mechanical engineers of companies in
China to study and apply TRIZ to solve inventive problems that exist in their working
environment. (2) Training is a choice to push the application forward. An interactive
model for training TRIZ is developed, which is suitable not only for several
companies at same time in a region but also for one company. The activities in this
model have tight relationships with the activities in the innovation processes of the
companies. The engineers who join the training class have to find and solve the
inventive problems of their own companies. (3) The implementation of the model is
carried out as a program, in which there are twenty classes in different provinces of
China. The organizers are the Science and Technology Department of local governments.
Most of the engineers who have passed the final oral examinations have sent patent
applications to SIPO. Some engineers have developed new products for their companies.
The innovative ability for all the engineers to join the program is increased to a
degree. The organizers are satisfied with the results. The next step is to make more
training classes in the interactive model developed for different regions available,
to meet the increasing needs of manufacturing companies in China.<component x="50.97"

essential for the success and competitive advantage of organizations or companies, as
well as for [1] strong economies in the 21st century . The innovation for the
organizations in China, such as in the manufacturing industry, is also a fundamental
choice for the further [2] [3-5] development . Researchers in China also show that
the key factor to enhance the competitiveness for industries lies in the improvement
of capability of innovation. Many manufacturing companies in China now have to pay
more attention to innovation than ever before. There are nine factors influencing an
organization's [6] ability to innovation . One of them is employees. This factor
takes into account the various personal characteristics associated with employees and
the motivation of employees to become innovative. There are five categories of

process , and they are entrepreneurs with technology, industry-specific inventors,
professional inventors, grantsmen, and inveterate inventors. If a part of employees
are inventors, such as industry- specific inventors, the innovative ability of a
company will increase. One of objectives of National Technological Innovation Method
and Tool Engineering Research Center is to carry out a program to train many
engineers for various industries, and make them to become innovative engineers. But
there is no definition for an innovative engineer in China. In order to push the
training program forward, a clear description of the functions for this kind of
engineers is needed. We define that an innovative engineer is an industry-specific
inventor, who creates specific technical improvements for product designs or
processes in which he or she works in, usually for several years. Most of the
improvements are incremental innovations, but a few are radical innovations. The
training program should include many training classes. A training class should follow
a process. The paper shows the generation of the process, which is called an
interactive training model of TRIZ. The model is especially A problem can be defined
as the gap between the present [10] and some desired state of affairs . There are two
types of problems which are routine and inventive problems in [11] engineering by the
definition of TRIZ . If all the critical steps from a problem to its solution are
known, the problem is a routine one. If at least one critical step to the solution as
well as the solution itself is unknown the problem is an inventive problem. So called
creativity enhancing techniques or idea [12] generation techniques are used to solve
problems . There are many creativity enhancing techniques in literatures. For [13]
example, SMITH carried out an extensive analysis of 172 techniques. Brainstorming,
method 635, and synectics are examples of this kind of techniques. The techniques do
assist many problem solvers or inventors to solve problems, but they are not always
successful because the creative capacities of problem solvers have reached their
limits in finding novelties, especially when the artifacts are complex, since the
value of engineering-like concepts and [14] brainstorming-derived practices have been
introduced . If they are useful, problem solvers may not be able to generate [15]
ideas without the proper experience . The hope of solving this kind of problems
appeared in the application of TRIZ, which is theory of inventive problem
solving(TRIZ) developed in the former USSR. Some indication of its success can be
derived from inquiries within the German industry classifying TRIZ as an effective
approach to problem solving, and indicating a ''rather high'' to ''very high''
economic benefit obtained from using TRIZ for 57% [16] of companies . TRIZ aims to
create an algorithmic approach applying inventive knowledge abstracted from patent
bases all over the world to solve inventive problems. TRIZ is a methodology, a tool
set, a knowledge base, and a model-based technology for generating innovative ideas
and solutions for solving inventive problems. The toolkits in TRIZ are problem
formulation, system analysis, failure analysis, patterns of system evolution,
inventive principles, standard solutions and ARIZ et al. All these assist inventors
to solve inventive problems quickly and efficiently. Fig. 2 shows all the problems
and their solving techniques. When an obstacle appears in the innovation process, a
problem can be identified, which is a routine or an inventive one. If it is a routine
problem, a creativity enhancing technique or common techniques is selected to solve
the problem. If the problem is an inventive problem,<component x="303.34" y="49.95"

TRIZ training process for organizations has been [28] studied for years. RANTANEN, et
al , developed a flowchart or a model for TRIZ training for an organization. [29]
JUN, et al , also developed a flowchart for Samsung TRIZ implementation. These
flowcharts show that the TRIZ experts outside the organization should carry out TRIZ
pilot project to show that TRIZ is powerful for innovation in a company. This process
is not suitable for the situations in China. We have no time to carry out a pilot
project for a company to test TRIZ because the local governments push many companies
to join a training class at the same time. Before the beginning of the training
program, most of the companies do not know what TRIZ is. They only know that the
program will train some engineers and to increase the innovative abilities of these
persons. It should be a good thing for the companies themselves too. In order to
increase the effectiveness of the application of TRIZ, high quality should be assured
for any training class. The object of the program is to train "innovative engineers"
for the companies. We have the freedom to make a plan, and to select education
processes and courses. All the trainers are from our institution, or we may invite
trainers from all over the world. But a new training process model is needed for
successful training programs, which is [28-29] different from the following : (1) The
companies to join the training program are selected by local governments. (2) The
local governments pay more attention to the training results, such as the attitudes
of the engineers to join the program, the patents applied from the classes. (3) The
evaluation made by companies which join the program in the middle or after the finish
of a training process. (4) The impressions of the classes on the companies which do
not join the program at first. Fig. 4 is the TRIZ training model developed form a
class after two years training practices. There are six phases in this process, from
selecting engineers of the companies to summing-up. The process lasts six to twelve
months. The governments, TRIZ institutions and companies to join the programs will be
interacted during the process. In Fig. 4, an innovation process model with a fuzzy
front end is integrated. The inventive problems which the engineers face in companies
are always found in fuzzy front [30] ends, conceptual designs or manufacturing
processes . The solutions will return to these stages and will push innovative
activities forward in the companies. The following is the work to be done in every
phase in the TRIZ based interactive training model. Phase 1: Selecting engineers The
local governments are responsible for selecting companies to join the program. The
companies selected recommend the engineers to be trained. The numbers for one
training class are limited. The recommended age range of the engineers is 30-50 years
old. They should have been responsible for some designs of products or manufacturing
processes and do have had some experience. The engineers selected may not know TRIZ
beforehand but their experiences is an important factor in understanding the general
meanings of TRIZ and applying them in innovative activities in short time. Phase 2:
Training stage-1 The selected engineers are gathered together as a class and trained
for seven days continuously. The conceptual knowledge and some procedural knowledge
in TRIZ are presented by a group of trainers. Every day, there are oral explanations
of about six hours on TRIZ, with no discussions or dialogs. And every night, there is
a two hours' discussion on any problems studied or encountered during the day. The
engineers are free to join the discussions at any time. Phase 3: Finding problems The
engineers return to their companies to find inventive problems which were not found
and not solved before. This phase needs one or two months. During this period, the
trainers will go to every company to discusses the problems with the engineers and
decide if the problems are suitable for the following use or not. After the end of
this phase every engineer in the class has found at least one inventive problem to be
solved in the company. Phases 4: Training stage-2 The selected engineers are gathered
together again and trained for another three or four days continuously. The courses
are designed after considering all the problems that the engineers selected. The main
points of the courses are the systematic methods integrating TRIZ, P&amp;B, QFD,
axiomatic design theory et al, which are mainly procedural knowledge. Several case
studies are presented step by step. Phases 5: Finding solutions The engineers return
to their companies and solve the problems selected. At the same time they do some
routine work at his or her position for the companies. During this phase, the
trainers may go to every company a few times to discuss the problems and possible
solutions if the engineers need it. In the end, most engineers do find solutions to
the problems. They may make application for patents. This phase is lasts for about
four months. Phases 6: Summing up The final oral examination is made and every
engineer will present his/her results using PPT files. Members of a committee
specific for the examination make discussions with them. An evaluation is made and a
certificate is presented to every engineer. 5 Implementation of the Training Program
5.1 General information The Innovation Method Society supported by the central
government of China, and the local governments together push the training program in
order to increase the innovative abilities of the engineers in industries. The
National Technological Innovation Method and Tool Engineering Research Center is one
of major training organizations. From 2008 to now, it has completed training
processes for twenty classes in China, and some of them are shown in Table 2. At
first, an organizer selects the engineers from different companies of a local region,
for example Hebei Province or Guangdong Province. Then they spend more than six
months to carry out the training process according to the model shown in Fig. 4. Some
selected engineers may not follow the process and drop out from the class. In the
end, some engineers as the final engineers join the final oral examinations, which
number less than the originally selected. The final engineers who pass the
examination are certificated as "Innovative Engineers", level 1 or level 2. There are
three conditions which should be satisfied for the engineers entering the final phase
and passing the examination. They are as follows: 1) Having found an inventive
problem from the innovation process of their company; 2) Having solved the problem
and had a good solution; 3) Having made a credible presentation using PPT. If they
have found and solved an important problem or sent an application for an inventive
patent, they will be certified as "Inventive Engineer"-level 2. Others are
certificate as level 1.<component x="50.99" y="60.8" width="243.96" height="446.75"

first training class organized by Guangdong Science and Technology Department in
Guangdong province, which is the organization of local government for the development
of sciences and technologies. Seventy-five engineers were selected from nineteen
companies, including BYD, BROAD-OCEAN and GAC, etc, were trained. Fifty-two passed
the final examination. Thirty of them were certificated as inventive engineers level
2, and the others were level 1. All the engineers found fifty-four inventive problems
from the innovative processes of seventeen different companies and solved them at
last. According to incomplete statistics thirty-six patent applications, twenty-two
patents for inventions and fourteen patents for utility models have been sent to
SIPO(State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC) and all application numbers have
been got. There are two engineers in the class from Broad-Ocean, which is a company
that produces micro-motors, located in Zhongshan, Guangdong Province. One engineer
developed three new concepts for the structure of a traditional micro-motor and
applied five patents to SIPO. The function analysis-standard solutions of TRIZ were
used in his work. Up to now, three new designs have been finished and the new process
design is being carried out. The cost for a new product will be lowered by 1.98 RMB,
and the efficiency for manufacturing will increase to 13.2%. The new products have
been put into the Chinese market in 2012. There were four engineers that joined the
class from Shengyi, which is a company located in Dongguan, Guangdong Province. FR-4,
CEM-1, CEM-3 and Prepreg are currently the products in this company. Every engineer
found and solved at least one inventive problem of design or process and sent
applications for patents for inventions and utility models. The new products based on

company. Most of the engineers who joined the class did achieve good results. Some of
them have solved the problems that had not been solved in their company for a long
time. Their ability to find problems in the design or process phase of a product and
to solve them efficiently increased. Some of them have made presentations about basic
principles of TRIZ to their colleagues to form a circumstance for study and apply
TRIZ in their company. 5.3 Case 2: New structured headstock and tailstock of CRH
Tangshan Railway Vehicle Co. Ltd located in Tangshan, Hebei Province, produces high
speed train called China Railways Highspeed(CRH) or "Harmony Express". We organized a
class for this company from May 2012 to December 2012. At first 60 engineers in
different working posts were joined the class and 28 engineers followed the whole
training process. One engineer has gotten a few patents for the new structured
headstocks and tailstocks of CRH. In the process of finding and solving an inventive
problem for improving the CRH, TRIZ is applied. 5.3.1 Situation analysis At first,
the engineer should study the situation for improving as shown in Fig. 5. The
headstock and tailstock in a CRH are not changed for both running directions. The
headstock in one running direction is the tailstock in reverse direction. The
distribution of airflow on the surface of headstock and tailstock are different, the
air resistance on the train mainly is pressure drag which rests with the shapes of
headstock and tailstock. Because the shape is designed symmetrical so that the
headstock and tailstock can be interchanged, the drag reduction can not reach the
limit. Big drag will result in electrical energy lose. Drag<component x="304.64"

of mechanical engineers, this problem is a parameter optimization problem that the
shape of headstock In general speaking the principles and the cases selected are
specific TRIZ solutions for the problem. The designer should transform them into
domain solutions. In this process the knowledge of design for high speed trains,
especially the headstocks and tailstocks, and the specific TRIZ solutions are both
important. From the specific TRIZ solutions the engineer could find unexpected
discoveries [31] (UXDs) for triggering him or her to generate new ideas for domain
solutions. In this case, No. 4 and No. 15 are used to produce new concepts for
solving the problem. For example, the shape of the headstock and the tailstock should
not be same according to the principle No. 4 for reducing the drag, and the shapes
should be changed into each other when the headstock and the tailstock interchange
according to the principle No. 15. So in one direction the headstock has a specific
shape and the tailstock has different shape for reducing drag. When the train stops
for reverse direction, both the headstock and the tailstock interchanged rapidly.
5.3.4 One accepted solution Fig. 7 shows one accepted solution(the publication of the
case has been authorized by enterprise, Courtesy of 5.3.3 Solving the inventive
problem Fig. 6 shows the process to solve the problem. The engineer finds two
parameters in the matrix of TRIZ, which present the inventive problem well. Four
inventive principles are found, which are Transformation properties (No. 35),
Asymmetry(No. 4), Dynamics(No. 15) and Prior action(No. 10). Also several cases using
these principles are identified for the analogous application. Tangshan Railway
Vehicle Co., LTD, China). Using TRIZ the designer could produce many possible
solutions for the problem. After evaluation a few are selected as accepted solutions.
Computer simulation and testing should be carried out for selecting final solutions.

to left direction. When changing direction the tailstock should be shortened and the
headstock should be elongated. The changing processes are controlled easily. 5.4

innovation process of a company are always faced in fuzzy front ends, conceptual
designs and manufacturing processes. TRIZ is a systematic method to solve these kinds
of problems. The urgent need is to push the mechanical engineers of companies in
China to study and apply TRIZ to solve inventive problems that exist in their working
environment. (2) Training is a choice to push the application forward. An interactive
model for training TRIZ is developed, which is suitable not only for several
companies at same time in a region but also for one company. The activities in this
model have tight relationships with the activities in the innovation processes of the
companies. The engineers who join the training class have to find and solve the
inventive problems of their own companies. (3) The implementation of the model is
carried out as a program, in which there are twenty classes in different provinces of
China. The organizers are the Science and Technology Department of local governments.
Most of the engineers who have passed the final oral examinations have sent patent
applications to SIPO. Some engineers have developed new products for their companies.
The innovative ability for all the engineers to join the program is increased to a
degree. The organizers are satisfied with the results. The next step is to make more
training classes in the interactive model developed for different regions available,
to meet the increasing needs of manufacturing companies in China.<component x="50.97"
