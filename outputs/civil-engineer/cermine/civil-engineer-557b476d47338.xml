        <p>This paper describes and analyses a series of tests on one-way spanning slabs, which were carried out at Imperial College London to investigate the influence of peak construction loads on long-term tension stiffening and slab deflections. The work was carried out to investigate the validity of conclusions drawn from the first author's back analysis of deflection data in the Cardington in situ concrete building, which suggested that long-term deflections in slabs could be governed by short-term construction and in-service loads. An improved method is proposed for taking account of the effect of peak construction loads on long-term slab deflections. The method is shown to be more accurate than the rigorous method in Concrete Society Report TR58 which is based on the first authors' analysis of slab deflections at Cardington.</p>

Introduction</p>
      <p>Analysis of deflection data from the Cardington in
situ concrete building1 suggested that long-term slab
deflections can be governed by early-age striking or
peak construction loads from casting slabs above. At that
time, there were no suitable laboratory data available to
validate the analytical model derived from back analysis
of the Cardington1,2 data. The current test programme
was designed to rectify this omission. Vollum’s
method1–3 for accounting for construction loading in
deflection calculations is a refinement of the moment –
curvature approach given in Eurocode 2.4 The method
was subsequently adopted in Concrete Society Technical
Report TR58,5 where it is referred to as the ‘rigorous
method’. It is useful to review the approach adopted in
Eurocode 24 for predicting long-term deflections, and
the loss of tension stiffening with time, before
considering the influence of construction loading. Curvatures
increase with time in reinforced concrete flexural
members owing to the combined effects of creep, shrinkage
and loss of tension stiffening with time. In Eurocode 2,4
the mean curvature in cracked members is given by
1=rm ¼
1=r2 þ (1</p>
      <p>)1=r1</p>
      <p>(M r=M )2
1/r1 and 1/r2 are the curvatures of uncracked and full
sections respectively including shrinkage and Mr is the
cracking moment. The coefficient in equation (2)
takes account of loss of tension stiffening with time
owing to additional internal- and macro-cracking under
sustained load. Eurocode 24 states that should be
taken as 1 for short-term loading and 0.5 for long-term
loading, but does not define the variation in with
time.</p>
      <p>Recently, Beeby and Scott6 carried out a series of
relatively short-term tests (up to around 100 days) on
tension members which showed that the residual tensile
force resisted by cracked concrete reduces to its
longterm value within a few weeks of loading. The
specimens were first loaded around 28 days after casting.
They found that the long-term mean residual tensile
stress in the concrete between cracks was around half
the instantaneous value after first cracking. Beeby and
Scott6 concluded that tension stiffening was largely lost
owing to additional cracking and internal damage under
sustained load as the tensile strength of concrete
reduces to around 70% of its instantaneous value under
sustained loading. Beeby and Scott’s6 data suggest that
the time function describing the rate of loss of tension
stiffening in tension specimens is approximately
0:12 log10 (t) þ 0:65 with 0:5 &lt;
(t) &lt; 1:0
where (t ) is a function of time and t is the time in
days from first cracking.</p>
      <p>Beeby and Scott6 carried out some exploratory slab
tests which suggested that tension stiffening is lost
rapidly in slabs but at a slower rate than in tension
specimens. As a result of these tests Beeby and Scott6
suggested that should be taken as 0.5 in most cases
in equation (2). Vollum7 also analysed deflection data
from various slabs tested by others in the laboratory
under constant loading and concluded that typically
reduced from 1 to around 0.7, in cracked members,
between 1 and 2 days after first loading. Some aspects
of Vollum’s7 analysis were speculative as creep and
shrinkage strains were typically measured in control
specimens which had a significantly smaller notional
size than the slabs. It was therefore difficult accurately
to assess the contributions of creep and shrinkage to
deflection in the first few days after loading.</p>
      <p>Influence of construction loads on
longterm slab deflections</p>
      <p>Relatively short-term peaks in slab loads can arise
during the construction of multi-storey buildings from
casting slabs above or in service as illustrated in Fig. 1,
which was derived from back prop forces measured at
St George Wharf.8 It is assumed in Fig. 1 that the slab
carries its self-weight after striking. The main problems
in predicting deflections under loading histories similar
to that shown in Fig. 1 are to determine (a) the
influence of short-term peak loads on the long-term residual
tension stiffening under sustained load and (b) the
deflection after repeated unloading and reloading.</p>
      <p>The Cardington deflection data1–3 are particularly
useful for assessing the influence of construction
loading on slab deflections as the loading on the first six
floors was measured during construction and the
permanent loading was the same at all floors. Variations in
construction loading, concrete strengths and
reinforcement between floors led to significant variations in
deflection between floors. Analysis of the Cardington
data1,2,7 showed that the measured deflections under the
permanent load, at a specific location, varied almost
linearly with the minimum value of a coefficient k,
which was defined as
k ¼ p f ct=w
where fct and w were evaluated at either striking, under
the peak construction load or under the permanent load.
The minimum value of k corresponds to the loading
stage which induces the worst cracking. It was assumed
that the interpolation coefficient corresponding to
kmin governs long-term deflections as cracking is
irreversible. The long-term deflections were shown to be
governed by striking or peak construction loads
provided that was taken as less than 0.86 in kstrike and
kpeak. Hossain and Vollum2 obtained good estimates of
long-term deflections at Cardington using (a) an
incremental analytical procedure with ¼ 0.7 and (b) a
single step analysis with ¼ 0.5. Hossain and Vollum2
adopted Rotilio’s9 procedure for calculating curvatures
after unloading in their incremental procedure for
calculating deflection. Rotilio9 assumed that the
shortterm unloading response follows a line that intersects
the response of the uncracked section at a moment
equal and opposite to that immediately before
unloading. A drawback with Rotilio’s9 approach is that it
needs to be implemented in an incremental procedure
Fig. 1. Load history from casting slabs above for two levels
of backprops
such as that devised by Hossain and Vollum.2 In
practice, it is more convenient to calculate deflections
corresponding to load histories such as that in Fig. 1 in a
single step procedure in conjunction with a suitably
modified concrete tensile strength and creep
coefficient. The slab tests described in the current paper were
designed to enable the development of improved
methods for deflection prediction under load histories such
as those presented Fig. 1.</p>
      <p>Slab tests</p>
      <p>A series of six simply supported one-way spanning
slabs were tested in the Concrete Structures Laboratory
at Imperial College to determine the influence of
shortterm construction loads on long-term slab deflections.
The slabs measured 500 mm wide by 3600 mm long by
150 mm thick and were reinforced with 3T10 bars as
shown in Fig. 2. The span of 3300 mm was chosen to
satisfy the span-to-effective depth ratios in Eurocode
2,4 which are intended to limit the total deflection to
span/250 under a quasi-permanent load equal to half
the design ultimate load. Equation (7.16a) in Eurocode
24 gives a maximum permissible span of 3537 mm for
the authors’ slabs with fck ¼ 30 MPa.</p>
      <p>The slabs were loaded at their third points with straps
attached to one or two concrete blocks with additional
steel kentledge as required, which gave an almost
constant moment within the central third of the slab. The
ratio of the maximum to minimum moments in the
central third of the beam varied between 1.03 and 1.04
in the tests. Slabs S1–S3 were first loaded 9 days after
casting. Constant loads were applied to slabs S1 and S2
throughout the test. Slab S3 was loaded for 5 days with a
peak load equal to 1.4 times the permanent load, which
was the same as for slab S2. Slabs S4–S6 were first
loaded with their self-weight at 7 days and the
quasipermanent load was applied at 34 days. In between, a
peak construction load was applied to slabs S4 and S5 at
13 days and sustained for a period of 4 days. The peak
load applied to S4 equalled the permanent load which

the load histories are given in Table 1, which should be
read in conjunction with Fig. 2.</p>
      <p>Long-term deflections are governed by factors
including
(a) the reinforcement stress under the quasi-permanent
(sustained) loading,
(b) the ratio between the peak construction moment
and the quasi-permanent moment (Mpeak/Mperm) and
(c) the ratio between the peak moment and the
cracking moment (Mpeak/Mr).</p>
      <p>These data are summarised in Table 2, which also
gives the maximum deflections measured in the tests.
Table 2 also shows that the ratio between Mperm and the

between 0.56 and 0.65, which is typical for slabs in
buildings.</p>

      <title>Instrumentation</title>
      <p>Deflections were measured at the centre of the slab
and adjacent to the loading points. Strains were
measured with a 150 mm Demec gauge along one edge of
each slab (a) near the level of the reinforcement, (b) at
mid-height and (c) just below the top surface of the
slab. In situ strains were also measured with a Demec
gauge in the top surface of each slab, parallel and
perpendicular to the direction of span. Strains were also
measured in the top and bottom surfaces of the slabs
with electrical resistance strain gauges.</p>
      <p>Concrete material properties</p>
      <p>The slabs were cast in two batches of three,
approximately 5 months apart, from ready-mix concrete with a
target 28 day cylinder strength of 30 MPa. The flexural
and splitting strengths of the concrete were determined
from control specimens cured in air and water. The
depth of the beams used in the flexural tests was
chosen to be 150 mm to eliminate the influence on
flexural strength of differences in section depth
between the control specimens and slabs. The resulting
tensile strengths are given in Table 3 which also gives
tensile strengths derived from the concrete compressive
strength using the equations given in Eurocode 2.4</p>
      <p>Creep and shrinkage strains were measured in 4 3 10
inches (10.16 3 25.40 cm) control cylinders and
derived from strain measurements in the slabs. The in

shrinkage strains predicted by Eurocode 24 from first
loading. Fig. 3 shows that the shrinkage strains
measured in tests S1–S3 were similar to those predicted by
Eurocode 2. Fig. 4 shows that the shrinkage strains
measured in slabs S4–S6 increased more rapidly than
predicted by Eurocode 2 and that no significant
increase in shrinkage occurred after 200 days.

measurements in the control cylinders and from changes in
curvature derived from strain measurements in the

The in situ creep coefficients were derived in a section
analysis which compensated for the influences of
shrinkage and internal restraint from the reinforcement.
The creep coefficients in Figs 5 and 6 were calculated
in terms of instantaneous strains corresponding to the
in situ elastic modulus of the slabs at first loading.

also give the creep coefficients predicted by Eurocode
24 which were scaled by Ec(t0)/Ec28 where Ec28 is the
elastic modulus at 28 days. It is interesting to note that
the creep coefficients measured in situ were slightly
greater than those measured in the control cylinders
which was unexpected. The rate of increase of the in
situ creep coefficients in slabs S1–S3 was also
significantly greater after 30 days than predicted by Eurocode</p>
      <sec id="2-1">
        <title>2.4 The current authors attribute the difference in creep</title>
        <p>behaviour between the control cylinders and slabs to
the slabs being in flexure unlike the control cylinders
which were in compression. The creep coefficient
is greater in flexure in compression because it is
increased by creep in tension, which is greater than in
compression. Neville10 also points out that the decrease
in the rate of creep with time is much less pronounced
in tension than compression because the increase in
tensile strength with time is less.</p>
        <p>Determination of in situ cracking moment</p>
        <p>It was anticipated that the effective flexural strength
of the concrete in the slabs would lie between the
splitting and flexural strengths as the flexural strength
of reinforced concrete is reduced by shrinkage owing to
the internal restraint provided by reinforcement. Three
approaches were used to estimate the in situ flexural
strength of the concrete in the slabs. In method M1, the
in situ strength was estimated by reducing the flexural
strength of the control beams by the tensile stress
induced in the slabs by restrained shrinkage which was
estimated as follows
f ctsh( t) ¼ Es sh( ts)S1( h</p>
        <p>x1)=I 1
þ As Es sh(ts)=(Ac(1 þ mr))
where r ¼ As/Ac, m is the effective modular ratio Es/
Eceff and ts is the time at onset of shrinkage.</p>
        <p>In method M2, the flexural strength was estimated
from the moment at which the moment-curvature
response of the slabs became non-linear. In method M3,
the flexural strength was chosen to give a good fit
between the instantaneous measured deflections and
those predicted by Eurocode 2 with ¼ 1. Method
M3 is illustrated in Figs 7 and 8, which show that
curvatures are underestimated around the cracking
moment if the flexural strength is chosen to give the
best overall estimate of the measured instantaneous
curvatures. In reality, tension stiffening is lost
progressively as cracks form successively as the moment
increases. It is unclear from the present tests to what
extent Eurocode 24 takes this into account as strain
data are unavailable to relate the loss of tension
stiffening in the tests to the development of cracks during
loading. It appears that the Eurocode 24 moment –

the mid-span curvatures in Figs 9 and 10. It is apparent
that the peak construction load increased deflections
significantly in slabs S3 (compared to S2) and S5
(compared to S6) at 100 days, and that the difference in
deflections between slabs S5 and S6 reduced with time.</p>
        <p>The rate of loss of tension stiffening with time is
significant in the calculation of long-term deflections
under load histories similar to Fig. 1 as long-term
deflections can be governed by the residual tension
stiffening remaining immediately before unloading from
the peak load. Slab tests S1, S2 and S6 provide data on
the rate of loss of tension stiffening in slabs under a
uniform sustained load. Tests S3–S5 provide data on the
residual tension stiffening remaining after unloading
from a short-term peak load. The mean moment resisted
by the concrete in tension between cracks was estimated
in the test slabs with the following equation
xm=3)
where M is the applied moment, Tsm ¼ AsEs sm, sm is
the mean strain in the concrete at the level of the
reinforcement and xm is the mean value of the depth to the
neutral axis both of which were determined from the
Demec strain readings.

curvature relationship may underestimate the
shortterm tension stiffening effect provided by cracked
concrete below the neutral axis if the moment at first
cracking is used in equation (2). This conclusion is
consistent with the common practice of using the
mean concrete rather than minimum tensile strength to
determine a best estimate of likely deflections.</p>
        <p>The concrete flexural strengths corresponding to
methods M1–M3 are listed in Table 3, which includes
the measured flexural and splitting strengths for
comparison. The tensile strengths obtained with M3 were
adopted in the analysis of the slab data described in this
article as they give the best estimates of deflection in
conjunction with Eurocode 2.4 The concrete tensile
strength given by M3 was the same for slabs S4 and
S6. This was unexpected as slab S1 was loaded to
cracking at 13 days whereas slab S6 was loaded to
cracking at 34 days when the tensile strength of the
control specimens was greater as shown in Table 3.</p>

Fig. 11. (a) Variation in with log(time) in slabs S1–S6;
(b) Variation in with time in slabs S1–S6</p>
      <p>The development of deflection with time depends
significantly on the rate of loss in the tension stiffening
moment with time which is governed by in equation
(2). According to the Eurocode 24 moment –curvature
model, the mean residual moment resisted by the
concrete between cracks is given by
(Mr=M )2 Mconc 1 (8)
where Mconc1 is the moment resisted by concrete in
tension in an uncracked section, which is close to the
total bending moment M in lightly reinforced sections
such as slabs. The coefficient in equation (2) can be
estimated by assuming Mconc1 ¼ M and rearranging
equation (8) as follows
t ¼ (Mconc mean=Mr)(M (t)=Mr)
where M(t ) is the bending moment at time t. The
variation in with log(time) was estimated with
equation (9) with Mconcmean from equation (7) assuming
Mconc1 ¼ M. The resulting values of are plotted
against log10(time) in Fig. 11(a) and against time in
Fig. 11(b). It can be seen that reduced at a similar
rate with time in all the slabs. The discontinuity in the
values of in slabs S3 and S5 arises as was
calculated under the current rather than peak moment. In all
cases, reduced linearly in log10(time) for around 12
days from first loading or the duration of the peak load
if less. Thereafter, reduced much more slowly as
shown in Fig. 11(b) for the duration of the
measurements presented which is up to one year. It appears that
reduced more rapidly after the shrinkage strain
plateaued at around 200 days.</p>
      <p>A number of different mechanisms are responsible
for the long-term loss of tension stiffening in slabs. It
seems likely that the rapid loss of tension stiffening
after first cracking is attributable to internal cracking
of the concrete under sustained load as proposed by
Beeby and Scott.6 The subsequent gradual loss of
tension stiffening appears to be caused by relaxation of
the concrete in tension between the cracks owing to
creep. The effect of creep is counter-balanced in part
by shrinkage, which induces tensile stresses in the
concrete between the cracks owing to the restraining effect
of the reinforcement. These suppositions are supported
by the observation that increased more rapidly after
the shrinkage plateaued at 200 days. Fig. 11(a) also
shows that reduced at a significantly slower rate in
the slabs than in the tension specimens of Beeby and
Scott.6</p>
      <p>The authors’ tests were designed primarily to
investigate the short-term loss of tension stiffening under peak
construction loads and no change is suggested to the
long-term value of of 0.5 in Eurocode 2.4 Regression
analysis showed that reduced as follows in slab S6

Influence of short term peak loads on
tension stiffening</p>
      <p>Vollum et al.1,2 showed that deflections at
Cardington varied linearly with the coefficient kmin defined
in equation (4). They went on to propose that the
influence of peak construction loads could be accounted for
in deflection calculations by using a modified concrete
tensile strength given by
where kmin ¼ minimum value of k ¼ ˇ fct/w evaluated
during construction and subsequently.</p>
      <p>Vollum et al.1–3 attributed the linear relationship
between k and deflection to the fact that Eurocode 24
predicts long-term deflections in cracked slabs with
given dimensions, reinforcement and loading to vary
almost linearly with fct. The current research shows this
explanation is overly simplistic and presents a more
thorough explanation, which accounts for the effects of
unloading. The starting point is to rearrange equation
(2) as below
1=rm ¼ 1=r2
(Mr=M )2ð1=r2
1=r1)
It follows that the mean curvatures in a set of
geometrically identical slabs vary linearly at any given time
with (Mr/M)2 or k2 for a given M (i.e. 1/r1 and 1/r2).
Analysis shows that k typically varies almost linearly
with k2 for cracked slabs which explains the observed
linear relationship between k and deflections predicted
with Eurocode 24 under constant load and varying
concrete tensile strength. The data from slabs S1–S6 were
analysed to determine if, at any given time, there was a
linear relationship between (Mperm S1/Mperm)1/rm and (a)
(Mr/M)2 and (b) Mr/M as anticipated from the first
author’s analysis of the Cardington deflection data. The
curvatures 1/rm were normalised by the ratio Mperm S1/
Mperm (where Mperm is the mid-span moment in the slab
under consideration under the permanent load and S1
denotes slab S1) as the permanent load varied between
the tests as shown in Table 2. The normalisation is
justified as the curvatures 1/r1 and 1/r2 are almost
proportional to the applied moment as the curvature
induced by shrinkage is relatively small. The results of
a typical analysis are shown in Figs 13 and 14, which
show that there was a linear relationship between
(Mperm S1/Mperm)1/rm and both (Mr/Mpeak)2 and Mr/Mpeak
in slabs S1 to S6 at 93 days when the permanent load
was removed from slabs S1–S3.</p>
      <p>The reason for the linear relationship between
(Mperm S1/Mperm)1/rm and (Mr/M)2 in slabs that have
been unloaded requires further explanation as the
unloading line does not pass through the origin. In this
case, the mean curvature can be expressed as
1=rm ¼
1=r2 þ (1
)1=r1
where * depends on the previous load history. Fig. 7
shows that the deflection reduced almost linearly in

consideration of Fig. 12 shows that the mean tension
stiffening moment after unloading is given by
)Mperm ¼ Mpeak(1
peak=(1 þ C))
where ˜M ¼ Mpeak Mperm and CMpeak/Mr is the
horizontal ordinate at which the unloading line
intersects line A in Fig. 12.</p>
      <p>Rotilio8 method8 can be shown to be equivalent to
assuming C ¼ 1 in equation (14). The coefficient C in
equation (14) was evaluated for slabs S3 to S5 by
equating the measured mean tension stiffening moment
after unloading to that given by equation (14) using the
graphical procedure illustrated in Fig. 12. The
corresponding values of C were 1.0 for S3, 1.3 for S4 and
0.9 for S5 with a mean of 1.1. The mean measured and
predicted tension stiffening moments Mconc mean given
by equations (8) and (14) respectively are compared for
slabs S3, S5 and S6 in Figs 15(a) to (c), which show a
remarkable agreement between the measured and
predicted values. Rearranging equation (14) gives

Analysis shows that the curvatures given by equation
(13) are relatively insensitive to the value used for C in
the calculation of * in equation (15) and it is
suggested that C is taken as1 throughout as implicitly
assumed in the Rotilio8 method.</p>
      <p>Equation (13) implies that the normalised curvatures
((Mperm S1/Mperm)1/rm) and corresponding mid-span
deflections should vary linearly with 1 * at any given
time. This has been investigated for slabs S1 to S6 and
the results are given in Fig. 16, which shows a
remarkably linear relationship between 1 * and curvature
in slabs S1 to S6 at 93 days as predicted. Analysis
shows that the linear relationship is virtually
independent of the value of C used to define the slope of the
unloading line in equation (15).

      <title>in Concrete Society Technical Report TR58</title>
      <p>Concrete Society Technical Report TR585 uses a
single step method, based on the recommendations of
Vollum et al.,1–3 to predict curvatures owing to load
histories as presented in Fig. 2. The mean curvature is
calculated with equation (1) in conjunction with
equation (2) and modified values for the concrete tensile
strength and effective elastic modulus. TR585 uses the
following equation, based on the theory of
superposition, to calculate a modified effective elastic modulus
for concrete
where Wi is the load increment at time ti and
Eceff ¼ Ect/(1 + (ti, t )) where ti is the age at
application of Wi and t is the age at which deflections are
required.</p>
      <p>TR585 uses equation (11) to modify the concrete
tensile strength to account for cracking during
construction and under peak loads. It is recommended in
TR585 that is taken as 0.5 in equation (2) as tension
stiffening is lost rapidly after first loading. The method
in TR585 neglects the residual increase in curvature
˜*1/rm that remains after unloading from peak loads
(see Fig. 8). This omission was justified in the
development of the method by observing that the effect of
neglecting ˜*1/rm in the calculation of the long-term
curvature under wperm is largely compensated by
overestimating the loss in tension stiffening under the peak
construction load.</p>
      <p>Proposed method for deflection prediction</p>
      <p>It is proposed that the rigorous method for deflection
prediction in TR585 should be modified by calculating
the interpolation coefficient in equation (1)
corresponding to the peak construction load with equation (15)
with C ¼ 1. In practice, peak can be calculated under
the applied loading using fctmod (see equation (11)) and
Mpeak/Mperm can be approximated as wpeak/wperm for
uniformly loaded slabs. The coefficient used in the
calculation of peak can be estimated with equation (10)
if the duration of the peak construction load is known
or, more conservatively, can be taken as 0.7 for peak
construction loads of up to five weeks duration. It is
suggested that the interpolation coefficient should be
taken as the greatest of either frequent (where frequent is
calculated under the frequent load with ¼ 0.5) or *
in the calculation of long-term deflections.</p>
      <p>Validation of proposed method</p>
      <p>The accuracy of the proposed method for deflection
prediction has been evaluated by comparing measured
and predicted deflections in slabs S1–S6. Curvatures
were calculated with methods outlined below.
(a) TR58 A: TR585 with concrete material properties
derived with Eurocode 2 from the concrete
compressive strength with the concrete tensile strength
taken as the flexural strength.
(b) TR58 B: TR585 with concrete material properties
derived with Eurocode 2 from the concrete
compressive strength with the concrete tensile strength
taken as the splitting strength.
(c) TR58 C: TR585 with the measured concrete
material properties.
(d ) Proposed: Proposed method with the measured
concrete material properties and the experimental
values of .</p>
      <p>The creep and shrinkage values used in TR58 C and
the proposed method were derived from the equations
of the lines of best fit to the mean in situ data shown in
Figs 3–6. Measured creep coefficients were used to
determine the curvatures under the peak construction
loads in slabs S3, S4 and S5 but the increase in creep
owing to the application of the peak construction load
was neglected in the calculation of curvatures after the
removal of the peak construction load. In reality, the in
situ creep coefficients were greater in slabs S4 and S5
than S6 as the additional creep under the peak
construction load was not fully recovered on unloading as
shown in Fig. 17. Despite this the measured long-term
curvatures within the constant moment region of slabs
S4 and S6 are very similar as shown in Fig. 10, even
though the curvature was greater in the uncracked
sections, adjacent to the supports, of slab S4 than S6. The
reason for this is probably related to the fact that the
effective creep coefficient is greater in the uncracked
regions of the slab than in the cracked regions where
tension is relieved in the concrete by cracking. In
practice, compressive creep coefficients are usually used in
deflection calculations. The present work suggests that
Fig. 17. Comparison between curvatures in uncracked section
of slabs S4 and S6
this can lead to an underestimate of deflection in lightly
loaded slabs with significant tension stiffening.</p>
      <p>The measured and predicted mean mid-span
curvatures are compared in Figs 18(a)–(f), which show that
the proposed method gives significantly more realistic
estimates of curvature in slabs S3 to S5 under the peak
construction load and subsequently than the rigorous
method in TR58.5 Furthermore, it can be seen that the
curvature predictions are significantly improved when
measured material properties are used, with curvatures
being particularly sensitive to the concrete tensile
strength, which was unexpectedly low in tests S4–S6
for unknown reasons. It can be seen that deflections
were overestimated in slabs S1 and S2 if the concrete
tensile strengths were calculated in terms of the
compressive strength using Eurocode 2. Conversely,
deflections were significantly underestimated in slab S6 if the
concrete tensile strength was taken as the flexural
strength given by Eurcode 2 at 34 days when the
permanent load was applied and cracking occurred.
Conclusions</p>
      <p>It has been demonstrated that tension stiffening is
lost rapidly after cracking in flexural members but less
rapidly than measured by Beeby and Scott6 in tension
members. It is shown that long-term deflections can be
governed by short-term peaks in construction loading
as suggested by analysis of deflection data from
Cardington.1,2 A modification is proposed to the Eurocode
24 moment –curvature model to calculate the residual
tension stiffening moment remaining in members after
unloading from short-term peak loads. Expressions are
developed to calculate the variation in time of the
coefficient in the Eurocode 24 moment –curvature
relationship. A refinement is proposed to the rigorous
method for deflection prediction in Concrete Society
Technical report 58,5 which is shown to give improved
estimates of deflection after the removal of the peak
construction load. The analysis of the test data shows
that deflections can vary significantly from values
predicted with material properties derived in terms of the
concrete compressive strength. It is shown that
deflections in slabs can be particularly sensitive to the
concrete tensile strength, which is uncertain at the design
stage. It is noteworthy that the final deflections in all
the slabs were greater than span/250 (13.2 mm) even
though the slabs complied with the span-to-effective
depth ratios in Eurocode 2.4</p>
