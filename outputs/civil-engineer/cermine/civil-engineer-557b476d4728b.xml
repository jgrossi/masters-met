      <abstract>
        <p>In mid-1910, C. Terrell Bartlett, Resident Engineer, Medina Valley Irrigation Co., and two others made a report to build Medina Dam, located northwest of San Antonio. By May 1911, Dr. Fredrich Pearson, Pearson Engineering Corporation - N.Y.C. (with Mexico and other dam experience), secured Medina Dam financing by selling $6 M in British bonds. In Oct. 1911, a large wooden crushing/mixing plant was erected on the site bluff. Innovations included a triple system of hoppers for concrete materials, double- track incline delivery chutes, and two cableways between the towers positioned on the bluffs. From Nov. 9, 1911 - Dec. 31, 1912, the Medina Lake Dam was built in record time. When completed on Dec. 31, 1912, Medina Dam was the largest dam in Texas, fourth largest dam in the U.S., and the largest western irrigation system (26 mi. (41.8 km) of irrigation canals for 33,000 acres (13,354.6 hectares)). On Aug. 24, 2012, the Medina Lake Preservation Society hosted Medina Dam centennial activities (1912 - 2012). In July 1913, Terrell Bartlett, a speaker at the Texas Good Roads Congress, Corpus Christi and six other civil engineers met there to plan/found the Texas Association of Members, ASCE. Bartlett served in many ASCE Texas offices including 1928 President. Terrell Bartlett started an early engineering practice, designing more than 50 bridges, including the second 1938 Galveston causeway, and Bartlett served as engineer for the Hondo Army Airfield/Base plus various city projects. Bartlett wrote many nationally - published technical papers that are still considered classics. Bartlett supported engineering registration and was Texas P.E. Registration No. 9. C.T. Bartlett was named San Antonio Engineer of the Year in 1953 and cited as “Dean of Texas Consulting Engineers.”</p>
