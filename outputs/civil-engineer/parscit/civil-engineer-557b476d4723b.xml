ABSTRACT: In snowy cold regions, embankments constructed in winter may cause
settlement and collapse of slopes in the thawing season in early spring. One of the
reasons may be unavoidable suspension of the work due to work schedules while
constructing an embankment during a cold winter. Accordingly, assuming such
construction, a test construction was conducted in the winter season. For the constructed
embankment, its inside temperatures and strength were measured. Also, after the
embankment melted it was cut open and the density and water content were measured. As
a result, it was found that 1) even in a 30cm high embankment, frost and moisture
movement occur, 2) a frozen embankment is strong but a non-frozen one is not strong, 3)
depending on the embankment construction method, layered frost remains and the
number of layers increases with the increase of construction days, and 4) when the
embankment freezes the density and water content decrease.
KEY WORDS: Embankment, construct, winter, density, strength.

INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.977324875">
There is a case where deformation such as settlement or slope collapse occurs when a
frozen or frost-heaved embankment melts. One of the reasons may be unavoidable
suspension of the work due to work schedules while constructing an embankment in a
cold winter. For example, because construction is done in the daytime and not at night,
the surface of the embankment being constructed is exposed to cold air. Accordingly,
assuming such a condition, we decided to construct a test embankment in winter and
check its properties. Also, after the frozen embankment melted, the embankment was cut
open to check its condition. This report summarizes this process.

At the Tomakomai construction test field of the Civil Engineering Institute for the Cold
Region, an embankment of 4m in top width, 1.8m in height, 1:1.5 in slope inclination,
and 5 to 7m in length was constructed. Table 1 lists the basic physical properties of the
embankment materials. They are classified as non-freezing materials in particle size

distribution. Since the natural moisture content is slightly higher than the optimum
moisture content but the cone index is high, these materials are easy to compact.
Six types of embankments were constructed (1 to 6). Table 2 shows the construction
conditions. 1 and 2 were constructed in mid December when the number of construction
projects is largest in winter earthwork, and 3, 4, 5, and 6 were constructed in mid January,
the coldest season in Hokkaido. For 1 and 3, six layers up to the embankment completion
cut plane were constructed in a day. For 2 and 5, one layer was constructed per day to
complete the embankment in six days. For 4 and 6, two layers were constructed per day
to complete the embankment in three days. Consequently, only the embankment top was
exposed to cold air for 1 and 3, the top and the embankment being constructed were
exposed five times for 2 and 5, and the top and the embankment being constructed were
exposed twice for 4. For 2, 4, and 5, even when the embankments were frozen in the
morning before construction, the embankment of the next layer was constructed. For 6,
the next layer was constructed after the frozen portion was removed before construction
of the embankment. Thickness of a single layer was 30cm.

Fig. 2 shows the N value of the embankment. N values at locations 80 cm or more in
depth are about 5 to 10 which is small. However, N values of the frozen embankment
surface measured on February 4 and February 29 are large. Particularly, for 1 and 2
constructed in December, N values obtained in the study on February 3 are very large.
The daily average air temperature on February 3 was –13°C and that on February 29 was
–1°C so the N value measure on the colder February 3 was larger. For the embankments
3, 4, 5, and 6 constructed in January, N values of 3 and 4 were almost the same and N
values of 5 and 6 were smaller. On April 25, there were slightly frozen portions in the
embankments but N values in the entire embankment were smaller.

Therefore, for 6, the frozen portion was peeled off and the moisture content of the
underneath unfrozen portion was measured. This is shown by “+” in Fig. 1. In the
unfrozen portion under the frozen portion, the moisture content was 3 to 5% lower than
that before freezing, meaning that water in the soil was moved upward by freezing.

5, and 6 were constructed at average temperatures –5 to –10°C, the frozen portion of the
already constructed embankment may not have been melted. Consequently, frozen

Fig. 4 shows the density of the embankment during construction and when thawed. Out
of 30 measurement points, 20 points were frozen and 10 points were not frozen. For 7 of
the 10 unfrozen points, the density during construction and that when thawed were almost
the same. For the 20 frozen points, the density when thawed was lower than during
construction at 15 points. This means that density tends to decrease when the
embankment melts and tends not to decrease when it does not melt. The compaction
degree of the embankment was 90% or more during construction but became 85% or
more when thawed. The embankment decreases in density when freezing and melting are
repeated. Therefore, even if the standard value is satisfied during construction it may not
be satisfied when the frozen embankment melts.

CONCLUSION
The analysis made so far has revealed the following:
1) Even in a 30cm high embankment, frost heave occurs and water moves in the
embankment.
2) Frozen embankments are strong but unfrozen portions are not strong.
3) Depending on the embankment construction method, layered frost remains in the

embankment and the number of layers increases with the increase in construction
days.
4) If the embankment is frozen and thawed by constructing it in winter, the density and
moisture content decrease.
