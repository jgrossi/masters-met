This paper describes and analyses a series of tests on one-way spanning slabs, which were carried out at Imperial
College London to investigate the influence of peak construction loads on long-term tension stiffening and slab
deflections. The work was carried out to investigate the validity of conclusions drawn from the first author’s back
analysis of deflection data in the Cardington in situ concrete building, which suggested that long-term deflections
in slabs could be governed by short-term construction and in-service loads. An improved method is proposed for
taking account of the effect of peak construction loads on long-term slab deflections. The method is shown to be
more accurate than the rigorous method in Concrete Society Report TR58 which is based on the first authors’
analysis of slab deflections at Cardington.

Introduction
Analysis of deflection data from the Cardington in
situ concrete building1 suggested that long-term slab
deflections can be governed by early-age striking or
peak construction loads from casting slabs above. At that
time, there were no suitable laboratory data available to
validate the analytical model derived from back analysis
of the Cardington1,2 data. The current test programme
was designed to rectify this omission. Vollum’s method1–3 for accounting for construction loading in deflection calculations is a refinement of the moment–
curvature approach given in Eurocode 2.4 The method
was subsequently adopted in Concrete Society Technical
Report TR58,5 where it is referred to as the ‘rigorous
method’. It is useful to review the approach adopted in
Eurocode 24 for predicting long-term deflections, and
the loss of tension stiffening with time, before considering the influence of construction loading. Curvatures
increase with time in reinforced concrete flexural members owing to the combined effects of creep, shrinkage
and loss of tension stiffening with time. In Eurocode 2,4
the mean curvature in cracked members is given by

where
1/r1 and 1/r2 are the curvatures of uncracked and full
sections respectively including shrinkage and Mr is the
cracking moment. The coefficient â in equation (2)
takes account of loss of tension stiffening with time
owing to additional internal- and macro-cracking under
sustained load. Eurocode 24 states that â should be
taken as 1 for short-term loading and 0.5 for long-term
loading, but does not define the variation in â with
time.
Recently, Beeby and Scott6 carried out a series of
relatively short-term tests (up to around 100 days) on
tension members which showed that the residual tensile
force resisted by cracked concrete reduces to its longterm value within a few weeks of loading. The specimens were first loaded around 28 days after casting.
They found that the long-term mean residual tensile
stress in the concrete between cracks was around half
the instantaneous value after first cracking. Beeby and
Scott6 concluded that tension stiffening was largely lost
owing to additional cracking and internal damage under
sustained load as the tensile strength of concrete reduces to around 70% of its instantaneous value under
sustained loading. Beeby and Scott’s6 data suggest that
the time function describing the rate of loss of tension
stiffening in tension specimens is approximately

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998366619047619">
where â(t ) is a function of time and t is the time in
days from first cracking.
Beeby and Scott6 carried out some exploratory slab
tests which suggested that tension stiffening is lost
rapidly in slabs but at a slower rate than in tension
specimens. As a result of these tests Beeby and Scott6
suggested that â should be taken as 0.5 in most cases
in equation (2). Vollum7 also analysed deflection data
from various slabs tested by others in the laboratory
under constant loading and concluded that â typically
reduced from 1 to around 0.7, in cracked members,
between 1 and 2 days after first loading. Some aspects
of Vollum’s7 analysis were speculative as creep and
shrinkage strains were typically measured in control
specimens which had a significantly smaller notional
size than the slabs. It was therefore difficult accurately
to assess the contributions of creep and shrinkage to
deflection in the first few days after loading.
Influence of construction loads on longterm slab deflections
Relatively short-term peaks in slab loads can arise
during the construction of multi-storey buildings from

casting slabs above or in service as illustrated in Fig. 1,
which was derived from back prop forces measured at
St George Wharf.8 It is assumed in Fig. 1 that the slab
carries its self-weight after striking. The main problems
in predicting deflections under loading histories similar
to that shown in Fig. 1 are to determine (a) the influence of short-term peak loads on the long-term residual
tension stiffening under sustained load and (b) the
deflection after repeated unloading and reloading.
The Cardington deflection data1–3 are particularly
useful for assessing the influence of construction loading on slab deflections as the loading on the first six
floors was measured during construction and the permanent loading was the same at all floors. Variations in
construction loading, concrete strengths and reinforcement between floors led to significant variations in
deflection between floors. Analysis of the Cardington
data1,2,7 showed that the measured deflections under the
permanent load, at a specific location, varied almost
linearly with the minimum value of a coefficient k,
which was defined as

p
k ¼ â f ct =w
(4)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999560533333333">
where fct and w were evaluated at either striking, under
the peak construction load or under the permanent load.
The minimum value of k corresponds to the loading
stage which induces the worst cracking. It was assumed
that the interpolation coefficient æ corresponding to
kmin governs long-term deflections as cracking is irreversible. The long-term deflections were shown to be
governed by striking or peak construction loads provided that â was taken as less than 0.86 in kstrike and
kpeak . Hossain and Vollum2 obtained good estimates of
long-term deflections at Cardington using (a) an incremental analytical procedure with â ¼ 0.7 and (b) a
single step analysis with â ¼ 0.5. Hossain and Vollum2
adopted Rotilio’s9 procedure for calculating curvatures
after unloading in their incremental procedure for calculating deflection. Rotilio9 assumed that the shortterm unloading response follows a line that intersects
the response of the uncracked section at a moment
equal and opposite to that immediately before unloading. A drawback with Rotilio’s9 approach is that it
needs to be implemented in an incremental procedure

Influence of construction loading on deflections in reinforced concrete slabs
such as that devised by Hossain and Vollum.2 In practice, it is more convenient to calculate deflections corresponding to load histories such as that in Fig. 1 in a
single step procedure in conjunction with a suitably
modified concrete tensile strength and creep coefficient. The slab tests described in the current paper were
designed to enable the development of improved methods for deflection prediction under load histories such
as those presented Fig. 1.

A series of six simply supported one-way spanning
slabs were tested in the Concrete Structures Laboratory
at Imperial College to determine the influence of shortterm construction loads on long-term slab deflections.
The slabs measured 500 mm wide by 3600 mm long by
150 mm thick and were reinforced with 3T10 bars as
shown in Fig. 2. The span of 3300 mm was chosen to
satisfy the span-to-effective depth ratios in Eurocode
2,4 which are intended to limit the total deflection to
span/250 under a quasi-permanent load equal to half
the design ultimate load. Equation (7.16a) in Eurocode
24 gives a maximum permissible span of 3537 mm for
the authors’ slabs with fck ¼ 30 MPa.
The slabs were loaded at their third points with straps
attached to one or two concrete blocks with additional
steel kentledge as required, which gave an almost constant moment within the central third of the slab. The
ratio of the maximum to minimum moments in the
central third of the beam varied between 1.03 and 1.04
in the tests. Slabs S1–S3 were first loaded 9 days after
casting. Constant loads were applied to slabs S1 and S2
throughout the test. Slab S3 was loaded for 5 days with a
peak load equal to 1.4 times the permanent load, which
was the same as for slab S2. Slabs S4–S6 were first
loaded with their self-weight at 7 days and the quasipermanent load was applied at 34 days. In between, a
peak construction load was applied to slabs S4 and S5 at
13 days and sustained for a period of 4 days. The peak
load applied to S4 equalled the permanent load which

buildings.
Instrumentation
Deflections were measured at the centre of the slab
and adjacent to the loading points. Strains were measured with a 150 mm Demec gauge along one edge of
each slab (a) near the level of the reinforcement, (b) at
mid-height and (c) just below the top surface of the
slab. In situ strains were also measured with a Demec
gauge in the top surface of each slab, parallel and
perpendicular to the direction of span. Strains were also
measured in the top and bottom surfaces of the slabs
with electrical resistance strain gauges.

The slabs were cast in two batches of three, approximately 5 months apart, from ready-mix concrete with a
target 28 day cylinder strength of 30 MPa. The flexural
and splitting strengths of the concrete were determined
from control specimens cured in air and water. The
depth of the beams used in the flexural tests was
chosen to be 150 mm to eliminate the influence on
flexural strength of differences in section depth between the control specimens and slabs. The resulting
tensile strengths are given in Table 3 which also gives
tensile strengths derived from the concrete compressive
strength using the equations given in Eurocode 2.4

Creep coefficients were estimated from strain measurements in the control cylinders and from changes in
curvature derived from strain measurements in the
uncracked sections of the slabs adjacent to the supports.
The in situ creep coefficients were derived in a section
analysis which compensated for the influences of
shrinkage and internal restraint from the reinforcement.
The creep coefficients in Figs 5 and 6 were calculated
in terms of instantaneous strains corresponding to the

The resulting creep coefficients are shown in Fig. 5
for tests S1–S3 and in Fig. 6 for test S6. The figures
also give the creep coefficients predicted by Eurocode
24 which were scaled by Ec (t0 )/Ec28 where Ec28 is the
elastic modulus at 28 days. It is interesting to note that
the creep coefficients measured in situ were slightly
greater than those measured in the control cylinders
which was unexpected. The rate of increase of the in
situ creep coefficients in slabs S1–S3 was also significantly greater after 30 days than predicted by Eurocode
2.4 The current authors attribute the difference in creep
behaviour between the control cylinders and slabs to
the slabs being in flexure unlike the control cylinders
which were in compression. The creep coefficient
is greater in flexure in compression because it is
increased by creep in tension, which is greater than in
compression. Neville10 also points out that the decrease
in the rate of creep with time is much less pronounced
in tension than compression because the increase in
tensile strength with time is less.
Determination of in situ cracking moment
It was anticipated that the effective flexural strength
of the concrete in the slabs would lie between the
splitting and flexural strengths as the flexural strength
of reinforced concrete is reduced by shrinkage owing to
the internal restraint provided by reinforcement. Three
approaches were used to estimate the in situ flexural
strength of the concrete in the slabs. In method M1, the
in situ strength was estimated by reducing the flexural
strength of the control beams by the tensile stress
induced in the slabs by restrained shrinkage which was
estimated as follows

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.979066266666667">
where r ¼ As /Ac , m is the effective modular ratio Es /
Eceff and ts is the time at onset of shrinkage.
In method M2, the flexural strength was estimated
from the moment at which the moment-curvature response of the slabs became non-linear. In method M3,
the flexural strength was chosen to give a good fit
between the instantaneous measured deflections and
those predicted by Eurocode 2 with â ¼ 1. Method
M3 is illustrated in Figs 7 and 8, which show that
curvatures are underestimated around the cracking

best overall estimate of the measured instantaneous
curvatures. In reality, tension stiffening is lost progressively as cracks form successively as the moment increases. It is unclear from the present tests to what
extent Eurocode 24 takes this into account as strain
data are unavailable to relate the loss of tension stiffening in the tests to the development of cracks during
loading. It appears that the Eurocode 24 moment–

the mid-span curvatures in Figs 9 and 10. It is apparent
that the peak construction load increased deflections
significantly in slabs S3 (compared to S2) and S5 (compared to S6) at 100 days, and that the difference in
deflections between slabs S5 and S6 reduced with time.
The rate of loss of tension stiffening with time is
significant in the calculation of long-term deflections
under load histories similar to Fig. 1 as long-term
deflections can be governed by the residual tension
stiffening remaining immediately before unloading from
the peak load. Slab tests S1, S2 and S6 provide data on
the rate of loss of tension stiffening in slabs under a
uniform sustained load. Tests S3–S5 provide data on the
residual tension stiffening remaining after unloading
from a short-term peak load. The mean moment resisted
by the concrete in tension between cracks was estimated
in the test slabs with the following equation

curvature relationship may underestimate the shortterm tension stiffening effect provided by cracked concrete below the neutral axis if the moment at first
cracking is used in equation (2). This conclusion is
consistent with the common practice of using the
mean concrete rather than minimum tensile strength to
determine a best estimate of likely deflections.
The concrete flexural strengths corresponding to
methods M1–M3 are listed in Table 3, which includes
the measured flexural and splitting strengths for comparison. The tensile strengths obtained with M3 were
adopted in the analysis of the slab data described in this
article as they give the best estimates of deflection in
conjunction with Eurocode 2.4 The concrete tensile
strength given by M3 was the same for slabs S4 and
S6. This was unexpected as slab S1 was loaded to
cracking at 13 days whereas slab S6 was loaded to
cracking at 34 days when the tensile strength of the
control specimens was greater as shown in Table 3.

Influence of construction loading on deflections in reinforced concrete slabs
The development of deflection with time depends
significantly on the rate of loss in the tension stiffening
moment with time which is governed by â in equation
(2). According to the Eurocode 24 moment–curvature
model, the mean residual moment resisted by the concrete between cracks is given by
M conc mean ¼ (1 À æ)M conc 1 ¼ â(M r =M)2 M conc 1 (8)
where Mconc1 is the moment resisted by concrete in
tension in an uncracked section, which is close to the
total bending moment M in lightly reinforced sections
such as slabs. The coefficient â in equation (2) can be
estimated by assuming Mconc1 ¼ M and rearranging
equation (8) as follows

days from first loading or the duration of the peak load
if less. Thereafter, â reduced much more slowly as
shown in Fig. 11(b) for the duration of the measurements presented which is up to one year. It appears that
â reduced more rapidly after the shrinkage strain plateaued at around 200 days.
A number of different mechanisms are responsible
for the long-term loss of tension stiffening in slabs. It
seems likely that the rapid loss of tension stiffening
after first cracking is attributable to internal cracking
of the concrete under sustained load as proposed by
Beeby and Scott.6 The subsequent gradual loss of tension stiffening appears to be caused by relaxation of
the concrete in tension between the cracks owing to
creep. The effect of creep is counter-balanced in part
by shrinkage, which induces tensile stresses in the concrete between the cracks owing to the restraining effect
of the reinforcement. These suppositions are supported
by the observation that â increased more rapidly after
the shrinkage plateaued at 200 days. Fig. 11(a) also
shows that â reduced at a significantly slower rate in
the slabs than in the tension specimens of Beeby and

Vollum et al.1,2 showed that deflections at Cardington varied linearly with the coefficient kmin defined
in equation (4). They went on to propose that the influence of peak construction loads could be accounted for
in deflection calculations by using a modified concrete
tensile strength given by
f ctmod ¼ k min w
(12)
It follows that the mean curvatures in a set of geometrically identical slabs vary linearly at any given time
with â(Mr /M)2 or k2 for a given M (i.e. 1/r1 and 1/r2 ).
Analysis shows that k typically varies almost linearly
with k2 for cracked slabs which explains the observed
linear relationship between k and deflections predicted
with Eurocode 24 under constant load and varying concrete tensile strength. The data from slabs S1–S6 were
analysed to determine if, at any given time, there was a
linear relationship between (Mperm S1 /Mperm )1/rm and (a)
(Mr /M)2 and (b) Mr /M as anticipated from the first
author’s analysis of the Cardington deflection data. The
curvatures 1/rm were normalised by the ratio Mperm S1 /
Mperm (where Mperm is the mid-span moment in the slab
under consideration under the permanent load and S1
denotes slab S1) as the permanent load varied between
the tests as shown in Table 2. The normalisation is
justified as the curvatures 1/r1 and 1/r2 are almost
proportional to the applied moment as the curvature
induced by shrinkage is relatively small. The results of
a typical analysis are shown in Figs 13 and 14, which
show that there was a linear relationship between
(Mperm S1 /Mperm )1/rm and both (Mr /Mpeak )2 and Mr /Mpeak
in slabs S1 to S6 at 93 days when the permanent load
was removed from slabs S1–S3.
The reason for the linear relationship between
(Mperm S1 /Mperm )1/rm and (Mr /M)2 in slabs that have
been unloaded requires further explanation as the unloading line does not pass through the origin. In this
case, the mean curvature can be expressed as

Analysis shows that the curvatures given by equation
(13) are relatively insensitive to the value used for C in
the calculation of æ* in equation (15) and it is suggested that C is taken as1 throughout as implicitly
assumed in the Rotilio8 method.
Equation (13) implies that the normalised curvatures
((Mperm S1 /Mperm )1/rm ) and corresponding mid-span deflections should vary linearly with 1 À æ* at any given
time. This has been investigated for slabs S1 to S6 and
the results are given in Fig. 16, which shows a remarkably linear relationship between 1 À æ* and curvature
in slabs S1 to S6 at 93 days as predicted. Analysis
shows that the linear relationship is virtually independent of the value of C used to define the slope of the
unloading line in equation (15).

required.
TR585 uses equation (11) to modify the concrete
tensile strength to account for cracking during construction and under peak loads. It is recommended in
TR585 that â is taken as 0.5 in equation (2) as tension
stiffening is lost rapidly after first loading. The method
in TR585 neglects the residual increase in curvature
˜*1/rm that remains after unloading from peak loads
(see Fig. 8). This omission was justified in the development of the method by observing that the effect of
neglecting ˜*1/rm in the calculation of the long-term
curvature under wperm is largely compensated by overestimating the loss in tension stiffening under the peak
construction load.
Proposed method for deflection prediction
It is proposed that the rigorous method for deflection
prediction in TR585 should be modified by calculating
the interpolation coefficient in equation (1) correspond11
ing to the peak construction load with equation (15)
with C ¼ 1. In practice, æpeak can be calculated under
the applied loading using fctmod (see equation (11)) and
Mpeak /Mperm can be approximated as wpeak /wperm for
uniformly loaded slabs. The coefficient â used in the
calculation of æpeak can be estimated with equation (10)
if the duration of the peak construction load is known
or, more conservatively, â can be taken as 0.7 for peak
construction loads of up to five weeks duration. It is
suggested that the interpolation coefficient æ should be
taken as the greatest of either æfrequent (where æfrequent is
calculated under the frequent load with â ¼ 0.5) or æ*
in the calculation of long-term deflections.

Validation of proposed method
The accuracy of the proposed method for deflection
prediction has been evaluated by comparing measured
and predicted deflections in slabs S1–S6. Curvatures
were calculated with methods outlined below.
(a) TR58 A: TR585 with concrete material properties
derived with Eurocode 2 from the concrete compressive strength with the concrete tensile strength
taken as the flexural strength.
(b) TR58 B: TR585 with concrete material properties
derived with Eurocode 2 from the concrete compressive strength with the concrete tensile strength
taken as the splitting strength.
(c) TR58 C: TR585 with the measured concrete material properties.
(d ) Proposed: Proposed method with the measured
concrete material properties and the experimental
values of â.
The creep and shrinkage values used in TR58 C and
the proposed method were derived from the equations
of the lines of best fit to the mean in situ data shown in
Figs 3–6. Measured creep coefficients were used to
determine the curvatures under the peak construction
loads in slabs S3, S4 and S5 but the increase in creep
owing to the application of the peak construction load
was neglected in the calculation of curvatures after the
removal of the peak construction load. In reality, the in
situ creep coefficients were greater in slabs S4 and S5
than S6 as the additional creep under the peak construction load was not fully recovered on unloading as
shown in Fig. 17. Despite this the measured long-term
curvatures within the constant moment region of slabs
S4 and S6 are very similar as shown in Fig. 10, even
though the curvature was greater in the uncracked sections, adjacent to the supports, of slab S4 than S6. The
reason for this is probably related to the fact that the
effective creep coefficient is greater in the uncracked
regions of the slab than in the cracked regions where
tension is relieved in the concrete by cracking. In practice, compressive creep coefficients are usually used in
deflection calculations. The present work suggests that
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.984925935483871">
this can lead to an underestimate of deflection in lightly
loaded slabs with significant tension stiffening.
The measured and predicted mean mid-span curvatures are compared in Figs 18(a)–(f), which show that
the proposed method gives significantly more realistic
estimates of curvature in slabs S3 to S5 under the peak
construction load and subsequently than the rigorous
method in TR58.5 Furthermore, it can be seen that the
curvature predictions are significantly improved when
measured material properties are used, with curvatures
being particularly sensitive to the concrete tensile
strength, which was unexpectedly low in tests S4–S6
for unknown reasons. It can be seen that deflections
were overestimated in slabs S1 and S2 if the concrete
tensile strengths were calculated in terms of the compressive strength using Eurocode 2. Conversely, deflections were significantly underestimated in slab S6 if the
concrete tensile strength was taken as the flexural
strength given by Eurcode 2 at 34 days when the
permanent load was applied and cracking occurred.
Conclusions
It has been demonstrated that tension stiffening is
lost rapidly after cracking in flexural members but less
rapidly than measured by Beeby and Scott6 in tension
members. It is shown that long-term deflections can be
governed by short-term peaks in construction loading
as suggested by analysis of deflection data from Cardington.1,2 A modification is proposed to the Eurocode
24 moment–curvature model to calculate the residual
tension stiffening moment remaining in members after
unloading from short-term peak loads. Expressions are
developed to calculate the variation in time of the coefficient â in the Eurocode 24 moment–curvature relationship. A refinement is proposed to the rigorous
method for deflection prediction in Concrete Society
Technical report 58,5 which is shown to give improved
estimates of deflection after the removal of the peak

This omission was justified in the development of the method by observing that the effect of neglecting ˜*1/rm in the calculation of the long-term curvature under wperm is largely compensated by overestimating the loss in tension stiffening under the peak construction load. Proposed method for deflection prediction It is proposed that the rigorous method for deflection prediction in TR585 should be modified by calculating the interpolation coefficient in equation (1) correspond11 ing to the peak construction load with equation (15) with C  1. In practice, æpeak can be calculated under the applied loading using fctmod (see equation (11)) and Mpeak /Mperm can be approximated as wpeak /wperm for uniformly loaded slabs. The coefficient â used in the calculation of æpeak can be estimated with equation (10) if the duration of the peak construction load is known or, more conservatively, â can be taken as 0.7 for peak construction loads of up to five weeks duration.

Vollum7 also analysed deflection data from various slabs tested by others in the laboratory under constant loading and concluded that â typically reduced from 1 to around 0.7, in cracked members, between 1 and 2 days after first loading. Some aspects of Vollum’s7 analysis were speculative as creep and shrinkage strains were typically measured in control specimens which had a significantly smaller notional size than the slabs.

Deflection plotted against load in slabs S4 to S6 curvature relationship may underestimate the shortterm tension stiffening effect provided by cracked concrete below the neutral axis if the moment at first cracking is used in equation (2). This conclusion is consistent with the common practice of using the mean concrete rather than minimum tensile strength to determine a best estimate of likely deflections. The concrete flexural strengths corresponding to methods M1–M3 are listed in Table 3, which includes the measured flexural and splitting strengths for comparison. The tensile strengths obtained with M3 were adopted in the analysis of the slab data described in this article as they give the best estimates of deflection in conjunction with Eurocode 2.4 The concrete tensile strength given by M3 was the same for slabs S4 and S6</context>

They found that the long-term mean residual tensile stress in the concrete between cracks was around half the instantaneous value after first cracking. Beeby and Scott6 concluded that tension stiffening was largely lost owing to additional cracking and internal damage under sustained load as the tensile strength of concrete reduces to around 70% of its instantaneous value under sustained loading.

Variations in construction loading, concrete strengths and reinforcement between floors led to significant variations in deflection between floors. Analysis of the Cardington data1,2,7 showed that the measured deflections under the permanent load, at a specific location, varied almost linearly with the minimum value of a coefficient k, which was defined as p k  â f ct =w (4) where fct and w were evaluated at either striking, under the peak construction load or under the permanent load. The minimum value of k corresponds to the loading stage which induces the worst cracking. It was assumed that the interpolation coefficient æ corresponding to kmin governs long-term deflections as cracking is irreversible. The long-term deflections were shown to be governed by striking or peak construction loads provided that â was taken as less than 0.86 in kstrike and kpeak .

Analysis shows that k typically varies almost linearly with k2 for cracked slabs which explains the observed linear relationship between k and deflections predicted with Eurocode 24 under constant load and varying concrete tensile s</context>

Three approaches were used to estimate the in situ flexural strength of the concrete in the slabs. In method M1, the in situ strength was estimated by reducing the flexural strength of the control beams by the tensile stress induced in the slabs by restrained shrinkage which was estimated as follows f ctsh (t)  Es åsh (ts )S1 (h À x1 )=I 1 þ As Es åsh (ts )=(Ac (1 þ mr)) (6) where r  As /Ac , m is the effective modular ratio Es / Eceff and ts is the time at onset of shrinkage. In method M2, the flexural strength was estimated from the moment at which the moment-curvature response of the slabs became non-linear. In method M3, the flexural strength was chosen to give a good fit between the instantaneous measured deflections and those predicted by Eurocode 2 with â  1. Method M3 is illustrated in Figs 7 and 8, which show that curvatures are underestimated around the cracking moment if the flexural strength is chosen to give the best overall estimate of the measure</context>

Proposed method for deflection prediction It is proposed that the rigorous method for deflection prediction in TR585 should be modified by calculating the interpolation coefficient in equation (1) correspond11 ing to the peak construction load with equation (15) with C  1. In practice, æpeak can be calculated under the applied loading using fctmod (see equation (11)) and Mpeak /Mperm can be approximated as wpeak /wperm for uniformly loaded slabs. The coefficient â used in the calculation of æpeak can be estimated with equation (10) if the duration of the peak construction load is known or, more conservatively, â can be taken as 0.7 for peak construction loads of up to five weeks duration. It is suggested that the interpolation coefficient æ should be taken as the greatest of either æfrequent (where æfrequent is calculated under the frequent load with â  0.5) or æ* in the calculation of long-term deflections.
