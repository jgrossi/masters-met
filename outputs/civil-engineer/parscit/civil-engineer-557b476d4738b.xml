Nondestructive testing provides ideal means to test pavement structure in a rapid and convenient manner.
In last few years, significant development has taken place in this field. This paper, presents some of the
major conventional as well as emerging nondestructive evaluation methods for in situ structural
assessment of asphalt pavements. Discussion of methods is primarily directed towards the estimation of
layer moduli and thickness values which are direct indicators of the structural strength of pavement.
Estimation of density, moisture content, etc. has not been emphasised in this paper.

Structural condition evaluation of existing asphalt pavement serves purposes such as,
(i) estimation of its present sufficiency for the purpose served, (ii) estimation of remaining
service-life and (iii) decision on the choice of rehabilitation measure. A desirable method is
the one which neither causes disruption to traffic, nor causes any damage to the existing
pavement structure. For quick acquisition of test data, a reliable and consistent test technique
is needed. Nondestructive testing (NDT) methods provide all these features and are ideally
suited for application to pavements. With NDT methods, a number of data sets can be acquired
at the same point which provides statistical reliability to the experimentally acquired data.
In a structural evaluation process, the primary objective is to estimate the structural
strength. For asphalt pavements, it may be expressed in terms of in situ layer elastic moduli,
layer thickness, inter-layer bond conditions and anomaly characterisation. A simple and
direct evaluation method for layer properties estimation is by visual examination after
digging pits or taking cores from the pavement, which are destructive methods. Dynamic
cone penetrometer test can give a qualitative (and to some extent quantitative) estimation of
layer thickness, though it has some limitations (Loizos and Plati 2007, Roy 2007) in terms of
test-speed, error and subjectivity in testing.

This paper discusses some of the emerging as well as contemporary nondestructive
evaluation (NDE) methods which have found applications for in situ structural evaluation of
asphalt pavements. Underlying principles and test set-up of various techniques alongwith
their scope and performance are discussed in detail. Discussion is confined to the NDE
methods specific to the estimation of in situ thickness and moduli values of asphalt pavement
layers. It does not specifically cover the issues related to estimation of density, moisture
content, etc.
2. Basic principles of NDE techniques for asphalt pavements
A number of NDE methods have been developed for evaluation of asphalt pavements. For
in situ NDT of pavements, only the top surface is available. Thus, methods requiring access
to two different surfaces of the pavement structure cannot be employed in this case (X-ray
method, etc.). Laboratory techniques such as resonance column method and ultrasonic
testing have been used to determine the seismic moduli for complimenting the evaluation
procedure (Nazarian et al. 1999, Celaya and Nazarian 2007). These techniques can also be
used for calibration of field NDT methods (Hammons et al. 2006).
Many of the NDE methods involve implementation of forward approach for analysis and
the inverse approach for interpretation. In forward approach, the system is idealised in the
form of a model to study its physical response (say, deflection) due to some stimulus (say,
force), when the properties of the pavement layers (say, layer elastic moduli) are assumed.
A simple approach to forward modeling of pavement structure is to idealise it as a
horizontally layered, linearly elastic, isotropic and homogenous media. More complex
forward analysis schemes can be developed by dropping these idealisations, thereby
achieving closer approximation to the actual response. In fact, the seismic/ loading response
of pavement structure is quite complex, and its modeling is itself a difficult task (Brown
1997). Asphalt layer is strongly sensitive to nature of loading (magnitude, frequency and
duration) as well as temperature (Krishnan and Rajagopal 2003); whereas the elastic
modulus of granular layer and subgrade is sensitive to stress conditions (Lekarp et al. 2000).
The inverse approach involves deductive analysis for which an unconstrained optimisation
scheme is applied to the acquired data (say, deflection) so as to estimate the desired properties
(say, layer elastic moduli) of the pavement system. Thus, the inverse algorithm typically
involves recursive calls to the forward analysis with some assumed values of the unknown
parameters, and any pre-defined error parameter is minimised through subsequent iterations.
The error parameter is generally defined as root mean square of the difference between the
obtained and predicted responses. Since, inverse calculation requires computation of forward
calculations at each iteration, use of more realistic forward modeling does enhance the
accuracy but it significantly increases the computation time as well.
Based on the underlying principles, the NDE methods for asphalt pavements can be
classified under two broad headings as follows.

3. Deflection-basin methods
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998259428571429">
In deflection-basin methods, vertical deflections at various points on the surface of the
pavement test-section, due to an applied load, are measured. Type of the load applied may be
static, steady state harmonic or transient impulse type (ASTM D2003). The measurement of
deflection at the load point and at locations radially outwards from it, can be done with the help
of a dial gauge/linear variable differential transformer, or by using velocity transducers
(geophones) (Haas et al. 1994). Various types of deflection based NDE methods are discussed
further in the following subsections.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998796">
3.1 Static loading method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994931875">
In this method, a static load is applied to the test section and its deflection is measured.
Benkelman beam deflection (BBD) test is a simple and relatively inexpensive method under
this category.
Basic device in a BBD test consists of a lightweight frame to which a beam probe is
attached alongwith a dial gauge (Zube and Forsyth 1966). BBD measures the deflection due
to static loading of dual tyres of a loaded truck. Measurement process starts by placing the
probe between the rear dual wheels of the test vehicle (figure 1). Initial dial gauge reading is
recorded. The truck is made to move away by a specified distance and as the rebound rate of
pavement surface falls below a specified level, intermediate reading is taken. Truck is again
made to move further away and the final reading is taken. Such an approach is adopted as an
attempt to reduce/nullify the influence of deflection bowl on the readings (Haas et al. 1994,
Chakroborty and Das 2003). A characteristic BBD value, which is larger than allowable,
warrants an overlay for the pavement.
The BBD device has been improved and made capable of multi-point probing with
increased accuracy. Rolling weight deflectometer (RWD) is an example of such improved
devices that employ similar basic principle (Bay and Stokoe 1998).

by counter rotating mass or electro-hydraulic system. The two trailer wheels equally
distribute the vertical dynamic load to the pavement. A geophone series measures the
velocity of movement with respect to time, which on integration gives the deflection basin
(Haas et al. 1994). Thus, the deflection measurement for these devices are free from
influence of deflection bowl. However, test loading is harmonic and does not have any rest
period. Hence, the loading condition is somewhat different (Fwa 2006) and the magnitude of
load applied is also smaller (Ullidtz 1987) than the actual situation of in-service pavements.
Also, a relatively large amount of pre-load is applied to the pavement which may adversely
affect the accuracy of pavement response (Fwa 2006).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.970148">
3.3 Transient impulse loading
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99104147826087">
This method uses an impulsive transient load application to the pavement test-section and the
deflection response is recorded at a series of radial points (ASTM D4694 2003). This type of
device is typically referred to as falling weight deflectometer (FWD) and is schematically
shown in (figure 2). The amount of impact load, duration and the loading area is adjusted in
such a way that it closely corresponds to the actual loading by a standard truck on in-service
road (Sebaaly et al. 1991). The peak load is controlled by varying the falling mass, height of
drop and the spring constant. The time of impulse load may vary between 0.025 and 0.30 s,
and the applied load may vary between 4.45 and 156 kN (Bay and Stokoe 1998, Goktepe et al.
2006). Generally, the load pulses are of halfsine type and the loading area is a 30 cm diameter
circular pad (Bay and Stokoe 1998). Velocity transducers Geophones record the deflection
response. Depending on the type of FWD, 3 to 7 geophones are used to capture the deflection
profile (Haas et al. 1994, Advisory Circular, No.150/5370-11A 2004). Load is measured by a
load cell, and its variation may be used to evaluate the stress dependence of the layer
modulus (Roesset 1998, Rahiom and George 2003, NCHRP Design Guide1-37A 2006).
Since the stiffness of asphalt layer is affected by temperature, a suitable temperature
correction factor needs to be applied to the observed deflection values to convert them to
values at the standard temperature (Chen et al. 2000, Park et al. 2002).
Some lighter versions of FWDs, called as light falling weight deflectometer, are also
available in which the impact load is relatively small (Loizos et al. 2003, Goktepe et al.
2006). LFWD is generally found to be suitable for base and subgrade evaluation (Loizos et al.
2003, Alshibli et al. 2005, Loizos and Boukovalas 2005). In heavy weight deflectometer
(HWD) heavier load is used to simulate aircraft or other heavier vehicles (Turner et al. 2003).
Major advantage of this technique is that it closely simulates the actual in-service

process. However, FWD method is relatively expensive and inverse analysis is complex. For
taking FWD measurements one needs to stop every time for deflection measurement. This
problem is taken care of by the rolling dynamic deflectometer (RDD) where the vehicle
moves at slow speed (of the order of 2.4 km/hr) and the deflection is continuously measured
(Bay and Stokoe 1998, Goktepe et al. 2006) by rolling sensors. RDD also measures the
deflection from inertial frame of reference, hence the error associated with the geometry of
the road does not come into picture (Bay and Stokoe 1998, Bay et al. 2000). Since, the
deflections are measured continuously, the statistical confidence is also good (Lee et al.
2006).
Forward analysis approach which simulates the FWD loading can be divided into two
broad categories, static analysis (Lytton 1989, Fwa 2006) and dynamic analysis (Roesset
et al. 1994, Loizos et al. 2003, Loizos and Boukovalas 2005). The dynamic analysis is able to
take into account the inertia effects, and loss of impact energy due to hysteresis and seismic
wave radiation (Chang et al. 1992, Loizos et al. 2003). Researches (Roesset and Shao 1985,
Chang et al. 1992, Uzan 1994) suggest that the use of static analysis may sometimes give
erroneous results, especially when there exists a stiff bedrock layer below the pavement at a
shallow depth.
The problem of backcalculation, i.e. inverse analysis is a complex one, and efforts are
being made to evolve a generalised backcalculation approach (May and Von Quintus 1994)
that can reach the solution quickly and accurately. Various approaches based on (i) closed
formed solutions (Scrivner et al. 1973, Hall and Mohseni 1991, Advisory Circular,
No.150/5370-11A 2004), (ii) database search (Anderson 1989, Chou and Lytton 1991),
(iii) optimisation techniques (Bush and Alexander 1985, Sivaneswaran et al. 1991,
Harichandran et al. 1993), (iv) regression equations (Ali and Khosla 1987, Mahoney et al.
1993, Roque et al. 1998), (v) evolutionary algorithms (Meier and Rix 1994a,b, Sharma and
Das) and (vi) combination of these methods have been implemented for backcalculation of
layer moduli. The difficulties faced by various backcalculation approaches may be
summarised as follows (Sharma and Das):
. The closed formed solutions can handle only limited and idealistic situations.
. The regression methods are fast, but sometimes may give inaccurate results (Lenngren
1991).
. The methods based on conventional optimisation techniques take a long time to
backcalculate the layer moduli (Harichandran et al. 1993). There are chances that the
solution may converge to a local optimal point. Also, the convergence depends on the
initial solution (seed values) chosen (Harichandran et al. 1993, May and Von Quintus
1994).
. The approach based on artificial neural network (ANN) takes a long time for training
data-sets and requires fresh training every time the input parameters change. Computation
time in genetic algorithm (GA) based program is also large (Fwa et al. 1997, Kameyana
et al. 1997).

The wave propagation based NDE methods employ wave propagation principles (for
stress/electromagnetic waves) in a multilayer pavement structure, and the response is
acquired, analyzed and interpreted. These methods are discussed in the following sections.

A stress/elastic wave is a type of mechanical wave that propagates in elastic/viscoelastic
materials due to a stress based disturbance. There are two types of stress waves, namely,
body-waves and surface-waves. The salient characteristics and propagation principles of
these waves in multilayered media are discussed elsewhere (Richart et al. 1970, Ryden 2004,
Goel and Das 2006). Stress waves may be generated through different devices like dropweight, strike hammer, or a transducer. The sensing element is also a transducer receiver
(e.g. accelerometer). The data is recorded through a data acquisition system and
subsequently analysed to get the required estimates. It is important to note that the estimated
seismic moduli of pavement layers by these methods may typically show larger values as
compared to those estimated by deflection based methods, since a low magnitude loading is
applied at a high strain rate in this case. Therefore, suitable correction models need to be
incorporated in the analysis scheme (Nazarian and Alvarado 2006). Based on the analysis

The first two methods employ body waves, whereas the third method primarily employs
surface wave response to evaluate the pavement structure. These are discussed in the
following subsections.
4.1.1 Impact echo/pulse echo method. In the IE/pulse echo method, an impact is made at
the test surface to generate stress waves and their reflections from any inhomogeneity in
layer medium, interface, void, crack, etc. are recorded to extract information on its location
(figure 4, Sansalone 1997). It is an established method for testing concrete structures (Sack
and Olson 1995, Gucunski and Maher 2002 Nazarian et al. 2003, Cho and Linb 2005).
From the amplitude-time data of reflected body waves, the frequency peaks are identified
using frequency domain analysis. Each of these peak indicates the resonant echo frequencies.
Inverse of these frequencies gives the time required for the waves to get echoed from the
pavement interface or the crack surface (Sack and Olson 1995, Sansalone 1997). For a single
layer structure, the thickness of the layer (t) can be calculated as (Hill et al. 2000)

where, t is the thickness of the layer, Vp is the longitudinal stress wave (P-wave) velocity, f is
the resonant frequency and b is a correction factor. Theoretical basis of this factor b has been
explained in a recent study (Gibson and Popovics 2005). If the Vp through the media is
known, the depth of crack or interface can be estimated. IE method can be combined with the
SASW method for Vp and thickness determination (ASTM C1383 2000, Kim et al. 2006).
The SASW method is discussed in a later section. Ultrasonic pulse echo has been used for
estimation of thickness and depth of surface cracks for asphalt pavements with success
(Underwood and Kim 2002, Celaya and Nazarian 2007).

of a wave-pulse transmitter (Tx) and a transducer receiver (Rx) at a known distance apart
(figure 5). Transit time for the wave-pulse is recorded by the data acquisition unit which then
gives the stress wave velocity (ASTM C597-02 2002). Ultrasonic waves are commonly
employed in this test. Laboratory studies suggest (Pellinen and Witczak 2002, Jiang et al.
2006, Kanta Rao et al. 2006) that the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) method can estimate
the dynamic modulus of asphalt with reasonable accuracy. For field testing on in-service
pavements, indirect configuration of sensors needs to be used, as only top surface is
accessible. P-wave velocity also varies with the homogeneity of the material medium and
this property can be used to characterise it. In some recent studies, UPV has been used to
monitor top – down cracking (Khazanovich et al. 2005), fatigue damage and crack healing in
asphalt pavements (Abo-Qudais and Suleiman 2005).

4.1.3 Spectral analysis of surface waves method. The SASW method (Heisey et al. 1982,
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999441117647059">
Nazarian et al. 1988, 1999) introduced a relatively simple and portable surface wave test
technique for pavements. Its major feature is the use of spectral analysis technique for signal
processing which makes it possible to analyze a range of frequencies with a convenient
hammer-impact type surface wave source and two transducer receivers. The method operates
at negligible strain level and provides estimates of the elastic moduli and thicknesses of
layers.
The basic assumption used in this method is that only the fundamental mode of Rayleigh
wave (R-wave) propagation is excited and recorded. Higher modes of R-wave propagation
are neglected. Physical quantity that is being determined, is the S-wave velocity (Vs) which is
a characteristic engineering property of a material (Richart et al. 1970). Commonly used
three-step evaluation procedure for this method is (i) generation of experimental dispersion
curve (EDC), (ii) forward modeling of R-wave dispersion and (iii) inversion to generate
vertical stiffness profile of the test section (Goel and Das 2006).
EDC is a curve between Vs and the generated wavelengths for the test section. It is
generated from data obtained through field testing which consists of a suitable impact source
to generate surface waves of a desired frequency range that are sensed by two vertical, singleaxis transducer receivers at known offsets (figure 6). Time domain data sets may be obtained

receiver midpoint or common source test geometries (Nazarian and Stokoe 1986, Hiltunen
and Woods 1989) are generally used to collect a number of data sets and stacking technique
is applied to increase the signal to noise ratio (SNR). To calculate the phase-difference
between the signals from the two receivers, the data is transformed to frequency domain
using fast Fourier transform algorithm. Phase-difference values at each frequency gives the
corresponding R-wave phase velocities VR (Nazarian and Desai 1993). Bergman (1948)
proposed a relation between VR and Vs as follows:

where; n is the poisson’s ratio of the material medium. This basic equation can be suitably
used for Vs calculation (Sanchez-Salinero et al. 1987, Roesset et al. 1990, Nazarian et al.
1999).
Forward modeling consists of generating a theoretical dispersion curve (TDC) for chosen
values of layer properties. A computationally adaptable formulation, known as Haskell –
Thomson’s propagator-matrix method (Thomson 1950, Haskell 1953, Jones 1955) was
established in early 1950’s, that related the R-wave dispersion property in a homogeneous
multi-layered media (such as asphalt pavement) with its elastic properties. This formulation
gives the surface wave dispersion function as a product of layer matrices that relates the
displacement and stress components at any interface to those for the deepest layer and is a
function of the frequency and wave-number. A determinant search technique computes the
values of the wave-number for which the determinant is zero (called as eigen values). For
asphalt pavement profiles, no real eigen values exist above a specific maximum frequency.
This leads to complex-domain computation of eigen values.
Propagator-matrix method became the basis for most of the theoretical forward modeling
approaches of R-wave dispersion, such as: stiffness-matrix method, linearised stiffnessmatrix method, etc. (Kauseland and Rou¨sset 1981, Storme et al. 2005). Various tools
utilising finite-difference (Hossian and Drnevich 1989), Green’s functions (Kausel and Peek
1982, Hisada 1994), wavelet transforms (Kim and Park 2002), etc. have also been applied to
solve for dispersion characteristics.
In the inversion process, a suitable analysis tool is employed to compare EDC with the
TDC. This gives the final vertical Vs profile of the test site which is then used to determine the
stiffness profile for the test-site using equation (3). It should be noted here that the estimated
asphalt modulus is sensitive to the test temperature and hence proper correction needs to be
applied (Mallick et al. 2005, Gucunski et al. 2006).

Besides the automated methods for EDC generation (Nazarian and Desai 1993), schemes
employing manual masking of raw data are also used which demand experience in use.
Analysis tools such as statistical/curve-fitting methods (Yuan and Nazarian 1993), simulation
(Ganji et al. 1998), ANN (Williams and Gucunski 1995, Gucunski et al. 2000, Nazarian et al.

has recently been used for void detection in pavements (Shokouhi et al. 2003). Construction
or testing information for the test site may also be incorporated in the inversion process for
more efficient profiling.
A number of variants of the basic evaluation method, as described above, have been
reported. Park et al. (1998) introduced the multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW)
method which makes use of more than two receivers to detect the other higher modes present
in the surface waves. This method attempts to generate a more accurate dispersion curve
representation using pattern recognition techniques which also automate the procedure.
Multichannel simulation using one receiver (MSOR) method for pavement characterisation
(Ryden et al. 2001) is based on MASW technique, and utilises a single fixed receiver and
moving source (or vice versa) to take a number of data sets, and then use them to simulate
multichannel data. A convenient testing and fast analysis procedure gives more efficiency to
this method. Ultrasonic surface waves have also been successfully employed to estimate the
depth of surface cracks and elastic modulus of asphalt layer (Mallick et al. 2005, Mallick and
Nazarian 2006).

<bodyText confidence="0.980838357142857">
In electromagnetic wave method, the reflections of the transmitted waves caused by any
changes in the material and/or layer properties, are recorded and analyzed to deduce the
required information. Infrared thermography (IRT) and ground penetrating radar (GPR) can
be identified as two types of NDE techniques that find application on asphalt pavement, and
are discussed in the following.
4.2.1 Infrared thermography. IRT employs an infrared camera to capture the thermal
image from top of the pavement. The subsurface defects affect the heat flow within the
pavement, and this in turn affects the temperature distribution of the concerned area. The IRT
can capture images of a larger area quickly. To some extent, this method can capture the
location and extent of sub-surface distresses in the form of cracking, segregation, ageing and
construction non-homogeneity, etc. (Gordon et al. 1998, Mahoney et al. 2000, Oloufa et al.
2004). The test results can also get affected by various field conditions such as time of
testing, cloud cover, wind flow, pavement surface texture, solar radiation and sub-surface
conditions (moisture, frost penetration, etc.).

1997, Morey 1998, Saarenketo and Scullion 2000, Al-Qadi and Lahouar 2005, Maser et al.
2006). Researchers have found that the estimation of surface-layer thickness of asphalt
pavement by this technique is good (Maser 1999, Saarenketo and Scullion 2000, Maser et al.
2006). GPR facility also provides a continuous data record for the full length of the test
section, thereby giving direct information of test section at each point.

horn-antenna) and ground coupled system. The two are further discussed in the following.
. In air-coupled system, the antenna is typically placed 150– 500 mm above the pavement
surface (Al-Qadi and Lahouar 2005). The test set-up is mounted on a vehicle which
operates on test pavement at specified speed. Operating speed depends on antenna type
used and required frequency of data recording. The survey can be conducted at a speed of
even 60 km/hr and the typical depth of penetration in the pavement is of the order of 0.5 to
0.9 m (Saarenketo and Scullion 2000). Accuracy of this method depends on the resolution

of the time scan and the dielectric constant of the material (Maser et al. 2006). As the
equipment moves on the pavement surface, sequence of wavefronts are generated, and
from this, the layer-boundaries can be directly visualised from the pictorial output of the
collected wavefront data (Maser et al. 2006).
The relative reflection amplitude at the nth interface can be expressed as (Al-Qadi and

Similarly, the expression for di-electric constant for the second layer (e r;2 ) can be obtained
by putting n ¼ 2 in equation (5) and using the value of e r;1 obtained form equation (6) and so
on. The depth of the ith layer of a pavement can be obtained as (ASTM D4748 2003, Al-Qadi
and Lahouar 2005, Loizos and Plati 2007):

where, di is the thickness of the ith layer, ti is the two way travel time of the electromagnetic
wave through the ith layer, c is the speed of light in free space (approximately equal to
1 £ 108 m/s) and e r;i is the dielectric constant of the ith layer. Its important to note here that
these simple equations assume the asphalt layer to be homogeneous and isotropic with
uniform dielectric constant. However, this assumption may not be always true for old or
faulty pavement layers, thereby decreasing the accuracy evaluation (Saarenketo and Scullion
2000, Lahouar et al. 2002, Loizos and Plati 2007).
. In ground coupled system, the antenna remains in full contact with the ground. Loss due
to reflection at the pavement surface being less, the depth of penetration is more. But, this
system has a limitation on the vehicle speed (Al-Qadi and Lahouar 2005).
Generally, the common mid-point (CMP) technique for ground coupled system is
employed to increase the SNR (signal to noise ratio) (Lahouar et al. 2002). In this technique,
two antennas are used, one is transmitter and the other is receiver. Initially, the two antennas
are kept adjacent to each other and then they are moved equal distances step-wise from the
mid-point and the data on travel time (ti) is collected. The following relationship can be used
(Maser et al. 2006)

where, i is the scan number, V is the velocity of wave in pavement layer, d is the thickness of
the pavement layer, x(i) is the distance of any antenna from the CMP in ith scan and ti is the
travel time of the pulse wave from transmitter to receiver. The resolution of this test largely
depends on waveform sampling and the ability of distinction between the reflected wave
from the direct wave (Maser et al. 2006).
Maser et al. (2006) found that the ground coupled GPR system can reliably identify a
pavement thickness which is larger than 100 mm, whereas air-coupled GPR can measure
asphalt layer thickness of the order of 50 mm. It is argued that amplitude based
characterisation through GPR may not be very appropriate for evaluation of pavements,
because amplitude is also affected by various factors (for example, height of the antenna)
other than the reflection from the interfaces (Gordon et al. 1998). To take care of this
problem, Mesher et al. (1995) developed multi-antenna bi-static array GPR system specific
to evaluation of pavement thickness.

The GPR technology is developing at a rapid pace, in both towards the equipment as well
as analysis algorithm. Some of the improvements towards the equipment include stepped
frequency, synthetic aperture radar, switched antenna array, etc. (Maser 1996, Gordon et al.
1998, Loulizi et al. 2003); whereas those towards the analysis algorithm include application
of wavelet analysis, deconvolution and data migration, ANN, fuzzy logic, optimisation, etc.
(Maser 1994, Gordon et al. 1998, Loulizi et al. 2003, Al-Qadi and Lahouar 2005).
Various researchers have found different levels of error in estimation of pavement
thickness by GPR technology. Calibration of GPR using field core data is expected to
enhance the accuracy achieved (Willett et al. 2006, Loizos and Plati 2007). In general, it is
seen that the thickness estimation is more erroneous for thin layers (Gordon et al. 1998,
Al-Qadi and Lahouar 2005, Loizos and Plati 2007). For newly built pavements, a greater
accuracy has been reported (Al-Qadi et al. 2003, Maser et al. 2006). A listing of accuracy
levels observed by different researches in estimating the thickness is presented in (table 2).
Some of the present limitations of the GPR technique, as identified by various researchers,
are summarised as follows:
. Interpretation of GPR data requires experience and is subjective in nature (Loulizi 2001).
. An inability to clearly differentiate between layers of similar materials is present due to a
low contrast in their dielectric properties (Al-Qadi et al. 2001, Loulizi 2001, Al-Qadi and
Lahouar 2005).
. An increased attenuation of electromagnetic signal may be caused in the pavement layers
due to presence of salt, water or high iron content in slag aggregates. As such, the analysis
results may be misleading sometimes, specially for concrete pavements (Mesher et al.
1995, Gordon et al. 1998, Al-Qadi et al. 2001, ASTM D4748 2003, Maser et al. 2006).
. With high frequency antenna, resolution of recorded data gets enhanced, but the depth of
penetration reduces (Gordon et al. 1998, Al-Qadi and Lahouar 2005, Loizos and Plati
2007).

(David et al. 2002, Shull 2002). However, due to their high frequency and low energy
response, they have been primarily used for evaluation of top asphaltic layer. User
experience is required to choose a suitable NDT technique specific to the test objective and
field conditions. For example, specialised techniques such as IRT can be successfully
employed for evaluation of airport pavements (Moropoulou et al. 2001) as they make use of
large temperature variations occurring there in.

It is argued that the stress wave related equipment (say, IE) work well for concrete
pavements, because the signal impedance contrast between concrete and the base material is
sharper as compared to asphalt pavements (Maser 2003, Maser et al. 2006). On the other
hand, for GPR methods, the dielectric contrast between asphalt and the base material is
sharper than between concrete and the base material (Maser et al. 2006). Since GPR testing is
continuous, future automated versions of GPR technology has a strong potential of being
developed as a routine pavement evaluation equipment (Saarenketo and Scullion 2000).
The accuracy achieved by employing individual NDE techniques can be improved by
combining data from two or more methods in the final analysis (Abdallah et al. 2001).
Similarly, FWD (or RDD) and GPR have been found as a good combination of technologies
for measuring asphalt layer thickness as well as stiffness (Saarenketo and Scullion 2000,
Hanna 2002, Lee et al. 2006). IRT can also be used to decide GPR survey locations thereby
enhancing its effectiveness in evaluation (Weil 1993). The SASW and FWD methods are
generally more suitable for evaluation of top and bottom layers respectively. This is due to a
difference in the basic evaluation method and the loading which generates different
magnitude wavelengths that give information on different depths of the pavement. So, if data
from these two methods are combined, a more accurate and complete pavement profile may
be obtained. Equipment such as seismic pavement analyzer, effectively employ this principle
(Abdallah et al. 2006).
The present paper has discussed about various methods available for NDE of an asphalt
pavement structure. A gradual shift can be noticed towards the usage of automatic equipment
and adoption of quick evaluation techniques as compared to the conventional ones.
A carefully chosen combination of different NDE methods can readily enhance the accuracy
and reliability in the evaluation of pavements.

The problem of backcalculation, i.e. inverse analysis is a complex one, and efforts are being made to evolve a generalised backcalculation approach (May and Von Quintus 1994) that can reach the solution quickly and accurately. Various approaches based on (i) closed formed solutions (Scrivner et al. 1973, Hall and Mohseni 1991, Advisory Circular, No.150/5370-11A 2004), (ii) database search (Anderson 1989, Chou and Lytton 1991), (iii) optimisation techniques (Bush and Alexander 1985, Sivaneswaran et al. 1991, Harichandran et al. 1993), (iv) regression equations (Ali and Khosla 1987, Mahoney et al. 1993, Roque et al. 1998), (v) evolutionary algorithms (Meier and Rix 1994a,b, Sharma and Das) and (vi) combination of these methods have been implemented for backcalculation of layer moduli. The difficulties faced by various backcalculation approaches may be summarised as follows (Sharma and Das): . The closed formed solutions can handle only limited and idealistic situations. . The regression methods are fast, but sometimes may give inaccurate results (Lenngren 1991). .

A simple approach to forward modeling of pavement structure is to idealise it as a horizontally layered, linearly elastic, isotropic and homogenous media. More complex forward analysis schemes can be developed by dropping these idealisations, thereby achieving closer approximation to the actual response. In fact, the seismic/ loading response of pavement structure is quite complex, and its modeling is itself a difficult task (Brown 1997). Asphalt layer is strongly sensitive to nature of loading (magnitude, frequency and duration) as well as temperature (Krishnan and Rajagopal 2003); whereas the elastic modulus of granular layer and subgrade is sensitive to stress conditions (Lekarp et al. 2000). The inverse approach involves deductive analysis for which an unconstrained optimisation scheme is applied to the acquired data (say, deflection) so as to estimate the desired properties (say, layer elastic moduli) of the pavement system. Thus, the inverse algorithm typically involves recursive calls to the forward analysis with some </context>

Basic principles of NDE techniques for asphalt pavements A number of NDE methods have been developed for evaluation of asphalt pavements. For in situ NDT of pavements, only the top surface is available. Thus, methods requiring access to two different surfaces of the pavement structure cannot be employed in this case (X-ray method, etc.). Laboratory techniques such as resonance column method and ultrasonic testing have been used to determine the seismic moduli for complimenting the evaluation procedure (Nazarian et al. 1999, Celaya and Nazarian 2007). These techniques can also be used for calibration of field NDT methods (Hammons et al. 2006). Many of the NDE methods involve implementation of forward approach for analysis and the inverse approach for interpretation. In forward approach, the system is idealised in the form of a model to study its physical response (say, deflection) due to some stimulus (say, force), when the properties of the pavement layers (say, layer elastic moduli) are assumed.

Since, the deflections are measured continuously, the statistical confidence is also good (Lee et al. 2006). Forward analysis approach which simulates the FWD loading can be divided into two broad categories, static analysis (Lytton 1989, Fwa 2006) and dynamic analysis (Roesset et al. 1994, Loizos et al. 2003, Loizos and Boukovalas 2005).

Depending on the type of FWD, 3 to 7 geophones are used to capture the deflection profile (Haas et al. 1994, Advisory Circular, No.150/5370-11A 2004). Load is measured by a load cell, and its variation may be used to evaluate the stress dependence of the layer modulus (Roesset 1998, Rahiom and George 2003, NCHRP Design Guide1-37A 2006). Since the stiffness of asphalt layer is affected by temperature, a suitable temperature correction factor needs to be applied to the observed deflection values to convert them to values at the standard temperature (Chen et al. 2000, Park et al. 2002). Some lighter versions of FWDs, called as light falling weight deflectometer, are also available in which the impact load is relatively small (Loizos et al. 2003, Goktepe et al. 2006). LFWD is generally found to be suitable for base and subgrade evaluation (Loizos et al. 2003, Alshibli et al. 2005, Loizos and Boukovalas 2005).

A geophone series measures the velocity of movement with respect to time, which on integration gives the deflection basin (Haas et al. 1994). Thus, the deflection measurement for these devices are free from influence of deflection bowl. However, test loading is harmonic and does not have any rest period. Hence, the loading condition is somewhat different (Fwa 2006) and the magnitude of load applied is also smaller (Ullidtz 1987) than the actual situation of in-service pavements. Also, a relatively large amount of pre-load is applied to the pavement which may adversely affect the accuracy of pavement response (Fwa 2006). 3.3 Transient impulse loading This method uses an impulsive transient load application to the pavement test-section and the deflection response is recorded at a series of radial points (ASTM D4694 2003).

This type of device is typically referred to as falling weight deflectometer (FWD) and is schematically shown in (figure 2). The amount of impact load, duration and the loading area is adjusted in such a way that it closely corresponds to the actual loading by a standard truck on in-service road (Sebaaly et al. 1991). The peak load is controlled by varying the falling mass, height of drop and the spring constant. The time of impulse load may vary between 0.025 and 0.30 s, and the applied load may vary between 4.45 and 156 kN (Bay and Stokoe 1998, Goktepe et al. 2006).

Deflection-basin methods In deflection-basin methods, vertical deflections at various points on the surface of the pavement test-section, due to an applied load, are measured. Type of the load applied may be static, steady state harmonic or transient impulse type (ASTM D2003). The measurement of deflection at the load point and at locations radially outwards from it, can be done with the help of a dial gauge/linear variable differential transformer, or by using velocity transducers (geophones) (Haas et al. 1994). Various types of deflection based NDE methods are discussed further in the following subsections. 3.1 Static loading method In this method, a static load is applied to the test section and its deflection is measured. Benkelman beam deflection (BBD) test is a simple and relatively inexpensive method under this category. Basic device in a BBD test consists of a lightweight frame to which a beam probe is attached alongwith a dial gauge (Zube and Forsyth 1966). BBD measures the deflection due to static loading of dual tyres of a loaded truck. Measurement process starts by placing the probe betwe</context>

The loading is generally applied Figure 1. A typical Bankelman beam deflectometer setup. 124 A. Goel and A. Das by counter rotating mass or electro-hydraulic system. The two trailer wheels equally distribute the vertical dynamic load to the pavement. A geophone series measures the velocity of movement with respect to time, which on integration gives the deflection basin (Haas et al. 1994). Thus, the deflection measurement for these devices are free from influence of deflection bowl. However, test loading is harmonic and does not have any rest period. Hence, the loading condition is somewhat different (Fwa 2006) and the magnitude of load applied is also smaller (Ullidtz 1987) than the actual situation of in-service pavements. Also, a relatively large amount of pre-load is applied to the pavement which may adversely affect the accuracy of pavement response (Fwa 2006). 3.3 Transient impulse loading This method uses an impulsive transient load application to the pavement test-sect</context>

The peak load is controlled by varying the falling mass, height of drop and the spring constant. The time of impulse load may vary between 0.025 and 0.30 s, and the applied load may vary between 4.45 and 156 kN (Bay and Stokoe 1998, Goktepe et al. 2006). Generally, the load pulses are of halfsine type and the loading area is a 30 cm diameter circular pad (Bay and Stokoe 1998). Velocity transducers Geophones record the deflection response. Depending on the type of FWD, 3 to 7 geophones are used to capture the deflection profile (Haas et al. 1994, Advisory Circular, No.150/5370-11A 2004). Load is measured by a load cell, and its variation may be used to evaluate the stress dependence of the layer modulus (Roesset 1998, Rahiom and George 2003, NCHRP Design Guide1-37A 2006). Since the stiffness of asphalt layer is affected by temperature, a suitable temperature correction factor needs to be applied to the observed deflection values to convert them to values at the standard temperature (Chen et al. 2000, Park et al. 2002). Some lighter versions of FWDs, called as light falling weight deflectometer, are also available in which the impact </context>

A simple approach to forward modeling of pavement structure is to idealise it as a horizontally layered, linearly elastic, isotropic and homogenous media. More complex forward analysis schemes can be developed by dropping these idealisations, thereby achieving closer approximation to the actual response. In fact, the seismic/ loading response of pavement structure is quite complex, and its modeling is itself a difficult task (Brown 1997). Asphalt layer is strongly sensitive to nature of loading (magnitude, frequency and duration) as well as temperature (Krishnan and Rajagopal 2003); whereas the elastic modulus of granular layer and subgrade is sensitive to stress conditions (Lekarp et al. 2000).

This problem is taken care of by the rolling dynamic deflectometer (RDD) where the vehicle moves at slow speed (of the order of 2.4 km/hr) and the deflection is continuously measured (Bay and Stokoe 1998, Goktepe et al. 2006) by rolling sensors. RDD also measures the deflection from inertial frame of reference, hence the error associated with the geometry of the road does not come into picture (Bay and Stokoe 1998, Bay et al. 2000). Since, the deflections are measured continuously, the statistical confidence is also good (Lee et al. 2006). Forward analysis approach which simulates the FWD loading can be divided into two broad categories, static analysis (Lytton 1989, Fwa 2006) and dynamic analysis (Roesset et al. 1994, Loizos et al. 2003, Loizos and Boukovalas 2005). The dynamic analysis is able to take into account the inertia effects, and loss of impact energy due to hysteresis and seismic wave radiation (Chang et al. 1992, Loizos et al. 2003). Researches (Roesset and Shao 1985, Chang et al. 1992, Uzan 1994) suggest that the use of static analysis may sometimes give erroneous results, especially when there exists a stiff bed</context>

The difficulties faced by various backcalculation approaches may be summarised as follows (Sharma and Das): . The closed formed solutions can handle only limited and idealistic situations. . The regression methods are fast, but sometimes may give inaccurate results (Lenngren 1991). . The methods based on conventional optimisation techniques take a long time to backcalculate the layer moduli (Harichandran et al. 1993). There are chances that the solution may converge to a local optimal point. Also, the convergence depends on the initial solution (seed values) chosen (Harichandran et al. 1993, May and Von Quintus 1994). . The approach based on artificial neural network (ANN) takes a long time for training data-sets and requires fresh training every time the input parameters change. Computation time in genetic algorithm (GA) based program is also large (Fwa et al. 1997, K</context>

Since the stiffness of asphalt layer is affected by temperature, a suitable temperature correction factor needs to be applied to the observed deflection values to convert them to values at the standard temperature (Chen et al. 2000, Park et al. 2002). Some lighter versions of FWDs, called as light falling weight deflectometer, are also available in which the impact load is relatively small (Loizos et al. 2003, Goktepe et al. 2006). LFWD is generally found to be suitable for base and subgrade evaluation (Loizos et al. 2003, Alshibli et al. 2005, Loizos and Boukovalas 2005). In heavy weight deflectometer (HWD) heavier load is used to simulate aircraft or other heavier vehicles (Turner et al. 2003). Major advantage of this technique is that it closely simulates the actual in-service pavement loading. Another benefit is that the road need not be closed to traffic during the test Figure 2.

RDD also measures the deflection from inertial frame of reference, hence the error associated with the geometry of the road does not come into picture (Bay and Stokoe 1998, Bay et al. 2000). Since, the deflections are measured continuously, the statistical confidence is also good (Lee et al. 2006). Forward analysis approach which simulates the FWD loading can be divided into two broad categories, static analysis (Lytton 1989, Fwa 2006) and dynamic analysis (Roesset et al. 1994, Loizos et al. 2003, Loizos and Boukovalas 2005). The dynamic analysis is able to take into account the inertia effects, and loss of impact energy due to hysteresis and seismic wave radiation (Chang et al. 1992, Loizos et al. 2003). Researches (Roesset and Shao 1985, Chang et al. 1992, Uzan 1994) suggest that the use of static analysis may sometimes give erroneous results, especially when there exists a stiff bedrock layer below the pavement at a shallow depth.

In a structural evaluation process, the primary objective is to estimate the structural strength. For asphalt pavements, it may be expressed in terms of in situ layer elastic moduli, layer thickness, inter-layer bond conditions and anomaly characterisation. A simple and direct evaluation method for layer properties estimation is by visual examination after digging pits or taking cores from the pavement, which are destructive methods. Dynamic cone penetrometer test can give a qualitative (and to some extent quantitative) estimation of layer thickness, though it has some limitations (Loizos and Plati 2007, Roy 2007) in terms of test-speed, error and subjectivity in testing. *Corresponding author.

Load is measured by a load cell, and its variation may be used to evaluate the stress dependence of the layer modulus (Roesset 1998, Rahiom and George 2003, NCHRP Design Guide1-37A 2006). Since the stiffness of asphalt layer is affected by temperature, a suitable temperature correction factor needs to be applied to the observed deflection values to convert them to values at the standard temperature (Chen et al. 2000, Park et al. 2002).

Basic principles of NDE techniques for asphalt pavements A number of NDE methods have been developed for evaluation of asphalt pavements. For in situ NDT of pavements, only the top surface is available. Thus, methods requiring access to two different surfaces of the pavement structure cannot be employed in this case (X-ray method, etc.). Laboratory techniques such as resonance column method and ultrasonic testing have been used to determine the seismic moduli for complimenting the evaluation procedure (Nazarian et al. 1999, Celaya and Nazarian 2007). These techniques can also be used for calibration of field NDT methods (Hammons et al. 2006). Many of the NDE methods involve implementation of forward approach for analysis and the inverse approach for interpretation. In forward approach, the system is idealised in the form of a model to study its physical response (say, deflection) due to some stimulus (say, force), when the properties of the pavement layers (say, layer elastic moduli) are assumed. A simple approach to forward modeling of pavement structure is to idealise it as a horizontally layered, linearly el</context>

For asphalt pavements, it may be expressed in terms of in situ layer elastic moduli, layer thickness, inter-layer bond conditions and anomaly characterisation. A simple and direct evaluation method for layer properties estimation is by visual examination after digging pits or taking cores from the pavement, which are destructive methods. Dynamic cone penetrometer test can give a qualitative (and to some extent quantitative) estimation of layer thickness, though it has some limitations (Loizos and Plati 2007, Roy 2007) in terms of test-speed, error and subjectivity in testing. *Corresponding author.

This type of device is typically referred to as falling weight deflectometer (FWD) and is schematically shown in (figure 2). The amount of impact load, duration and the loading area is adjusted in such a way that it closely corresponds to the actual loading by a standard truck on in-service road (Sebaaly et al. 1991). The peak load is controlled by varying the falling mass, height of drop and the spring constant. The time of impulse load may vary between 0.025 and 0.30 s, and the applied load may vary between 4.45 and 156 kN (Bay and Stokoe 1998, Goktepe et al. 2006). Generally, the load pulses are of halfsine type and the loading area is a 30 cm diameter circular pad (Bay and Stokoe 1998). Velocity transducers Geophones record the deflection response. Depending on the type of FWD, 3 to 7 geophones are used to capture the deflection profile (Haas et al. 1994, Advisory Circular, No.150/5370-11A 2004). Load</context>

Some lighter versions of FWDs, called as light falling weight deflectometer, are also available in which the impact load is relatively small (Loizos et al. 2003, Goktepe et al. 2006). LFWD is generally found to be suitable for base and subgrade evaluation (Loizos et al. 2003, Alshibli et al. 2005, Loizos and Boukovalas 2005). In heavy weight deflectometer (HWD) heavier load is used to simulate aircraft or other heavier vehicles (Turner et al. 2003). Major advantage of this technique is that it closely simulates the actual in-service pavement loading. Another benefit is that the road need not be closed to traffic during the test Figure 2.

The two trailer wheels equally distribute the vertical dynamic load to the pavement. A geophone series measures the velocity of movement with respect to time, which on integration gives the deflection basin (Haas et al. 1994). Thus, the deflection measurement for these devices are free from influence of deflection bowl. However, test loading is harmonic and does not have any rest period. Hence, the loading condition is somewhat different (Fwa 2006) and the magnitude of load applied is also smaller (Ullidtz 1987) than the actual situation of in-service pavements. Also, a relatively large amount of pre-load is applied to the pavement which may adversely affect the accuracy of pavement response (Fwa 2006). 3.3 Transient impulse loading This method uses an impulsive transient load application to the pavement test-section and the deflection response is recorded at a series of radial points (ASTM D4694 2003).

Since, the deflections are measured continuously, the statistical confidence is also good (Lee et al. 2006). Forward analysis approach which simulates the FWD loading can be divided into two broad categories, static analysis (Lytton 1989, Fwa 2006) and dynamic analysis (Roesset et al. 1994, Loizos et al. 2003, Loizos and Boukovalas 2005). The dynamic analysis is able to take into account the inertia effects, and loss of impact energy due to hysteresis and seismic wave radiation (Chang et al. 1992, Loizos et al. 2003). Researches (Roesset and Shao 1985, Chang et al. 1992, Uzan 1994) suggest that the use of static analysis may sometimes give erroneous results, especially when there exists a stiff bedrock layer below the pavement at a shallow depth.

Various types of deflection based NDE methods are discussed further in the following subsections. 3.1 Static loading method In this method, a static load is applied to the test section and its deflection is measured. Benkelman beam deflection (BBD) test is a simple and relatively inexpensive method under this category. Basic device in a BBD test consists of a lightweight frame to which a beam probe is attached alongwith a dial gauge (Zube and Forsyth 1966). BBD measures the deflection due to static loading of dual tyres of a loaded truck. Measurement process starts by placing the probe between the rear dual wheels of the test vehicle (figure 1). Initial dial gauge reading is recorded. The truck is made to move away by a specified distance and as the rebound rate of pavement surface falls below a specified level, intermediate reading is taken. Truck is again made to move further away and the final reading is taken. Such an approach is adopted as an attempt to reduce/nullify the influence of deflection bowl on the readings (Haas et al. 1994, Chak</context>
