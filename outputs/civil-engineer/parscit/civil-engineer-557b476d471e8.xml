ABSRRACT: In order to solve the traffic congestion problems around Nantou area,
the roadway network should be completely reviewed, especially for the National
Highway 3’s interchange system. The key assess is the Zucih bridge located at the
edge of the Nantou city with the station 228K+500 on the National Freeway 3. Well
constructed interchange system will definitely improve the traffic congestion
problem in Nantou City. After that the Nantou County will possess the advantages
for developing the industrious field. The purpose of this study is to conduct a
quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefit-cost analysis of the construction project in
order to evaluate the economic benefits of the location and route of the Nantou
interchange. To do this, benefit-cost ratio(B/C) and net present value(NPV) will be
used as quantifiable indicators, while for non-quantifiable indicators (such as land
value, property value, and commerce benefits) more concrete figures will be used
when possible in order to fully understand the economic benefits of this project.
Further steps were taken to analyze the feasibility of the proposed construction. The
findings of our research are to be used to contribute to the project’s construction
team.

INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.961400714285714">
Construction on the National Highway 3 began in 1987, and in 2004 it was open
for use. Running through northern and southern Nantou, the highway plays an
important role as a transportation thorough way throughout the area. However,
after opening the thorough way to traffic use, it was found that the unsatisfactory
location of certain sections of the interchange brought considerable inconveniences
to road users.
Nantou City currently uses the Nantou interchange to join National Freeway 3, but
due to the interchange’s location in the northern most regions of Nantou City, city
traffic must first travel by way of Provincial Highway 3 in order to join the
interchange. Also, because the Nan Kung Industrial Zone is located in the most
northern region on the west side of the Provincial Highway 3, the highway is
frequently accessed by large vehicles. Therefore, during peak commuting hours, the
Nantou interchange and the surrounding roads often experience congestion. In

particular, Provincial Highway 3 and the Zhongxing Rd. section of Provincial
Highway 14B experience the worst congestion. Therefore, in order to solve the
traffic problems in and around Nantou City and make a more complete road system
in the Nantou living area, it is in necessary to review National Highway 3 and the
Nantou area interchange system.
This study’s economic benefit analysis is current to the year 2007 with 2040 set as
the target year and 2023 as the intermediate period. Its purpose is to provide an
economic benefit analysis of the feasibility of constructing an additional interchange
to directly link Nantou District roads to National Highway 3 so as to provide a fast
and convenient transportation system in the Nantou Region, as well as consider the
project of connecting East Min Rd and Jhongjheng Rd. with Zucih bridge to allow
the future transportation network to form a complete system (see Fig.1).

This economic assessment uses benefit-cost analysis to monetize and compare the
costs and benefits of the project, and seeks to understand the economic feasibility of
the implementation plan through assessment indicators such as net present value
(NPV), and benefit-cost ratio (B/C) (Greene and Wegener, 1997).

Net Present Value
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998253714285714">
Net present value is a convenient and widely used method for assessing public
construction investment projects because it takes into account the time value of
money as well as the cost and benefit of the project’s entire lifespan. During the
assessment period, the difference between the present value of the total benefit
stream and the present value of the total cost stream is measured (Luis and Luis,
2008). When the benefit is greater than the cost, the investment plan is conducive to
the use of social resources. The method of calculation is as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.941825166666666">
n
NPV = ∑
t =0
Bt − Ct
............................................................................................................(1)
(1 + i )t
The formula, NPV = net present value
Bt = benefits of the period t years
Ct = cost of the period t years
n = assessment years
i = discount rate
Benefit-Cost Ratio
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997964333333333">
The benefit-cost ratio uses the difference between the net present value of the
benefits and the net present value of the costs as an analytical assessment of the
feasibility of the project. When the benefit-cost ratio (B/C) value is greater than 1,
the investment is economically feasible. The larger the ratio is the better. If the B/C
value is less than 1, then the investment is not worth it (Boardman et al, 1996;
Getzner, 2008). The formula for the benefit-cost ratio is as follows:

Economic Benefit Assessment

<bodyText confidence="0.958690142857143">
The construction of the ramp in Nantou City and the Zucih bridge, in addition to
enhancing the performance of transport outside of Nantou, can also effectively
improve transport accessibility in the Nantou area and therefore can lead to overall
area development. However, discount rate, assessment period, inflation trend, etc.
must first be considered (Wang and Luo, 2010; Roberts and Goodwin 2002).
Discount Rate
Discount rate is used to convert the costs and benefits of different years into a
monetary value of the base year. Usually, depending on the investment preferences of
investors, the interest rate of investment and other factors, the discount rate varies.
Therefore the market interest rate is usually used as a reference to calculate the
discount rate. In recent years, with continuous adjustment of the central bank deposit
rate, government bond interest rates have continued to weaken, which should reduce
the discount rate. After having economically evaluated the construction project, the
government will generally, in view of the results, decide whether or not to promote a
specific construction project or decide which projects to promote first. Thus, this
study, with reference to the discount rate, should be considered with an assessment of
general transport investment and from a consistent standpoint (Sáez and Requena,
2007). Based on this, a 5.0% discount rate will be used for the relevant assessment.
Using the 2007 currency value, the total benefits and costs were analyzed
according to discount rates at 1%, 3%, 5%, 8%, 11%, 14% and 17% (see Table 6.1
below).

Having summarized above the cost of building an additional interchange and a
linking road(main construction costs including engineering design, land acquisition
and compensation for demolition, construction, etc.) and of improving the efficiency
estimates (travel time saving benefits, travel cost saving benefits, cost saving benefits
etc.) according to net present value, benefit-cost ratio, and other indicators, further
research into the feasibility, as well as the merits, of implementing the building
project is necessary. The criteria for determining the assessment indicators are as
follows:

<bodyText confidence="0.99876125">
In this research summary, the project to build an on and off ramp is estimated at
NT$1 billion, which, when compared to the original plan, would save NT$1.5 billion.
However, the required future annual maintenance cost is estimated to be more and
this does not include the increase in travel cost due to diverting southbound traffic.

Sensitivity Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9985616">
In view of the above assumed factors of economic benefit analysis, there still
exists many uncertainties. Therefore, this study conducted a sensitivity analysis of
the variables (factors such as the construction cost, land acquisition cost, operating
cost, inflation cost, discount rate, time value of money, travel cost and the time value
of goods) which could possibly affect the assessment results in order to understand
how a change in each factor could affect the economic benefit analysis (Helton et al.
2006). Overall, while conducting an analysis of the affects of variations in variables,
if the change in a factor does not affect the possibility of plan implementation, then
this factor can be considered stable and controllable. Otherwise, a risk management
assessment should be carried out on those that are not stable and controllable.
Discount rate changes in the sensitivity analysis
The higher the discount rate, the higher the cost of investment, and the lower the
economic benefits of investment. This project is feasible at a discount rate under
17%. However, at a 17% discount rate the NPV would be NT$40.8 million, and all
economic indicators show the project to be infeasible (see Table 6.3 below).

Net Present Value Net present value is a convenient and widely used method for assessing public construction investment projects because it takes into account the time value of money as well as the cost and benefit of the project’s entire lifespan. During the assessment period, the difference between the present value of the total benefit stream and the present value of the total cost stream is measured (Luis and Luis, 2008). When the benefit is greater than the cost, the investment plan is conducive to the use of social resources. The method of calculation is as follows: n NPV = ∑ t =0 Bt − Ct ............................................................................................................(1) (1 + i )t The formula, NPV = net present value Bt = benefits of the period t years Ct = cost of the period t years n = assessment years i = discount rate Benefit-Cost Ratio The benefit-cost ratio uses the difference between the net present value of the benefits and the net present value of the costs as an analyti</context>
