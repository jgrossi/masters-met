Treatment of soft ground by Fibredrain and highenergy impact in highway embankment construction
S. L. LEE and G. P. KARUNARATNE
Department of Civil Engineering, National University of Singapore
The economic growth of a country depends significantly
on its transportation system. The highways that form part
of this system sometimes pass over compressible soft soil
deposits. Two major geotechnical problems associated
with the construction of road embankments on these soil
deposits are stability during construction and long-term
settlement. If the latter problem is not addressed adequately, excessive post-construction settlement will have
serious consequences for the maintenance of road pavement, in addition to the unwarranted downdrag force
(negative skin friction) and lateral pressure on the piles
supporting the bridge abutments and ancillary structures.
To mitigate these adverse effects, deep-seated saturated
clays are pre-consolidated with Fibredrain, a vertical drain
manufactured with biodegradable jute and coir fibre, and
surcharge, and surface deposits of granular, clayey or peaty
materials are treated by high-energy impact (HEI) application to enforce settlement and improve their bearing
capacity. If post-construction secondary compression is
significant it can be reduced by placing a higher surcharge
than required for primary consolidation. Because of their
cost-effectiveness these techniques have been and are
being used in several soil improvement projects in the
Southeast Asian region. Details of the treatment, the
properties of and design procedure for Fibredrains, and
the application of HEI are discussed.

Introduction
Construction on soft ground is a major problem in civil
engineering. If the ground is untreated it is not uncommon
for the construction machinery to get bogged down, and
bearing capacity or slope failure may occur because of
inadequate soil strength. Both short-term and long-term
settlement may occur, causing severe maintenance problems
for highway engineers. Differential settlement between
bridges on piled foundations and approach embankments
may inconvenience and endanger motorists as well as other
road users. Problems arising from floods and droughts also
need attention, because they can cause severe distortion in

L’expansion e´conomique d’un pays est tributaire, dans une

the embankment due to swelling or shrinking of expansive
soils.
Excessive settlement due to the construction of embankments over soft clay is best dealt with by pre-consolidating
the clay until the anticipated settlement under the design
load is enforced to an acceptable level. Fibredrains, a vertical
drain manufactured with biodegradable jute and coir fibres,
are installed from a sand platform into the compressible clay
deposit at a spacing designed to achieve the desired degree of
consolidation within the project duration under the predetermined surcharge intensity. If post-construction secondary
compression is significant, it can be reduced by placing a
higher surcharge than required for primary consolidation.
Surface deposits with low shear strength and stiffness can
be treated cost-effectively by the application of high-energy
impact (HEI) to enforce settlement and improve bearing

capacity. HEI application consists of dropping a heavy
pounder, ranging normally from 10 t to 40 t, from a height
usually of about 10–25 m via a platform of granular fill.
Variations of this method are useful for treating surface
deposits of loose granular soil by dynamic compaction (DC),
soft clayey soil by dynamic replacement (DR), and peaty
clay by dynamic replacement and mixing (DRM). By tamping the ground in a regular grid pattern, settlement is
enforced on the underlying soft soils, leading to densification in sandy soils and reinforcement in clayey deposits.
Fibredrains with surcharge and HEI application have been
used separately or in combination in several soil improvement projects in the Southeast Asian region. The sequence of
soil treatment is shown schematically in Fig. 1. Details of
treatment, improved ground conditions and mitigation of
long-term settlements are discussed in subsequent sections.

<bodyText confidence="0.999425692307692">
The settlement in the subsoil under the embankment
loading consists of two parts: primary and secondary compression, especially if the subsoil is composed of clay of
volcanic or highly compressible peaty origin. The primary
compression can be eliminated by pre-consolidating the clay
with Fibredrains and surcharge before the construction of
the pavement. The secondary component, which leads to
post-construction settlement, should be kept within the
tolerable limits of maintenance. If excessive, a greater
portion of secondary compression can be eliminated by
placing a surcharge higher than that required for primary
consolidation settlement.

The existing effective overburden pressure ó 09 , the critical

recompression index Cr to virgin compression index Cc , and
the final effective stress ó f9 at the end of the consolidation

be displayed at ó f9 as a creep phenomenon is obtained from
the coefficient of secondary compression CÆ ¼ ˜e/log(ts /tp ),
where ˜e is the reduction in void ratio at constant ó f9 over
the time period between tp , the end of primary consolidation, and ts , the time at which compression is calculated.
The total settlement äT under one-dimensional compression
can be evaluated in terms of void ratio reduction in the soil by
Selection of consolidation parameters
The accuracy of settlement computation depends on the
evaluation of an accurate stress distribution and the estimation of realistic field properties of the subsoil. Most consolidation properties determined in the laboratory are
subject to sampling disturbance, which causes changes in
the soil properties such that the values of Cc and ó c9 are
usually underestimated (Hansbo, 1987). The laboratory
curve of e against log p9 curve also tends to move towards
the void ratio axis, reducing the values of ó c9 and Cc . The
value of Cr may also change.
Work done on carefully taken block samples and piston
samples by Holtz et al. (1986) indicated that the laboratory
determined critical pressure, ó c9l , and the actual field value,
ó c9f , may vary considerably.
In a highway project, because of its wide coverage over
many different types of soil, a vast amount of soil data will
be collected. They should be statistically analysed, compared
with other available data on similar soils, and the most
probable parameters evaluated and adopted. Trends in
attaching significance of the natural water content of a clay
soil to the soil properties are shown in Fig. 3(a) for the
variation of Cc and in Fig. 3(b) for CÆ /(1 + e0 ) against natural
water content (Mesri and Rokshar, 1974).
For low embankment heights the settlement in the
primary range will be confined mainly to the recompression
zone. Settlement will also occur at these heights at a much
faster rate owing to the larger Cv (coefficient of consolidation
with vertical flow) in the clay in the recompression zone. For
higher embankments and in thicker deposits of underlying

Properties of Fibredrain

<bodyText confidence="0.989776236842105">
Most prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) are manufactured with a polymeric core and a geotextile filter sleeve.
Fibredrain, a PVD developed at the National University of
Singapore, consists of four axial coir strands enveloped
within a filter comprising two layers of jute burlap (Lee et al.,
1995). Jute in raw form, after preliminary treatment, is spun
into yarns and woven into burlap, which is used for the two
filter layers. Coconut coir used in the core is spun into strands
after preliminary processing. Figs 4 and 5 show respectively a
bale of Fibredrains delivered on site and a schematic view of
Fibredrain. It has shown satisfactory performance in many
projects in Southeast Asia and Japan involving the treatment
of soft marine and fluvial clays, as well as peaty clays, and in
some cases in conjunction with surface densification using
the application of high-energy impact (HEI).
From the environmental point of view, the energy consumption of jute and coir products in the production, transformation and utilisation/disposal stages is much lower than that of
synthetic products (De, 1994). The raw materials for the
production of Fibredrain are natural fibres extracted from jute
plants and ripened coconuts, both of which are renewable
resources. Jute plants and coconut trees grow in soil with
nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and trace elements, as
well as water, sunlight and carbon dioxide. No air pollutants
or water pollutants are generated during this process. The
production of jute fibres and coconut coir is labour intensive,
requiring land and manpower as the main inputs. The solid
waste generated during the production and utilisation/dis-
Fig. 4. Bale of Fibredrains and anchor shoes
posal stages is basically organic and biodegradable, and in
some instances is reusable as building materials. When used
in stabilising soft subsoil, Fibredrain decomposes biologically
after the consolidation process. The decomposed products are
organic wastes with traces of methane and carbon dioxide,
which are non-polluting. It is a green product, environmentally friendly and ecologically harmonious. Some of the
laboratory tests conducted to examine the properties of
Fibredrain are reported in the following; further details can be
found in Karunaratne et al. (1999).

after exposure for 50 days outdoors, and after consolidation
in Ariake clay for 126 days (Miura et al., 1995b). The tensile
strength ranged from 8.96 kN (916 kg), 8.45 kN (860 kg), and
7.56 kN (771 kg) to 2.04 kN (208 kg) for the respective cases.
The strength deterioration with time in the Ariake clay
shows the biodegradability of the fibres. It should be pointed
out that the deterioration in strength does not imply a
reduction in drainage capacity, as observed in the Pantai
Mutiara reclamation project in Jakarta, Indonesia (see
below), where Fibredrains performed satisfactorily for more
than two years (Lee et al., 1988). Because of the high tensile
strength (6.8 kN with 8.7% strain at rupture), robustness and
flexibility of the core and the jute filter layers, Fibredrain can
withstand installation stresses, and high-energy tamping
while retaining its drainage functions unimpaired. As the
mandrel is driven into the ground during the installation
process, soils intrude into the mandrel through the interface
between the mandrel and the anchor shoe, and develop
significant tensile forces in the PVD as the mandrel is
withdrawn. In recent field measurements of installation
stresses on plastic PVDs, a tensile force of 1.4 kN on the
filter was recorded at an installation depth of 30 m
(Karunaratne et al., 2002). It is imperative that the PVD
should possess sufficient tensile strength to withstand these
tensile forces.
The large apparent opening size (AOS) of Fibredrains, in
the range 200–600 ìm, serves to tap pervious layers and
lenses in clay deposits. The double filter layer, which has a
smaller effective AOS, intercepts the clay slurry generated
immediately after installation of the Fibredrain in the clay as
the mandrel is withdrawn. The cross-plane permeability of
the filter was measured under a constant head across a stack
of four identical burlaps fastened across an open end of a
circular cylinder (Lee et al., 1994). The cross-plane filter
permeability determined in this way for clean water was
better than 10À5 m/s. This is equivalent to the hydraulic
conductivity of fine sand, which helps in tapping natural
drainage layers such as sand and silt seams, lenses and other
pervious paths. Clay slurry with water content from 65% to
600% was passed through the four burlap layers mentioned
above under a pressure head of 0.5 m of water. About 2 l of
marine clay slurry at a water content of 260–600% flowed
out within 15 min. For Singapore marine clay (wL ¼ 70%) at
a water content of 65%, the passage of water was slower but
clear from the beginning.
This scenario is similar to the field installation stage of
PVDs as the mandrel is withdrawn, when disturbed slurry
clay under high water pressure tends to rush through the
filter into the core. The four burlap filter layers were
removed carefully and cleaned in an ultrasonic agitator to
extract the clay embedded in each burlap layer separately.
Gravimetric analysis showed that soil particles were retained
on the outermost burlap layer and the immediately adjacent
inner layer, but no particles were detected in the third or
fourth burlap layers (Fig. 7(a)). The water passing through
the four burlap layers was examined and found to be
similarly free of any soil particles (Lee et al., 1994). The

retention of soil particles on the two burlap layers under
axial permeability testing with marine clay at 65% water
content is shown in Fig. 7(b).
This study shows that clay near the liquid limit will not
enter the drain core during the installation process or the
consolidation process, but will instead be retained by the
two burlap layers. It is evident from this series of tests that
the AOS of the burlap filter layers need not be too small to
prevent clay intrusion into the core, but a larger AOS of the
order of 200–600 ìm is beneficial in tapping pervious seams
and lenses in clay deposits.
Kinking
Miura et al. (1995a) compared the effective coefficient of
consolidation, Ch , of Fibredrain (FD) and a plastic drain
identified as PD in Ariake clay (wL ¼ 86–97%, Ip ¼ 48–54%,
wN ¼ 105–34%, Gs ¼ 2.59–2.62) by installing them separately in consolidation cells 500 mm in diameter and 500 mm
high. On back-analysis, at consolidation pressures of 98 kPa
and 294 kPa, the effective Ch was found to be 1.35 m2 /yr
and 2.19 m2 /yr with PD, and 9.2 m2 /yr and 10.7 m2 /yr with
Fibredrain respectively. Figs 8 and 9 show the deformed
shapes of the two drains after carefully removing the clay
around the drains at the end of consolidation (Miura et al.,
1995b; Aboshi et al., 2001).
The PD has deformed significantly, resulting in kinking
and decreased axial drainage capacity. The deformation of
Fibredrain, on the other hand, was confined largely to an
increase in the thickness and longitudinal compression of
the drain without kinking. Axial compression in the Fibredrain is manifested largely as an increase in cross-sectional
area, mainly because of the unwinding characteristics of jute
fibres in both the filter layer and the core. The resulting
increase in cross-sectional area and the decrease in filter
opening size enhance the unclogged water flow into the
drain. The above experimental results show that the effective
Ch of the same clay under the same consolidation pressures
is a function of the performance of different PVDs. Aboshi et
al. (2001) reported the consolidation of Hiroshima clay (wL ¼
49%, wP ¼ 21%, CC ¼ 0.36, PC ¼ 300 kPa) at 15 m depth and
clay from Kojima Bay, Japan (wL ¼ 64%, wP ¼ 22%, CC ¼
0.53, PC ¼ 78 kPa) in 300 mm diameter laboratory consolidation cells with Fibredrain and PD. Pore pressure measurements in the Fibredrain test showed zero excess pore
pressure at the end of primary consolidation, whereas the
PD test showed 5 m of water head remaining at respective
axial strains of 24% and 19%. The measurement of axial
permeability at the end of the test was reported to be 7 3
10À9 m/s for Fibredrain and zero for PD, illustrating the
effect of kinking. Examination of the drain materials after
the tests showed that Fibredrain had increased its thickness
without kinking, whereas the PD had developed three to
four kinks, which completely curtailed the axial flow
capacity, as shown in Fig. 9.

To evaluate the discharge capacity of Fibredrain a 200 mm
long specimen was installed at the centre of a 100 mm
diameter cylinder of Singapore marine clay (wN ¼ 65%, wL
¼ 70%, wP ¼ 40%). A coarse sand layer, 10 mm thick, was
provided at both ends of the clay cylinder, which was
enclosed within a large-diameter triaxial membrane. The
discharge capacity was measured by connecting the drainage ends to a constant-head tank. The lateral pressure was
increased in stages, and the volume change in the clay

discharge capacity under each pressure (Karunaratne et al.,

Koerner (1997) suggested that Q9 be determined from
short-term laboratory tests in accordance with ASTM D4716
(1991). In equation (9) Fi represents the reduction factor due
to intrusion of the filter into the core space (Fi ¼ 1.5–2.5); Fd
is due to creep deformation of the core (Fd ¼ 1.0–2.5); Fc
refers to chemical clogging of the filter and core space (Fc ¼
1.0–1.2); Fb is due to biological clogging of the filter and core
space (Fb ¼ 1.0–1.2); and Fk is due to kinking of the PVD
under axial deformation caused by the compression of the
clay layer (Fk ¼ 1.0–4.0).
Referring to equation (9), kinking is not a problem for
Fibredrain, and hence Fk for Fibredrain is close to 1.0. For
short duration projects Fc is low, or close to 1.0 (Koerner,
1997). Mlynarek (1998) and Mlynarek and Rollin (1995) have
reported that biological clogging is not a problem if the
apparent opening size (AOS) is large. The AOS of Fibredrain
is in the range 200–600 ìm when measured individually:
hence Fb for Fibredrain is 1.0. The reduction factors due to
deformation of the core and intrusion of the filter into the
core space, Fi 3 Fd , due to lateral pressure, have been taken
into account in the testing procedure.

Design of soil improvement
In the design of soil improvement work using Fibredrain,
Sf can be estimated from the results obtained from soil
investigation and design loads. The value of Qr can be
obtained from Fig. 10(b) as a function of Sf for various
values of influence diameter D and the effective Ch and
compared with the discharge flow capacity given in Fig.
10(a), which depends on the lateral pressure corresponding
to the depth of installation and the design load and
surcharge. The hydraulic gradient set up along the PVD
Treatment of soft ground in highway embankment construction
may be estimated by the intensity of the design load and
surcharge in terms of metres of water divided by the length
of the flow path along the drain.
The design of spacing to achieve a certain degree of
primary consolidation, say 80% under surcharge, which is
equivalent to 100% primary consolidation under design
load, within a prescribed time is determined, as usual, by
means of equation (3) using the influence diameter D and
effective Ch determined from Fig. 10b. For example, under a
lateral pressure of 200 kPa, i ¼ 0.5 and a settlement Sf equal
to 2 m, the effective Ch is 5 m2 /yr with an influence
diameter of 1.5 m. The time of consolidation by equation (3)
corresponding to U ¼ 80%, Sf ¼ 2 m, Ch ¼ 5 m2 /yr and D ¼
1.5 m is t ¼ 84 days. It should be emphasised that the time
of consolidation cannot be reduced by decreasing D because
this leads to larger QR , which will be greater than the
effective discharge capacity of the drain under the lateral
pressure and hydraulic gradient. In most cases the effective
Ch is smaller than the Ch of the soil determined in the
laboratory (Rowe, 1968; Head, 1985). If the latter is smaller,
it should be used in equation (3) to determine the time of
consolidation.
Back-analysis of field settlement–time data obtained in
Singapore marine clay using a plastic PVD (Choa et al., 1979)
showed effective Ch values in the range 2–10 m2 /yr. Figs
10(a) and 10(b) show that for i ¼ 0.5 and a lateral pressure of
200 kPa, the values of effective Ch corresponding to settlements of 3, 2 and 1 m are 3, 5 and 7 m2 /yr respectively.
(Lee et al., 1984) produced sand columns and sand claquage
within the peat when increased pounding energy was
applied directly on the sand columns. This technique,
described as dynamic replacement and mixing (DRM), has
been able to eliminate overall settlement, including a large
percentage of the long-term secondary components.
The principle of successful implementation of HEI application lies in recognising the most appropriate energy levels
to be used. The earlier approach of using empiricism based
on field operation is complemented by a more rational
approach of determining the enforced settlement, which is a
function of the imposed stress from the structure to be built
upon the soil and the soil modulus or compressibility. Lo et
al. (1990) showed that there is a unique relationship between
the saturation intensity applied through HEI and the
enforced settlement. Fig. 11 shows the enforced settlement
upon application of HEI energy in various projects worldwide. It can be seen that for every site (depending upon the
soil characteristics and geometric configuration, involving
depth, water table and stratification) there is a saturated
intensity Is beyond which further HEI application produces
no tangible results in terms of settlement. Fig. 12 illustrates
the operational parameters in HEI application, namely the

Because of the large extent of highways over a variety of
site conditions, varying subsoil material may be encountered, ranging from cohesive to granular soil, including
organic peat in waterlogged ground, and waste material
from mine areas and landfills. The deep-seated clay soil can
be treated with Fibredrains and surcharge. For surface
deposits, the application of high-energy impact (HEI) has
been successfully employed in several projects in this region
(Choa et al., 1979; Lee et al., 1989) and elsewhere (Lukas,
1986).
When improving in situ soil deposits by HEI, one of the
physical limitations usually met is the depth. With standard
HEI techniques it is generally not economical or practical to
reach depths exceeding 5–7 m below the ground surface for
clay or 8–l0 m below the ground surface for sand. When the
type of soil to be improved varies, it is customary to change
the improvement technique. With HEI application the
method and equipment remain essentially the same, but
allowance is made in the application of the energy level and
intensity.
HEI application consists of dropping a heavy pounder
ranging from l0 to 40 t from a height, usually about 10–
25 m, via a platform of granular fill. To treat loose granular
deposits dynamic compaction (DC) was used effectively for
more than three decades (Menard and Broise, 1975; Ramaswamy et al., 1979). In the case of soft clay it is found to be
ineffective when used alone on saturated soft clay as the
pore pressure dissipation is governed only by the permeability of the clay (Choa et al., 1979). For partly saturated
cohesive soil it is found to be quite effective (Ramaswamy et
al., 1979). When the clay is soft and saturated, sand columns
can be formed with HEI by systematically punching sand
into the clay. This method, known as dynamic replacement
(DR), has been used successfully even in a gap-graded sandy
soil (Lee et al., 1984). An adaptation of DR for peaty clay

number of drops at one location and the number of phases
used are the other operational parameters in a given project

For soft clay deposits exceeding about 5–7 m in depth,
long-term consolidation settlement can be accelerated by
Fibredrains and surcharge. In the approach of this scheme,
shown in Fig. 1, in which Fibredrains are installed at
predetermined spacing, a granular mat 1–2 m thick is placed
on the ground and HEI is applied at an appropriate energy
level to improve the surface deposits. The embankment is
constructed, according to the specifications, by increasing
the height progressively, based on the newly improved
strength of the soil. If the degree of consolidation at time t
under an embankment fill load is Ut , then the prevailing clay
strength is given by

where Su0 is the original undrained shear strength of the

depth, ç is the relevant stress distribution coefficient, and ì
is the ratio of undrained shear strength to effective stress of

checked based on the improved strength of the clay before
raising the fill height further.

<bodyText confidence="0.99916680952381">
Following the decision to install Fibredrains and surcharge
to accelerate consolidation of the underlying soft clay, and
subsequently use HEI application for surface as well as fill
compaction, the suitability of Fibredrains to withstand HEI
was checked in several projects; otherwise the drain would
be ruptured and its continuity impaired. As shown in Fig. 1,
a working platform for the installation machines should be
made with a suitable material available with fines less than
10% for a minimum of 50 cm in thickness. The drains should
terminate in this sandy platform.
For HEI application, if required, a similar working platform is adequate except that the thickness should be increased to about 1–1.5 m. Based on the anticipated
settlement under the embankment and the modulus of the
subsoil, the energy level to be used will be determined. With
the progress of HEI more sand will be added and finally the
surcharge fill is placed in accordance with the drain design.
The construction of the embankment follows afterwards. A
suitable material should be selected; highly swelling minerals should be avoided in order to prevent excessive absorption of water within the embankment during wet weather
and shrinkage during dry weather, which might result in
distress in the pavement. In the event that the use of such
materials is unavoidable, then they should be shielded from
fluctuations of the water table and from flooding.

a spacing of 1.1 m and sand drains at 2.5 m spacing for
comparative assessment. A considerable excess pore pressure remained in the clay at the end of 8 months in the sand
drain area (Aboshi, 1999).
Figure 13 shows the monitoring results of piezometers
installed in the clay in the Fibredrain area at El. À9.2 m,
À12.5 m and À19 m, where the clay occurs between El.
À8.5 m and À25 m. Piezometers were also installed at
El. À10.6 m, À13.6 m, À16.6 m, À19.6 m and À22.6 m within
the Fibredrain core to investigate the well resistance. Within
the same 8-month period, the piezometers in the Fibredrain
core showed only an excess pore pressure not exceeding
10 kPa, indicating that well resistance was insignificant and
the axial flow capacity was more than adequate.
Treatment of ex-mining land Near Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia
The use of vertical drains and surcharge in conjunction
with HEI application for the treatment of ex-mining land for
a housing project (Lee et al., 1989) is briefly presented. A safe
bearing pressure of 60 kN/m2 with a factor of safety of 2.5
was necessary for this project. The site, near Kuala Lumpur,
is composed of mine tailing soils consisting of loose sandy
deposits to very soft clayey soils. Soil profiles from typical
borehole log show that N values are less than 2 blows/30 cm
in clays and between 2 and 10 blows/30 cm in sands.
The construction commenced with placing a working
platform with selected fill materials containing fines less
than 10%. To treat the deep-seated clay, varying from 9 m to
21 m, Fibredrains were first installed at 1.5 m square spacing, followed by the application of HEI from a 15 t pounder
falling freely from heights of between 10 m and 25 m. With 6
to 12 blows per pass for three passes, over a 6 m 3 6 m grid
together with a fourth ‘ironing pass’, energy of 225–250
t m/m2 for DC was imparted in the sandy areas and 270–
335 t m/m2 for DR in the clayey deposits. A surcharge fill of

and was found to taper off in 60–70 days. Fig. 14(a) shows
the load–time–settlement curve for the surcharge as observed in three settlement plates. Fibredrains and surcharge
combined with HEI enforced an anticipated total settlement
of the order of 1 m. Fig. 14b illustrates the improvement
shown by CPT before and after the HEI application. Plate
load tests carried out subsequently showed negligible settlement.
This case record shows that using vertical drains, surcharge and HEI application, a safe bearing capacity adequate
for five-storey residential houses can be easily achieved. For
highway embankment construction this treatment method
can be easily adopted.
Peaty soil treatment in Singapore
A series of field trials was conducted for evaluating the
feasibility of stabilising the peaty clay and fluvial clay at the
Bishan Depot site of the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit
System (Lee et al., 1984). Techniques involving surcharge
only, vertical drains and surcharge, and the dynamic
replacement and mixing (DRM) method of HEI application
were investigated. In Zone B of the site, designated for
DRM, some 7.8 m of peaty clay was underlain by 5.6 m of
fluvial clay. Fibredrains were installed at 2.2 m square
spacing from a 1 m thick sand blanket to improve the deepseated fluvial clay. Afterwards, HEI application was used in
treating the upper layer of peaty clay.

The HEI application consisted in dropping a 15 t pounder
from a height of 15–20 m. Four passes were completed, on
an 8 m 3 8 m grid system, the last two passes being in
between the previous print locations. The first two passes
resulted in the formation of sand columns about 4 m long,
tapering from an average diameter of 4 m at the surface to
2 m at the base. The third and fourth passes formed sand
columns at intermediate locations and compacted the peaty
clay in a three-dimensional confinement effected by the
vertical sand columns and horizontal sand blanket at the
surface. The fifth pass was the DRM phase, involving a 15 t
pounder dropped from a height of 20 m with 35 blows per
print. This action resulted in widespread replacement and
mixing of the in situ peaty clay with sand charges.
The ground, after treatment, was effectively transformed
into a stiff sand raft with pockets of peaty sand 3.2 m thick,
followed by 4.5 m of sandy peat. The properties of the peaty
soil, such as natural water content wN ¼ 137%, undrained
shear strength Cu ¼ 14 kN/m2 and modulus E ¼ 1.6 MN/
m2 , were improved to w ¼ 115%, Cu ¼ 17 kN/m2 and E ¼

had a modulus of E ¼ 13.7 MN/m2 .
A surcharge equivalent to 3.7 m of well-rolled clayey sand
fill was placed subsequently for verification. Fig. 15 shows
the observed settlement, along with the predicted settlement
based on the improved properties. Comparison with other
treatment methods carried out in the project can also be seen
in Fig. 15 for the first 6 months. The settlement in site B
began to peter out compared with the drains and surcharge
method in Zone A and surcharge only in Zone C. Thus it is
quite evident that DRM largely reduced the compressibility
of the peaty clay, and drains and surcharge installed before
DRM effectively accelerated consolidation settlement in the
underlying fluvial clay. The result was a sand raft of high
bearing capacity with negligible long-term settlement under
an embankment load of about 3.7 m.

clay. Phase II, comprising Blocks T, U, V, W, X and Y,
started in August 1994 and was completed in 1997. In each
phase, the sequence of reclamation work involved construction of perimeter dykes, placement of fill, soil improvement
using vertical drains and surcharge, dredging of internal
canals and marina, and construction of canal/marina revetment. Temporary dykes were also constructed to allow
phase development of the project.
A typical soil profile across the north–south direction of
the proposed development is shown in Fig. 17. The seabed
at the site varies from El. 0 m to El. À5 m and the proposed
formation level is El. +2.6 m. The site is underlain by a layer,
16–18 m thick, of very soft to medium stiff silty clay
followed by interbedded layers of silts and sands of dense to
very dense consistency and very stiff silty clays. The upper
12 m of the deposit are highly plastic silts and organic clay
with wN ¼ 70–150%, wL ¼ 60–130, IP ¼ 30–70, void ratio e
¼ 1.5–3.5 and Cc ¼ 0.7–1.2. Between El. À12m and El. À18m
the soft to medium stiff silty clay is relatively less compressible, with wN ¼ 50–90%, void ratio e % 1.7, and Cc ¼ 0.5.
The SPT N value is 0 in the very soft silty clay, 2–15 blows/
30 cm in the soft to medium stiff silty clay layer, and more
than 50 blows/30 cm in the dense to very dense sand/silt
strata. The cone resistance rarely exceeds 1 MPa until 12 m
depth. Thereafter, it increases to about 2–3 MPa between
12 m and 18 m, and exceeds 3 MPa below 18 m depth. The
vane shear strengths increased from 2 kPa near the seabed
to about 14 kPa at 10 m depth. Between 12 m and 18 m
depths the shear strength values vary from 20 to 40 kPa, and
below 18 m depth the soil was too stiff for the vane
apparatus. The consolidation tests confirmed that the clayey
soils are mostly normally consolidated, with a Cu /p9 ratio of
about 0.22–0.25.
Fibredrains for consolidation
Settlement of the filled areas will occur owing to the
consolidation of the underlying soft sediments. To provide
construction stability during fill placement, and to minimise
post-construction settlement to an acceptable magnitude, a
system of vertical drains with preloading was adopted.
Initially, plastic vertical drains were installed, but because of
a devaluation of the local currency they were replaced by
locally manufactured Fibredrains at the request of the
developer, as the material costs were lower. More than
350 000 m of Fibredrains (80 mm 3 10 mm) were installed in
a 2 m square grid over an area of about 4 ha in Block R to a

reclamation works consisted in filling an area designated as
‘Block R’ (Fig. 16) from the end of 1986 to 1988, where the
seabed varied from El. 0 m to El. À1.2 m. Phase IB, consisting of Block S and Block Z, where the seabed varied from El.

available, fill placement was interrupted, and the reclamation works stretched to more than 15 months. Following Lee
et al. (1988) the back-calculated Ch for this soft clay was
obtained as 3.8 m2 /yr using equation (3).
For Block R, at a fill level of +2.6 m, the observed
settlement was 1.2 m. Using the design chart for Fibredrains
in Fig. 10(b), for the back-calculated Ch ¼ 3.8 m2 /yr, an
equivalent influence diameter D ¼ 2.25 m, and final settlement of 1.4 m, of which 0.2 m is due to oversurcharge to
account for minor superimposed load and secondary settlement, the required discharge capacity QR is 15 m3 /yr. The
lateral pressure within the 16 m depth of seabed clay ranged
from about 25 kPa to 75 kPa, using a lateral earth pressure
coefficient of 0.5. Fig. 10(a) shows that, within this range of
lateral pressure, Fibredrain possesses more discharge capacity than needed. After 12–15 months of drain installation
the fill level was raised by 1 m. The ground settlement
accelerated at all depths as expected, and the effective
presence of the drain was observed. In situ vane tests
indicated Cu ¼ 20 kN/m2 within the mid-depth of clay,

Seawall construction on soft clay
In Phase II, with the reclamation of about 17–20 ha of land
with hydraulically dredged seabed clay from the vicinity of
the site, in order to increase the undrained shear strength of
the underlying sea bed clay to about 22 kN/m2 at El. À6 m
at the periphery of the reclamation so as to facilitate seawall
construction without instability, an estimated degree of
consolidation of 90% was needed. With an average Ch of
about 9 m2 /yr, a drain spacing of 1.4 m was adopted to
achieve this degree of consolidation in 3 months with an
appropriate surcharge (Lee et al., 1988).
In this reclamation, excavation for drainage channels in an
area where Fibredrain was installed about eight years earlier
revealed no trace of its existence, which verified the
biodegradability and hence the ecological friendliness of
Fibredrain.
A typical section of the western breakwater was at a
seabed level of El. À4.5 m. The dyke was designed to retain
fill materials inside the reclamation areas and at the same
time protect the reclaimed land from wave forces. Prior to
construction of the dykes, bamboo clusters consisting of
seven bamboo poles, 8 m long and 80–100 mm in diameter,
were inserted vertically into the soft seabed at 1.5 m spacing
with the aid of a floater guide until the tops of the clusters
were at the seabed. These bamboo clusters have two
Fibredrains wrapped around the centre pole of the cluster
(Fig. 18). The bamboo is tied together by jute ropes and
bamboo pins. A bamboo raft comprising seven layers of
bamboo mat was placed on top of the clusters with the aid
of a crane mounted on a pontoon. Each bamboo pole has a
nominal 1 t tensile strength.
Sand was then spread over the rafts to a height of 0.30 m.
For temporary dykes, sandbags were placed on top of this
reinforced raft–sand layer. For permanent dykes, the raft–
sand layer was covered with a geotextile (Polyfelt TS700)
before continuing the build-up with graded quarry stone.
Two rock mounds comprising 200 kg quarry stone were
constructed gradually with a slope of 1:1.5. The next stage
consisted of placing the geotextile on the centre portion
between the two rock mounds, after which sand was placed
up to El. À1.0 m. After allowing a period of time for the
underlying soft clay to gain strength from dissipation of
excess pore pressure through Fibredrains wrapped in the
Ijuk rope

Fig. 18. Bamboo cluster with Fibredrains
bamboo clusters, quarry stones of 15–50 kg were put in
place.
To provide protection against wave forces, a 2 m thick
layer of precast tetrapods weighing 1.6 t each was placed on
the external sides of the dyke up to a crest height of El.
+4.0 m. There was a time lapse between each stage to allow
the underlying soft clay to gain strength.
During construction of the dyke the bamboo raft acts as a
tension element, increasing the dyke’s stability. The bamboo
clusters increase the length of a potential rupture surface
during the fill operation, and the Fibredrain accelerates the
gain in strength of the underlying soft clay. Stability analysis
was carried out for each stage, and the minimum factor of
safety was 1.10 for a deep-seated failure. The factor of safety
will increase gradually with time owing to consolidation of
the underlying clay layers. The stability of the dyke with the
reclamation fill behind it was also analysed, and the minimum factor of safety was found to be about 1.20 at the end
of construction.
During the initial stages of construction the bamboo
clusters supported the dyke and, with the raft, prevent the
loss of sand and quarry stones in the seawall into the soft
clay below. At the later stages, the weight of the dyke will
exceed the bearing capacities of the bamboo clusters. The
latter will subside, and the surrounding clay will commence
the consolidation process, with a consequent increase in

shear strength. From previous measurements of completed
dykes, the settlement is estimated to be of the order of 1.5–
2.0 m.
The incorporation of bamboo rafts and bamboo clusters
with Fibredrains can be utilised in the construction of
highway embankments over shallow water underlain by soft
ground.
Concluding remarks
A considerable part of the cost incurred in the construction of highway embankments on soft ground arises from
the need to pre-treat the soft soil in the foundation. If proper
soil treatment is not carried out, protracted and costly road
maintenance cannot be avoided. The most economical
method of dealing with embankment settlement on soft
ground is to eliminate the primary compression and a large
portion of the secondary compression. The most cost-effective method for achieving this objective is to consolidate the
deep-seated clay with Fibredrains and surcharge and to
densify the surface deposits with HEI application, if
required.
Fibredrains are proven to withstand installation and HEI
tamping stresses with the following performance characteristics in the consolidation of soft soil.
(a) The effective coefficient of consolidation Ch is a function
of the hydraulic conductivity and compressibility of the
soil as well as of the field performance of the PVD.
(b) PVD field behaviour is greatly influenced by the
deformation of the core and the filter, and the clogging
and kinking of the drain.
(c) In field monitoring, the slope of the settlement–time
curve in the early stage of consolidation multiplied by
the influence area per drain gives the effective discharge
capacity of the PVD–soil system under the surcharge.
(d) For Fibredrains, the effective discharge capacity in the
field is given in Fig. 10(a) as a function of lateral
pressure. The required discharge capacity is shown in
Fig. 10(b) as a function of the final settlement Sf for
various values of the influence diameter D and the
effective Ch . With a given lateral pressure and final
settlement Sf the values of D and Ch can be determined
in Fig. 10. With these values of D and Ch , the consolidation time can be calculated from equation (3).
(e) The consolidation time cannot be reduced by decreasing
D because this leads to an increase in Qr .
( f ) It should be emphasised that Fibredrain continues to
function even at an axial strain of 24% (Aboshi et al.,
2001). In soil improvement projects where the PVD is
observed to be underperforming, the effective discharge
capacity of the PVD should be examined, with particular reference to the effect of kinking under axial strain
caused by settlement and clogging. The damage caused
by installation stresses may be important for PVD with
lower tensile strength. For Fibredrain the effect of these
factors is not significant, as discussed earlier.
(g) Fibredrain is environmentally friendly in the production
and transformation processes, and biodegradable in the
utilisation phase. Hence it is ecologically harmonious.
(h) In highway construction Fibredrains can be installed for
the consolidation of soft subsoil accompanied by HEI
application for embankment construction, if required,
because their high tensile strength can withstand HEI.
(i) Where embankment construction over shallow water
underlain by soft ground is required, bamboo raft and
clusters with embedded Fibredrains can be effectively

Field-monitored case studies Hiroshima, Japan Yoshida et al. (1995) reported the installation of Fibredrains in Hiroshima under the jurisdiction of the Hiroshima Prefecture government.

Fibredrains were installed at a spacing of 1.1 m and sand drains at 2.5 m spacing for comparative assessment. A considerable excess pore pressure remained in the clay at the end of 8 months in the sand drain area (Aboshi, 1999). Figure 13 shows the monitoring results of piezometers installed in the clay in the Fibredrain area at El. À9.2 m, À12.5 m and À19 m, where the clay occurs between El. À8.5 m and À25 m. Piezometers were also installed at El. À10.6 m, À13.6 m, À16.6 m, À19.6 m and À22.6 m within the Fibredrain core to investigate the well resistance.

On back-analysis, at consolidation pressures of 98 kPa and 294 kPa, the effective Ch was found to be 1.35 m2 /yr and 2.19 m2 /yr with PD, and 9.2 m2 /yr and 10.7 m2 /yr with Fibredrain respectively. Figs 8 and 9 show the deformed shapes of the two drains after carefully removing the clay around the drains at the end of consolidation (Miura et al., 1995b; Aboshi et al., 2001). The PD has deformed significantly, resulting in kinking and decreased axial drainage capacity. The deformation of Fibredrain, on the other hand, was confined largely to an increase in the thickness and longitudinal compression of the drain without kinking. Axial compression in the Fibredrain is manifested largely as an increase in cross-sectional area, mainly because of the unwinding characteristics of jute fibres in both the filter layer and the core. The resulting increase in cross-sectional area and the decrease in filter opening size enhance the unclogged water flow into the drain. The a</context>

The measurement of axial permeability at the end of the test was reported to be 7 3 10À9 m/s for Fibredrain and zero for PD, illustrating the effect of kinking. Examination of the drain materials after the tests showed that Fibredrain had increased its thickness without kinking, whereas the PD had developed three to four kinks, which completely curtailed the axial flow capacity, as shown in Fig. 9.

It should be emphasised that the time of consolidation cannot be reduced by decreasing D because this leads to larger QR , which will be greater than the effective discharge capacity of the drain under the lateral pressure and hydraulic gradient. In most cases the effective Ch is smaller than the Ch of the soil determined in the laboratory (Rowe, 1968; Head, 1985). If the latter is smaller, it should be used in equation (3) to determine the time of consolidation. Back-analysis of field settlement–time data obtained in Singapore marine clay using a plastic PVD (Choa et al., 1979) showed effective Ch values in the range 2–10 m2 /yr. Figs 10(a) and 10(b) show that for i  0.5 and a lateral pressure of 200 kPa, the values of effective Ch corresponding to settlements of 3, 2 and 1 m are 3, 5 and 7 m2 /yr respectively.

The deep-seated clay soil can be treated with Fibredrains and surcharge. For surface deposits, the application of high-energy impact (HEI) has been successfully employed in several projects in this region (Choa et al., 1979; Lee et al., 1989) and elsewhere (Lukas, 1986). When improving in situ soil deposits by HEI, one of the physical limitations usually met is the depth. With standard HEI techniques it is generally not economical or practical to reach depths exceeding 5–7 m below the ground surface for clay or 8–l0 m below the ground surface for sand. When the type of soil to be improved varies, it is customary to change the improvement technique. With HEI application the method and equipment remain essentially the same, but allowance is made in the application of the energy level and intensity. HEI application</context>

It should be emphasised that the time of consolidation cannot be reduced by decreasing D because this leads to larger QR , which will be greater than the effective discharge capacity of the drain under the lateral pressure and hydraulic gradient. In most cases the effective Ch is smaller than the Ch of the soil determined in the laboratory (Rowe, 1968; Head, 1985).

As the mandrel is driven into the ground during the installation process, soils intrude into the mandrel through the interface between the mandrel and the anchor shoe, and develop significant tensile forces in the PVD as the mandrel is withdrawn. In recent field measurements of installation stresses on plastic PVDs, a tensile force of 1.4 kN on the filter was recorded at an installation depth of 30 m (Karunaratne et al., 2002). It is imperative that the PVD should possess sufficient tensile strength to withstand these tensile forces. The large apparent opening size (AOS) of Fibredrains, in the range 200–600 ìm, serves to tap pervious layers and lenses in clay deposits. The double filter layer, which has a smaller effective AOS, intercepts the clay slurry generated immediately after installation of the Fibredrain in the clay as the mandrel is withdrawn. The cross-plane permeability of the filter was measured under a constant head across a stack of four identical burlaps fastened across an open end of a circular cyli</context>

In the case of soft clay it is found to be ineffective when used alone on saturated soft clay as the pore pressure dissipation is governed only by the permeability of the clay (Choa et al., 1979). For partly saturated cohesive soil it is found to be quite effective (Ramaswamy et al., 1979). When the clay is soft and saturated, sand columns can be formed with HEI by systematically punching sand into the clay.

The strength deterioration with time in the Ariake clay shows the biodegradability of the fibres. It should be pointed out that the deterioration in strength does not imply a reduction in drainage capacity, as observed in the Pantai Mutiara reclamation project in Jakarta, Indonesia (see below), where Fibredrains performed satisfactorily for more than two years (Lee et al., 1988).

With an average Ch of about 9 m2 /yr, a drain spacing of 1.4 m was adopted to achieve this degree of consolidation in 3 months with an appropriate surcharge (Lee et al., 1988). In this reclamation, excavation for drainage channels in an area where Fibredrain was installed about eight years earlier revealed no trace of its existence, which verified the biodegradability and hence the ecological friendliness of Fibredrain.

The deep-seated clay soil can be treated with Fibredrains and surcharge. For surface deposits, the application of high-energy impact (HEI) has been successfully employed in several projects in this region (Choa et al., 1979; Lee et al., 1989) and elsewhere (Lukas, 1986). When improving in situ soil deposits by HEI, one of the physical limitations usually met is the depth.

À10.6 m, À13.6 m, À16.6 m, À19.6 m and À22.6 m within the Fibredrain core to investigate the well resistance. Within the same 8-month period, the piezometers in the Fibredrain core showed only an excess pore pressure not exceeding 10 kPa, indicating that well resistance was insignificant and the axial flow capacity was more than adequate. Treatment of ex-mining land Near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia The use of vertical drains and surcharge in conjunction with HEI application for the treatment of ex-mining land for a housing project (Lee et al., 1989) is briefly presented. A safe bearing pressure of 60 kN/m2 with a factor of safety of 2.5 was necessary for this project. The site, near Kuala Lumpur, is composed of mine tailing soils consisting of loose sandy deposits to very soft clayey soils. Soil profiles from typical borehole log show that N values are less than 2 blows/30 cm in clays and between 2 and 10 blows/30 cm in sands. The construction commenced with placing a working platform with selected fill materials containing fines less than 10%.

Properties of Fibredrain Most prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) are manufactured with a polymeric core and a geotextile filter sleeve. Fibredrain, a PVD developed at the National University of Singapore, consists of four axial coir strands enveloped within a filter comprising two layers of jute burlap (Lee et al., 1995). Jute in raw form, after preliminary treatment, is spun into yarns and woven into burlap, which is used for the two filter layers.

This technique, described as dynamic replacement and mixing (DRM), has been able to eliminate overall settlement, including a large percentage of the long-term secondary components. The principle of successful implementation of HEI application lies in recognising the most appropriate energy levels to be used. The earlier approach of using empiricism based on field operation is complemented by a more rational approach of determining the enforced settlement, which is a function of the imposed stress from the structure to be built upon the soil and the soil modulus or compressibility. Lo et al. (1990) showed that there is a unique relationship between the saturation intensity applied through HEI and the enforced settlement. Fig. 11 shows the enforced settlement upon application of HEI energy in various projects worldwide. It can be seen that for every site (depending upon the soil characteristics and geometric configuration, involving depth, water table and stratification) there is a saturated intensity Is beyond which further HEI application produces no tangible results in terms of settlement.

The deep-seated clay soil can be treated with Fibredrains and surcharge. For surface deposits, the application of high-energy impact (HEI) has been successfully employed in several projects in this region (Choa et al., 1979; Lee et al., 1989) and elsewhere (Lukas, 1986). When improving in situ soil deposits by HEI, one of the physical limitations usually met is the depth. With standard HEI techniques it is generally not economical or practical to reach depths exceeding 5–7 m below the ground surface for clay or 8–l0 m below the ground surface for sand.

When the type of soil to be improved varies, it is customary to change the improvement technique. With HEI application the method and equipment remain essentially the same, but allowance is made in the application of the energy level and intensity. HEI application consists of dropping a heavy pounder ranging from l0 to 40 t from a height, usually about 10– 25 m, via a platform of granular fill. To treat loose granular deposits dynamic compaction (DC) was used effectively for more than three decades (Menard and Broise, 1975; Ramaswamy et al., 1979). In the case of soft clay it is found to be ineffective when used alone on saturated soft clay as the pore pressure dissipation is governed only by the permeability of the clay (Choa et al., 1979). For partly saturated cohesive soil it is found to be quite effective (Ramaswamy et al., 1979). When the clay is soft and saturated, sand columns can be formed with HEI by systematically punching sand into the clay. This method, known as dynamic replacement (DR), has been used successfully even in a gap-graded sandy soil (Lee et al., 1984). An adaptation of DR for peaty clay</context>

When the type of soil to be improved varies, it is customary to change the improvement technique. With HEI application the method and equipment remain essentially the same, but allowance is made in the application of the energy level and intensity. HEI application consists of dropping a heavy pounder ranging from l0 to 40 t from a height, usually about 10– 25 m, via a platform of granular fill. To treat loose granular deposits dynamic compaction (DC) was used effectively for more than three decades (Menard and Broise, 1975; Ramaswamy et al., 1979). In the case of soft clay it is found to be ineffective when used alone on saturated soft clay as the pore pressure dissipation is governed only by the permeability of the clay (Choa et al., 1979). For partly saturated cohesive soil it is found to be quite effective (Ramaswamy et al., 1979). When the clay is soft and saturated, sand columns can be formed with HEI by systematically punching sand into the clay. This method, known as dynamic replacement (DR), has been used successfully even in a gap-graded sandy soil (Lee et al., 1984). An adaptation of DR for peaty clay 0·4 Enforced settlement,</context>

The time of consolidation by equation (3) corresponding to U  80%, Sf  2 m, Ch  5 m2 /yr and D  1.5 m is t  84 days. It should be emphasised that the time of consolidation cannot be reduced by decreasing D because this leads to larger QR , which will be greater than the effective discharge capacity of the drain under the lateral pressure and hydraulic gradient. In most cases the effective Ch is smaller than the Ch of the soil determined in the laboratory (Rowe, 1968; Head, 1985). If the latter is smaller, it should be used in equation (3) to determine the time of consolidation. Back-analysis of field settlement–time data obtained in Singapore marine clay using a plastic PVD (Choa et al., 1979) showed effective Ch values in the range 2–10 m2 /yr. Figs 10(a) and 10(b) show that for i  0.5 and a lateral pressure of 200 kPa, the values of effective Ch corresponding to settlements of 3, 2 and 1 m are 3, 5 and 7 m2 /yr respectively.

The construction of the embankment follows afterwards. A suitable material should be selected; highly swelling minerals should be avoided in order to prevent excessive absorption of water within the embankment during wet weather and shrinkage during dry weather, which might result in distress in the pavement. In the event that the use of such materials is unavoidable, then they should be shielded from fluctuations of the water table and from flooding. Field-monitored case studies Hiroshima, Japan Yoshida et al. (1995) reported the installation of Fibredrains in Hiroshima under the jurisdiction of the Hiroshima Prefecture government.

Fibredrains were installed at a spacing of 1.1 m and sand drains at 2.5 m spacing for comparative assessment. A considerable excess pore pressure remained in the clay at the end of 8 months in the sand drain area (Aboshi, 1999).
