Civil Engineering: Anachronism and Black Sheep

Abstract: The paper presents a thesis that the word “civil” in “civil engineering” is anachronistic and does not represent the works of the
so-called civil engineer. The origin and root of the words “engineer” and civil are traced. Engineer is seen to have its roots via the Greek
and Latin in the Sanskrit word jan, meaning life, whereas civil is traced to the differentiation that engineers of the 18th and 19th centuries
created from their military engineer counterparts. The word engineer was used as far back as the 14th century, though, much of it in
nontechnical terms. The evolution of the practice of civil engineering, and the history of the formation of societies are studied to determine
how tasks relate to the word civil. Of particular interest is to see what the practitioners and founders of societies aimed to embody in this
field of civil engineering. The paper aims to explore the factors and influences in the practice and naming of the civil engineer. It delves
into the roots and origins of the names of a number of engineering disciplines, giving explanations and commentary on the implications
of those names, and finds that all those names relate to technical functions. The paper concludes that the name of civil engineering does
not represent the functional tasks of the civil engineer, in contrast to names of other engineering disciplines, and is, moreover, out of place
with modern times. What’s in a name? This paper seeks to find out.

Introduction
Origin of the Word Engineer
By the time ASCE was formed in 1852, civil engineering already
had a history, and the British Institution of Civil Engineers had
preceded ASCE by half a century. Engineers had styled themselves as “civil engineers” and universities offered courses in civil
engineering. The construction of public roads and bridges, and
canals and drainage systems had been practiced since time immemorial, and had been recorded for thousands of years. But somehow, “civil engineering” came to be spoken of only in the 18th
Century. The “engineer,” however, has been around for centuries.
Many engineers, especially today, have a misconception of the
origin of the word engineer, thinking that it derives from engine;
nothing is farther from the truth, as this study explores. This paper
studies the origin of “civil engineer” and proposes that the word
“civil” is an anachronism. Moreover, the name does not reflect the
reality of the technical functions, nor the actual type of work
performed in this glorious branch of engineering.
Does a name affect anything at all? Perhaps yes, or yet again,
perhaps not, depending on how the issue is viewed. If it is viewed
from the former perspective, then there can be cause for concern
and chagrin. Nevertheless, this paper is the result of a study to
determine whether there is a fit between civil and the “engineering” works performed by the civil engineer.
Engineer comes directly from the Latin, French, and Middle English ͑McDonald 1914; ASCE 1970͒:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999715">
• Middle Latin: ingeniarius;
• Old French: engignier;
• Middle English: engyneour; and
• French: ingenieur.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.980315481481482">
Also related to these are the words ingenuity coming from the
Latin ingenuita and French ingenuite; and ingenious comes from
the Latin ingeniosus. Quite apparently, all have gen as their root
term.
“Origin” ͑1910͒ has the best and most clear-cut explanation of
the root gen. That article asserts “The root of both the words,
Engineer and Engine is found in the Sanskrit jan, to be born, from
which came the Greek form ␥␧␯ and the Latin gen, the latter
being embodied in the old verb genere, with its compound ingenere ͑changed into ingignere͒, to implant by birth, and in the later
substantive ingenium, an innate or natural quality.”
McDonald ͑1914͒, a Past President of ASCE, confirms from an
independent study through the consultation of a lexicographer,
that the Sanskrit root jan is the true origin of the Greek and Latin
root of gen, which has led to the formation of many words in
English in common use even today ͑see Appendix I͒. ͑This should
not be surprising: numerous words in English have their root in
Sanskrit.͒
Consequently, the engineer is someone who gives life to ideas,
bringing to life various machines and systems, which makes a lot
of sense in modern day terms. Therefore, the Engineer “creates.”
He applies his “ingenuity,” which has its roots in gen, to give
“life” to things and develop new systems. Consequently, the word
“generate” is understood to mean something that is given life to
and put into action, where gen, again, is the root word. The word
“genius” is understood in its derivation from gen as someone who
can give life and vitality to words and things, which is what
geniuses do when they invent new systems or solve difficult prob-

lems. Similarly, the implied derivatives of the words listed in
Appendix I can be traced back to gen, which is traced back to jan,
which means life.
As a matter of record, jan does not really mean birth, but
means life. In all likelihood, “Origin” ͑1910͒ made a minor error,
probably because of unfamiliarity with Sanskrit. Birth is actually
derived from jan, when life is given to a soul or entity, but is not
jan itself ͑in Sanskrit, jan= life and janam= birth͒. Nevertheless,
this does not detract from jan being the root of the Greek ␥␧␯.

It is apparent that the word engineer has its roots in the root word
gen, and not in the word engine, which itself is derived from gen.
The common misconception that engineer came from engine is,
however, understandable because the operators of steam engines
were called engineers. The Oxford English Dictionary defined the
engineer as one who managed engines or had charge of steam
engines; in the United States, the driver of a locomotive engine
was often called an engineer; the engineer was also known as a
contriver or maker of engines. For instance the obituary of John
Hampson, Esq., Engineer, in 1854, read at an ASCE meeting,
stated ͑Hunt 1897͒: “Mr. Hampson aided in the construction of
͑as a machinist͒ and ran as Engineman, the first Locomotive Engine built in America . . .”
In history, actually, the water wheel was referred to as an engine, as it brought water up, whereas the designer and maker of
the water wheel was known as an engineer, which is true even
today. Various machines have been invented in the world going
back to the time of Archimedes and before ͑The History Channel
2004͒. Is this a chicken and egg problem, as to what came first—
the engine or the engineer? No. Clearly, the engine could not have
been created without the brains of some engineer.
Moreover, the word engineer has nowhere been reported to be
derived from engine, though the misconception is somewhat
popular among people, especially after the onset of the steam
engine in locomotives. Correspondingly, it is quite logical to understand that engine and engineer are related ͑Herbert 1633͒ and
have their root in a common word, gen.
Early Use of the Word Engineer
May 26, 1716 is frequently credited with the day when engineering blossomed as a formal discipline, although all engineering
was combined in one, and there was no differentiation between
the disciplines. This was the day of the formation of the Corps of
Engineers of the military of Great Britain ͑ASCE 1970͒. The
Oxford English Dictionary subsequently carried a definition of
engineer that reflected the military engineer: “One who designs
and constructs military works for attack or defense.” The Corps of
Engineers was renamed Corps of Royal Engineers in 1787, and
was charged with the designing and constructing of military fortifications, ramparts, canals, river management, railways, road,
and bridge making. They were also tasked with penetrating
enemy fortifications using whatever technologies they could muster. For instance, the battle-tank of World War I was a design of
the Royal Engineers practicing general engineering, when they
first installed steel plates around a four-wheel drive vehicle to
attack infantry positions, though Leonardo da Vinci had first proposed armor around a cart to the Ruler of Milan in the 15th
century.
Later editions of the Oxford English Dictionary in the 18th
Century defined engineer as “one whose profession is the designing and constructing of works of public utility, such as bridges,
roads, canals, railways, harbors, drainage works, gas, and water
works,” which we can see, are public works items. Therefore, by
the end of the 18th Century, the word engineer, itself, was taken
as public works engineering. As the use of engineer and civil
engineer were practically synonymous with respect to civilians,
the civilian engineer was distinguished on the professional level
only from military engineers ͑Calhoun 1960͒. The French Dictionnaire de la Langue Francais of the 18th Century carried the
following definitions of engineer, bringing out the fact that public
works engineers in the civilian sector performed works undertaken by the military engineers, as well ͑McDonald 1914͒:
1. Engineer—one who plans, lays out, and directs field work
and fortifications, for attacking, defending, or fortifying
places.
2. Engineer—one who directs ͑private͒ works or public works,
such as the construction and maintenance of roads and
bridges, working of mines, etc. Engineer of bridges and
roads. Mining engineer, naval engineer or marine engineer,
railroad engineer.
Hence, the record of public works practice notes that the person
engaged in such practice was, indeed, classified as an engineer, in
that he designed and constructed new systems, and brought life to
his constructions. The public used those systems en masse—for
general consumption of the populace.
Early Use of Engineer in Nontechnical Applications
Prior to 1716, and even to this day, engineer was and is used in
many other ways. For instance—to engineer a new scheme, or to
develop a new idea or policy and seek its implementation even if
it is not in the formal area of engineering ͑e.g., Mr. X engineered
the adoption of his policies with the Board members for increasing market share of their product͒. The Cotgrave’s Dictionary of
French and English carried the following multiple definitions of
engineer ͑McDonald 1914͒:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999875833333333">
• Engineer—an engineer; a maker of engines;
• Enginer—engigner
• Engigner—a deceiver, beguiler, counsener; also an enchanter;
• Engin—an engin, toole, instrument; also understanding, policie, reach of wit; also suttletie, fraud, craft, wiliness, deceit;
and
• Ingenieur—an enginer, engine-maker; fortifier.

Grimm’s Deutsches Worterbuch is particularly remarkable in acknowledging the introduction of engineer from a foreign language
and accepting the dual use of the word: “Engineer, n.–This word
of the present day, for military architect, surveyor, introduced
from a foreign language in the 17th Century, represented an artful
calculating person in general. Ex. ‘He who wishes to bring Germans into an understanding must be a very good and wise engineer ͑schemer, calculator͒.’ ”
Thus, it is easy to understand when Satan is described as engineering his deception on mankind ͑see the next section for
quotes͒. It is not far-fetched to say that a primal power engineered
the universe, because that was surely a gigantic engineering feat
of construction, by any standard, and we are still searching for the
laws, techniques, formulas, equipment, resources, and tools used
for that construction!
However, the basic meaning of engineer had to do with one
who devises, builds, and makes new. Thus, the use of the word is

appropriate to the practices of the professions classified as engineering today. The dual use, including for nonengineering phrases
and terms, is equally valid. However, people of the 21st century
seem to have forgotten the dual use fundamentals, and raise eyebrows when engineering is used in any way not having to do with
the practice of engineering. Most guilty of this are the engineers
themselves, who often think their way of engineering is the
only way and that other uses of the word are aberrations or
adaptations.
Literature on the Use of Engineer
Usage of the word engineer preceded, by far, any formal recognition of engineering as a technical profession. Engineer was used
commonly in medieval and earlier centuries for expressing ingenuity, planning, scheming, proposing, or improving the issue, system, or gadget at hand. Appendix II carries a list of quotations
appearing in earlier centuries concerning the engineer, traced to
the root words gen and jan. The quotes include both the technical
and nontechnical uses of the word.
Roots of Names of Engineering Disciplines
Given in the following are the roots of names of common engineering disciplines ͑in alphabetical order͒:
“Aeronautical engineering” traces its origin to the prefix aer
meaning air, gas, or atmosphere. Aer is originally a Greek and
Latin word meaning air, so when we wish to study the flight of
aircraft in air, it is quite logical to call it aeronautical engineering.
An “architect” is one who designs and supervises the construction of buildings—coming from the Greek arkhitekton, meaning
master builder. It is logical to observe that “architecture” has
been derived from arkhitekton.
Improving soil cultivation is “agricultural engineering.”
“Agriculture” comes from two roots—ager, meaning “field” in
Latin; and cultura, meaning to cultivate. Ager has been the root
word for growing of food and crops for many millennia. The
meaning of the tasks and functions performed by agricultural engineering are immediately clear from their roots.
“Biological engineering,” an up and coming field of study,
derives from the root words bios—Greek for life—and logia—
Greek for study. Nothing could more truly represent the engineering applied to the study of living species.
Chemistry has been around for ages—and anything to do with
preparing chemical plants and kilns or handling chemicals was
rightfully and justifiably given the name of “chemical engineering.” The alchemist strove for centuries to transmute ordinary
materials and chemical substances into gold. Medieval Latin referred to that pursuit as alchemia, alchimicus, and alchymia. The
practitioner was called in New Latin as chimicus or alchemist.
Therefore, it was quite natural to come up with the name of
chemical engineering for the study of chemical plants and machinery, as chemistry was already known and derived from alchemia. The root is traced to the French chimic for “chemical,”
and Late Greek chemeia for “chemistry.”
“Computer engineering” comes from the Latin word computare, meaning the ability to make determinations by numerical
methods. For centuries, mathematicians had toiled with computing strategies until they hit on the abacus, the logarithm tables,
slide rule, and then, finally, the computer after the discovery of
electronics.
Goddess Electra was said to appear to mortals in the form of a
comet. The bright light of the comet, its flare, and the ominous
power of comets made quite an impression on humans. It was
quite logical, therefore, for “electrical engineering” to be given
this name for the study of electricity that dealt with power and
light. Thomas Edison, if we recall, brought electricity from the
heavens in his experiment with a kite that led to the light bulb.
Going from Electra to “electricity” and then to electrical engineering was not far-fetched at all. Moreover, “electric” derives
from the Greek electron, akin to Greek elektor meaning beaming
sun. Elektor is reported to come from the Sanskrit ulka meaning
fiery phenomenon in sky, or meteor. Hence, Goddess Electra was
given a suitable name in reference to her characteristic.
The “fire protection engineers” took their name from the Old
English fyr, meaning fire. They did not have to go far to find their
name to represent their basic function.
The Society for “hospital engineers” takes their name from
the modern “hospital,” which took its name from the Latin hospitum meaning hospitality; the Latin hospitalis, meaning good
treatment of a guest; and the Latin hospes, meaning host, as it is
in the hospital that patients are treated with care and love ͑hopefully͒, much as traditional cultures treat well and respectfully a
host or guest. The word Hospital refers to treating well those who
come to the hospital, thereby reflecting a major function of the
hospital and hospital engineers.
When workers sweat from their brow to produce industrial
goods, and when people work hard in factories to produce goods,
we know they have been “industrious” in the exercise of their
duties—coming from the Latin industria meaning diligent, and
Middle English industrie. It is no surprise that the branch of engineering dealing with workplace productivity and manufacture
of goods is called “industrial engineering.” The word “industrial
is further composed of two roots—Indo and struus. Indo comes
from Indu that comes from endo that means “within.” Struus
comes from the Latin struere that means to arrange and build; in
this sense, it is similar to the root of “construction,” explained
later. Together, indo and struus mean “building within”—in other
words, working hard, or diligent.
“Marine engineering” has to do with the oceans and seas, and
it would be quite logical to expect marine to have something to do
with ocean or sea. Marine comes from the Old French marin,
which comes from the Latin marinus, which comes from mare,
meaning sea. The “mariner” is, thus, one who explores the sea.
Hence, we have a direct connection here to the functions of the
marine engineers in their name.
Mekhane is the original Greek word for machine. Anything
that is suggestive of or appropriate for performance of a machine
is, therefore, quite logically given the name of “mechanical engineering.” The word mekhane has been around for millennia, so
it was reasonable when the word mechanical engineering was
chosen for the study of modern machines.
“Military engineering” comes from the word military that
comes from the Latin root miles meaning soldier and the Latin
root militare meaning to serve as a soldier.
“Mining engineering,” another very old and important form
of engineering, considering how important metals such as gold
have been through the centuries, even before Christ. The root of
“mining” comes to us from the Welsh and the Old French. The
Welsh origin, mywn, meaning “ore” is expected to be of Celtic
origin. The Old French origin, miniere or mine, means “mineral.”
“Nuclear engineering” deals with harnessing the power of the
nucleus of atoms. The word “nuclear” derives directly from the
Latin nucleus or nuculeus. In physics, “nucleus” represents the

central region of an atom ͑whose energy is harnessed in nuclear
engineering͒ and containing almost all of the mass of an atom.
The word itself means the kernel—the most material and central
part: The core. Nucleus further derives from nux, meaning nut,
wherein it is implied that the nucleus of the atom is like a nut and
grouping of subatomic particles.
“Petroleum engineering” deals with drawing oil from under
the layers of rock and beds of earth. Truly enough, petroleum is
derived from Latin petra, meaning rock and the Latin oleum,
meaning oil, giving an instantaneous understanding of the type of
work and tasks involved—where the name explains the functions.
Finally, “safety engineering” is one of the most obvious cases
where the name of the engineering discipline directly implies the
type of work being undertaken. Safety engineering concerns itself
with being safe, free from danger or harm, unhurt—͑of͒ maintaining health. The word safe comes to us from the Middle English
sauf and from the Latin salvus meaning healthy.
Hence, it is apparent that the names of all major engineering
disciplines ͑except civil engineering that has not been defined yet͒
come from root words that represent their technical functions.
Early Evolution of Civil Engineering
No single civilization can lay claim to having discovered or invented engineering. From the earliest times, human settlements
have sought to construct dams and barrages for water supply;
move earth to build embankments; quarried and hewed to patterns
and line; dug rivulets to increase irrigation for the fields; and
applied the lever, roller, and the inclined plane from Sumeria to
Mohenjo-Daro, Egypt to China. All known ancient civilizations
of Assyria, Babylonia, China, Etruscia, India, Misr ͑Egypt͒, Persia, and Phoenicia built canals and aqueducts, docks and harbors,
palaces and cities, roads and suspension bridges, and drainage and
water supply systems. All these activities were performed for humankind to quench their thirst, grow crops, keep the environment
clean through sanitation, and basically improve their quality of
life. The urge to improve one’s lot is a characteristic of the human
race. Biblical records tell us that Noah used bitumen in the construction of his ark; bitumen was also used to make watertight,
the casket in which Moses was committed to the Nile as a forlorn
baby ͑Watkins 1891͒. These were the humble beginnings of the
field of study known as civil engineering. Later to be added to this
field were military pursuits, such as fortifications and ramparts,
moats and bridges, tunnels and catapults.
Three prime examples out of the hundreds and thousands that
were executed of the practice of engineering in the ancient
world—marvels of ingenuity in their time–that are all infrastructure projects, are as follows ͑Watkins 1891͒:

pointed arches that supported the earth above them; construction of docks and warehouses at Port Cadiz; working of tin
mines. All these were done for the purposes of trading everywhere along the Mediterranean.
Interestingly, the construction of buildings is nowhere mentioned
as primarily an engineering work, though references to engineers
supporting the master-builder architect are discovered in literature. The many wonders of the ancient world–the pyramids, construction of palaces and halls, or the beauty of cathedrals and
temples are placed in the realm of the master-builder architect,
and are nowhere recorded as falling under the purview of the
engineer or public works engineering.
The Medes, Carthaginians, and Greeks were to follow the
Phoenicians and Assyrians with larger infrastructure projects for
the maintenance of their cities. Similarly, we know that Julius
Caesar was an expert on public and infrastructure works prior to
his ascension as the Ruler of Rome. For instance, he was called
upon to solve the transport crisis in Rome, much as we would
have transportation engineers do today. As “all roads ͑literally͒
led to Rome” owing to Rome’s central position in the trade and
commerce of the nation, Rome was afflicted with a severe traffic
problem for which Julius Caesar presented solutions, not all of
which were successful, though ͑Singh 2000͒.
The Romans were known to have enormous engineering accomplishments to serve their war machine, and applied their skills
to public works too. There were estimated 250 mi of aqueducts
during the Roman period, 50 mi of which were supported on
stone arches. It was estimated that these aqueducts poured into
Rome over 300 million gallons per day ͑Watkins 1891͒.
Rome continued to build canals and locks, being among the
first in relatively recent times to build canals, especially in Milan,
a city dependent on canals, and later aided by Leonardo da Vinci
who offered his services as an infrastructure expert to the Ruler of
Milan. Interestingly, these public works were distinguished from
building works.
Public works applications are evident throughout the world
from China to the Mayan Empire, Viking maritime operations in
Northern Europe to Central Asian road constructions, and they
cannot all be mentioned. Suffice to say that it is discovered that
all the works undertaken in earlier millennia that led to the modern practice of Civil Engineering cover infrastructure works for
public improvements.
Calhoun ͑1960͒ opines that the “precise definition of the term
‘civil engineer’ can cause needless concern.” From a practical
perspective, he has a somewhat valid point. He argues that civil
engineering evolved over time from the many activities of a large
variety of engineers, coming from a mixed source of agrarian,
mercantile, and military origins, in addition to newer industrial
ways. The ingenuity of the public works or civil engineer had to
be applied to a vast array of applications in many fields of activity. In addition, a name is often the superset of dynamic language,
culturally inspired, and socially shaped. Moreover, as Calhoun
implies, the tasks and functions of the civil engineer do not
change no matter what the name is. Further, the name has been in
vogue for many decades and has been accepted, so why bother
with the name at all? Nevertheless, it is obvious that the name has
caused concern to people, as Calhoun implies; we do not know
whom, though. However, the name, or lack of an appropriate
name, is a matter of interest to the author.
Practice of Public Works Engineering: 1776–1852
The term civil engineer was already recognized among professionals by the time ASCE attempted to begin its business in 1839,
and by the time they formed themselves in 1852. The practice of
infrastructure engineering was already accepted in the Western
world, since many ports, railroads, and canals had been constructed, engineers from West Point had been engaged in the construction of various locks on rivers, and much of America had
been surveyed ͑Fig. 1͒. Sewer lines were in operation in Boston
by 1800. South Hadley and Middlesex Canals in Massachusetts

͑1793 and 1804͒; Erie Canal ͑1825͒; Union Canal, Pa. ͑1829͒;
Morris Canal, N.J. ͑1831͒; and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal
͑1851͒ had been constructed ͑Adams 2004͒. A total of about
300 mi of canals had been constructed by 1840, stimulating inland navigation, commerce, and transport of factory goods. In
1850, there were 83 municipal water supplies ͑Calhoun 1960͒.
Much infrastructure engineering work had also been accomplished in the nonmilitary area. The 1787 law establishing the
Northwest Territory decreed that 2% of land revenues be allocated to construction of the National Road, the “Cumberland
Pike” from Washington to the Ohio River. By 1820, the United
States had 9,000 mi of rock and gravel surfaced roads ͑Wisely
1974͒. Railroads greatly stimulated the need for infrastructure engineers. In 1840, there were 9,000 miles of railroads in the United
States; 30,000 in 1850, with about $300 million being invested
that year for the construction of railroads ͑Houghton Mifflin
2004͒.
America carried over much of the European social patterns. As
Europeans came to the new world in search of a better life, all the
skills and trades were brought with them. It was necessary to
build the new nation from scratch. European society had recognized the military engineer, the architect, and the civilian engineer
as appropriate men to plan and direct large public works ͑Calhoun
1960͒. The year 1785 saw a surge in the hiring of engineers, for
example, for the improvement of navigation in the Potomac River
by the Potomac Company, whose President was George Washington himself ͑Kaylor 2005͒. It was difficult to get an engineer all
the way from Europe, and earlier personnel selected by the Potomac Company to manage the engineering proved unsatisfactory
in their work. Engineers were in short supply, and the shortage
continued to be felt through to the civil war. John Quincy Adams,
then Minister to Great Britain, once transmitted the application of
an English engineer anxious to seek employment in the United
States. However, European engineers were generally hard to get.
The preference was usually for French engineers who were considered more scientifically educated ͑Calhoun 1960͒.
There was confusion as to the type of engineer that could be
found for infrastructure projects. Architects often doubled up as
managers of works, such as Benjamin Latrobe who worked as a
civil engineer on the Susquehanna navigation survey, Philadelphia works, and the Chesapeake and Delaware canals. For various
reasons, he felt himself not appreciated in America. The owners
and presidents of canal and river improvement companies themselves felt uncertain on how to find the necessary supervision for
their projects. They tried various personnel, meeting with disappointment for a long time, until they finally realized, as in the
case of Mr. Phillip Schuyler, President of Western and Northern
Inland Lock Navigation Companies, that only the hiring of experienced, professional infrastructure engineers would fulfill their
needs and demands of project success ͑Calhoun 1960͒. Basically,
it is evident that those who had worked specifically on infrastructure projects would be qualified then for the type of work we call
civil engineering today.
There was some difficulty in hiring architects to fulfill engineering roles. The architect’s task is largely to arrange materials
artistically to enhance the internal living experience as much as
possible. The training of an architect did little to equip him with
knowledge of soils for moving earth, or properties of channel
flow for river training, or the sinking of caissons for bridge foundations, which was knowledge required in the practice of infrastructure development.
The difficulty in acquiring competent engineers prompted the
U.S. Congress to establish West Point, as a starter, for training
engineers for military infrastructure projects. This set the stimulus
for private schools to begin civil engineering instruction. In 1816,
the states of New York, Virginia, and South Carolina sought engineers for canal and road building. Whereas, the preference was
for an engineer, the jobs were still filled by architects, land surveyors, contractors, and draftsmen owing to a general shortage of
qualified engineers. It is reported that the total number of engineers or quasi-engineers active or available in the United States
up to 1816 never averaged more than two per state ͑Calhoun
1960͒. However, they were all engaged in public works. They
came from all over—they were surveyors, landholders, speculators, builders, contractors, lawyers, architects, and military
engineers.
Thus, it is straight to see that the tasks engineers performed for
which they were later named civil engineers were what we commonly know today as infrastructure engineering. It was nowhere
for building engineering that they were called civil engineers, but
basically for public works improvement projects of an infrastructure nature. The fundamental finding of this section is that the
skills that employers sought in civil engineers related to public
works or infrastructure works, a somewhat embodied field of
knowledge by the mid-19th century. The shortage was not felt for
building works, since there were architects available for the design and construction of buildings.
Origin and Definition of the Term Civil Engineering
John Smeaton, an eminent civil engineer of his times is recorded
as the first person to sign himself as a civil engineer, in 1761
͑“Origin” 1910; McDonald 1914͒. Wisely ͑1974͒ mentions that
Smeaton signed himself in as civil engineer, as he was engaged in
the building of roads, structures, and canals in England in a civilian capacity. Fairweather ͑2002͒ reports that Smeaton signed himself so while presenting testimony to the courts in 1782. This was
probably in addition to his signing in 1761, but there could be
confusion on the dates in the historical records, but this does not
detract from the fact that Smeaton is credited with being the first
person to style himself as civil engineer.
By 1761, it can be inferred that calling oneself an engineer
meant one was in the Corps of Royal Engineers. As Smeaton
could not misrepresent himself in court, he had to come up with
an alternate to engineer and military engineer. Moreover, there
was no precedence in the matter before Smeaton, and he suitably
struck on civil engineer. It is probably logical to speculate that he
took counsel in the matter, that he had support of the professional
community, and that others in the profession had been referring to
themselves as civil engineers in the vernacular.
The distinction between military and civilian engineering was

brought out by the French Dictionnaire de la Langue Francaise
of the 18th Century, carrying the following definition: “Civil
Engineer—name given to engineers who are not trained in technical schools or who work for private industry.”
An interesting part of this definition is the portion about training in technical schools. Though no one today could be recognized as a civil engineer without training ͑education͒ in a technical ͑engineering͒ school, only military engineers were trained in
school in 18th Century France. The others, who worked in the
civilian sector, earned their credentials through the School of
Hard Knocks ͑which refers in the colloquial to learning that takes
place on the job or on the streets, in contrast to formal learning in
school͒. Thus, civil engineers were differentiated from their military engineering counterparts in 18th Century France through the
above-mentioned definition.
The Society of Civil Engineers ͑SCE͒ in Great Britain was the
first civil engineering society in the world, formed in 1793 following years of effort that dated back to 1771, a good 55 years
after the formation of the British Corps of Engineers, and at least
a decade after Smeaton had styled himself as civil engineer. The
SCE served to formalize and embody what was only loosely
used—the term and style of civilian engineer, or civil engineer,
for short.
The SCE transformed in 1818 to the British Institution of Civil
Engineers ͑ICE͒. Thomas Telford, who had a career as a surveyor,
and road, bridge, and canal builder, was appointed its first President in 1820, in which position he served until his death in 1834.
He helped ICE get a Royal Charter in 1828—a recognition that
helped establish ICE as the preeminent organization for civil engineers ͑“Encyclopedia” 2005͒.
At home, the U.S. Congress legislated the Army Corps of Engineers in 1794, and the U.S. Military Academy was created at
West Point in 1802, with the specific purpose of supporting military engineering functions. In 1821, the Congress enacted legislation specifically directing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to
conduct surveys of roads and canals jointly with “engineer officers” of the Corps and engineers from among civilians engaged in
such work, who the Congress referred to as civil engineers.
Hence, this was the first official recognition of this special nature
of work being given the name of civil engineering. In 1824, Congress further passed an act authorizing the President to use engineer officers from the army, as well as civilian engineers, to make
surveys for roads and canals considered of national importance
͑Wisely 1974; Calhoun 1960͒.
When the Oxford English Dictionary enhanced its definition of
engineering in the 18th Century, they contrasted works that the
military performed with identical works performed in the civilian
community, defining such professionals in the civilian community
as a civil engineer, for distinction from the military engineer. It
was not until ICE had been formed that in 1828 they formally
defined civil engineering as “. . . that species of knowledge which
constitutes the profession of a civil engineer; being the art of
directing the great source of power in nature for the use and
convenience of man; of the means of production and of traffic in
states, both for external and internal trade, as applied in the construction of roads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation,
and docks, for internal intercourse and exchange; and in the construction of ports, harbors, moles, breakwaters, and light-houses;
commerce; and in the construction and adoption of machinery;
and in the drainage of cities and towns.”
Somewhat similar to the ICE definition was the West Point
definition of civil engineering prepared in December 1831 ͑U.S.
Congress 1831͒. It differed partially from the ICE definition to the
extent that the West Point definition incorporated building engineering within the field of civil engineering: “Civil Engineering,
viz.: the properties, preparation and use of materials; elementary
parts of buildings; composition and distribution of buildings; art
of construction; decorative architecture; manner of laying out and
constructing roads; discussion of the different kinds of stone, iron,
and wooden bridges, with the methods of construction; consideration of the obstacles impeding the navigation of rivers, and their
remedies; details of the various constructions on a canal; survey,
location, and construction of a canal; calculation of the economy
of canal transportation; different kinds of rail-roads; survey, location, and construction of a line of railway; economy of transportation on railroads; and construction of artificial and improvement
of natural harbors.”
However, the word civil in civil engineering is nowhere seen
to explain any activity being undertaken: Civil actually traces its
roots to the Latin civilis meaning polite; “civilian” is derived
from civilis, which comes from the Latin, Middle English, and
Middle French word of civis, meaning citizen. Civil also means
mannerly, presentable, courteous, courtly, gallant, chivalrous, forbearance from rudeness or unpleasantness ͑refer to The American
Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 3rd Ed.͒, none of
which represent the engineering functions of civil engineering. In
contrast, the word “military” is derived from the Latin miles
meaning soldier, which well explains the military engineer. Civil
is not a technical root of engineering functions, and therefore is a
gross misnomer for civil engineering. Civil is used from out of
convenience rather than to represent function, thereby making
civil engineering the sole exception to all engineering disciplines
mentioned in this article.
University Courses in Civil Engineering: 1763–1852
As in England, which was reaping benefits from its colonies
around the world, immigration and the conquest of a large frontier
in North America was increasing the need for infrastructure
projects there, largely for transportation purposes that had a direct
impact on economic activity and personal mobility. Moreover, the
U.S. military needed the same type of infrastructure for the conquests of the vast frontiers. This demand led to West Point being
started as the first engineering academy in the country in 1802, as
was mentioned earlier. At the time, the primary engineering tasks
taught were surveying, road making, and design and construction
of hydraulic locks and railroads.
Prior to 1802, there was no formal education in civil engineering in the United States, and practitioners acquired their knowledge through apprenticeship and fieldwork, with some of them
having completed a course of study in the sciences and mathematics. However, the first and oldest school of civil engineering was
the L’Ecole Militaire de Saint Cyr, established in Paris in 1763.
For a long time, it was considered a fine institution, ranked high
among all nations. French engineers, graduates of that institution
were highly sought ͑Calhoun 1960͒, especially by the U.S. government between the period 1775 and 1825, during which time
French military engineers helped Napoleonic power become the
premier world power. Colleges and universities in the United
States that began to offer civil engineering instruction following
the creation of West Point are listed in the following ͑Wisely
1974͒; the dates given represent the first degrees offered, and it
must be noted that the universities began their civil engineering
programs a few years before these dates ͑refer to Phelan et al.

In spite of this education, there were only 512 civil engineers
by 1850. For even those who listed their profession as engineer in
contrast to civil engineer, most worked on canals and railroads,
which goes to show again how synonymous and interchangeable
the two terms were. To many, the engineer was known as a person
responsible for infrastructure, industrial, and municipal improvements ͑where the most commonly understood infrastructure improvements were railroads; canals and locks for river navigation
and agriculture; roads, highways, and bridges͒ ͑Calhoun 1960͒.
Popular literature of the early 19th Century assumed that the engineer was mainly a designer of internal improvements—what we
would call infrastructure today; the 1824 Act of Congress, mentioned previously, was overseen by a Board of Engineers for Internal Improvements in the War Department.
Allen Partridge was formerly a Superintendent of West Point,
from where he resigned after clashing with his superiors. He
opened the Partridge Academy at Norwich, used the same textbooks as West Point, and offered his graduates jobs on the New
York canals. In 1825, Partridge wrote to the Governor of New
York, De Witt Clinton, that his course was “to prepare young men
for the scientific discharg ͑sic.͒ of the duties of Civil Engineers.”
He felt that if the country could prepare its own engineers, they
would never have to look to Europe for them.
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ͑RPI͒ taught mensuration,
surveying, and engineering. Professor Amos Eaton, who taught
the course, felt that advanced mathematics was unnecessary to
teach to engineering students, and even politely criticized the text
used by West Point instructor, Mahan, Elementary Course in Civil
Engineering, a textbook that was popular and saw seven editions
from 1837 to 1868 ͑Calhoun 1960͒. The opinion of Professor
Eaton resonates today in the education of the modern construction
manager in the United States, exemplified in university curricula
accredited by the American Council on Construction Education
͑ACCE͒, whose graduates supervise construction projects identical to the construction engineers from ABET-accredited schools.
However, much of the earlier civil engineering courses were
taught by professors of mathematics at a variety of schools—a
disposition that somewhat characterizes the profession and is reflected in the heavy mathematics required today for civil engineers in an ABET-accredited curriculum. In Hanover College, a
professor of mathematics taught civil engineering courses; at the
University of Michigan in 1837, the professor of mathematics
was also professor of natural philosophy and civil engineering;
whereas at the University of Virginia in 1836–1837, professors of
mathematics and natural philosophy taught civil engineering
courses; in 1837, Charles Hackley, a professor of mathematics
taught civil engineering at the University of New York ͑Calhoun

1960͒. The first half of the 19th Century was to witness the slow
but steady maturing of civil engineering as a profession, largely
through formal education.
Other schools offering some kind of engineering courses between 1831 and 1852 included the following:
• Geneva College;
• Dartmouth College, Hanover, N.H.;
• Lehigh University, Pa.;
• City Academy, Washington, D.C.;
• William and Mary College;
• Georgetown College, Ky.;
• Elijah Slack’s School, Cincinnati;
• Miami University, Miami;
• University of Alabama;
• St. John’s College, Md.;
• East Tennessee College; and
• Virginia Military Institute.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995070023809524">
However, these engineering courses were no more than a minor
part of the instruction. It is important to observe that their emphasis was the teaching of infrastructure engineering—the main job
market of engineers of the time being railroads, canals, roads,
bridges, barrages, and harbors. Building engineering was added
quite as a consequence, since the principles of science for analyzing and designing bridges was identical to that for buildings, essentially those pertaining to Newton’s laws of motions and
calculus.
As can be evidently observed, the courses and content in all
universities were geared to the training of engineers for infrastructure development—whether they were in the military or civilian practice. However, by the early 1800s, the name of civil
engineer had become “stuck,” and universities had no opportunity
to give a different name to their training.
Graduating Civil Engineers: 1802–1852
The number of West Point graduates entering civilian service
began in 1818 with one individual. This number slowly increased
until it reached approximately 10 in 1828, 15 in 1830, passed 25
in 1833, was 39 in 1836, 96 in 1837, and 107 in 1838. The
cumulative number of civilian engineers, however, was more than
this, probably reaching 200 in 1837. Compare this to about
200,000 civil engineers in the United States today. A total of 231
West Point engineers from 1802 to 1837 went into civilian service
at some point in their lives ͑Calhoun 1960͒.
Between 1826 and 1843, the Partridge Academy produced
about 40–50 civilian engineers. RPI produced 48 civilian engineers from the 102 who graduated from their program between
1835 and 1843.
West Point, Partridge Academy, and RPI were the three main
suppliers of public works engineers in the days 1802–1843. Other
on-the-job trained engineers continued to exist. There are no
available formal census figures for the number of engineers and
civil engineers in the United States before 1850.
However, alarmed by the number of West Point graduates
leaving military service for civilian service, apparently for better
fortunes based on their excellent education, Congress forbade all
army engineers in 1838 to take employment with private companies. This put pressure on private universities to take up civil
engineering education, resulting in Yale and Harvard to begin
teaching the subject. With the formation of the American Society
of Civil Engineers and Architects ͑ASCEA͒, civil engineering
education would be given a major boost, and the need to debar
military engineers from entering civilian service would be slowly
diminished.
Nevertheless, we again see that the engineers were primarily
sought to work on internal improvement projects such as railroads, canals, harbors and docks, and roads and bridges—items
required for military mobility, as well as trade and commerce.
Thus, it is evident that the West Point engineer and the training

imparted at West Point served immensely to define the discipline

of Civil Engineering, as did the L’Ecole Militaire of France, and
the Corps’ of Engineers of Great Britain. It is also evident that the
Partridge Academy and RPI were formed as a consequence of the
existence of West Point. Further, there was none to little distinction between the work of West Point graduates engaged in military projects and those of Partridge and RPI engaged in civilian
public works projects. The only feature that distinguished them
was their uniform and their work in the military or civilian sectors. Hence, the concretization of civil engineering.

Moreover, those who could, went on to college, but they still
ended up working alongside those who did not or could not go to
college. Slowly, those with college degrees would increasingly
take up design works, creating an exclusive distinction from those
in construction who had no college degrees. But, the discipline
and work function was still the same—infrastructure engineering.
Early Background of Civil Engineering Societies
The Society for Promoting the Improvements of Roads and Inland
Navigation, which sought to promote the technical functions of
civil engineers, was perhaps the earliest public works organization in North America, being founded in 1789. They concerned
themselves with activities such as canals, locks, bridges, roads,
tunnels, tramways, breakwaters, harbor works, and industrial
installations.
Given that the military engineers of L’Ecole Militaire were
considered the finest, most sophisticated, and that the Royal Engineers in Britain had already been formed, West Point had
started to produce military engineers engaged in infrastructure
projects, and the fact that The Society for Promoting the Improvements of Roads and Inland Navigation had already commenced
its activities, whereas ICE had received a Royal Charter, a group
led by Mr. John Jervis proposed to start a national civil engineering organization, in 1836, that was distinct from the poorly
trained builders, on the one side, and the military engineers, on
the other. There was a need to make that distinction as the civilian
and military engineers worked on identical types of infrastructure
and public works projects, and the realities of contracting as well
as professional pride dictated such a distinction necessary. However, it was not until 1839 that this group was able to coordinate
its efforts to meet in Baltimore ͑Fairweather 2002; Calhoun
1960͒. During their deliberations, there were divisions among the
attendees, and the effort to form a civil engineering society was
not successful. It was not again until 1852—a long, 13 years
later—that the group of 1839 met with a slightly expanded group,
reinforced by those in the building trade, and formally established
the “American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects”
͑ASCEA͒.
A statement crafted by the committee in 1839 to describe the
work of their profession, brings out that their major interest was
public infrastructure works. They also recognized the success of
the Institution of Civil Engineers ͑U.K.͒ ͑Wisely 1974͒, thereby
accepting de facto ICE’s definition that constituted the art and
practice of civil engineering. Though journals of civil engineering
appeared later, the American Railroad Journal was already in
existence, and an article in that journal in 1840 explained reasons
behind the collapse of the 1839 effort in forming a civil engineering society, basically disagreements where the members were not
convinced of the need, not to mention that some participants came
from varying states and had not known each other. Railroad engineering was quintessentially the same field of study as other
infrastructure engineering fields, such as roads and bridges, the
principles of alignment and curve being similar. In this regard, it
is interesting that the American Railroad Journal was started in
1832, some time before the civil engineering societies were
formed.
The Boston Society of Civil Engineers ͑BSCE͒, founded in
1848, was consequently the first civil engineering organization in
America, not to mention that it was the first engineering society
of the United States, as well. Boston had a large concentration of
public works engineers, and Massachusetts was among the first
colonies to induct European technology, much of it from Great
Britain, becoming economically and technologically well developed. Boston had a bustling harbor, an elaborate road feeder system, and was a cultural hub for two centuries from the 17th to the
19th Centuries. But, as the BSCE was restricted to Massachusetts
and Connecticut, a civil engineering society was indicated to
serve the nation at large. A New York Institute of Civil Engineers
was formed in 1848, but ceased activity in 1850 for lack of support. Though the ASCEA was formed in 1852, the architects
opted out and formed their own society in 1857, thereby prompting ASCEA to change their name to just “ASCE” in 1868. It was
going to be 1877 before the name, ASCE, was registered legally
͑Fairweather 2002͒.
In any case, the ASCEA founded in 1852 met regularly until
1855, after which it experienced a hiatus of 12 years, much of
which can be attributed to the civil war, but also due to the fact
that the first President, James Laurie, a prime mover of ASCEA,
took assignments in Nova Scotia for two years, evaluating railroads and planning extensions; and six years as Chief Engineer of
the New Haven-Springfield and Hartford Railroad. Interestingly,
James Laurie was one of the founding fathers of the BSCE, in
addition to his activities in ASCE ͑Fairweather 2002͒.
Other societies were formed in the United States after ASCE,

American engineering societies. ICE is perhaps the oldest engineering society in the world, none other known to exist before
her. This correlates well with infrastructure engineering being the
first known engineering activity of ancient times, and with all
engineering being considered synonymous to civil engineering.
Basically, it appears that the move to form civil engineering
societies was to embody the knowledge pertaining to the practice
of infrastructure engineering and building construction. Much as
in earlier years, where all engineering was synonymous with civil
engineering, ASCEA first sought to be the society for all engineers and architects. ASCEA opened applications for its membership to architects, mining engineers, mechanical engineers, and
naval engineers. It was a mistaken and arrogant judgment, in the
writer’s opinion, that motivated the civil engineers of the day to
feel that all engineers should come under their umbrella, when
they well knew that not all engineers understood the designing of
machines and naval ships, neither through education nor through
training. It is understandable, however, to see why they sought to
include mining engineers, as the mining engineers moved and
supported earth much in the same way as the construction engi-

neers did. It is also understandable to see why they sought to
include the architects because the constructors of buildings were
among those who worked on internal improvement projects as
well, and West Point had defined civil engineering to include
building engineering and architecture. However, the industrial
progress of the 19th Century was to exert alternate forces that
would lead to other engineering bodies forming their own societies, the architects to break away from ASCEA, and for ASCE to
stop asking mining, naval, and mechanical engineers to join their
society.
Roots of Names of Civil Engineering Subdisciplines
The roots of the names of civil engineering subdisciplines are
given here.
“Construction engineering” takes directly from the Latin
construere meaning to make, build, or erect, thus directly relating
to the activities of the construction engineer. Basically, all that the
construction engineers really do is put together, organize, assemble, and build.
“Cost engineering,” we understand, implies the optimal management of money, which comes from the Latin word constare,
meaning to cost. There is no doubt what cost engineers aim to
achieve with respect to their profession.
“Environmental engineering” takes from the French word
environ meaning “around,” implying around the city, the surrounding area, or the city outskirts, which is what environmental
engineering concerns itself with—of the surrounding areas of
habitation, the forests, greens, and other life-supporting surrounds. Environ comes from two syllables in French—en ͑meaning “in”͒ϩviron ͑meaning circle, circuit͒. Hence, environ means
to enclose a circle, or encircle. Ment is a suffix suggesting
“about.” Thus, “environment” means “about the surrounds.”
“Geotechnical engineering” has geo as the root word, coming
from the Greek geo, which comes from ge, meaning “Earth.”
Obviously, “geotechnical” has to do with the technical properties
of soils and rocks that are of the Earth, and so their name represents the functions they are engaged in.
“Hydraulics engineering,” that studies the movement of
water and liquids, takes from the root word hydro meaning water,
which was the initial liquid studied as a general standard, not to
mention that rivers, lakes, and canals were all largely made of
water in contrast to other liquids. Hydro is a later adaptation of
the Greek hudor meaning water. The original form of hydraulics
is the Greek hydraulikos, which comes from three syllables—
hydr ͑meaning water͒ϩaulis ͑meaning a reed instrument through
which water is conducted͒ϩikos ͑meaning “relating to”͒. Hence,
hydraulics means relating to the flow of water through
enclosures—a very functional description.
“Sanitary engineering,” which is often studied under environmental engineering, relates to tasks that improve health conditions. “Sanitary” comes from the French sanitaire and the Latin
sanitas—meaning of or relating to health. Hence, the phrase
“sanitary engineering” portrays the area of emphasis of their
work.
“Structural engineering” comes from the Latin structus and
structura—a past participle of struere, which means to construct,
which is what structural engineers primarily purport to do. Their
designs serve to allow construction to take place.
The French word surveiller meaning to watch over, and the
medieval Latin word supervidere meaning to look over, both contribute to the development of the modern word “survey” from
which we have “surveying engineering.” There is no doubt that
surveyors “look over” the land and observe it ͓for its features͔.
The Middle French carried the words surveeir, surveer, and surveoir, meaning to look over. These words are composed of two
syllables—sur ͑meaning “above, up”͒ϩveeir ͑meaning “to look,”
“see”͒. When the surveyors peer through their theodolites, they
are literally “looking over” the topography.
“Transportation engineering” takes from the Latin transportare, meaning to carry from one place to another. Hence, we see
that automobiles, planes, and ships that pertain to transportation
engineering all carry goods and/or people from one destination to
another.
All the names for the previous engineering disciplines, within
the broader discipline of civil engineering, represent the activity
they engage in. There is no divergence or exception on this account.
The Importance of a Name
“What’s in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as
sweet” ͓Shakespeare ͑1564͒, Romeo and Juliet͔. Then, why give a
name at all, if that is the case? However, names are important for
representation and identification. It is the name that makes a person. Names are the nom de plume of people, institutions, and
nations.
Agonizing hours and days are often spent in giving names to
new committees, a newborn child, and to new institutions. All
those hours are meant to serve a purpose. Often, people are urged
to “live up to their name,” implying that only reputable, ethical,
legal, and honorable tasks should be done. It is the name that buys
reputation and prestige. A name says it all!
Native Indian names attempt to represent an activity of a person. Names of people in most parts of the world carry a meaning
to them. Names of institutions generally seek to represent the
given activity they are engaged in. For instance, no one can doubt
that the American Concrete Institute deals with concrete. I cannot
see how anyone can deny that the name of an institution must be
representative of its activities. But, in the case of ASCE, civil
engineering just does not represent the functions of its engineers.
Observations
By tracing the history, evolution, and education of civil engineering, it becomes clear that nothing that is not infrastructure, public
works, and building or factory construction is civil engineering. It
is important to see this in the opposite way to understand what
civil engineers are all about. When we look at the history and
origin of civil engineering, we discover a pattern of activities in
infrastructure activities for both civilian and military use, with
building engineering added later starting with West Point’s definition of civil engineering.
That notwithstanding, there is no cogent reason for civil engineering to be given the name it has, for it to have relevance in the
modern world. Moreover, its activities are undertaken by military
engineers as well, and we all know that military engineers get
their degrees in civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering from

between them and their uniformed brethren is not at all in the
engineering tasks performed, but in that their uniformed brethren
learn to carry a rifle, are trained in combat and bomb disposal
techniques, and learn military strategy. There are many other engineering activities practiced in the civilian sector—such as electrical and mechanical—that are not called civil engineering, even
though the military uses those fields of engineering. Hence, there
is little logic in assigning the name of civil engineering to the
activities of civilian engineers alone engaged in infrastructure
works.
The evolution and origin of the names of engineering disciplines is very logical and meaningful in representing the activities
they are engaged in, tracing to Greek, French, or Latin words,
sometimes to mythology, except for that of civil engineering.
There is no use for civil engineers to continue living in the
past for the constraints of military and civilian that are not applicable in the emancipated and educated society of today where
globalization is commonplace. The militaries of the 18th and 19th
Centuries in Britain and France were particularly elitist, and this
created a class distinction between the activities of the military
engineers and other engineers engaged in similar works. There is
no compelling reason today for the discipline to distinguish itself
from the military engineers. The British military, for instance, and
some other professional militaries around the world, as well, have
a Corps of Signals responsible for communication services—
having electronics engineering as the core discipline there.
Armies also have a Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers
for repair and maintenance of ordnance, weapons, and armaments, including battle tanks; this corps has mechanical and electrical engineering as its basic functions. Apparently, even the
name Corps’ of Engineers is past in its value, as mechanical,
electrical, industrial, or chemical engineers, or any other engineer
save civil engineer do not become members of the corps. Correspondingly, Corps’ of Engineers is an anachronism, as well.
Military engineering has vastly changed in composition, nature, and emphasis over the past 150 years. Similarly, civil engineering is no longer applicable for the profession it wishes to
represent, belonging instead to an era long gone by. Quite frankly,
it is strange for military engineers to call themselves civil engineers as they do these days: quite an oxymoron, since military is
the antonym of civilian.
Many civilian activities are not engineering, many civilian engineering activities involve other disciplines, and many military
engineering activities incorporate civil engineering. Hence, civil
engineering fits in neither one mold nor the other. There is no
apparent need for the profession of Civil Engineering to play
second fiddle to Military Engineering. But, tracing the origins of
Civil Engineering, it is apparent that Civil Engineering was second or subordinate to Military Engineering in the 18th and 19th
Centuries. It therefore seems that it is time to give a true name to
the practice of civil engineering works, such that it can stand in its
own right, rather than being in contrast or comparison to any
other discipline or profession.

What Should We Name Ourselves?

<bodyText confidence="0.999683285714286">
The thesis rests here after bringing out the inappropriateness of
the name civil engineering. A name change is a logical step, and
could be considered by the ASCE Board of Directors. Some additional brainstorming among the larger committees and groups of
ASCE may be the formal route for discussion and debate to initiate a name change. It is, however, beyond the scope of this
paper to discuss what the new name should or should not be,
whether it really should be changed to follow the logic presented
here, or whether a suitable alternative name can at all be found.

Black Sheep

<bodyText confidence="0.987128833333333">
So, the problem and interest persists, but it is quite obvious that
civil engineering is the only black sheep of all engineering disciplines, especially from among the 25 major engineering disciplines and subdisciplines of civil engineering considered in this
article, as its name does not represent the technical functions and
activities undertaken by its practitioners.
Conclusions
The word engineer is appropriate enough to describe the activities
of the civil engineering profession, having been a word that traces
to the 14th Century, and deriving from the Greek ␥␧␯ that originates in the Sanskrit jan, meaning life, implying that engineers
give life to creative ideas. Up until the 18th Century, engineer was
synonymous with the tasks of infrastructure engineering, and it
was not until John Smeaton was compelled to submit his testimony to court that differentiation became necessary between the
military and civilian engineers. The British Corps of Royal Engineers were commonly known as engineers and performed functions of all engineering disciplines. Even today, the British and
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are known as just that—“Corps of
Engineers”—not “Corps of Civil Engineers,” even though the
functions of the Corps of Engineers are subject matter learned in
civil engineering schools. The study confirms that engineering
was the name assigned, since the very beginning of civilization,
to activities such as the construction of roads and bridges, aqueducts, river training, and irrigation, and represent the application
of ingenuity. The word engineer, it was seen, also has nontechnical applications in the English language.
However, the word civil in civil engineering was a word
coined out of convenience—not to represent any function of the
engineers practicing infrastructure development—but to differentiate those working in the civilian sector from those engaged in
military engineering. Whereas, the roots of names of all the other
engineering disciplines discussed in the paper—industrial, mining, electrical, chemical, mechanical, agricultural, safety, etc.—
are traced to a specific function they perform, civil can best be
traced to civilian and the Latin civilis meaning polite. This renders civil engineering the only engineering discipline to have a
name that does not represent the works it undertakes.
The roots of all civil engineering subdisciplines—
geotechnical, surveying, structures, transportation, cost, and
hydraulics—are also all seen to have their root in a term that
represents the functional applications of the subdiscipline, which
is consistent with what we are seeking. Again, civil engineering is
the only exception, even in comparison to its subdisciplines. Consequently, civil engineering is a term whose era is past and application is null.
To differentiate the military engineer from the civilian engineer is a meaningless concept rooted in the past, with no significance today, because all functional tasks performed by the civilian engineers are performed by the military engineers, as well.
There is an incongruity between calling some military engineers
as civil engineers for at least three reasons:

realm are not those related to infrastructure or public works
engineering. Thus, mechanical and electrical engineering, for
example, would also be called civil engineering if the logic
of the 18th Century were to be applied today.
Thus, the oldest engineering discipline, and the very first engineering society of the United States still in existence today—
ASCE—has a name that has lost its relevance. This paper
extracts—after a comprehensive study of the history, evolution,
and formation of the discipline and its societies—that the name of
civil engineering is void of substance that does not connote what
the discipline is about. ͑This does not imply that civil engineering
itself is void of substance, and no such meaning is intentioned.͒
This indicates that a name change may be in order.
So, what’s in a name? Actually, plenty is. A name is the nom
de plume of an institution. Civil engineers cannot boast of their
name representing the tasks and functions they perform. What the
new name should or should not be is not attempted to be addressed in this paper.
Appendix I. Contemporary Words Having Their Root
in Gen
͑Word source: American Heritage Dictionary, 3rd Ed., 1996͒
Whereas engineer has its roots in gen, other words of the English language also have their root in gen—related to life or giving birth. For example, “renaissance” means giving birth to the
new; “innate” can be understood as having life as natural; “genocide” is the taking away of life; and “gene” is the basic ͑form͒ of
life; “pregnant” is the ͑state͒ before life. Similarly, the reader can
extend the interpretation of the words below to terms of life and
birth—all of which go back to the Sanskrit jan, meaning life.

the backbone of the advancement of American civil engineering, as public works engineers gained experience and expertise

164,000 in 1890. Strangely, Calhoun ͑1960͒ reports only

͑July
2005͒. The first President of the United States is credited with
being the nation’s “first engineer,” with Engineers’ Week being
traditionally celebrated during the week of his birthday—the
last week of February. George Washington started as a surveyor apprentice at the tender age of 15 and went on to become reputed for his surveying skills. However, he attended no
formal, technical school, but was certified as a fully qualified
surveyor by William and Mary College upon the passing of an
examination. This article says “On June 9, 1778, at Valley
Forge, Pennsylvania, General George Washington issued a call
for engineers and engineering education. This order is considered the genesis of a U.S. Army Engineer School, which found
its permanent home at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.” Again, “In
1794, President Washington established a Corps of Artillerists
and Engineers to be educated and stationed at West Point in
New York, which later become the US Military Academy at
West Point.” The author adds “He ͓George Washington͔ promoted construction of roads, canals, the Capitol, docks and
ports, water works, and new efforts to extract coal and ores
and develop manufacturing resources.” The infrastructure and
know-how to build infrastructure thus developed, helped USA
expand westwards in the 1800s.

various original inventions to him for his defense. Such military needs were carried on to later centuries, with the military
becoming the foremost user of engineering skills, which is
what led to civil engineering receiving the name it did.

words, Shipley writes that the words “bind, bond, band, bandage, bondage, riband, and ribbon” trace to the Sanskrit
bhendh {currently bandh}, meaning to “tie.” The words “gnosis, gnostic, and agnostic” trace their root to the Sanskrit root
gn from whence came gyana ͑meaning “knowledge”͒; Shipley
reports that the word, “know, knew, and ͓knowledge͔” follow
from gn, and this can be recognized as the phonetics of gn and
“kn” are the same in English. More interestingly, he reports
that the words “come” and “go” follow from the Sanskrit gua

though the transformations to “come” are not explained. . . .

“stand,” he fails to mention that the Sanskrit sthun, meaning
stationary and sthan, meaning fixed place, are the derivatives
of words such as “stand, stay, stance, circumstance, status,
static, standard, density, destination, constant, constitution,
store, storage, statue, statutory, station, stationary, and tenure.”
