traffic congestion problems around Nantou area, the roadway network should be
completely reviewed, especially for the National Highway 3's interchange system. The
key assess is the Zucih bridge located at the edge of the Nantou city with the
station 228K+500 on the National Freeway 3. Well constructed interchange system will
definitely improve the traffic congestion problem in Nantou City. After that the
Nantou County will possess the advantages for developing the industrious field. The
purpose of this study is to conduct a quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefit-cost
analysis of the construction project in order to evaluate the economic benefits of
the location and route of the Nantou interchange. To do this, benefit-cost ratio(B/C)
and net present value(NPV) will be used as quantifiable indicators, while for
non-quantifiable indicators (such as land value, property value, and commerce
benefits) more concrete figures will be used when possible in order to fully
understand the economic benefits of this project. Further steps were taken to analyze
the feasibility of the proposed construction. The findings of our research are to be
used to contribute to the project's construction team.<component x="112.68"

Highway 3 began in 1987, and in 2004 it was open for use. Running through northern
and southern Nantou, the highway plays an important role as a transportation thorough
way throughout the area. However, after opening the thorough way to traffic use, it
was found that the unsatisfactory location of certain sections of the interchange
brought considerable inconveniences to road users. Nantou City currently uses the
Nantou interchange to join National Freeway 3, but due to the interchange's location
in the northern most regions of Nantou City, city traffic must first travel by way of
Provincial Highway 3 in order to join the interchange. Also, because the Nan Kung
Industrial Zone is located in the most northern region on the west side of the
Provincial Highway 3, the highway is frequently accessed by large vehicles.
Therefore, during peak commuting hours, the Nantou interchange and the surrounding
roads often experience congestion. In particular, Provincial Highway 3 and the
Zhongxing Rd. section of Provincial Highway 14B experience the worst congestion.
Therefore, in order to solve the traffic problems in and around Nantou City and make
a more complete road system in the Nantou living area, it is in necessary to review
National Highway 3 and the Nantou area interchange system. This study's economic
benefit analysis is current to the year 2007 with 2040 set as the target year and
2023 as the intermediate period. Its purpose is to provide an economic benefit
analysis of the feasibility of constructing an additional interchange to directly
link Nantou District roads to National Highway 3 so as to provide a fast and
convenient transportation system in the Nantou Region, as well as consider the
project of connecting East Min Rd and Jhongjheng Rd. with Zucih bridge to allow the
future transportation network to form a complete system (see Fig.1).<component

Assessment This economic assessment uses benefit-cost analysis to monetize and
compare the costs and benefits of the project, and seeks to understand the economic
feasibility of the implementation plan through assessment indicators such as net
present value (NPV), and benefit-cost ratio (B/C) (Greene and Wegener, 1997). Net
Present Value Net present value is a convenient and widely used method for assessing
public construction investment projects because it takes into account the time value
of money as well as the cost and benefit of the project's entire lifespan. During the
assessment period, the difference between the present value of the total benefit
stream and the present value of the total cost stream is measured (Luis and Luis,
2008). When the benefit is greater than the cost, the investment plan is conducive to
the use of social resources. The method of calculation is as follows:<component

benefit-cost ratio uses the difference between the net present value of the benefits
and the net present value of the costs as an analytical assessment of the feasibility
of the project. When the benefit-cost ratio (B/C) value is greater than 1, the
investment is economically feasible. The larger the ratio is the better. If the B/C
value is less than 1, then the investment is not worth it (Boardman et al, 1996;
Getzner, 2008). The formula for the benefit-cost ratio is as follows:<component

research summary, the project to build an on and off ramp is estimated at NT$1
billion, which, when compared to the original plan, would save NT$1.5 billion.
However, the required future annual maintenance cost is estimated to be more and this
does not include the increase in travel cost due to diverting southbound traffic.
Sensitivity Analysis In view of the above assumed factors of economic benefit
analysis, there still exists many uncertainties. Therefore, this study conducted a
sensitivity analysis of the variables (factors such as the construction cost, land
acquisition cost, operating cost, inflation cost, discount rate, time value of money,
travel cost and the time value of goods) which could possibly affect the assessment
results in order to understand how a change in each factor could affect the economic
benefit analysis (Helton et al. 2006). Overall, while conducting an analysis of the
affects of variations in variables, if the change in a factor does not affect the
possibility of plan implementation, then this factor can be considered stable and
controllable. Otherwise, a risk management assessment should be carried out on those
that are not stable and controllable. Discount rate changes in the sensitivity
analysis The higher the discount rate, the higher the cost of investment, and the
lower the economic benefits of investment. This project is feasible at a discount
rate under 17%. However, at a 17% discount rate the NPV would be NT$40.8 million, and
all economic indicators show the project to be infeasible (see Table 6.3
below).<component x="112.68" y="615.92" width="392.48" height="80.12" page="6"

National Highway 3's 228k+500 section in Nantou will increase traffic in the area and
change the route of transport. Thus, in order to enhance the systems accessibility
and improve the efficiency of transport in the area, an operations benefits analysis
of the additional ramp was conducted. The transportation benefits include saving
travel time, travel cost, production cost, etc. Benefit Analysis Conclusion This
comprehensive analysis estimates the costs and benefits(the saving of travel time,
travel cost, production cost, etc) of the construction of the ramp and connecting
roads, which both present implementation policies that are necessary and feasible,
and that: (1) Could establish a better network of roads within the residential area
of Nantou which would improve transportation accessibility and convenience. (2) Could
link such areas as Nantou City, Chung Hsing New Village, Chungliao, Ming Jian County
(the Pine Ridge tea producing area) and Tsaotun; open up the area to potential
development; and promote its tourist industry. (3) Could strengthen the network of
roads in the residential areas, improve the regions standard of living, and set up a
core urban community both convenient and accessible. Benefit Analysis Recommendation
Well planned interchange system will be able to keep all the traffic flow going
around the roadway network. Therefore, the on and off ramp on the Zucih Bridge with
the good alignment to connect the local roadway are really needed in order to improve
the traffic congestion problem in the Nantou area. According, the area economy will
develop through the local logistics system.<component x="112.68" y="130.34"

Provincial Highway 3 in order to join the interchange. Also, because the Nan Kung
Industrial Zone is located in the most northern region on the west side of the
Provincial Highway 3, the highway is frequently accessed by large vehicles.
Therefore, during peak commuting hours, the Nantou interchange and the surrounding
roads often experience congestion. In particular, Provincial Highway 3 and the
Zhongxing Rd. section of Provincial Highway 14B experience the worst congestion.
Therefore, in order to solve the traffic problems in and around Nantou City and make
a more complete road system in the Nantou living area, it is in necessary to review
National Highway 3 and the Nantou area interchange system. This study's economic
benefit analysis is current to the year 2007 with 2040 set as the target year and
2023 as the intermediate period. Its purpose is to provide an economic benefit
analysis of the feasibility of constructing an additional interchange to directly
link Nantou District roads to National Highway 3 so as to provide a fast and
convenient transportation system in the Nantou Region, as well as consider the
project of connecting East Min Rd and Jhongjheng Rd. with Zucih bridge to allow the
future transportation network to form a complete system (see Fig.1).<component

Assessment This economic assessment uses benefit-cost analysis to monetize and
compare the costs and benefits of the project, and seeks to understand the economic
feasibility of the implementation plan through assessment indicators such as net
present value (NPV), and benefit-cost ratio (B/C) (Greene and Wegener, 1997). Net
Present Value Net present value is a convenient and widely used method for assessing
public construction investment projects because it takes into account the time value
of money as well as the cost and benefit of the project's entire lifespan. During the
assessment period, the difference between the present value of the total benefit
stream and the present value of the total cost stream is measured (Luis and Luis,
2008). When the benefit is greater than the cost, the investment plan is conducive to
the use of social resources. The method of calculation is as follows:<component

benefit-cost ratio uses the difference between the net present value of the benefits
and the net present value of the costs as an analytical assessment of the feasibility
of the project. When the benefit-cost ratio (B/C) value is greater than 1, the
investment is economically feasible. The larger the ratio is the better. If the B/C
value is less than 1, then the investment is not worth it (Boardman et al, 1996;
Getzner, 2008). The formula for the benefit-cost ratio is as follows:<component

research summary, the project to build an on and off ramp is estimated at NT$1
billion, which, when compared to the original plan, would save NT$1.5 billion.
However, the required future annual maintenance cost is estimated to be more and this
does not include the increase in travel cost due to diverting southbound traffic.
Sensitivity Analysis In view of the above assumed factors of economic benefit
analysis, there still exists many uncertainties. Therefore, this study conducted a
sensitivity analysis of the variables (factors such as the construction cost, land
acquisition cost, operating cost, inflation cost, discount rate, time value of money,
travel cost and the time value of goods) which could possibly affect the assessment
results in order to understand how a change in each factor could affect the economic
benefit analysis (Helton et al. 2006). Overall, while conducting an analysis of the
affects of variations in variables, if the change in a factor does not affect the
possibility of plan implementation, then this factor can be considered stable and
controllable. Otherwise, a risk management assessment should be carried out on those
that are not stable and controllable. Discount rate changes in the sensitivity
analysis The higher the discount rate, the higher the cost of investment, and the
lower the economic benefits of investment. This project is feasible at a discount
rate under 17%. However, at a 17% discount rate the NPV would be NT$40.8 million, and
all economic indicators show the project to be infeasible (see Table 6.3
below).<component x="112.68" y="615.92" width="392.48" height="80.12" page="6"

National Highway 3's 228k+500 section in Nantou will increase traffic in the area and
change the route of transport. Thus, in order to enhance the systems accessibility
and improve the efficiency of transport in the area, an operations benefits analysis
of the additional ramp was conducted. The transportation benefits include saving
travel time, travel cost, production cost, etc. Benefit Analysis Conclusion This
comprehensive analysis estimates the costs and benefits(the saving of travel time,
travel cost, production cost, etc) of the construction of the ramp and connecting
roads, which both present implementation policies that are necessary and feasible,
and that: (1) Could establish a better network of roads within the residential area
of Nantou which would improve transportation accessibility and convenience. (2) Could
link such areas as Nantou City, Chung Hsing New Village, Chungliao, Ming Jian County
(the Pine Ridge tea producing area) and Tsaotun; open up the area to potential
development; and promote its tourist industry. (3) Could strengthen the network of
roads in the residential areas, improve the regions standard of living, and set up a
core urban community both convenient and accessible. Benefit Analysis Recommendation
Well planned interchange system will be able to keep all the traffic flow going
around the roadway network. Therefore, the on and off ramp on the Zucih Bridge with
the good alignment to connect the local roadway are really needed in order to improve
the traffic congestion problem in the Nantou area. According, the area economy will
develop through the local logistics system.<component x="112.68" y="130.34"
