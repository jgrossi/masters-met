a major problem in civil engineering. If the ground is untreated it is not uncommon
for the construction machinery to get bogged down, and bearing capacity or slope
failure may occur because of inadequate soil strength. Both short-term and long-term
settlement may occur, causing severe maintenance problems for highway engineers.
Differential settlement between bridges on piled foundations and approach embankments
may inconvenience and endanger motorists as well as other road users. Problems
arising from floods and droughts also need attention, because they can cause severe
distortion in the embankment due to swelling or shrinking of expansive soils.
Excessive settlement due to the construction of embankments over soft clay is best
dealt with by pre-consolidating the clay until the anticipated settlement under the
design load is enforced to an acceptable level. Fibredrains, a vertical drain
manufactured with biodegradable jute and coir fibres, are installed from a sand
platform into the compressible clay deposit at a spacing designed to achieve the
desired degree of consolidation within the project duration under the predetermined
surcharge intensity. If post-construction secondary compression is significant, it
can be reduced by placing a higher surcharge than required for primary consolidation.
Surface deposits with low shear strength and stiffness can be treated
cost-effectively by the application of high-energy impact (HEI) to enforce settlement
and improve bearing capacity. HEI application consists of dropping a heavy pounder,
ranging normally from 10 t to 40 t, from a height usually of about 10-25 m via a
platform of granular fill. Variations of this method are useful for treating surface
deposits of loose granular soil by dynamic compaction (DC), soft clayey soil by
dynamic replacement (DR), and peaty clay by dynamic replacement and mixing (DRM). By
tamping the ground in a regular grid pattern, settlement is enforced on the
underlying soft soils, leading to densification in sandy soils and reinforcement in
clayey deposits. Fibredrains with surcharge and HEI application have been used
separately or in combination in several soil improvement projects in the Southeast
Asian region. The sequence of soil treatment is shown schematically in Fig. 1.
Details of treatment, improved ground conditions and mitigation of long-term
settlements are discussed in subsequent sections.<component x="44.84" y="72.25"

under the embankment loading consists of two parts: primary and secondary
compression, especially if the subsoil is composed of clay of volcanic or highly
compressible peaty origin. The primary compression can be eliminated by
pre-consolidating the clay with Fibredrains and surcharge before the construction of
the pavement. The secondary component, which leads to post-construction settlement,
should be kept within the tolerable limits of maintenance. If excessive, a greater
portion of secondary compression can be eliminated by placing a surcharge higher than
that required for primary consolidation settlement. Evaluation of consolidation

drains (PVDs) are manufactured with a polymeric core and a geotextile filter sleeve.
Fibredrain, a PVD developed at the National University of Singapore, consists of four
axial coir strands enveloped within a filter comprising two layers of jute burlap
(Lee et al., 1995). Jute in raw form, after preliminary treatment, is spun into yarns
and woven into burlap, which is used for the two filter layers. Coconut coir used in
the core is spun into strands after preliminary processing. Figs 4 and 5 show
respectively a bale of Fibredrains delivered on site and a schematic view of
Fibredrain. It has shown satisfactory performance in many projects in Southeast Asia
and Japan involving the treatment of soft marine and fluvial clays, as well as peaty
clays, and in some cases in conjunction with surface densification using the
application of high-energy impact (HEI). From the environmental point of view, the
energy consumption of jute and coir products in the production, transformation and
utilisation/disposal stages is much lower than that of synthetic products (De, 1994).
The raw materials for the production of Fibredrain are natural fibres extracted from
jute plants and ripened coconuts, both of which are renewable resources. Jute plants
and coconut trees grow in soil with nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and trace
elements, as well as water, sunlight and carbon dioxide. No air pollutants or water
pollutants are generated during this process. The production of jute fibres and
coconut coir is labour intensive, requiring land and manpower as the main inputs. The

When used in stabilising soft subsoil, Fibredrain decomposes biologically after the
consolidation process. The decomposed products are organic wastes with traces of
methane and carbon dioxide, which are non-polluting. It is a green product,
environmentally friendly and ecologically harmonious. Some of the laboratory tests
conducted to examine the properties of et al. found in Karunaratne Fibredrain are
reported in the following; further details can be (1999). Tensile strength Figure 6

Fibredrain can withstand installation stresses, and high-energy tamping while

potential The large apparent opening size (AOS) of Fibredrains, in ( the range
200-600 m, serves to tap pervious layers and lenses in clay deposits. The double
filter layer, which has a smaller effective AOS, intercepts the clay slurry generated
immediately after installation of the Fibredrain in the clay as the mandrel is
withdrawn. The cross-plane permeability of the filter was measured under a constant
head across a stack of four identical burlaps fastened across an open end of a et al.
circular cylinder (Lee , 1994). The cross-plane filter permeability determined in
this way for clean water was ( 5 better than 10 m/s. This is equivalent to the
hydraulic conductivity of fine sand, which helps in tapping natural drainage layers
such as sand and silt seams, lenses and other pervious paths. Clay slurry with water
content from 65% to 600% was passed through the four burlap layers mentioned . above
under a pressure head of 0 5 m of water. About 2 l of marine clay slurry at a water
content of 260-600% flowed w out within 15 min. For Singapore marine clay (
&#xBC;70%) at L a water content of 65%, the passage of water was slower but clear
from the beginning. This scenario is similar to the field installation stage of PVDs
as the mandrel is withdrawn, when disturbed slurry clay under high water pressure
tends to rush through the filter into the core. The four burlap filter layers were
removed carefully and cleaned in an ultrasonic agitator to extract the clay embedded
in each burlap layer separately. Gravimetric analysis showed that soil particles were
retained on the outermost burlap layer and the immediately adjacent inner layer, but
no particles were detected in the third or fourth burlap layers (Fig. 7(a)). The

was confined largely to an increase in the thickness and longitudinal compression of
the drain without kinking. Axial compression in the Fibredrain is manifested largely
as an increase in cross-sectional area, mainly because of the unwinding
characteristics of jute fibres in both the filter layer and the core. The resulting
increase in cross-sectional area and the decrease in filter opening size enhance the
unclogged water flow into the drain. The above experimental results show that the
effective C of the same clay under the same consolidation pressures h et is a
function of the performance of different PVDs. Aboshi &#xBC; al. w (2001) reported
the consolidation of Hiroshima clay ( L . &#xBC; &#xBC; &#xBC; w C P 49%, 21%, 0 36,
300 kPa) at 15 m depth and P C C &#xBC; &#xBC; &#xBC; w w C clay from Kojima Bay,
Japan ( 64%, 22%, L P C . &#xBC; P 0 53, 78 kPa) in 300 mm diameter laboratory
consolidaC tion cells with Fibredrain and PD. Pore pressure measurements in the
Fibredrain test showed zero excess pore pressure at the end of primary consolidation,
whereas the PD test showed 5 m of water head remaining at respective axial strains of
24% and 19%. The measurement of axial 3 permeability at the end of the test was
reported to be 7 ( 9 10 m/s for Fibredrain and zero for PD, illustrating the effect
of kinking. Examination of the drain materials after the tests showed that Fibredrain
had increased its thickness without kinking, whereas the PD had developed three to
four kinks, which completely curtailed the axial flow capacity, as shown in Fig. 9.
Axial discharge capacity To evaluate the discharge capacity of Fibredrain a 200 mm
long specimen was installed at the centre of a 100 mm w w diameter cylinder of
Singapore marine clay ( &#xBC;65%, N L &#xBC; &#xBC; w 70%, 40%). A coarse sand
layer, 10 mm thick, was P provided at both ends of the clay cylinder, which was
enclosed within a large-diameter triaxial membrane. The discharge capacity was
measured by connecting the drainage ends to a constant-head tank. The lateral
pressure was increased in stages, and the volume change in the clay cylinder was
measured, followed by determination of the et al. discharge capacity under each
pressure (Karunaratne , 1999). Figure 10(a) shows the mean discharge capacity of
Fibredrain under several hydraulic gradients plotted against argument of lateral

degree of primary consolidation, say 80% under surcharge, which is equivalent to 100%
primary consolidation under design load, within a prescribed time is determined, as
usual, by D means of equation (3) using the influence diameter and C effective
determined from Fig. 10b. For example, under a h . &#xBC; i S lateral pressure of 200

reduced by decreasing because Q this leads to larger , which will be greater than the
R effective discharge capacity of the drain under the lateral pressure and hydraulic
gradient. In most cases the effective C C is smaller than the of the soil determined
in the h h laboratory (Rowe, 1968; Head, 1985). If the latter is smaller, it should
be used in equation (3) to determine the time of consolidation. Back-analysis of

highways over a variety of site conditions, varying subsoil material may be
encountered, ranging from cohesive to granular soil, including organic peat in
waterlogged ground, and waste material from mine areas and landfills. The deep-seated
clay soil can be treated with Fibredrains and surcharge. For surface deposits, the
application of high-energy impact (HEI) has been successfully employed in several
projects in this region et al. et al. (Choa , 1979; Lee , 1989) and elsewhere (Lukas,
1986). When improving in situ soil deposits by HEI, one of the physical limitations
usually met is the depth. With standard HEI techniques it is generally not economical
or practical to reach depths exceeding 5-7 m below the ground surface for clay or
8-l0 m below the ground surface for sand. When the type of soil to be improved
varies, it is customary to change the improvement technique. With HEI application the
method and equipment remain essentially the same, but allowance is made in the
application of the energy level and intensity. HEI application consists of dropping a
heavy pounder ranging from l0 to 40 t from a height, usually about 10- 25 m, via a
platform of granular fill. To treat loose granular deposits dynamic compaction (DC)
was used effectively for more than three decades (Menard and Broise, 1975; Ramaset
al. wamy , 1979). In the case of soft clay it is found to be ineffective when used
alone on saturated soft clay as the pore pressure dissipation is governed only by the
permeabilet al. ity of the clay (Choa , 1979). For partly saturated et cohesive soil
it is found to be quite effective (Ramaswamy al. , 1979). When the clay is soft and
saturated, sand columns can be formed with HEI by systematically punching sand into
the clay. This method, known as dynamic replacement et al. soil (Lee (DR), has been
used successfully even in a gap-graded sandy , 1984). An adaptation of DR for peaty
clay et al. (Lee , 1984) produced sand columns and sand claquage within the peat when
increased pounding energy was applied directly on the sand columns. This technique,
described as dynamic replacement and mixing (DRM), has been able to eliminate overall
settlement, including a large percentage of the long-term secondary components. The
principle of successful implementation of HEI application lies in recognising the
most appropriate energy levels to be used. The earlier approach of using empiricism
based on field operation is complemented by a more rational approach of determining
the enforced settlement, which is a function of the imposed stress from the structure
to be built et upon the soil and the soil modulus or compressibility. Lo al. (1990)
showed that there is a unique relationship between the saturation intensity applied
through HEI and the enforced settlement. Fig. 11 shows the enforced settlement upon
application of HEI energy in various projects worldwide. It can be seen that for
every site (depending upon the soil characteristics and geometric configuration,
involving depth, water table and stratification) there is a saturated I intensity
beyond which further HEI application produces s no tangible results in terms of
settlement. Fig. 12 illustrates the operational parameters in HEI application, namely

about 5-7 m in depth, long-term consolidation settlement can be accelerated by
Fibredrains and surcharge. In the approach of this scheme, shown in Fig. 1, in which
Fibredrains are installed at predetermined spacing, a granular mat 1-2 m thick is
placed on the ground and HEI is applied at an appropriate energy level to improve the

install Fibredrains and surcharge to accelerate consolidation of the underlying soft
clay, and subsequently use HEI application for surface as well as fill compaction,
the suitability of Fibredrains to withstand HEI was checked in several projects;
otherwise the drain would be ruptured and its continuity impaired. As shown in Fig.
1, a working platform for the installation machines should be made with a suitable
material available with fines less than 10% for a minimum of 50 cm in thickness. The
drains should terminate in this sandy platform. For HEI application, if required, a
similar working platform is adequate except that the thickness should be in. creased
to about 1-1 5 m. Based on the anticipated settlement under the embankment and the
modulus of the subsoil, the energy level to be used will be determined. With the
progress of HEI more sand will be added and finally the surcharge fill is placed in
accordance with the drain design. The construction of the embankment follows
afterwards. A suitable material should be selected; highly swelling minerals should
be avoided in order to prevent excessive absorption of water within the embankment
during wet weather and shrinkage during dry weather, which might result in distress
in the pavement. In the event that the use of such materials is unavoidable, then
they should be shielded from fluctuations of the water table and from
flooding.<component x="42.35" y="148.62" width="245.09" height="272.09" page="8"

Malaysia The use of vertical drains and surcharge in conjunction with HEI application
for the treatment of ex-mining land for et al. a housing project (Lee , 1989) is
briefly presented. A safe 2 . bearing pressure of 60 kN/m with a factor of safety of
2 5 was necessary for this project. The site, near Kuala Lumpur, is composed of mine
tailing soils consisting of loose sandy deposits to very soft clayey soils. Soil
profiles from typical borehole log show that Nvalues are less than 2 blows/30 cm in
clays and between 2 and 10 blows/30 cm in sands. The construction commenced with
placing a working platform with selected fill materials containing fines less than
10%. To treat the deep-seated clay, varying from 9 m to . 21 m, Fibredrains were
first installed at 1 5 m square spacing, followed by the application of HEI from a 15
t pounder falling freely from heights of between 10 m and 25 m. With 6 3 to 12 blows
per pass for three passes, over a 6 m 6 m grid together with a fourth 'ironing pass',
energy of 225-250 2 t m/m for DC was imparted in the sandy areas and 270- 2 335 t m/m
for DR in the clayey deposits. A surcharge fill of . 4 5 m was placed; the resulting
settlement was monitored, and was found to taper off in 60-70 days. Fig. 14(a) shows
the load-time-settlement curve for the surcharge as observed in three settlement
plates. Fibredrains and surcharge combined with HEI enforced an anticipated total
settlement of the order of 1 m. Fig. 14b illustrates the improvement shown by CPT
before and after the HEI application. Plate load tests carried out subsequently
showed negligible settlement. This case record shows that using vertical drains,
surcharge and HEI application, a safe bearing capacity adequate for five-storey
residential houses can be easily achieved. For highway embankment construction this
treatment method can be easily adopted. Peaty soil treatment in Singapore A series of

measurements of completed . dykes, the settlement is estimated to be of the order of
1 5- . 2 0 m. The incorporation of bamboo rafts and bamboo clusters with Fibredrains
can be utilised in the construction of highway embankments over shallow water
underlain by soft ground. Concluding remarks A considerable part of the cost incurred
in the construction of highway embankments on soft ground arises from the need to
pre-treat the soft soil in the foundation. If proper soil treatment is not carried
out, protracted and costly road maintenance cannot be avoided. The most economical
method of dealing with embankment settlement on soft ground is to eliminate the
primary compression and a large portion of the secondary compression. The most
cost-effective method for achieving this objective is to consolidate the deep-seated
clay with Fibredrains and surcharge and to densify the surface deposits with HEI
application, if required. Fibredrains are proven to withstand installation and HEI
tamping stresses with the following performance characteristics in the consolidation
of soft soil. a C ( ) The effective coefficient of consolidation is a function h of
the hydraulic conductivity and compressibility of the soil as well as of the field
performance of the PVD. b ( ) PVD field behaviour is greatly influenced by the
deformation of the core and the filter, and the clogging and kinking of the drain. c
( ) In field monitoring, the slope of the settlement - time curve in the early stage
of consolidation multiplied by the influence area per drain gives the effective
discharge capacity of the PVD-soil system under the surcharge. d ( ) For Fibredrains,
the effective discharge capacity in the field is given in Fig. 10(a) as a function of
lateral pressure. The required discharge capacity is shown in S Fig. 10(b) as a
function of the final settlement for f various values of the influence diameter Dand
the C effective . With a given lateral pressure and final h S settlement the values
ofD Cand can be determined f h in Fig. 10. With these values of D Cand , the
consolidah tion time can be calculated from equation (3). e ( ) The consolidation
time cannot be reduced by decreasing D because this leads to an increase in . Qr f (
) It should be emphasised that Fibredrain continues to et al. function even at an
axial strain of 24% (Aboshi , 2001). In soil improvement projects where the PVD is
observed to be underperforming, the effective discharge capacity of the PVD should be
examined, with particular reference to the effect of kinking under axial strain
caused by settlement and clogging. The damage caused by installation stresses may be
important for PVD with lower tensile strength. For Fibredrain the effect of these
factors is not significant, as discussed earlier. g ( ) Fibredrain is environmentally
friendly in the production and transformation processes, and biodegradable in the
utilisation phase. Hence it is ecologically harmonious. h ( ) In highway construction
Fibredrains can be installed for the consolidation of soft subsoil accompanied by HEI
application for embankment construction, if required, because their high tensile
strength can withstand HEI. i ( ) Where embankment construction over shallow water
underlain by soft ground is required, bamboo raft and clusters with embedded
Fibredrains can be effectively used, ensuring rapid consolidation with satisfactory
foundation and slope stability.<component x="42.35" y="696.89" width="245.06"

a major problem in civil engineering. If the ground is untreated it is not uncommon
for the construction machinery to get bogged down, and bearing capacity or slope
failure may occur because of inadequate soil strength. Both short-term and long-term
settlement may occur, causing severe maintenance problems for highway engineers.
Differential settlement between bridges on piled foundations and approach embankments
may inconvenience and endanger motorists as well as other road users. Problems
arising from floods and droughts also need attention, because they can cause severe
distortion in the embankment due to swelling or shrinking of expansive soils.
Excessive settlement due to the construction of embankments over soft clay is best
dealt with by pre-consolidating the clay until the anticipated settlement under the
design load is enforced to an acceptable level. Fibredrains, a vertical drain
manufactured with biodegradable jute and coir fibres, are installed from a sand
platform into the compressible clay deposit at a spacing designed to achieve the
desired degree of consolidation within the project duration under the predetermined
surcharge intensity. If post-construction secondary compression is significant, it
can be reduced by placing a higher surcharge than required for primary consolidation.
Surface deposits with low shear strength and stiffness can be treated
cost-effectively by the application of high-energy impact (HEI) to enforce settlement
and improve bearing capacity. HEI application consists of dropping a heavy pounder,
ranging normally from 10 t to 40 t, from a height usually of about 10-25 m via a
platform of granular fill. Variations of this method are useful for treating surface
deposits of loose granular soil by dynamic compaction (DC), soft clayey soil by
dynamic replacement (DR), and peaty clay by dynamic replacement and mixing (DRM). By
tamping the ground in a regular grid pattern, settlement is enforced on the
underlying soft soils, leading to densification in sandy soils and reinforcement in
clayey deposits. Fibredrains with surcharge and HEI application have been used
separately or in combination in several soil improvement projects in the Southeast
Asian region. The sequence of soil treatment is shown schematically in Fig. 1.
Details of treatment, improved ground conditions and mitigation of long-term
settlements are discussed in subsequent sections.<component x="44.84" y="72.25"

under the embankment loading consists of two parts: primary and secondary
compression, especially if the subsoil is composed of clay of volcanic or highly
compressible peaty origin. The primary compression can be eliminated by
pre-consolidating the clay with Fibredrains and surcharge before the construction of
the pavement. The secondary component, which leads to post-construction settlement,
should be kept within the tolerable limits of maintenance. If excessive, a greater
portion of secondary compression can be eliminated by placing a surcharge higher than
that required for primary consolidation settlement. Evaluation of consolidation

Fibredrain, a PVD developed at the National University of Singapore, consists of four
axial coir strands enveloped within a filter comprising two layers of jute burlap
(Lee et al., 1995). Jute in raw form, after preliminary treatment, is spun into yarns
and woven into burlap, which is used for the two filter layers. Coconut coir used in
the core is spun into strands after preliminary processing. Figs 4 and 5 show
respectively a bale of Fibredrains delivered on site and a schematic view of
Fibredrain. It has shown satisfactory performance in many projects in Southeast Asia
and Japan involving the treatment of soft marine and fluvial clays, as well as peaty
clays, and in some cases in conjunction with surface densification using the
application of high-energy impact (HEI). From the environmental point of view, the
energy consumption of jute and coir products in the production, transformation and
utilisation/disposal stages is much lower than that of synthetic products (De, 1994).
The raw materials for the production of Fibredrain are natural fibres extracted from
jute plants and ripened coconuts, both of which are renewable resources. Jute plants
and coconut trees grow in soil with nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and trace
elements, as well as water, sunlight and carbon dioxide. No air pollutants or water

pointed out that the deterioration in strength does not imply a reduction in drainage
capacity, as observed in the Pantai Mutiara reclamation project in Jakarta, Indonesia
(see below), where Fibredrains performed satisfactorily for more et al. than two
years (Lee , 1988). Because of the high tensile . . strength (6 8 kN with 8 7% strain
at rupture), robustness and flexibility of the core and the jute filter layers,
Fibredrain can withstand installation stresses, and high-energy tamping while
retaining its drainage functions unimpaired. As the mandrel is driven into the ground
during the installation process, soils intrude into the mandrel through the interface
between the mandrel and the anchor shoe, and develop significant tensile forces in
the PVD as the mandrel is withdrawn. In recent field measurements of installation .
stresses on plastic PVDs, a tensile force of 1 4 kN on the filter was recorded at an
installation depth of 30 m (Karunaratne et al., 2002). It is imperative that the PVD
should possess sufficient tensile strength to withstand these tensile
forces.<component x="42.35" y="280.43" width="245.11" height="272.09" page="4"

potential The large apparent opening size (AOS) of Fibredrains, in ( the range
200-600 m, serves to tap pervious layers and lenses in clay deposits. The double
filter layer, which has a smaller effective AOS, intercepts the clay slurry generated
immediately after installation of the Fibredrain in the clay as the mandrel is
withdrawn. The cross-plane permeability of the filter was measured under a constant
head across a stack of four identical burlaps fastened across an open end of a et al.
circular cylinder (Lee , 1994). The cross-plane filter permeability determined in
this way for clean water was ( 5 better than 10 m/s. This is equivalent to the
hydraulic conductivity of fine sand, which helps in tapping natural drainage layers
such as sand and silt seams, lenses and other pervious paths. Clay slurry with water
content from 65% to 600% was passed through the four burlap layers mentioned . above
under a pressure head of 0 5 m of water. About 2 l of marine clay slurry at a water
content of 260-600% flowed w out within 15 min. For Singapore marine clay (
&#xBC;70%) at L a water content of 65%, the passage of water was slower but clear
from the beginning. This scenario is similar to the field installation stage of PVDs
as the mandrel is withdrawn, when disturbed slurry clay under high water pressure
tends to rush through the filter into the core. The four burlap filter layers were
removed carefully and cleaned in an ultrasonic agitator to extract the clay embedded
in each burlap layer separately. Gravimetric analysis showed that soil particles were
retained on the outermost burlap layer and the immediately adjacent inner layer, but
no particles were detected in the third or fourth burlap layers (Fig. 7(a)). The

was confined largely to an increase in the thickness and longitudinal compression of
the drain without kinking. Axial compression in the Fibredrain is manifested largely
as an increase in cross-sectional area, mainly because of the unwinding
characteristics of jute fibres in both the filter layer and the core. The resulting
increase in cross-sectional area and the decrease in filter opening size enhance the
unclogged water flow into the drain. The above experimental results show that the
effective C of the same clay under the same consolidation pressures h et is a
function of the performance of different PVDs. Aboshi &#xBC; al. w (2001) reported
the consolidation of Hiroshima clay ( L . &#xBC; &#xBC; &#xBC; w C P 49%, 21%, 0 36,

Japan ( 64%, 22%, L P C . &#xBC; P 0 53, 78 kPa) in 300 mm diameter laboratory
consolidaC tion cells with Fibredrain and PD. Pore pressure measurements in the
Fibredrain test showed zero excess pore pressure at the end of primary consolidation,
whereas the PD test showed 5 m of water head remaining at respective axial strains of
24% and 19%. The measurement of axial 3 permeability at the end of the test was
reported to be 7 ( 9 10 m/s for Fibredrain and zero for PD, illustrating the effect
of kinking. Examination of the drain materials after the tests showed that Fibredrain
had increased its thickness without kinking, whereas the PD had developed three to
four kinks, which completely curtailed the axial flow capacity, as shown in Fig. 9.
Axial discharge capacity To evaluate the discharge capacity of Fibredrain a 200 mm
long specimen was installed at the centre of a 100 mm w w diameter cylinder of
Singapore marine clay ( &#xBC;65%, N L &#xBC; &#xBC; w 70%, 40%). A coarse sand
layer, 10 mm thick, was P provided at both ends of the clay cylinder, which was
enclosed within a large-diameter triaxial membrane. The discharge capacity was
measured by connecting the drainage ends to a constant-head tank. The lateral
pressure was increased in stages, and the volume change in the clay cylinder was
measured, followed by determination of the et al. discharge capacity under each
pressure (Karunaratne , 1999). Figure 10(a) shows the mean discharge capacity of

highways over a variety of site conditions, varying subsoil material may be
encountered, ranging from cohesive to granular soil, including organic peat in
waterlogged ground, and waste material from mine areas and landfills. The deep-seated
clay soil can be treated with Fibredrains and surcharge. For surface deposits, the
application of high-energy impact (HEI) has been successfully employed in several
projects in this region et al. et al. (Choa , 1979; Lee , 1989) and elsewhere (Lukas,
1986). When improving in situ soil deposits by HEI, one of the physical limitations
usually met is the depth. With standard HEI techniques it is generally not economical
or practical to reach depths exceeding 5-7 m below the ground surface for clay or
8-l0 m below the ground surface for sand. When the type of soil to be improved
varies, it is customary to change the improvement technique. With HEI application the
method and equipment remain essentially the same, but allowance is made in the
application of the energy level and intensity. HEI application consists of dropping a
heavy pounder ranging from l0 to 40 t from a height, usually about 10- 25 m, via a
platform of granular fill. To treat loose granular deposits dynamic compaction (DC)
was used effectively for more than three decades (Menard and Broise, 1975; Ramaset
al. wamy , 1979). In the case of soft clay it is found to be ineffective when used
alone on saturated soft clay as the pore pressure dissipation is governed only by the
permeabilet al. ity of the clay (Choa , 1979). For partly saturated et cohesive soil
it is found to be quite effective (Ramaswamy al. , 1979). When the clay is soft and
saturated, sand columns can be formed with HEI by systematically punching sand into
the clay. This method, known as dynamic replacement et al. soil (Lee (DR), has been
used successfully even in a gap-graded sandy , 1984). An adaptation of DR for peaty
clay et al. (Lee , 1984) produced sand columns and sand claquage within the peat when
increased pounding energy was applied directly on the sand columns. This technique,
described as dynamic replacement and mixing (DRM), has been able to eliminate overall
settlement, including a large percentage of the long-term secondary components. The
principle of successful implementation of HEI application lies in recognising the
most appropriate energy levels to be used. The earlier approach of using empiricism
based on field operation is complemented by a more rational approach of determining
the enforced settlement, which is a function of the imposed stress from the structure
to be built et upon the soil and the soil modulus or compressibility. Lo al. (1990)
showed that there is a unique relationship between the saturation intensity applied
through HEI and the enforced settlement. Fig. 11 shows the enforced settlement upon
application of HEI energy in various projects worldwide. It can be seen that for
every site (depending upon the soil characteristics and geometric configuration,
involving depth, water table and stratification) there is a saturated I intensity
beyond which further HEI application produces s no tangible results in terms of
settlement. Fig. 12 illustrates the operational parameters in HEI application, namely

Fibredrains and surcharge. In the approach of this scheme, shown in Fig. 1, in which

install Fibredrains and surcharge to accelerate consolidation of the underlying soft
clay, and subsequently use HEI application for surface as well as fill compaction,
the suitability of Fibredrains to withstand HEI was checked in several projects;
otherwise the drain would be ruptured and its continuity impaired. As shown in Fig.
1, a working platform for the installation machines should be made with a suitable
material available with fines less than 10% for a minimum of 50 cm in thickness. The
drains should terminate in this sandy platform. For HEI application, if required, a
similar working platform is adequate except that the thickness should be in. creased
to about 1-1 5 m. Based on the anticipated settlement under the embankment and the
modulus of the subsoil, the energy level to be used will be determined. With the
progress of HEI more sand will be added and finally the surcharge fill is placed in
accordance with the drain design. The construction of the embankment follows
afterwards. A suitable material should be selected; highly swelling minerals should
be avoided in order to prevent excessive absorption of water within the embankment
during wet weather and shrinkage during dry weather, which might result in distress
in the pavement. In the event that the use of such materials is unavoidable, then
they should be shielded from fluctuations of the water table and from
flooding.<component x="42.35" y="148.62" width="245.09" height="272.09" page="8"

profiles from typical borehole log show that Nvalues are less than 2 blows/30 cm in
clays and between 2 and 10 blows/30 cm in sands. The construction commenced with
placing a working platform with selected fill materials containing fines less than
10%. To treat the deep-seated clay, varying from 9 m to . 21 m, Fibredrains were
first installed at 1 5 m square spacing, followed by the application of HEI from a 15
t pounder falling freely from heights of between 10 m and 25 m. With 6 3 to 12 blows
per pass for three passes, over a 6 m 6 m grid together with a fourth 'ironing pass',
energy of 225-250 2 t m/m for DC was imparted in the sandy areas and 270- 2 335 t m/m
for DR in the clayey deposits. A surcharge fill of . 4 5 m was placed; the resulting
settlement was monitored, and was found to taper off in 60-70 days. Fig. 14(a) shows
the load-time-settlement curve for the surcharge as observed in three settlement
plates. Fibredrains and surcharge combined with HEI enforced an anticipated total
settlement of the order of 1 m. Fig. 14b illustrates the improvement shown by CPT
before and after the HEI application. Plate load tests carried out subsequently
showed negligible settlement. This case record shows that using vertical drains,
surcharge and HEI application, a safe bearing capacity adequate for five-storey
residential houses can be easily achieved. For highway embankment construction this
treatment method can be easily adopted. Peaty soil treatment in Singapore A series of
field trials was conducted for evaluating the feasibility of stabilising the peaty
clay and fluvial clay at the Bishan Depot site of the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit et
al. System (Lee , 1984). Techniques involving surcharge only, vertical drains and
surcharge, and the dynamic replacement and mixing (DRM) method of HEI application
were investigated. In Zone B of the site, designated for . . DRM, some 7 8 m of peaty
clay was underlain by 5 6 m of . fluvial clay. Fibredrains were installed at 2 2 m
square spacing from a 1 m thick sand blanket to improve the deepseated fluvial clay.
Afterwards, HEI application was used in treating the upper layer of peaty
clay.<component x="42.35" y="38.37" width="245.05" height="57.38" page="8"

in dropping a 15 t pounder from a height of 15-20 m. Four passes were completed, on 3
an 8 m 8 m grid system, the last two passes being in between the previous print
locations. The first two passes resulted in the formation of sand columns about 4 m
long, tapering from an average diameter of 4 m at the surface to 2 m at the base. The
third and fourth passes formed sand columns at intermediate locations and compacted
the peaty clay in a three-dimensional confinement effected by the vertical sand
columns and horizontal sand blanket at the surface. The fifth pass was the DRM phase,
involving a 15 t pounder dropped from a height of 20 m with 35 blows per print. This
action resulted in widespread replacement and mixing of the in situ peaty clay with
sand charges. The ground, after treatment, was effectively transformed . into a stiff
sand raft with pockets of peaty sand 3 2 m thick, . followed by 4 5 m of sandy peat.

with the predicted settlement based on the improved properties. Comparison with other
treatment methods carried out in the project can also be seen in Fig. 15 for the
first 6 months. The settlement in site B began to peter out compared with the drains
and surcharge method in Zone A and surcharge only in Zone C. Thus it is quite evident
that DRM largely reduced the compressibility of the peaty clay, and drains and
surcharge installed before DRM effectively accelerated consolidation settlement in
the underlying fluvial clay. The result was a sand raft of high bearing capacity with
negligible long-term settlement under . an embankment load of about 3 7 m.
Reclamation on seabed clay at Pantai Mutiara, Jakarta, Indonesia Pantai Mutiara, a 90
ha residential-cum-recreational development, was constructed on land that had been
reclaimed at the waterfront in the Pluit area of Jakarta. The project site, located
immediately north of metropolitan Jakarta, extends about 1500 m from the old
shoreline and spans a width of 650-750 m, as shown in Fig. 16. Part of the existing
site was reclaimed for approximately 400 m from the original shoreline during 1979 to

Fibredrain possesses more discharge capacity than needed. After 12-15 months of drain
installation the fill level was raised by 1 m. The ground settlement accelerated at

Based on / 0 25, nearly 90-95% consolidau tion of clay under the applied load is

about 17-20 ha of land with hydraulically dredged seabed clay from the vicinity of
the site, in order to increase the undrained shear strength of 2 ( the underlying sea
bed clay to about 22 kN/m at El. 6 m at the periphery of the reclamation so as to
facilitate seawall construction without instability, an estimated degree of C
consolidation of 90% was needed. With an average of h 2 . about 9 m /yr, a drain
spacing of 1 4 m was adopted to achieve this degree of consolidation in 3 months with
an et al. appropriate surcharge (Lee , 1988). In this reclamation, excavation for
drainage channels in an area where Fibredrain was installed about eight years earlier
revealed no trace of its existence, which verified the biodegradability and hence the
ecological friendliness of Fibredrain. A typical section of the western breakwater
was at a . ( seabed level of El. 4 5 m. The dyke was designed to retain fill
materials inside the reclamation areas and at the same time protect the reclaimed
land from wave forces. Prior to construction of the dykes, bamboo clusters consisting
of seven bamboo poles, 8 m long and 80-100 mm in diameter, . were inserted vertically
into the soft seabed at 1 5 m spacing with the aid of a floater guide until the tops
of the clusters were at the seabed. These bamboo clusters have two Fibredrains
wrapped around the centre pole of the cluster (Fig. 18). The bamboo is tied together
by jute ropes and bamboo pins. A bamboo raft comprising seven layers of bamboo mat
was placed on top of the clusters with the aid of a crane mounted on a pontoon. Each
bamboo pole has a nominal 1 t tensile strength. . Sand was then spread over the rafts
to a height of 0 30 m. For temporary dykes, sandbags were placed on top of this
reinforced raft - sand layer. For permanent dykes, the raft - sand layer was covered
with a geotextile (Polyfelt TS700) before continuing the build-up with graded quarry
stone. Two rock mounds comprising 200 kg quarry stone were . constructed gradually
with a slope of 1:1 5. The next stage consisted of placing the geotextile on the
centre portion between the two rock mounds, after which sand was placed . ( 0 m.

measurements of completed . dykes, the settlement is estimated to be of the order of
1 5- . 2 0 m. The incorporation of bamboo rafts and bamboo clusters with Fibredrains
can be utilised in the construction of highway embankments over shallow water
underlain by soft ground. Concluding remarks A considerable part of the cost incurred
in the construction of highway embankments on soft ground arises from the need to
pre-treat the soft soil in the foundation. If proper soil treatment is not carried
out, protracted and costly road maintenance cannot be avoided. The most economical
method of dealing with embankment settlement on soft ground is to eliminate the
primary compression and a large portion of the secondary compression. The most
cost-effective method for achieving this objective is to consolidate the deep-seated
clay with Fibredrains and surcharge and to densify the surface deposits with HEI
application, if required. Fibredrains are proven to withstand installation and HEI
tamping stresses with the following performance characteristics in the consolidation
of soft soil. a C ( ) The effective coefficient of consolidation is a function h of
the hydraulic conductivity and compressibility of the soil as well as of the field
performance of the PVD. b ( ) PVD field behaviour is greatly influenced by the
deformation of the core and the filter, and the clogging and kinking of the drain. c
( ) In field monitoring, the slope of the settlement - time curve in the early stage
of consolidation multiplied by the influence area per drain gives the effective
discharge capacity of the PVD-soil system under the surcharge. d ( ) For Fibredrains,
the effective discharge capacity in the field is given in Fig. 10(a) as a function of
lateral pressure. The required discharge capacity is shown in S Fig. 10(b) as a
function of the final settlement for f various values of the influence diameter Dand
the C effective . With a given lateral pressure and final h S settlement the values
ofD Cand can be determined f h in Fig. 10. With these values of D Cand , the
consolidah tion time can be calculated from equation (3). e ( ) The consolidation
time cannot be reduced by decreasing D because this leads to an increase in . Qr f (
) It should be emphasised that Fibredrain continues to et al. function even at an
axial strain of 24% (Aboshi , 2001). In soil improvement projects where the PVD is
observed to be underperforming, the effective discharge capacity of the PVD should be
examined, with particular reference to the effect of kinking under axial strain
caused by settlement and clogging. The damage caused by installation stresses may be
important for PVD with lower tensile strength. For Fibredrain the effect of these
factors is not significant, as discussed earlier. g ( ) Fibredrain is environmentally
friendly in the production and transformation processes, and biodegradable in the
utilisation phase. Hence it is ecologically harmonious. h ( ) In highway construction
Fibredrains can be installed for the consolidation of soft subsoil accompanied by HEI
application for embankment construction, if required, because their high tensile
strength can withstand HEI. i ( ) Where embankment construction over shallow water
underlain by soft ground is required, bamboo raft and clusters with embedded
Fibredrains can be effectively used, ensuring rapid consolidation with satisfactory
foundation and slope stability.<component x="42.35" y="696.89" width="245.06"
