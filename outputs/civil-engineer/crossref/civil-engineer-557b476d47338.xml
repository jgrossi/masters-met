deflection data from the Cardington in 1 situ concrete building suggested that
long-term slab deflections can be governed by early-age striking or peak construction
loads from casting slabs above. At that time, there were no suitable laboratory data
available to validate the analytical model derived from back analysis 1,2 of the
Cardington data. The current test programme was designed to rectify this omission.
Vollum's meth1-3 od for accounting for construction loading in deflection
calculations is a refinement of the moment - 4 curvature approach given in Eurocode
2. The method was subsequently adopted in Concrete Society Technical 5 Report TR58,
where it is referred to as the 'rigorous method'. It is useful to review the approach
adopted in 4 Eurocode 2 for predicting long-term deflections, and the loss of tension
stiffening with time, before considering the influence of construction loading.
Curvatures increase with time in reinforced concrete flexural mem4 bers owing to the
combined effects of creep, shrinkage and loss of tension stiffening with time. In
Eurocode 2, the mean curvature in cracked members is given by<component x="286.92"

additional internal- and macro-cracking under 4 sustained load. Eurocode 2 states
that should be ( . taken as 1 for short-term loading and 0 5 for long-term loading,
but does not define the variation in with ( time. 6 Recently, Beeby and Scott carried
out a series of relatively short-term tests (up to around 100 days) on tension
members which showed that the residual tensile force resisted by cracked concrete
reduces to its longterm value within a few weeks of loading. The specimens were first
loaded around 28 days after casting. They found that the long-term mean residual
tensile stress in the concrete between cracks was around half the instantaneous value
after first cracking. Beeby and 6 Scott concluded that tension stiffening was largely
lost owing to additional cracking and internal damage under sustained load as the
tensile strength of concrete reduces to around 70% of its instantaneous value under 6
sustained loading. Beeby and Scott's data suggest that the time function describing
the rate of loss of tension stiffening in tension specimens is approximately : : : :

) is a function of time and t is the time in ( days from first cracking. 6 Beeby and
Scott carried out some exploratory slab tests which suggested that tension stiffening
is lost rapidly in slabs but at a slower rate than in tension 6 specimens. As a
result of these tests Beeby and Scott . suggested that should be taken as 0 5 in most
cases ( 7 in equation (2). Vollum also analysed deflection data from various slabs
tested by others in the laboratory under constant loading and concluded that
typically ( . reduced from 1 to around 0 7, in cracked members, between 1 and 2 days
after first loading. Some aspects 7 of Vollum's analysis were speculative as creep
and shrinkage strains were typically measured in control specimens which had a
significantly smaller notional size than the slabs. It was therefore difficult
accurately to assess the contributions of creep and shrinkage to deflection in the
first few days after loading. Influence of construction loads on longterm slab
deflections Relatively short-term peaks in slab loads can arise during the
construction of multi-storey buildings from 4 casting slabs above or in service as
illustrated in Fig. 1, which was derived from back prop forces measured at 8 It is
assumed in Fig. 1 that the slab St George Wharf. carries its self-weight after
striking. The main problems in predicting deflections under loading histories similar
to that shown in Fig. 1 are to determine (a) the influence of short-term peak loads
on the long-term residual tension stiffening under sustained load and (b) the
deflection after repeated unloading and reloading. 1-3 The Cardington deflection data
are particularly useful for assessing the influence of construction loading on slab
deflections as the loading on the first six floors was measured during construction
and the permanent loading was the same at all floors. Variations in construction
loading, concrete strengths and reinforcement between floors led to significant
variations in deflection between floors. Analysis of the Cardington 1,2,7 data showed
that the measured deflections under the permanent load, at a specific location,
varied almost linearly with the minimum value of a coefficient k, which was defined

simply supported one-way spanning slabs were tested in the Concrete Structures
Laboratory at Imperial College to determine the influence of shortterm construction
loads on long-term slab deflections. The slabs measured 500 mm wide by 3600 mm long
by 150 mm thick and were reinforced with 3T10 bars as shown in Fig. 2. The span of
3300 mm was chosen to satisfy the span-to-effective depth ratios in Eurocode 4 2,
which are intended to limit the total deflection to span/250 under a quasi-permanent
load equal to half . the design ultimate load. Equation (7 16a) in Eurocode 4 2 gives
a maximum permissible span of 3537 mm for the authors' slabs with f ck&#xBC;30 MPa.
The slabs were loaded at their third points with straps attached to one or two
concrete blocks with additional steel kentledge as required, which gave an almost
constant moment within the central third of the slab. The ratio of the maximum to
minimum moments in the . . central third of the beam varied between 1 03 and 1 04 in
the tests. Slabs S1-S3 were first loaded 9 days after casting. Constant loads were
applied to slabs S1 and S2 throughout the test. Slab S3 was loaded for 5 days with a
. peak load equal to 1 4 times the permanent load, which was the same as for slab S2.
Slabs S4-S6 were first loaded with their self-weight at 7 days and the quasipermanent
load was applied at 34 days. In between, a peak construction load was applied to
slabs S4 and S5 at 13 days and sustained for a period of 4 days. The peak load
applied to S4 equalled the permanent load which<component x="41.84" y="283.65"

adjacent to the loading points. Strains were measured with a 150 mm Demec gauge along
one edge of each slab (a) near the level of the reinforcement, (b) at mid-height and
(c) just below the top surface of the slab. In situ strains were also measured with a
Demec gauge in the top surface of each slab, parallel and perpendicular to the
direction of span. Strains were also measured in the top and bottom surfaces of the
slabs with electrical resistance strain gauges. Concrete material properties The
slabs were cast in two batches of three, approximately 5 months apart, from ready-mix
concrete with a target 28 day cylinder strength of 30 MPa. The flexural and splitting
strengths of the concrete were determined from control specimens cured in air and
water. The depth of the beams used in the flexural tests was chosen to be 150 mm to
eliminate the influence on flexural strength of differences in section depth between
the control specimens and slabs. The resulting tensile strengths are given in Table 3
which also gives tensile strengths derived from the concrete compressive 4 strength
using the equations given in Eurocode 2. 3 Creep and shrinkage strains were measured

figures also give the creep coefficients predicted by Eurocode 4 2 which were scaled
by E (t )/E where E is the c 0 c28 c28 elastic modulus at 28 days. It is interesting
to note that the creep coefficients measured in situ were slightly greater than those
measured in the control cylinders which was unexpected. The rate of increase of the
in situ creep coefficients in slabs S1-S3 was also significantly greater after 30
days than predicted by Eurocode 4 2. The current authors attribute the difference in
creep behaviour between the control cylinders and slabs to the slabs being in flexure
unlike the control cylinders which were in compression. The creep coefficient is
greater in flexure in compression because it is increased by creep in tension, which
is greater than in 10 compression. Neville also points out that the decrease in the
rate of creep with time is much less pronounced in tension than compression because
the increase in tensile strength with time is less. Determination of in situ cracking
moment It was anticipated that the effective flexural strength of the concrete in the
slabs would lie between the splitting and flexural strengths as the flexural strength
of reinforced concrete is reduced by shrinkage owing to the internal restraint
provided by reinforcement. Three approaches were used to estimate the in situ
flexural strength of the concrete in the slabs. In method M1, the in situ strength
was estimated by reducing the flexural strength of the control beams by the tensile
stress induced in the slabs by restrained shrinkage which was f ( t) &#xBC; ctsh

underestimate the shortterm tension stiffening effect provided by cracked concrete
below the neutral axis if the moment at first cracking is used in equation (2). This
conclusion is consistent with the common practice of using the mean concrete rather
than minimum tensile strength to determine a best estimate of likely deflections. The
concrete flexural strengths corresponding to methods M1-M3 are listed in Table 3,
which includes the measured flexural and splitting strengths for comparison. The
tensile strengths obtained with M3 were adopted in the analysis of the slab data
described in this article as they give the best estimates of deflection in 4
conjunction with Eurocode 2. The concrete tensile strength given by M3 was the same
for slabs S4 and S6. This was unexpected as slab S1 was loaded to cracking at 13 days
whereas slab S6 was loaded to cracking at 34 days when the tensile strength of the
control specimens was greater as shown in Table 3. Results The influence of peak
construction loads on deflection can be seen by comparing the deflections in Table 2

Fig. 11(b) for the duration of the measurements presented which is up to one year. It
appears that reduced more rapidly after the shrinkage strain pla( teaued at around
200 days. A number of different mechanisms are responsible for the long-term loss of
tension stiffening in slabs. It seems likely that the rapid loss of tension
stiffening after first cracking is attributable to internal cracking of the concrete
under sustained load as proposed by 6 Beeby and Scott. The subsequent gradual loss of
tension stiffening appears to be caused by relaxation of the concrete in tension
between the cracks owing to creep. The effect of creep is counter-balanced in part by
shrinkage, which induces tensile stresses in the concrete between the cracks owing to
the restraining effect of the reinforcement. These suppositions are supported by the
observation that increased more rapidly after ( the shrinkage plateaued at 200 days.
Fig. 11(a) also shows that reduced at a significantly slower rate in ( the slabs than

loads on tension stiffening 1,2 Vollum et al. showed that deflections at Cardington
varied linearly with the coefficient k defined min in equation (4). They went on to
propose that the influence of peak construction loads could be accounted for in
deflection calculations by using a modified concrete tensile strength given by f k w

&#xBC; min ct during construction and subsequently. 1-3 Vollum et al. attributed the
linear relationship be4 tween k and deflection to the fact that Eurocode 2 predicts
long-term deflections in cracked slabs with given dimensions, reinforcement and
loading to vary almost linearly with f . The current research shows this ct
explanation is overly simplistic and presents a more thorough explanation, which
accounts for the effects of unloading. The starting point is to rearrange equation

slabs which explains the observed linear relationship between k and deflections
predicted 4 with Eurocode 2 under constant load and varying concrete tensile
strength. The data from slabs S1-S6 were analysed to determine if, at any given time,
there was a linear relationship between (M /M )1/r and (a) perm S1 perm m 2 (M /M)
and (b) M /M as anticipated from the first r r author's analysis of the Cardington
deflection data. The curvatures 1/r were normalised by the ratio M / m perm S1 M
(where M is the mid-span moment in the slab perm perm under consideration under the
permanent load and S1 denotes slab S1) as the permanent load varied between the tests
as shown in Table 2. The normalisation is justified as the curvatures 1/r and 1/r are
almost 1 2 proportional to the applied moment as the curvature induced by shrinkage
is relatively small. The results of a typical analysis are shown in Figs 13 and 14,
which show that there was a linear relationship between 2 (M /M )1/r and both (M /M )

further explanation as the unloading line does not pass through the origin. In this
case, the mean curvature can be expressed as ( ( = = 1 r= 1 r (1 )1 r (13) ( ( &#xBC;

methods outlined below. 5 (a) TR58 A: TR58 with concrete material properties derived
with Eurocode 2 from the concrete compressive strength with the concrete tensile
strength taken as the flexural strength. 5 (b) TR58 B: TR58 with concrete material
properties derived with Eurocode 2 from the concrete compressive strength with the

measured concrete material properties and the experimental values of . ( The creep
and shrinkage values used in TR58 C and the proposed method were derived from the
equations of the lines of best fit to the mean in situ data shown in Figs 3-6.
Measured creep coefficients were used to determine the curvatures under the peak
construction loads in slabs S3, S4 and S5 but the increase in creep owing to the
application of the peak construction load was neglected in the calculation of
curvatures after the removal of the peak construction load. In reality, the in situ
creep coefficients were greater in slabs S4 and S5 than S6 as the additional creep
under the peak construction load was not fully recovered on unloading as shown in
Fig. 17. Despite this the measured long-term curvatures within the constant moment
region of slabs S4 and S6 are very similar as shown in Fig. 10, even though the
curvature was greater in the uncracked sections, adjacent to the supports, of slab S4
than S6. The reason for this is probably related to the fact that the effective creep
coefficient is greater in the uncracked regions of the slab than in the cracked
regions where tension is relieved in the concrete by cracking. In practice,
compressive creep coefficients are usually used in deflection calculations. The
present work suggests that 12<component x="81.18" y="630.55" width="227.17"

underestimate of deflection in lightly loaded slabs with significant tension
stiffening. The measured and predicted mean mid-span curvatures are compared in Figs
18(a)-(f), which show that the proposed method gives significantly more realistic
estimates of curvature in slabs S3 to S5 under the peak construction load and
subsequently than the rigorous 5 method in TR58. Furthermore, it can be seen that the
curvature predictions are significantly improved when measured material properties
are used, with curvatures being particularly sensitive to the concrete tensile
strength, which was unexpectedly low in tests S4-S6 for unknown reasons. It can be
seen that deflections were overestimated in slabs S1 and S2 if the concrete tensile
strengths were calculated in terms of the compressive strength using Eurocode 2.
Conversely, deflections were significantly underestimated in slab S6 if the concrete
tensile strength was taken as the flexural strength given by Eurcode 2 at 34 days
when the permanent load was applied and cracking occurred. Conclusions It has been
demonstrated that tension stiffening is lost rapidly after cracking in flexural
members but less 6 rapidly than measured by Beeby and Scott in tension members. It is
shown that long-term deflections can be governed by short-term peaks in construction
loading as suggested by analysis of deflection data from Cardi1,2 ngton. A
modification is proposed to the Eurocode 4 2 moment - curvature model to calculate
the residual tension stiffening moment remaining in members after unloading from
short-term peak loads. Expressions are developed to calculate the variation in time
of the coef4 ficient in the Eurocode 2 moment - curvature rela( tionship. A
refinement is proposed to the rigorous method for deflection prediction in Concrete

deflection data from the Cardington in 1 situ concrete building suggested that
long-term slab deflections can be governed by early-age striking or peak construction
loads from casting slabs above. At that time, there were no suitable laboratory data
available to validate the analytical model derived from back analysis 1,2 of the
Cardington data. The current test programme was designed to rectify this omission.
Vollum's meth1-3 od for accounting for construction loading in deflection
calculations is a refinement of the moment - 4 curvature approach given in Eurocode
2. The method was subsequently adopted in Concrete Society Technical 5 Report TR58,
where it is referred to as the 'rigorous method'. It is useful to review the approach
adopted in 4 Eurocode 2 for predicting long-term deflections, and the loss of tension
stiffening with time, before considering the influence of construction loading.
Curvatures increase with time in reinforced concrete flexural mem4 bers owing to the
combined effects of creep, shrinkage and loss of tension stiffening with time. In

loaded around 28 days after casting. They found that the long-term mean residual
tensile stress in the concrete between cracks was around half the instantaneous value
after first cracking. Beeby and 6 Scott concluded that tension stiffening was largely
lost owing to additional cracking and internal damage under sustained load as the
tensile strength of concrete reduces to around 70% of its instantaneous value under 6
sustained loading. Beeby and Scott's data suggest that the time function describing
the rate of loss of tension stiffening in tension specimens is approximately : : : :
&lt; &lt; ( t) 0 65 with 0 5 ( t) 1 0 0 12 log ( ((t) &#xFE; &#xBC; ( 10 (3) where (t
) is a function of time and t is the time in ( days from first cracking. 6 Beeby and
Scott carried out some exploratory slab tests which suggested that tension stiffening
is lost rapidly in slabs but at a slower rate than in tension 6 specimens. As a
result of these tests Beeby and Scott . suggested that should be taken as 0 5 in most
cases ( 7 in equation (2). Vollum also analysed deflection data from various slabs
tested by others in the laboratory under constant loading and concluded that
typically ( . reduced from 1 to around 0 7, in cracked members, between 1 and 2 days
after first loading. Some aspects 7 of Vollum's analysis were speculative as creep
and shrinkage strains were typically measured in control specimens which had a
significantly smaller notional size than the slabs. It was therefore difficult
accurately to assess the contributions of creep and shrinkage to deflection in the
first few days after loading. Influence of construction loads on longterm slab
deflections Relatively short-term peaks in slab loads can arise during the
construction of multi-storey buildings from 4 casting slabs above or in service as
illustrated in Fig. 1, which was derived from back prop forces measured at 8 It is
assumed in Fig. 1 that the slab St George Wharf. carries its self-weight after
striking. The main problems in predicting deflections under loading histories similar
to that shown in Fig. 1 are to determine (a) the influence of short-term peak loads
on the long-term residual tension stiffening under sustained load and (b) the
deflection after repeated unloading and reloading. 1-3 The Cardington deflection data
are particularly useful for assessing the influence of construction loading on slab
deflections as the loading on the first six floors was measured during construction
and the permanent loading was the same at all floors. Variations in construction
loading, concrete strengths and reinforcement between floors led to significant
variations in deflection between floors. Analysis of the Cardington 1,2,7 data showed
that the measured deflections under the permanent load, at a specific location,
varied almost linearly with the minimum value of a coefficient k, which was defined

simply supported one-way spanning slabs were tested in the Concrete Structures
Laboratory at Imperial College to determine the influence of shortterm construction
loads on long-term slab deflections. The slabs measured 500 mm wide by 3600 mm long
by 150 mm thick and were reinforced with 3T10 bars as shown in Fig. 2. The span of
3300 mm was chosen to satisfy the span-to-effective depth ratios in Eurocode 4 2,
which are intended to limit the total deflection to span/250 under a quasi-permanent
load equal to half . the design ultimate load. Equation (7 16a) in Eurocode 4 2 gives
a maximum permissible span of 3537 mm for the authors' slabs with f ck&#xBC;30 MPa.
The slabs were loaded at their third points with straps attached to one or two
concrete blocks with additional steel kentledge as required, which gave an almost
constant moment within the central third of the slab. The ratio of the maximum to
minimum moments in the . . central third of the beam varied between 1 03 and 1 04 in
the tests. Slabs S1-S3 were first loaded 9 days after casting. Constant loads were
applied to slabs S1 and S2 throughout the test. Slab S3 was loaded for 5 days with a
. peak load equal to 1 4 times the permanent load, which was the same as for slab S2.
Slabs S4-S6 were first loaded with their self-weight at 7 days and the quasipermanent
load was applied at 34 days. In between, a peak construction load was applied to
slabs S4 and S5 at 13 days and sustained for a period of 4 days. The peak load
applied to S4 equalled the permanent load which<component x="41.84" y="283.65"

one edge of each slab (a) near the level of the reinforcement, (b) at mid-height and

slabs were cast in two batches of three, approximately 5 months apart, from ready-mix
concrete with a target 28 day cylinder strength of 30 MPa. The flexural and splitting
strengths of the concrete were determined from control specimens cured in air and
water. The depth of the beams used in the flexural tests was chosen to be 150 mm to
eliminate the influence on flexural strength of differences in section depth between
the control specimens and slabs. The resulting tensile strengths are given in Table 3

to note that the creep coefficients measured in situ were slightly greater than those
measured in the control cylinders which was unexpected. The rate of increase of the
in situ creep coefficients in slabs S1-S3 was also significantly greater after 30
days than predicted by Eurocode 4 2. The current authors attribute the difference in
creep behaviour between the control cylinders and slabs to the slabs being in flexure
unlike the control cylinders which were in compression. The creep coefficient is
greater in flexure in compression because it is increased by creep in tension, which
is greater than in 10 compression. Neville also points out that the decrease in the
rate of creep with time is much less pronounced in tension than compression because
the increase in tensile strength with time is less. Determination of in situ cracking
moment It was anticipated that the effective flexural strength of the concrete in the
slabs would lie between the splitting and flexural strengths as the flexural strength
of reinforced concrete is reduced by shrinkage owing to the internal restraint
provided by reinforcement. Three approaches were used to estimate the in situ
flexural strength of the concrete in the slabs. In method M1, the in situ strength
was estimated by reducing the flexural strength of the control beams by the tensile
stress induced in the slabs by restrained shrinkage which was f ( t) &#xBC; ctsh

conclusion is consistent with the common practice of using the mean concrete rather
than minimum tensile strength to determine a best estimate of likely deflections. The
concrete flexural strengths corresponding to methods M1-M3 are listed in Table 3,
which includes the measured flexural and splitting strengths for comparison. The
tensile strengths obtained with M3 were adopted in the analysis of the slab data

appears that reduced more rapidly after the shrinkage strain pla( teaued at around

tension stiffening in slabs. It seems likely that the rapid loss of tension
stiffening after first cracking is attributable to internal cracking of the concrete
under sustained load as proposed by 6 Beeby and Scott. The subsequent gradual loss of
tension stiffening appears to be caused by relaxation of the concrete in tension
between the cracks owing to creep. The effect of creep is counter-balanced in part by
shrinkage, which induces tensile stresses in the concrete between the cracks owing to
the restraining effect of the reinforcement. These suppositions are supported by the
observation that increased more rapidly after ( the shrinkage plateaued at 200 days.
Fig. 11(a) also shows that reduced at a significantly slower rate in ( the slabs than

deflection data. The curvatures 1/r were normalised by the ratio M / m perm S1 M
(where M is the mid-span moment in the slab perm perm under consideration under the
permanent load and S1 denotes slab S1) as the permanent load varied between the tests
as shown in Table 2. The normalisation is justified as the curvatures 1/r and 1/r are
almost 1 2 proportional to the applied moment as the curvature induced by shrinkage
is relatively small. The results of a typical analysis are shown in Figs 13 and 14,
which show that there was a linear relationship between 2 (M /M )1/r and both (M /M )
and M /M perm S1 perm m r peak r peak in slabs S1 to S6 at 93 days when the permanent
load was removed from slabs S1-S3. The reason for the linear relationship between 2
(M /M )1/r and (M /M) in slabs that have perm S1 perm m r been unloaded requires
further explanation as the unloading line does not pass through the origin. In this
case, the mean curvature can be expressed as ( ( = = 1 r= 1 r (1 )1 r (13) ( ( &#xBC;

the proposed method for deflection prediction has been evaluated by comparing
measured and predicted deflections in slabs S1-S6. Curvatures were calculated with
methods outlined below. 5 (a) TR58 A: TR58 with concrete material properties derived
with Eurocode 2 from the concrete compressive strength with the concrete tensile
strength taken as the flexural strength. 5 (b) TR58 B: TR58 with concrete material
properties derived with Eurocode 2 from the concrete compressive strength with the
concrete tensile strength taken as the splitting strength. 5 (c) TR58 C: TR58 with
the measured concrete material properties. (d ) Proposed: Proposed method with the
measured concrete material properties and the experimental values of . ( The creep
and shrinkage values used in TR58 C and the proposed method were derived from the
equations of the lines of best fit to the mean in situ data shown in Figs 3-6.
Measured creep coefficients were used to determine the curvatures under the peak
construction loads in slabs S3, S4 and S5 but the increase in creep owing to the
application of the peak construction load was neglected in the calculation of
curvatures after the removal of the peak construction load. In reality, the in situ
creep coefficients were greater in slabs S4 and S5 than S6 as the additional creep
under the peak construction load was not fully recovered on unloading as shown in
Fig. 17. Despite this the measured long-term curvatures within the constant moment
region of slabs S4 and S6 are very similar as shown in Fig. 10, even though the
curvature was greater in the uncracked sections, adjacent to the supports, of slab S4
than S6. The reason for this is probably related to the fact that the effective creep
coefficient is greater in the uncracked regions of the slab than in the cracked
regions where tension is relieved in the concrete by cracking. In practice,
compressive creep coefficients are usually used in deflection calculations. The
present work suggests that 12<component x="81.18" y="630.55" width="227.17"

underestimate of deflection in lightly loaded slabs with significant tension
stiffening. The measured and predicted mean mid-span curvatures are compared in Figs
18(a)-(f), which show that the proposed method gives significantly more realistic
estimates of curvature in slabs S3 to S5 under the peak construction load and
subsequently than the rigorous 5 method in TR58. Furthermore, it can be seen that the
curvature predictions are significantly improved when measured material properties
are used, with curvatures being particularly sensitive to the concrete tensile
strength, which was unexpectedly low in tests S4-S6 for unknown reasons. It can be
seen that deflections were overestimated in slabs S1 and S2 if the concrete tensile
strengths were calculated in terms of the compressive strength using Eurocode 2.
Conversely, deflections were significantly underestimated in slab S6 if the concrete
tensile strength was taken as the flexural strength given by Eurcode 2 at 34 days
when the permanent load was applied and cracking occurred. Conclusions It has been
demonstrated that tension stiffening is lost rapidly after cracking in flexural
members but less 6 rapidly than measured by Beeby and Scott in tension members. It is
shown that long-term deflections can be governed by short-term peaks in construction
loading as suggested by analysis of deflection data from Cardi1,2 ngton. A
modification is proposed to the Eurocode 4 2 moment - curvature model to calculate
the residual tension stiffening moment remaining in members after unloading from
short-term peak loads. Expressions are developed to calculate the variation in time
of the coef4 ficient in the Eurocode 2 moment - curvature rela( tionship. A
refinement is proposed to the rigorous method for deflection prediction in Concrete
