regions, embankments constructed in winter may cause settlement and collapse of
slopes in the thawing season in early spring. One of the reasons may be unavoidable
suspension of the work due to work schedules while constructing an embankment during
a cold winter. Accordingly, assuming such construction, a test construction was
conducted in the winter season. For the constructed embankment, its inside
temperatures and strength were measured. Also, after the embankment melted it was cut
open and the density and water content were measured. As a result, it was found that
1) even in a 30cm high embankment, frost and moisture movement occur, 2) a frozen
embankment is strong but a non-frozen one is not strong, 3) depending on the
embankment construction method, layered frost remains and the number of layers
increases with the increase of construction days, and 4) when the embankment freezes
the density and water content decrease.<component x="89.88" y="373.64" width="435.73"

where deformation such as settlement or slope collapse occurs when a frozen or
frost-heaved embankment melts. One of the reasons may be unavoidable suspension of
the work due to work schedules while constructing an embankment in a cold winter. For
example, because construction is done in the daytime and not at night, the surface of
the embankment being constructed is exposed to cold air. Accordingly, assuming such a
condition, we decided to construct a test embankment in winter and check its
properties. Also, after the frozen embankment melted, the embankment was cut open to
check its condition. This report summarizes this process. 2 CONSTRUCTION AND
INVESTIGATION METHOD At the Tomakomai construction test field of the Civil
Engineering Institute for the Cold Region, an embankment of 4m in top width, 1.8m in
height, 1:1.5 in slope inclination, and 5 to 7m in length was constructed. Table 1
lists the basic physical properties of the embankment materials. They are classified
as non-freezing materials in particle size<component x="89.88" y="186.08"

moisture content is slightly higher than the optimum moisture content but the cone
index is high, these materials are easy to compact. Six types of embankments were
constructed (1 to 6). Table 2 shows the construction conditions. 1 and 2 were
constructed in mid December when the number of construction projects is largest in
winter earthwork, and 3, 4, 5, and 6 were constructed in mid January, the coldest
season in Hokkaido. For 1 and 3, six layers up to the embankment completion cut plane
were constructed in a day. For 2 and 5, one layer was constructed per day to complete
the embankment in six days. For 4 and 6, two layers were constructed per day to
complete the embankment in three days. Consequently, only the embankment top was
exposed to cold air for 1 and 3, the top and the embankment being constructed were
exposed five times for 2 and 5, and the top and the embankment being constructed were
exposed twice for 4. For 2, 4, and 5, even when the embankments were frozen in the
morning before construction, the embankment of the next layer was constructed. For 6,
the next layer was constructed after the frozen portion was removed before
construction of the embankment. Thickness of a single layer was 30cm.<component

was measured. This is shown by "+" in Fig. 1. In the unfrozen portion under the
frozen portion, the moisture content was 3 to 5% lower than that before freezing,
meaning that water in the soil was moved upward by freezing. 3.2 N value of
Embankment Fig. 2 shows the N value of the embankment. N values at locations 80 cm or
more in depth are about 5 to 10 which is small. However, N values of the frozen
embankment surface measured on February 4 and February 29 are large. Particularly,
for 1 and 2 constructed in December, N values obtained in the study on February 3 are
very large. The daily average air temperature on February 3 was -13&#xB0;C and that
on February 29 was -1&#xB0;C so the N value measure on the colder February 3 was
larger. For the embankments 3, 4, 5, and 6 constructed in January, N values of 3 and
4 were almost the same and N values of 5 and 6 were smaller. On April 25, there were
slightly frozen portions in the embankments but N values in the entire embankment
were smaller.<component x="89.88" y="651.32" width="435.66" height="68.81" page="4"

layer was constructed after frozen portions were removed. At this time, compaction
was done after the frozen portions were removed. In this case, compaction degrees
decreased uniformly. This means that even if frozen portions are removed, embankment
density decreases unless it is compacted. 3.4.2 Change in Moisture Content Fig. 5
shows the moisture content of the embankment during construction and when thawed. The
moisture content when thawed is lower than during construction. Particularly, the
moisture content of the embankment surface decreases the most.<component x="89.88"

in a 30cm high embankment, frost heave occurs and water moves in the embankment. 2)
Frozen embankments are strong but unfrozen portions are not strong. 3) Depending on
the embankment construction method, layered frost remains in the embankment and the
number of layers increases with the increase in construction days. 4) If the
embankment is frozen and thawed by constructing it in winter, the density and
moisture content decrease.<component x="89.88" y="568.64" width="435.69"
