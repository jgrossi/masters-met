provides ideal means to test pavement structure in a rapid and convenient manner. In
last few years, significant development has taken place in this field. This paper,
presents some of the major conventional as well as emerging nondestructive evaluation
methods for in situstructural assessment of asphalt pavements. Discussion of methods
is primarily directed towards the estimation of layer moduli and thickness values
which are direct indicators of the structural strength of pavement. Estimation of
density, moisture content, etc. has not been emphasised in this paper.<component

evaluation of existing asphalt pavement serves purposes such as, (i) estimation of
its present sufficiency for the purpose served, (ii) estimation of remaining
service-life and (iii) decision on the choice of rehabilitation measure. A desirable
method is the one which neither causes disruption to traffic, nor causes any damage
to the existing pavement structure. For quick acquisition of test data, a reliable
and consistent test technique is needed. Nondestructive testing (NDT) methods provide
all these features and are ideally suited for application to pavements. With NDT
methods, a number of data sets can be acquired at the same point which provides
statistical reliability to the experimentally acquired data. In a structural
evaluation process, the primary objective is to estimate the structural strength. For
asphalt pavements, it may be expressed in terms of in situlayer elastic moduli, layer
thickness, inter-layer bond conditions and anomaly characterisation. A simple and
direct evaluation method for layer properties estimation is by visual examination
after digging pits or taking cores from the pavement, which are destructive methods.
Dynamic cone penetrometer test can give a qualitative (and to some extent
quantitative) estimation of layer thickness, though it has some limitations (Loizos
and Plati 2007, Roy 2007) in terms of test-speed, error and subjectivity in
testing.<component x="68.03" y="114.97" width="368.58" height="203.25" page="1"

been developed for evaluation of asphalt pavements. For in situ NDT of pavements,
only the top surface is available. Thus, methods requiring access to two different
surfaces of the pavement structure cannot be employed in this case (X-ray method,
etc.). Laboratory techniques such as resonance column method and ultrasonic testing
have been used to determine the seismic moduli for complimenting the evaluation
procedure (Nazarian et al.1999, Celaya and Nazarian 2007). These techniques can also
be used for calibration of field NDT methods (Hammons et al.2006). Many of the NDE
methods involve implementation of forward approach for analysis and the inverse
approach for interpretation. In forward approach, the system is idealised in the form
of a model to study its physical response (say, deflection) due to some stimulus
(say, force), when the properties of the pavement layers (say, layer elastic moduli)
are assumed. A simple approach to forward modeling of pavement structure is to
idealise it as a horizontally layered, linearly elastic, isotropic and homogenous
media. More complex forward analysis schemes can be developed by dropping these
idealisations, thereby achieving closer approximation to the actual response. In
fact, the seismic/ loading response of pavement structure is quite complex, and its
modeling is itself a difficult task (Brown 1997). Asphalt layer is strongly sensitive
to nature of loading (magnitude, frequency and duration) as well as temperature
(Krishnan and Rajagopal 2003); whereas the elastic modulus of granular layer and
subgrade is sensitive to stress conditions (Lekarp et al.2000). The inverse approach
involves deductive analysis for which an unconstrained optimisation scheme is applied
to the acquired data (say, deflection) so as to estimate the desired properties (say,
layer elastic moduli) of the pavement system. Thus, the inverse algorithm typically
involves recursive calls to the forward analysis with some assumed values of the
unknown parameters, and any pre-defined error parameter is minimised through
subsequent iterations. The error parameter is generally defined as root mean square
of the difference between the obtained and predicted responses. Since, inverse
calculation requires computation of forward calculations at each iteration, use of
more realistic forward modeling does enhance the accuracy but it significantly
increases the computation time as well. Based on the underlying principles, the NDE
methods for asphalt pavements can be classified under two broad headings as
follows.<component x="56.69" y="118.1" width="368.52" height="384.55" page="2"

vertical deflections at various points on the surface of the pavement test-section,
due to an applied load, are measured. Type of the load applied may be static, steady
state harmonic or transient impulse type (ASTM D2003). The measurement of deflection
at the load point and at locations radially outwards from it, can be done with the
help of a dial gauge/linear variable differential transformer, or by using velocity
transducers et al. (geophones) (Haas 1994). Various types of deflection based NDE
methods are discussed further in the following subsections.<component x="68.03"

is applied to the test section and its deflection is measured. Benkelman beam
deflection (BBD) test is a simple and relatively inexpensive method under this
category. Basic device in a BBD test consists of a lightweight frame to which a beam
probe is attached alongwith a dial gauge (Zube and Forsyth 1966). BBD measures the
deflection due to static loading of dual tyres of a loaded truck. Measurement process
starts by placing the probe between the rear dual wheels of the test vehicle (figure
1). Initial dial gauge reading is recorded. The truck is made to move away by a
specified distance and as the rebound rate of pavement surface falls below a
specified level, intermediate reading is taken. Truck is again made to move further
away and the final reading is taken. Such an approach is adopted as an attempt to
reduce/nullify the influence of deflection bowl on the readings (Haas et al.1994,
Chakroborty and Das 2003). A characteristic BBD value, which is larger than
allowable, warrants an overlay for the pavement. The BBD device has been improved and
made capable of multi-point probing with increased accuracy. Rolling weight
deflectometer (RWD) is an example of such improved devices that employ similar basic
principle (Bay and Stokoe 1998).<component x="68.03" y="191.4" width="368.5"

oscillatory loading is applied to the pavement and the deflection response is
recorded (ASTM D4602 2003). The loading is generally applied by counter rotating mass
or electro-hydraulic system. The two trailer wheels equally distribute the vertical
dynamic load to the pavement. A geophone series measures the velocity of movement
with respect to time, which on integration gives the deflection basin et al. (Haas
1994). Thus, the deflection measurement for these devices are free from influence of
deflection bowl. However, test loading is harmonic and does not have any rest period.
Hence, the loading condition is somewhat different (Fwa 2006) and the magnitude of
load applied is also smaller (Ullidtz 1987) than the actual situation of in-service
pavements. Also, a relatively large amount of pre-load is applied to the pavement
which may adversely affect the accuracy of pavement response (Fwa 2006).<component

transient load application to the pavement test-section and the deflection response
is recorded at a series of radial points (ASTM D4694 2003). This type of device is
typically referred to as falling weight deflectometer (FWD) and is schematically
shown in (figure 2). The amount of impact load, duration and the loading area is
adjusted in such a way that it closely corresponds to the actual loading by a
standard truck on in-service et al. road (Sebaaly 1991). The peak load is controlled
by varying the falling mass, height of drop and the spring constant. The time of
impulse load may vary between 0.025 and 0.30 s, et al. and the applied load may vary
between 4.45 and 156 kN (Bay and Stokoe 1998, Goktepe 2006). Generally, the load
pulses are of halfsine type and the loading area is a 30 cm diameter circular pad
(Bay and Stokoe 1998). Velocity transducers Geophones record the deflection response.
Depending on the type of FWD, 3 to 7 geophones are used to capture the deflection et
al. profile (Haas 1994, Advisory Circular, No.150/5370-11A 2004). Load is measured by
a load cell, and its variation may be used to evaluate the stress dependence of the
layer modulus (Roesset 1998, Rahiom and George 2003, NCHRP Design Guide1-37A 2006).
Since the stiffness of asphalt layer is affected by temperature, a suitable
temperature correction factor needs to be applied to the observed deflection values
to convert them to values at the standard temperature (Chen et al.2000, Parket al.
2002). Some lighter versions of FWDs, called as light falling weight deflectometer,
are also et al. et al. available in which the impact load is relatively small (Loizos
2003, Goktepe et al. 2006). LFWD is generally found to be suitable for base and
subgrade evaluation (Loizos et al. 2003, Alshibli 2005, Loizos and Boukovalas 2005).
In heavy weight deflectometer (HWD) heavier load is used to simulate aircraft or
other heavier vehicles (Turner et al.2003). Major advantage of this technique is that
it closely simulates the actual in-service pavement loading. Another benefit is that
the road need not be closed to traffic during the test<component x="56.69" y="177.45"

surface-waves. The salient characteristics and propagation principles of et al. these
waves in multilayered media are discussed elsewhere (Richart 1970, Ryden 2004, Goel

dropweight, strike hammer, or a transducer. The sensing element is also a transducer
receiver (e.g. accelerometer). The data is recorded through a data acquisition system
and subsequently analysed to get the required estimates. It is important to note that
the estimated seismic moduli of pavement layers by these methods may typically show
larger values as compared to those estimated by deflection based methods, since a low
magnitude loading is applied at a high strain rate in this case. Therefore, suitable
correction models need to be incorporated in the analysis scheme (Nazarian and

Witczak 2002, Jiang et al. 2006, Kanta Rao 2006) that the ultrasonic pulse velocity
(UPV) method can estimate the dynamic modulus of asphalt with reasonable accuracy.
For field testing on in-service pavements, indirect configuration of sensors needs to
be used, as only top surface is accessible. P-wave velocity also varies with the
homogeneity of the material medium and this property can be used to characterise it.
In some recent studies, UPV has been used to et al. monitor top - down cracking

and Suleiman 2005). 4.1.3 Spectral analysis of surface waves method et al. . The SASW
method (Heisey 1982, et al. Nazarian 1988, 1999) introduced a relatively simple and
portable surface wave test technique for pavements. Its major feature is the use of
spectral analysis technique for signal processing which makes it possible to analyze
a range of frequencies with a convenient hammer-impact type surface wave source and
two transducer receivers. The method operates at negligible strain level and provides
estimates of the elastic moduli and thicknesses of layers. The basic assumption used
in this method is that only the fundamental mode of Rayleigh wave (R-wave)
propagation is excited and recorded. Higher modes of R-wave propagation V are
neglected. Physical quantity that is being determined, is the S-wave velocity ( )
which is s et al. a characteristic engineering property of a material (Richart 1970).
Commonly used three-step evaluation procedure for this method is (i) generation of
experimental dispersion curve (EDC), (ii) forward modeling of R-wave dispersion and
(iii) inversion to generate vertical stiffness profile of the test section (Goel and
Das 2006). V EDC is a curve between and the generated wavelengths for the test
section. It is s generated from data obtained through field testing which consists of
a suitable impact source to generate surface waves of a desired frequency range that
are sensed by two vertical, singleaxis transducer receivers at known offsets (figure

calculation (Sanchez-Salinero 1987, Roesset et al.1990, Nazarian s 1999). Forward
modeling consists of generating a theoretical dispersion curve (TDC) for chosen
values of layer properties. A computationally adaptable formulation, known as Haskell
- Thomson's propagator-matrix method (Thomson 1950, Haskell 1953, Jones 1955) was
established in early 1950's, that related the R-wave dispersion property in a
homogeneous multi-layered media (such as asphalt pavement) with its elastic
properties. This formulation gives the surface wave dispersion function as a product
of layer matrices that relates the displacement and stress components at any
interface to those for the deepest layer and is a function of the frequency and
wave-number. A determinant search technique computes the values of the wave-number
for which the determinant is zero (called as eigen values). For asphalt pavement
profiles, no real eigen values exist above a specific maximum frequency. This leads
to complex-domain computation of eigen values. Propagator-matrix method became the
basis for most of the theoretical forward modeling approaches of R-wave dispersion,
such as: stiffness-matrix method, linearised stiffnesset al. &#xA8; matrix method,
etc. (Kauseland and Rousset 1981, Storme 2005). Various tools utilising
finite-difference (Hossian and Drnevich 1989), Green's functions (Kausel and Peek
1982, Hisada 1994), wavelet transforms (Kim and Park 2002), etc. have also been
applied to solve for dispersion characteristics. In the inversion process, a suitable
analysis tool is employed to compare EDC with the V TDC. This gives the final
vertical profile of the test site which is then used to determine the s stiffness
profile for the test-site using equation (3). It should be noted here that the
estimated et al. applied (Mallick et al.2005, Gucunski asphalt modulus is sensitive
to the test temperature and hence proper correction needs to be 2006). Besides the
automated methods for EDC generation (Nazarian and Desai 1993), schemes employing
manual masking of raw data are also used which demand experience in use. Analysis

Nazarian 2004), GA (Al-Hunaidi 1998) and more recently simulated annealing (Beaty et
al.2002, Ryden and Park 2006) have been used for automation of the inversion process.
A different signal processing methodology employing continuous wavelet transform of
surface waves et al. has recently been used for void detection in pavements (Shokouhi
2003). Construction or testing information for the test site may also be incorporated
in the inversion process for more efficient profiling. A number of variants of the
basic evaluation method, as described above, have been reported. Park et al.(1998)
introduced the multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method which makes use
of more than two receivers to detect the other higher modes present in the surface
waves. This method attempts to generate a more accurate dispersion curve
representation using pattern recognition techniques which also automate the
procedure. Multichannel simulation using one receiver (MSOR) method for pavement
characterisation et al. (Ryden 2001) is based on MASW technique, and utilises a
single fixed receiver and moving source (or vice versa) to take a number of data
sets, and then use them to simulate multichannel data. A convenient testing and fast
analysis procedure gives more efficiency to et al. 2005, Mallick and this method.
Ultrasonic surface waves have also been successfully employed to estimate the depth
of surface cracks and elastic modulus of asphalt layer (Mallick Nazarian
2006).<component x="68.03" y="40.36" width="368.5" height="319.94" page="9"

IRT employs an infrared camera to capture the thermal image from top of the pavement.
The subsurface defects affect the heat flow within the pavement, and this in turn
affects the temperature distribution of the concerned area. The IRT can capture
images of a larger area quickly. To some extent, this method can capture the location
and extent of sub-surface distresses in the form of cracking, segregation, ageing and
et al. et al. construction non-homogeneity, etc. (Gordon et al.1998, Mahoney 2000,
Oloufa 2004). The test results can also get affected by various field conditions such
as time of testing, cloud cover, wind flow, pavement surface texture, solar radiation
and sub-surface conditions (moisture, frost penetration, etc.). can be estimated by
this method (Al-Qadi 1992, Saarenketo 1997, Scullion and Saarenketo et al. 1997,
Morey 1998, Saarenketo and Scullion 2000, Al-Qadi and Lahouar 2005, Maser 2006).
Researchers have found that the estimation of surface-layer thickness of asphalt et
al. pavement by this technique is good (Maser 1999, Saarenketo and Scullion 2000,
Maser 2006). GPR facility also provides a continuous data record for the full length
of the test section, thereby giving direct information of test section at each point.
et al. Figure 7 schematically explains the working of a typical GPR system (Maser
2006). Depending on the type of antenna used, a GPR system can be of two types; air
coupled (or horn-antenna) and ground coupled system. The two are further discussed in
the following. In air-coupled system, the antenna is typically placed 150- 500 mm
above the pavement surface (Al-Qadi and Lahouar 2005). The test set-up is mounted on
a vehicle which operates on test pavement at specified speed. Operating speed depends
on antenna type used and required frequency of data recording. The survey can be
conducted at a speed of even 60 km/hr and the typical depth of penetration in the
pavement is of the order of 0.5 to 0.9 m (Saarenketo and Scullion 2000). Accuracy of
this method depends on the resolution et al. of the time scan and the dielectric
constant of the material (Maser 2006). As the equipment moves on the pavement
surface, sequence of wavefronts are generated, and et al. collected wavefront data
(Maser from this, the layer-boundaries can be directly visualised from the pictorial
output of the 2006). n The relative reflection amplitude at the th interface can be
expressed as (Al-Qadi and Lahouar 2005)<component x="56.69" y="114.3" width="368.5"

wave related equipment (say, IE) work well for concrete pavements, because the signal
impedance contrast between concrete and the base material is et al. sharper as
compared to asphalt pavements (Maser 2003, Maser 2006). On the other hand, for GPR
methods, the dielectric contrast between asphalt and the base material is et al.
sharper than between concrete and the base material (Maser 2006). Since GPR testing
is continuous, future automated versions of GPR technology has a strong potential of
being developed as a routine pavement evaluation equipment (Saarenketo and Scullion
2000). The accuracy achieved by employing individual NDE techniques can be improved
by combining data from two or more methods in the final analysis (Abdallah et
al.2001). Similarly, FWD (or RDD) and GPR have been found as a good combination of
technologies for measuring asphalt layer thickness as well as stiffness (Saarenketo
and Scullion 2000, Hanna 2002, Lee et al.2006). IRT can also be used to decide GPR
survey locations thereby enhancing its effectiveness in evaluation (Weil 1993). The
SASW and FWD methods are generally more suitable for evaluation of top and bottom
layers respectively. This is due to a difference in the basic evaluation method and
the loading which generates different magnitude wavelengths that give information on
different depths of the pavement. So, if data from these two methods are combined, a
more accurate and complete pavement profile may be obtained. Equipment such as
seismic pavement analyzer, effectively employ this principle et al. (Abdallah 2006).
The present paper has discussed about various methods available for NDE of an asphalt
pavement structure. A gradual shift can be noticed towards the usage of automatic
equipment and adoption of quick evaluation techniques as compared to the conventional
ones. A carefully chosen combination of different NDE methods can readily enhance the
accuracy and reliability in the evaluation of pavements.<component x="68.03"

provides ideal means to test pavement structure in a rapid and convenient manner. In
last few years, significant development has taken place in this field. This paper,
presents some of the major conventional as well as emerging nondestructive evaluation
methods for in situstructural assessment of asphalt pavements. Discussion of methods
is primarily directed towards the estimation of layer moduli and thickness values
which are direct indicators of the structural strength of pavement. Estimation of

evaluation of existing asphalt pavement serves purposes such as, (i) estimation of
its present sufficiency for the purpose served, (ii) estimation of remaining
service-life and (iii) decision on the choice of rehabilitation measure. A desirable
method is the one which neither causes disruption to traffic, nor causes any damage
to the existing pavement structure. For quick acquisition of test data, a reliable
and consistent test technique is needed. Nondestructive testing (NDT) methods provide
all these features and are ideally suited for application to pavements. With NDT
methods, a number of data sets can be acquired at the same point which provides
statistical reliability to the experimentally acquired data. In a structural
evaluation process, the primary objective is to estimate the structural strength. For
asphalt pavements, it may be expressed in terms of in situlayer elastic moduli, layer
thickness, inter-layer bond conditions and anomaly characterisation. A simple and
direct evaluation method for layer properties estimation is by visual examination
after digging pits or taking cores from the pavement, which are destructive methods.
Dynamic cone penetrometer test can give a qualitative (and to some extent
quantitative) estimation of layer thickness, though it has some limitations (Loizos
and Plati 2007, Roy 2007) in terms of test-speed, error and subjectivity in
testing.<component x="68.03" y="114.97" width="368.58" height="203.25" page="1"

been developed for evaluation of asphalt pavements. For in situ NDT of pavements,
only the top surface is available. Thus, methods requiring access to two different
surfaces of the pavement structure cannot be employed in this case (X-ray method,
etc.). Laboratory techniques such as resonance column method and ultrasonic testing
have been used to determine the seismic moduli for complimenting the evaluation
procedure (Nazarian et al.1999, Celaya and Nazarian 2007). These techniques can also
be used for calibration of field NDT methods (Hammons et al.2006). Many of the NDE
methods involve implementation of forward approach for analysis and the inverse
approach for interpretation. In forward approach, the system is idealised in the form
of a model to study its physical response (say, deflection) due to some stimulus
(say, force), when the properties of the pavement layers (say, layer elastic moduli)
are assumed. A simple approach to forward modeling of pavement structure is to
idealise it as a horizontally layered, linearly elastic, isotropic and homogenous
media. More complex forward analysis schemes can be developed by dropping these
idealisations, thereby achieving closer approximation to the actual response. In
fact, the seismic/ loading response of pavement structure is quite complex, and its
modeling is itself a difficult task (Brown 1997). Asphalt layer is strongly sensitive
to nature of loading (magnitude, frequency and duration) as well as temperature
(Krishnan and Rajagopal 2003); whereas the elastic modulus of granular layer and
subgrade is sensitive to stress conditions (Lekarp et al.2000). The inverse approach
involves deductive analysis for which an unconstrained optimisation scheme is applied
to the acquired data (say, deflection) so as to estimate the desired properties (say,
layer elastic moduli) of the pavement system. Thus, the inverse algorithm typically
involves recursive calls to the forward analysis with some assumed values of the
unknown parameters, and any pre-defined error parameter is minimised through
subsequent iterations. The error parameter is generally defined as root mean square
of the difference between the obtained and predicted responses. Since, inverse
calculation requires computation of forward calculations at each iteration, use of
more realistic forward modeling does enhance the accuracy but it significantly
increases the computation time as well. Based on the underlying principles, the NDE
methods for asphalt pavements can be classified under two broad headings as
follows.<component x="56.69" y="118.1" width="368.52" height="384.55" page="2"

vertical deflections at various points on the surface of the pavement test-section,
due to an applied load, are measured. Type of the load applied may be static, steady
state harmonic or transient impulse type (ASTM D2003). The measurement of deflection
at the load point and at locations radially outwards from it, can be done with the
help of a dial gauge/linear variable differential transformer, or by using velocity
transducers et al. (geophones) (Haas 1994). Various types of deflection based NDE
methods are discussed further in the following subsections.<component x="68.03"

is applied to the test section and its deflection is measured. Benkelman beam
deflection (BBD) test is a simple and relatively inexpensive method under this
category. Basic device in a BBD test consists of a lightweight frame to which a beam
probe is attached alongwith a dial gauge (Zube and Forsyth 1966). BBD measures the
deflection due to static loading of dual tyres of a loaded truck. Measurement process
starts by placing the probe between the rear dual wheels of the test vehicle (figure
1). Initial dial gauge reading is recorded. The truck is made to move away by a
specified distance and as the rebound rate of pavement surface falls below a
specified level, intermediate reading is taken. Truck is again made to move further
away and the final reading is taken. Such an approach is adopted as an attempt to
reduce/nullify the influence of deflection bowl on the readings (Haas et al.1994,
Chakroborty and Das 2003). A characteristic BBD value, which is larger than
allowable, warrants an overlay for the pavement. The BBD device has been improved and
made capable of multi-point probing with increased accuracy. Rolling weight
deflectometer (RWD) is an example of such improved devices that employ similar basic
principle (Bay and Stokoe 1998).<component x="68.03" y="191.4" width="368.5"

oscillatory loading is applied to the pavement and the deflection response is
recorded (ASTM D4602 2003). The loading is generally applied by counter rotating mass
or electro-hydraulic system. The two trailer wheels equally distribute the vertical
dynamic load to the pavement. A geophone series measures the velocity of movement
with respect to time, which on integration gives the deflection basin et al. (Haas
1994). Thus, the deflection measurement for these devices are free from influence of
deflection bowl. However, test loading is harmonic and does not have any rest period.
Hence, the loading condition is somewhat different (Fwa 2006) and the magnitude of
load applied is also smaller (Ullidtz 1987) than the actual situation of in-service
pavements. Also, a relatively large amount of pre-load is applied to the pavement
which may adversely affect the accuracy of pavement response (Fwa 2006).<component

transient load application to the pavement test-section and the deflection response
is recorded at a series of radial points (ASTM D4694 2003). This type of device is
typically referred to as falling weight deflectometer (FWD) and is schematically
shown in (figure 2). The amount of impact load, duration and the loading area is
adjusted in such a way that it closely corresponds to the actual loading by a
standard truck on in-service et al. road (Sebaaly 1991). The peak load is controlled
by varying the falling mass, height of drop and the spring constant. The time of
impulse load may vary between 0.025 and 0.30 s, et al. and the applied load may vary
between 4.45 and 156 kN (Bay and Stokoe 1998, Goktepe 2006). Generally, the load
pulses are of halfsine type and the loading area is a 30 cm diameter circular pad
(Bay and Stokoe 1998). Velocity transducers Geophones record the deflection response.
Depending on the type of FWD, 3 to 7 geophones are used to capture the deflection et
al. profile (Haas 1994, Advisory Circular, No.150/5370-11A 2004). Load is measured by
a load cell, and its variation may be used to evaluate the stress dependence of the
layer modulus (Roesset 1998, Rahiom and George 2003, NCHRP Design Guide1-37A 2006).
Since the stiffness of asphalt layer is affected by temperature, a suitable
temperature correction factor needs to be applied to the observed deflection values
to convert them to values at the standard temperature (Chen et al.2000, Parket al.
2002). Some lighter versions of FWDs, called as light falling weight deflectometer,
are also et al. et al. available in which the impact load is relatively small (Loizos
2003, Goktepe et al. 2006). LFWD is generally found to be suitable for base and
subgrade evaluation (Loizos et al. 2003, Alshibli 2005, Loizos and Boukovalas 2005).
In heavy weight deflectometer (HWD) heavier load is used to simulate aircraft or
other heavier vehicles (Turner et al.2003). Major advantage of this technique is that
it closely simulates the actual in-service pavement loading. Another benefit is that
the road need not be closed to traffic during the test<component x="56.69" y="177.45"

dropweight, strike hammer, or a transducer. The sensing element is also a transducer
receiver (e.g. accelerometer). The data is recorded through a data acquisition system
and subsequently analysed to get the required estimates. It is important to note that
the estimated seismic moduli of pavement layers by these methods may typically show
larger values as compared to those estimated by deflection based methods, since a low
magnitude loading is applied at a high strain rate in this case. Therefore, suitable
correction models need to be incorporated in the analysis scheme (Nazarian and

are commonly et al. employed in this test. Laboratory studies suggest (Pellinen and
Witczak 2002, Jiang et al. 2006, Kanta Rao 2006) that the ultrasonic pulse velocity
(UPV) method can estimate the dynamic modulus of asphalt with reasonable accuracy.
For field testing on in-service pavements, indirect configuration of sensors needs to
be used, as only top surface is accessible. P-wave velocity also varies with the
homogeneity of the material medium and this property can be used to characterise it.
In some recent studies, UPV has been used to et al. monitor top - down cracking
(Khazanovich 2005), fatigue damage and crack healing in asphalt pavements (Abo-Qudais
and Suleiman 2005). 4.1.3 Spectral analysis of surface waves method et al. . The SASW
method (Heisey 1982, et al. Nazarian 1988, 1999) introduced a relatively simple and
portable surface wave test technique for pavements. Its major feature is the use of
spectral analysis technique for signal processing which makes it possible to analyze
a range of frequencies with a convenient hammer-impact type surface wave source and
two transducer receivers. The method operates at negligible strain level and provides
estimates of the elastic moduli and thicknesses of layers. The basic assumption used
in this method is that only the fundamental mode of Rayleigh wave (R-wave)
propagation is excited and recorded. Higher modes of R-wave propagation V are
neglected. Physical quantity that is being determined, is the S-wave velocity ( )
which is s et al. a characteristic engineering property of a material (Richart 1970).
Commonly used three-step evaluation procedure for this method is (i) generation of
experimental dispersion curve (EDC), (ii) forward modeling of R-wave dispersion and
(iii) inversion to generate vertical stiffness profile of the test section (Goel and
Das 2006). V EDC is a curve between and the generated wavelengths for the test
section. It is s generated from data obtained through field testing which consists of
a suitable impact source to generate surface waves of a desired frequency range that
are sensed by two vertical, singleaxis transducer receivers at known offsets (figure

of the material medium. This basic equation can be suitably V et al. et al. used for
calculation (Sanchez-Salinero 1987, Roesset et al.1990, Nazarian s 1999). Forward
modeling consists of generating a theoretical dispersion curve (TDC) for chosen
values of layer properties. A computationally adaptable formulation, known as Haskell
- Thomson's propagator-matrix method (Thomson 1950, Haskell 1953, Jones 1955) was
established in early 1950's, that related the R-wave dispersion property in a
homogeneous multi-layered media (such as asphalt pavement) with its elastic
properties. This formulation gives the surface wave dispersion function as a product
of layer matrices that relates the displacement and stress components at any
interface to those for the deepest layer and is a function of the frequency and
wave-number. A determinant search technique computes the values of the wave-number
for which the determinant is zero (called as eigen values). For asphalt pavement
profiles, no real eigen values exist above a specific maximum frequency. This leads
to complex-domain computation of eigen values. Propagator-matrix method became the
basis for most of the theoretical forward modeling approaches of R-wave dispersion,
such as: stiffness-matrix method, linearised stiffnesset al. &#xA8; matrix method,
etc. (Kauseland and Rousset 1981, Storme 2005). Various tools utilising
finite-difference (Hossian and Drnevich 1989), Green's functions (Kausel and Peek
1982, Hisada 1994), wavelet transforms (Kim and Park 2002), etc. have also been
applied to solve for dispersion characteristics. In the inversion process, a suitable
analysis tool is employed to compare EDC with the V TDC. This gives the final
vertical profile of the test site which is then used to determine the s stiffness
profile for the test-site using equation (3). It should be noted here that the
estimated et al. applied (Mallick et al.2005, Gucunski asphalt modulus is sensitive
to the test temperature and hence proper correction needs to be 2006). Besides the
automated methods for EDC generation (Nazarian and Desai 1993), schemes employing
manual masking of raw data are also used which demand experience in use. Analysis
tools such as statistical/curve-fitting methods (Yuan and Nazarian 1993), simulation
et al. et al. et al. (Ganji 1998), ANN (Williams and Gucunski 1995, Gucunski 2000,
Nazarian 2004), GA (Al-Hunaidi 1998) and more recently simulated annealing (Beaty et
al.2002, Ryden and Park 2006) have been used for automation of the inversion process.
A different signal processing methodology employing continuous wavelet transform of
surface waves et al. has recently been used for void detection in pavements (Shokouhi
2003). Construction or testing information for the test site may also be incorporated
in the inversion process for more efficient profiling. A number of variants of the
basic evaluation method, as described above, have been reported. Park et al.(1998)
introduced the multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method which makes use
of more than two receivers to detect the other higher modes present in the surface
waves. This method attempts to generate a more accurate dispersion curve
representation using pattern recognition techniques which also automate the
procedure. Multichannel simulation using one receiver (MSOR) method for pavement
characterisation et al. (Ryden 2001) is based on MASW technique, and utilises a
single fixed receiver and moving source (or vice versa) to take a number of data
sets, and then use them to simulate multichannel data. A convenient testing and fast
analysis procedure gives more efficiency to et al. 2005, Mallick and this method.
Ultrasonic surface waves have also been successfully employed to estimate the depth
of surface cracks and elastic modulus of asphalt layer (Mallick Nazarian
2006).<component x="68.03" y="40.36" width="368.5" height="319.94" page="9"

IRT employs an infrared camera to capture the thermal image from top of the pavement.
The subsurface defects affect the heat flow within the pavement, and this in turn
affects the temperature distribution of the concerned area. The IRT can capture
images of a larger area quickly. To some extent, this method can capture the location
and extent of sub-surface distresses in the form of cracking, segregation, ageing and
et al. et al. construction non-homogeneity, etc. (Gordon et al.1998, Mahoney 2000,
Oloufa 2004). The test results can also get affected by various field conditions such
as time of testing, cloud cover, wind flow, pavement surface texture, solar radiation
and sub-surface conditions (moisture, frost penetration, etc.). can be estimated by
this method (Al-Qadi 1992, Saarenketo 1997, Scullion and Saarenketo et al. 1997,
Morey 1998, Saarenketo and Scullion 2000, Al-Qadi and Lahouar 2005, Maser 2006).
Researchers have found that the estimation of surface-layer thickness of asphalt et
al. pavement by this technique is good (Maser 1999, Saarenketo and Scullion 2000,
Maser 2006). GPR facility also provides a continuous data record for the full length
of the test section, thereby giving direct information of test section at each point.
et al. Figure 7 schematically explains the working of a typical GPR system (Maser
2006). Depending on the type of antenna used, a GPR system can be of two types; air
coupled (or horn-antenna) and ground coupled system. The two are further discussed in
the following. In air-coupled system, the antenna is typically placed 150- 500 mm
above the pavement surface (Al-Qadi and Lahouar 2005). The test set-up is mounted on
a vehicle which operates on test pavement at specified speed. Operating speed depends
on antenna type used and required frequency of data recording. The survey can be
conducted at a speed of even 60 km/hr and the typical depth of penetration in the
pavement is of the order of 0.5 to 0.9 m (Saarenketo and Scullion 2000). Accuracy of
this method depends on the resolution et al. of the time scan and the dielectric
constant of the material (Maser 2006). As the equipment moves on the pavement
surface, sequence of wavefronts are generated, and et al. collected wavefront data
(Maser from this, the layer-boundaries can be directly visualised from the pictorial
output of the 2006). n The relative reflection amplitude at the th interface can be

wave related equipment (say, IE) work well for concrete pavements, because the signal
impedance contrast between concrete and the base material is et al. sharper as
compared to asphalt pavements (Maser 2003, Maser 2006). On the other hand, for GPR
methods, the dielectric contrast between asphalt and the base material is et al.
sharper than between concrete and the base material (Maser 2006). Since GPR testing
is continuous, future automated versions of GPR technology has a strong potential of
being developed as a routine pavement evaluation equipment (Saarenketo and Scullion
2000). The accuracy achieved by employing individual NDE techniques can be improved
by combining data from two or more methods in the final analysis (Abdallah et
al.2001). Similarly, FWD (or RDD) and GPR have been found as a good combination of
technologies for measuring asphalt layer thickness as well as stiffness (Saarenketo
and Scullion 2000, Hanna 2002, Lee et al.2006). IRT can also be used to decide GPR
survey locations thereby enhancing its effectiveness in evaluation (Weil 1993). The
SASW and FWD methods are generally more suitable for evaluation of top and bottom
layers respectively. This is due to a difference in the basic evaluation method and
the loading which generates different magnitude wavelengths that give information on
different depths of the pavement. So, if data from these two methods are combined, a
more accurate and complete pavement profile may be obtained. Equipment such as
seismic pavement analyzer, effectively employ this principle et al. (Abdallah 2006).
The present paper has discussed about various methods available for NDE of an asphalt
pavement structure. A gradual shift can be noticed towards the usage of automatic
equipment and adoption of quick evaluation techniques as compared to the conventional
ones. A carefully chosen combination of different NDE methods can readily enhance the
accuracy and reliability in the evaluation of pavements.<component x="68.03"
