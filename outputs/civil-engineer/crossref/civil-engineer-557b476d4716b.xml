1852, civil engineering already had a history, and the British Institution of Civil
Engineers had preceded ASCE by half a century. Engineers had styled themselves as
"civil engineers" and universities offered courses in civil engineering. The
construction of public roads and bridges, and canals and drainage systems had been
practiced since time immemorial, and had been recorded for thousands of years. But
somehow, "civil engineering" came to be spoken of only in the 18th Century. The
"engineer," however, has been around for centuries. Many engineers, especially today,
have a misconception of the origin of the word engineer, thinking that it derives
from engine; nothing is farther from the truth, as this study explores. This paper
studies the origin of "civil engineer" and proposes that the word "civil" is an
anachronism. Moreover, the name does not reflect the reality of the technical
functions, nor the actual type of work performed in this glorious branch of
engineering. Does a name affect anything at all? Perhaps yes, or yet again, perhaps
not, depending on how the issue is viewed. If it is viewed from the former
perspective, then there can be cause for concern and chagrin. Nevertheless, this
paper is the result of a study to determine whether there is a fit between civil and
the "engineering" works performed by the civil engineer.<component x="42.08"

the Latin, French, and Middle English McDonald 1914; ASCE 1970 : ( (  Middle Latin:
ingeniarius;  Old French: engignier;  Middle English: engyneour; and  French:
ingenieur. Also related to these are the words ingenuity coming from the Latin
ingenuita and French ingenuite; and ingenious comes from the Latin ingeniosus. Quite
apparently, all have gen as their root term. "Origin" 1910 has the best and most
clear-cut explanation of ( ( the root gen. That article asserts "The root of both the
words, Engineer and Engine is found in the Sanskrit jan, to be born, from gen
&#x2425;&#x2427;&#x242F; which came the Greek form and the Latin , the latter genere
ingebeing embodied in the old verb , with its compound nere ingignere changed into (
(, to implant by birth, and in the later ingenium substantive , an innate or natural
quality." McDonald 1914 , a Past President of ASCE, confirms from an ( ( independent
study through the consultation of a lexicographer, that the Sanskrit root jan is the
true origin of the Greek and Latin root of gen, which has led to the formation of
many words in English in common use even today see Appendix I . This should ( ( ( not
be surprising: numerous words in English have their root in Sanskrit. ( Consequently,
the engineer is someone who gives life to ideas, bringing to life various machines
and systems, which makes a lot of sense in modern day terms. Therefore, the Engineer
"creates." gen He applies his "ingenuity," which has its roots in , to give "life" to
things and develop new systems. Consequently, the word "generate" is understood to
mean something that is given life to gen and put into action, where , again, is the
root word. The word gen "genius" is understood in its derivation from as someone who
can give life and vitality to words and things, which is what geniuses do when they
invent new systems or solve difficult problems. Similarly, the implied derivatives of
the words listed in Appendix I can be traced back to gen, which is traced back to
jan, which means life. As a matter of record, jan does not really mean birth, but
means life. In all likelihood, "Origin" 1910 made a minor error, ( ( probably because
of unfamiliarity with Sanskrit. Birth is actually derived from jan, when life is
given to a soul or entity, but is not jan itself in Sanskrit, jan= life and
janam=birth . Nevertheless, ( ( &#x2425;&#x2427;&#x242F; this does not detract from
jan being the root of the Greek .<component x="317.47" y="51.69" width="251.49"

engineer has its roots in the root word gen, and not in the word engine, which itself
is derived from gen. The common misconception that engineer came from engine is,
however, understandable because the operators of steam engines were called engineers.
The Oxford English Dictionary defined the engineer as one who managed engines or had
charge of steam engines; in the United States, the driver of a locomotive engine was
often called an engineer; the engineer was also known as a contriver or maker of
engines. For instance the obituary of John Hampson, Esq., Engineer, in 1854, read at
an ASCE meeting, stated Hunt 1897 : "Mr. Hampson aided in the construction of ( ( as
a machinist and ran as Engineman, the first Locomotive En( ( gine built in America .
. ." In history, actually, the water wheel was referred to as an engine, as it
brought water up, whereas the designer and maker of the water wheel was known as an
engineer, which is true even today. Various machines have been invented in the world
going back to the time of Archimedes and before The History Channel ( 2004 . Is this
a chicken and egg problem, as to what came first- ( the engine or the engineer? No.
Clearly, the engine could not have been created without the brains of some engineer.
engineer Moreover, the word has nowhere been reported to be derived engine from ,
though the misconception is somewhat popular among people, especially after the onset
of the steam engine in locomotives. Correspondingly, it is quite logical to un( (
derstand that engine and engineer are related Herbert 1633 and have their root in a
common word, gen.<component x="42.08" y="310.08" width="251.48" height="299.21"

credited with the day when engineering blossomed as a formal discipline, although all
engineering was combined in one, and there was no differentiation between Corps of
the disciplines. This was the day of the formation of the Engineers of the military
of Great Britain ASCE 1970 . The ( ( Oxford English Dictionary subsequently carried a
definition of engineer that reflected the military engineer: "One who designs Corps
of and constructs military works for attack or defense." The Engineers Corps of Royal
Engineers was renamed in 1787, and was charged with the designing and constructing of
military fortifications, ramparts, canals, river management, railways, road, and
bridge making. They were also tasked with penetrating enemy fortifications using
whatever technologies they could muster. For instance, the battle-tank of World War I
was a design of the Royal Engineers practicing general engineering, when they first
installed steel plates around a four-wheel drive vehicle to attack infantry
positions, though Leonardo da Vinci had first proposed armor around a cart to the
Ruler of Milan in the 15th century. Later editions of the Oxford English Dictionary
in the 18th Century defined engineer as "one whose profession is the designing and
constructing of works of public utility, such as bridges, roads, canals, railways,
harbors, drainage works, gas, and water works," which we can see, are public works
items. Therefore, by the end of the 18th Century, the word engineer, itself, was
taken public works engineering as . As the use of engineer and civil engineer were
practically synonymous with respect to civilians, civilian engineer the was
distinguished on the professional level military engineers Diconly from (Calhoun 1960
. The French ( tionnaire de la Langue Francais of the 18th Century carried the
following definitions of engineer, bringing out the fact that public works engineers
in the civilian sector performed works undertaken by the military engineers, as well
McDonald 1914 : ( ( 1. Engineer-one who plans, lays out, and directs field work and
fortifications, for attacking, defending, or fortifying places. 2. Engineer-one who
directs private works or public works, ( ( such as the construction and maintenance
of roads and bridges, working of mines, etc. Engineer of bridges and roads. Mining
engineer, naval engineer or marine engineer, railroad engineer. public works Hence,
the record of practice notes that the person engaged in such practice was, indeed,
classified as an engineer, in that he designed and constructed new systems, and
brought life to his constructions. The public used those systems en masse-for general
consumption of the populace.<component x="42.08" y="51.78" width="251.48"

roots of names of common engineering disciplines in alphabetical order : ( (
Aeronautical engineering " " traces its origin to the prefix aer meaning air, gas, or
atmosphere. Aer is originally a Greek and Latin word meaning air, so when we wish to
study the flight of aircraft in air, it is quite logical to call it aeronautical
engineering. An "architect" is one who designs and supervises the construction of
buildings-coming from the Greek arkhitekton, meaning master builder. It is logical to
observe that " architecture" has been derived from arkhitekton. agricultural
engineering Improving soil cultivation is " ." "Agriculture" comes from two
roots-ager, meaning "field" in Latin; and cultura, meaning to cultivate. Ager has
been the root word for growing of food and crops for many millennia. The meaning of
the tasks and functions performed by agricultural engineering are immediately clear
from their roots. Biological engineering " ," an up and coming field of study,
derives from the root words bios-Greek for life-and logia- Greek for study. Nothing
could more truly represent the engineering applied to the study of living species.
Chemistry has been around for ages-and anything to do with preparing chemical plants
and kilns or handling chemicals was chemical engineerrightfully and justifiably given
the name of " ing ." The alchemist strove for centuries to transmute ordinary
materials and chemical substances into gold. Medieval Latin referred to that pursuit
as alchemia, alchimicus, and alchymia. The practitioner was called in New Latin as
chimicus or alchemist. Therefore, it was quite natural to come up with the name of
chemical engineering for the study of chemical plants and machinery, as chemistry was
already known and derived from alchemia. The root is traced to the French chimic for
"chemical," and Late Greek chemeia for "chemistry." Computer engineering " " comes
from the Latin word computare, meaning the ability to make determinations by
numerical methods. For centuries, mathematicians had toiled with computing strategies
until they hit on the abacus, the logarithm tables, slide rule, and then, finally,
the computer after the discovery of electronics. Goddess Electra was said to appear
to mortals in the form of a comet . The bright light of the comet, its flare, and the
ominous power of comets made quite an impression on humans. It was quite logical,
therefore, for "electrical engineering" to be given this name for the study of
electricity that dealt with power and light. Thomas Edison, if we recall, brought
electricity from the heavens in his experiment with a kite that led to the light
bulb. Electra electrical engiGoing from to "electricity" and then to neering was not
far-fetched at all. Moreover, "electric" derives from the Greek electron, akin to
Greek elektor meaning beaming sun. Elektor is reported to come from the Sanskrit ulka
meaning fiery phenomenon in sky, or meteor. Hence, Goddess Electra was given a
suitable name in reference to her characteristic. fire protection engineers The " "
took their name from the Old English fyr, meaning fire. They did not have to go far
to find their name to represent their basic function. hospital engineers The Society
for " " takes their name from the modern "hospital," which took its name from the
Latin hospitum meaning hospitality; the Latin hospitalis, meaning good treatment of a
guest; and the Latin hospes, meaning host, as it is in the hospital that patients are
treated with care and love hope( fully , much as traditional cultures treat well and
respectfully a ( host or guest. The word Hospital refers to treating well those who
come to the hospital, thereby reflecting a major function of the hospital and
hospital engineers. When workers sweat from their brow to produce industrial goods,
and when people work hard in factories to produce goods, we know they have been
"industrious" in the exercise of their duties-coming from the Latin industria meaning
diligent, and Middle English industrie. It is no surprise that the branch of
engineering dealing with workplace productivity and manufacture industrial
engineering of goods is called " ." The word "industrial is further composed of two
roots-Indo and struus. Indo comes from Indu that comes from endo that means "within."
Struus comes from the Latin struere that means to arrange and build; in this sense,
it is similar to the root of "construction," explained later. Together, indo and
struus mean "building within"-in other words, working hard, or diligent. Marine
engineering " " has to do with the oceans and seas, and it would be quite logical to
expect marine to have something to do with ocean or sea. Marine comes from the Old
French marin, which comes from the Latin marinus, which comes from mare, meaning sea.
The "mariner" is, thus, one who explores the sea. Hence, we have a direct connection
here to the functions of the marine engineers in their name. Mekhane is the original
Greek word for machine. Anything that is suggestive of or appropriate for performance
of a machine mechanical enis, therefore, quite logically given the name of "
gineering ." The word mekhane has been around for millennia, so it was reasonable
when the word mechanical engineering was chosen for the study of modern machines.
Military engineering " " comes from the word military that comes from the Latin root
miles meaning soldier and the Latin root militare meaning to serve as a soldier.
Mining engineering " ," another very old and important form of engineering,
considering how important metals such as gold have been through the centuries, even
before Christ. The root of "mining" comes to us from the Welsh and the Old French.
The Welsh origin, mywn, meaning "ore" is expected to be of Celtic origin. The Old
French origin, miniere or mine, means "mineral." Nuclear engineering " " deals with
harnessing the power of the nucleus of atoms. The word "nuclear" derives directly
from the Latin nucleus or nuculeus. In physics, "nucleus" represents the central
region of an atom whose energy is harnessed in nuclear ( engineering and containing
almost all of the mass of an atom. ( The word itself means the kernel-the most
material and central part: The core. Nucleus further derives from nux, meaning nut,
wherein it is implied that the nucleus of the atom is like a nut and grouping of
subatomic particles. Petroleum engineering " " deals with drawing oil from under the
layers of rock and beds of earth. Truly enough, petroleum is derived from Latin
petra, meaning rock and the Latin oleum, meaning oil, giving an instantaneous
understanding of the type of work and tasks involved-where the name explains the
functions. "safety engineering" Finally, is one of the most obvious cases where the
name of the engineering discipline directly implies the type of work being
undertaken. Safety engineering concerns itself with being safe, free from danger or
harm, unhurt- of maintain( ( ing health. The word safe comes to us from the Middle
English sauf and from the Latin salvus meaning healthy. ( Hence, it is apparent that
the names of all major engineering disciplines except civil engineering that has not
been defined yet ( come from root words that represent their technical
functions.<component x="42.08" y="51.78" width="251.49" height="422.12" page="3"

claim to having discovered or invented engineering. From the earliest times, human
settlements have sought to construct dams and barrages for water supply; move earth
to build embankments; quarried and hewed to patterns and line; dug rivulets to
increase irrigation for the fields; and applied the lever, roller, and the inclined
plane from Sumeria to Mohenjo-Daro, Egypt to China. All known ancient civilizations
of Assyria, Babylonia, China, Etruscia, India, Misr Egypt , Per(( sia, and Phoenicia
built canals and aqueducts, docks and harbors, palaces and cities, roads and
suspension bridges, and drainage and water supply systems. All these activities were
performed for humankind to quench their thirst, grow crops, keep the environment
clean through sanitation, and basically improve their quality of life. The urge to
improve one's lot is a characteristic of the human race. Biblical records tell us
that Noah used bitumen in the construction of his ark; bitumen was also used to make
watertight, the casket in which Moses was committed to the Nile as a forlorn baby
Watkins 1891 . These were the humble beginnings of the ( ( field of study known as
civil engineering. Later to be added to this field were military pursuits, such as
fortifications and ramparts, moats and bridges, tunnels and catapults. Three prime
examples out of the hundreds and thousands that were executed of the practice of
engineering in the ancient world-marvels of ingenuity in their time-that are all
infrastructure projects, are as follows Watkins 1891 : ( (  1000 B.C.: Phoenicia:
Harbors of Tyre and Sidon;  875 B.C.: Assyria: Tunnel at Negoub connected to an open
channel excavated in rock, for the purpose of conducting water of the river Zab to
the city of Numrud; and  800 B.C.: Assyria: Construction of sewers at Khorsabad with
pointed arches that supported the earth above them; construction of docks and
warehouses at Port Cadiz; working of tin mines. All these were done for the purposes
of trading everywhere along the Mediterranean. Interestingly, the construction of
buildings is nowhere mentioned as primarily an engineering work, though references to
engineers supporting the master-builder architect are discovered in literature. The
many wonders of the ancient world-the pyramids, construction of palaces and halls, or
the beauty of cathedrals and temples are placed in the realm of the master-builder
architect, and are nowhere recorded as falling under the purview of the engineer or
public works engineering. The Medes, Carthaginians, and Greeks were to follow the
Phoenicians and Assyrians with larger infrastructure projects for the maintenance of
their cities. Similarly, we know that Julius Caesar was an expert on public and
infrastructure works prior to his ascension as the Ruler of Rome. For instance, he
was called upon to solve the transport crisis in Rome, much as we would have
transportation engineers do today. As "all roads literally ( ( led to Rome" owing to
Rome's central position in the trade and commerce of the nation, Rome was afflicted
with a severe traffic problem for which Julius Caesar presented solutions, not all of
which were successful, though Singh 2000 . ( ( The Romans were known to have enormous
engineering accomplishments to serve their war machine, and applied their skills to
public works too. There were estimated 250 mi of aqueducts during the Roman period,
50 mi of which were supported on stone arches. It was estimated that these aqueducts
poured into Rome over 300 million gallons per day Watkins 1891 . ( ( Rome continued
to build canals and locks, being among the first in relatively recent times to build
canals, especially in Milan, a city dependent on canals, and later aided by Leonardo
da Vinci who offered his services as an infrastructure expert to the Ruler of Milan.
Interestingly, these public works were distinguished from building works. Public
works applications are evident throughout the world from China to the Mayan Empire,
Viking maritime operations in Northern Europe to Central Asian road constructions,
and they cannot all be mentioned. Suffice to say that it is discovered that all the
works undertaken in earlier millennia that led to the modinfrastructure works ern
practice of Civil Engineering cover for public improvements . Calhoun 1960 opines
that the "precise definition of the term ( ( 'civil engineer' can cause needless
concern." From a practical perspective, he has a somewhat valid point. He argues that
civil engineering evolved over time from the many activities of a large variety of
engineers, coming from a mixed source of agrarian, mercantile, and military origins,
in addition to newer industrial ways. The ingenuity of the public works or civil
engineer had to vast array many fields be applied to a of applications in of
activity. In addition, a name is often the superset of dynamic language, culturally
inspired, and socially shaped. Moreover, as Calhoun implies, the tasks and functions
of the civil engineer do not change no matter what the name is. Further, the name has
been in vogue for many decades and has been accepted, so why bother with the name at
all? Nevertheless, it is obvious that the name has caused concern to people, as
Calhoun implies; we do not know whom, though. However, the name, or lack of an
appropriate name, is a matter of interest to the author.<component x="42.08"

of canals had been constructed by 1840, stimulating inland navigation, commerce, and
transport of factory goods. In 1850, there were 83 municipal water supplies Calhoun
1960 . ( ( Much infrastructure engineering work had also been accomplished in the
nonmilitary area. The 1787 law establishing the Northwest Territory decreed that 2%
of land revenues be allocated to construction of the National Road, the "Cumberland
Pike" from Washington to the Ohio River. By 1820, the United States had 9,000 mi of
rock and gravel surfaced roads Wisely ( 1974 . Railroads greatly stimulated the need
for infrastructure en( gineers. In 1840, there were 9,000 miles of railroads in the
United States; 30,000 in 1850, with about $300 million being invested that year for
the construction of railroads Houghton Mifflin ( 2004 . ( America carried over much
of the European social patterns. As Europeans came to the new world in search of a
better life, all the skills and trades were brought with them. It was necessary to
build the new nation from scratch. European society had recognized the military
engineer, the architect, and the civilian engineer as appropriate men to plan and
direct large public works Calhoun ( 1960 . The year 1785 saw a surge in the hiring of
engineers, for ( example, for the improvement of navigation in the Potomac River by
the Potomac Company, whose President was George Washington himself Kaylor 2005 . It
was difficult to get an engineer all ( ( the way from Europe, and earlier personnel
selected by the Potomac Company to manage the engineering proved unsatisfactory in
their work. Engineers were in short supply, and the shortage continued to be felt
through to the civil war. John Quincy Adams, then Minister to Great Britain, once
transmitted the application of an English engineer anxious to seek employment in the
United States. However, European engineers were generally hard to get. The preference
was usually for French engineers who were considered more scientifically educated
Calhoun 1960 . ( ( There was confusion as to the type of engineer that could be found
for infrastructure projects. Architects often doubled up as managers of works, such
as Benjamin Latrobe who worked as a civil engineer on the Susquehanna navigation
survey, Philadelphia works, and the Chesapeake and Delaware canals. For various
reasons, he felt himself not appreciated in America. The owners and presidents of
canal and river improvement companies themselves felt uncertain on how to find the
necessary supervision for their projects. They tried various personnel, meeting with
disappointment for a long time, until they finally realized, as in the case of Mr.
Phillip Schuyler, President of Western and Northern infrastructure engineers rienced,
professional Inland Lock Navigation Companies, that only the hiring of expewould
fulfill their needs and demands of project success Calhoun 1960 . Basically, ( ( it
is evident that those who had worked specifically on infrastructure projects would be
qualified then for the type of work we call civil engineering today. There was some
difficulty in hiring architects to fulfill engineering roles. The architect's task is
largely to arrange materials artistically to enhance the internal living experience
as much as possible. The training of an architect did little to equip him with
knowledge of soils for moving earth, or properties of channel flow for river
training, or the sinking of caissons for bridge foundations, which was knowledge
required in the practice of infrastructure development. The difficulty in acquiring
competent engineers prompted the U.S. Congress to establish West Point, as a starter,
for training engineers for military infrastructure projects. This set the stimulus
for private schools to begin civil engineering instruction. In 1816, the states of
New York, Virginia, and South Carolina sought engineers for canal and road building.
Whereas, the preference was for an engineer, the jobs were still filled by
architects, land surveyors, contractors, and draftsmen owing to a general shortage of
qualified engineers. It is reported that the total number of engineers or
quasi-engineers active or available in the United States up to 1816 never averaged
more than two per state Calhoun ( public works 1960 . However, they were all engaged
in . They ( came from all over-they were surveyors, landholders, speculators,
builders, contractors, lawyers, architects, and military engineers. Thus, it is
straight to see that the tasks engineers performed for which they were later named
civil engineers were what we cominfrastructure engineering monly know today as . It
was nowhere for building engineering that they were called civil engineers, but
public works infrastrucbasically for improvement projects of an ture nature. The
fundamental finding of this section is that the skills that employers sought in civil
engineers related to public works or infrastructure works, a somewhat embodied field
of knowledge by the mid-19th century. The shortage was not felt for building works,
since there were architects available for the design and construction of
buildings.<component x="42.08" y="51.8" width="251.5" height="546.13" page="5"

engineer of his times is recorded as the first person to sign himself as a civil
engineer, in 1761 "Origin" 1910; McDonald 1914 . Wisely 1974 mentions that ( ( ( (
Smeaton signed himself in as civil engineer, as he was engaged in the building of
roads, structures, and canals in England in a civilian capacity. Fairweather 2002
reports that Smeaton signed him( ( self so while presenting testimony to the courts
in 1782. This was probably in addition to his signing in 1761, but there could be
confusion on the dates in the historical records, but this does not detract from the
fact that Smeaton is credited with being the first person to style himself as civil
engineer. By 1761, it can be inferred that calling oneself an engineer Corps of Royal
Engineers meant one was in the . As Smeaton could not misrepresent himself in court,
he had to come up with an alternate to engineer and military engineer. Moreover,
there was no precedence in the matter before Smeaton, and he suitably struck on civil
engineer. It is probably logical to speculate that he took counsel in the matter,
that he had support of the professional community, and that others in the profession
had been referring to themselves as civil engineers in the vernacular. The
distinction between military and civilian engineering was Dictionnaire de la Langue
Francaise brought out by the French of the 18th Century, carrying the following
definition: "Civil Engineer-name given to engineers who are not trained in technical
schools or who work for private industry." An interesting part of this definition is
the portion about training in technical schools. Though no one today could be
recognized as a civil engineer without training education in a techni( ( cal
engineering school, only military engineers were trained in ( ( school in 18th
Century France. The others, who worked in the School of civilian sector, earned their
credentials through the Hard Knocks (which refers in the colloquial to learning that
takes place on the job or on the streets, in contrast to formal learning in school .
Thus, civil engineers were differentiated from their mili( tary engineering
counterparts in 18th Century France through the above-mentioned definition. The
Society of Civil Engineers SCE in Great Britain was the ( ( first civil engineering
society in the world, formed in 1793 following years of effort that dated back to
1771, a good 55 years after the formation of the British Corps of Engineers, and at
least a decade after Smeaton had styled himself as civil engineer. The SCE served to
formalize and embody what was only loosely civilian engineer civil engineer used-the
term and style of , or , for short. The SCE transformed in 1818 to the British
Institution of Civil Engineers ICE . Thomas Telford, who had a career as a surveyor,
( ( and road, bridge, and canal builder, was appointed its first President in 1820,
in which position he served until his death in 1834. He helped ICE get a Royal
Charter in 1828-a recognition that helped establish ICE as the preeminent
organization for civil engineers "Encyclopedia" 2005 . ( ( At home, the U.S. Congress
legislated the Army Corps of Engineers in 1794, and the U.S. Military Academy was
created at West Point in 1802, with the specific purpose of supporting military
engineering functions. In 1821, the Congress enacted legislation specifically
directing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct surveys of roads and canals
jointly with "engineer officcivilians ers" of the Corps and engineers from among
engaged in such work, who the Congress referred to as civil engineers. Hence, this
was the first official recognition of this special nature civil engineering of work
being given the name of . In 1824, Congress further passed an act authorizing the
President to use engicivilian neer officers from the army, as well as engineers, to
make surveys for roads and canals considered of national importance Wisely 1974;
Calhoun 1960 . ( ( When the Oxford English Dictionary enhanced its definition of
engineering in the 18th Century, they contrasted works that the military performed
with identical works performed in the civilian community, defining such professionals
in the civilian community civil engineer as a , for distinction from the military
engineer. It was not until ICE had been formed that in 1828 they formally defined
civil engineering as ". . . that species of knowledge which constitutes the
profession of a civil engineer; being the art of directing the great source of power
in nature for the use and convenience of man; of the means of production and of
traffic in states, both for external and internal trade, as applied in the
construction of roads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation, and docks, for
internal intercourse and exchange; and in the construction of ports, harbors, moles,
breakwaters, and light-houses; commerce; and in the construction and adoption of
machinery; and in the drainage of cities and towns." Somewhat similar to the ICE
definition was the West Point definition of civil engineering prepared in December
1831 U.S. ( Congress 1831 . It differed partially from the ICE definition to the (
extent that the West Point definition incorporated building engiCivil Engineering
neering within the field of civil engineering: " , viz.: the properties, preparation
and use of materials; elementary parts of buildings; composition and distribution of
buildings; art of construction; decorative architecture; manner of laying out and
constructing roads; discussion of the different kinds of stone, iron, and wooden
bridges, with the methods of construction; consideration of the obstacles impeding
the navigation of rivers, and their remedies; details of the various constructions on
a canal; survey, location, and construction of a canal; calculation of the economy of
canal transportation; different kinds of rail-roads; survey, location, and
construction of a line of railway; economy of transportation on railroads; and
construction of artificial and improvement of natural harbors." However, the word
civil in civil engineering is nowhere seen to explain any activity being undertaken:
Civil actually traces its roots to the Latin civilis meaning polite; "civilian" is
derived from civilis, which comes from the Latin, Middle English, and Middle French
word of civis, meaning citizen. Civil also means mannerly, presentable, courteous,
courtly, gallant, chivalrous, forThe American bearance from rudeness or
unpleasantness refer to ( Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 3rd Ed. , none
of ( which represent the engineering functions of civil engineering. In contrast, the
word "military" is derived from the Latin miles meaning soldier, which well explains
the military engineer. Civil is not a technical root of engineering functions, and
therefore is a gross misnomer for civil engineering. Civil is used from out of
convenience rather than to represent function, thereby making civil engineering the
sole exception to all engineering disciplines mentioned in this article.<component

benefits from its colonies around the world, immigration and the conquest of a large
frontier in North America was increasing the need for infrastructure projects there,
largely for transportation purposes that had a direct impact on economic activity and
personal mobility. Moreover, the U.S. military needed the same type of infrastructure
for the conquests of the vast frontiers. This demand led to West Point being started
as the first engineering academy in the country in 1802, as was mentioned earlier. At
the time, the primary engineering tasks taught were surveying, road making, and
design and construction of hydraulic locks and railroads. Prior to 1802, there was no
formal education in civil engineering in the United States, and practitioners
acquired their knowledge through apprenticeship and fieldwork, with some of them
having completed a course of study in the sciences and mathematics. However, the
first and oldest school of civil engineering was L'Ecole Militaire de Saint Cyr the ,
established in Paris in 1763. For a long time, it was considered a fine institution,
ranked high among all nations. French engineers, graduates of that institution were
highly sought Calhoun 1960 , especially by the U.S. gov( ( ernment between the period
1775 and 1825, during which time French military engineers helped Napoleonic power
become the premier world power. Colleges and universities in the United States that
began to offer civil engineering instruction following the creation of West Point are
listed in the following Wisely ( 1974 ; the dates given represent the first degrees
offered, and it ( must be noted that the universities began their civil engineering (
programs a few years before these dates refer to Phelan et al. 1995 : (  1821:
American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy renamed Lewis College, and later
renamed Norwich Univer( sity , known popularly as the "Partridge Academy" after Allen
( Partridge, its founder;  1835: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute;  1845: Union
College;  1846: Yale College; and  1846: Harvard College. In spite of this
education, there were only 512 civil engineers by 1850. For even those who listed
their profession as engineer in contrast to civil engineer, most worked on canals and
railroads, which goes to show again how synonymous and interchangeable the two terms
were. To many, the engineer was known as a person responsible for infrastructure,
industrial, and municipal improvements where the most commonly understood
infrastructure im( provements were railroads; canals and locks for river navigation
and agriculture; roads, highways, and bridges Calhoun 1960 . ( ( ( Popular literature
of the early 19th Century assumed that the eninternal improvements gineer was mainly
a designer of -what we would call infrastructure today; the 1824 Act of Congress,
menBoard of Engineers for Intioned previously, was overseen by a ternal Improvements
in the War Department. Allen Partridge was formerly a Superintendent of West Point,
from where he resigned after clashing with his superiors. He opened the Partridge
Academy at Norwich, used the same textbooks as West Point, and offered his graduates
jobs on the New York canals. In 1825, Partridge wrote to the Governor of New York, De
Witt Clinton, that his course was "to prepare young men for the scientific discharg
sic. of the duties of Civil Engineers." (( He felt that if the country could prepare
its own engineers, they would never have to look to Europe for them. Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute RPI taught mensuration, ( ( surveying, and engineering.
Professor Amos Eaton, who taught the course, felt that advanced mathematics was
unnecessary to teach to engineering students, and even politely criticized the text
Elementary Course in Civil used by West Point instructor, Mahan, Engineering , a
textbook that was popular and saw seven editions from 1837 to 1868 Calhoun 1960 . The
opinion of Professor ( ( Eaton resonates today in the education of the modern
construction manager in the United States, exemplified in university curricula
accredited by the American Council on Construction Education ACCE , whose graduates
supervise construction projects identi( ( cal to the construction engineers from
ABET-accredited schools. However, much of the earlier civil engineering courses were
taught by professors of mathematics at a variety of schools-a disposition that
somewhat characterizes the profession and is reflected in the heavy mathematics
required today for civil engineers in an ABET-accredited curriculum. In Hanover
College, a professor of mathematics taught civil engineering courses; at the
University of Michigan in 1837, the professor of mathematics was also professor of
natural philosophy and civil engineering; whereas at the University of Virginia in
1836-1837, professors of mathematics and natural philosophy taught civil engineering
courses; in 1837, Charles Hackley, a professor of mathematics taught civil
engineering at the University of New York Calhoun ( 1960 . The first half of the 19th
Century was to witness the slow ( but steady maturing of civil engineering as a
profession, largely through formal education. Other schools offering some kind of
engineering courses between 1831 and 1852 included the following:  Geneva College; 
Dartmouth College, Hanover, N.H.;  Lehigh University, Pa.;  City Academy,
Washington, D.C.;  William and Mary College;  Georgetown College, Ky.;  Elijah
Slack's School, Cincinnati;  Miami University, Miami;  University of Alabama;  St.
John's College, Md.;  East Tennessee College; and  Virginia Military Institute.
However, these engineering courses were no more than a minor part of the instruction.
It is important to observe that their emphainfrastructure engineering sis was the
teaching of -the main job market of engineers of the time being railroads, canals,
roads, bridges, barrages, and harbors. Building engineering was added quite as a
consequence, since the principles of science for analyzing and designing bridges was
identical to that for buildings, essentially those pertaining to Newton's laws of
motions and calculus. As can be evidently observed, the courses and content in all
universities were geared to the training of engineers for infrastructure
development-whether they were in the military or civilian practice. However, by the
early 1800s, the name of civil engineer had become "stuck," and universities had no
opportunity to give a different name to their training.<component x="317.47"

graduates entering civilian service began in 1818 with one individual. This number
slowly increased until it reached approximately 10 in 1828, 15 in 1830, passed 25 in
1833, was 39 in 1836, 96 in 1837, and 107 in 1838. The cumulative number of civilian
engineers, however, was more than this, probably reaching 200 in 1837. Compare this
to about 200,000 civil engineers in the United States today. A total of 231 civilian
service West Point engineers from 1802 to 1837 went into at some point in their lives
Calhoun 1960 . ( ( Between 1826 and 1843, the Partridge Academy produced about 40-50
civilian engineers. RPI produced 48 civilian engineers from the 102 who graduated
from their program between 1835 and 1843. West Point, Partridge Academy, and RPI were
the three main suppliers of public works engineers in the days 1802-1843. Other
on-the-job trained engineers continued to exist. There are no available formal census
figures for the number of engineers and civil engineers in the United States before
1850. However, alarmed by the number of West Point graduates leaving military service
for civilian service, apparently for better fortunes based on their excellent
education, Congress forbade all army engineers in 1838 to take employment with
private companies. This put pressure on private universities to take up civil
engineering education, resulting in Yale and Harvard to begin teaching the subject.
With the formation of the American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects ASCEA ,
civil engineering ( ( education would be given a major boost, and the need to debar
military engineers from entering civilian service would be slowly diminished.
Nevertheless, we again see that the engineers were primarily sought to work on
internal improvement projects such as railroads, canals, harbors and docks, and roads
and bridges-items required for military mobility, as well as trade and commerce.
Thus, it is evident that the West Point engineer and the training imparted at West
Point served immensely to define the discipline L'Ecole Militaire of Civil
Engineering, as did the of France, and the Corps' of Engineers of Great Britain. It
is also evident that the Partridge Academy and RPI were formed as a consequence of
the existence of West Point. Further, there was none to little distinction between
the work of West Point graduates engaged in military projects and those of Partridge
and RPI engaged in civilian public works projects. The only feature that
distinguished them was their uniform and their work in the military or civilian
sectors. Hence, the concretization of civil engineering. Moreover, those who could,
went on to college, but they still ended up working alongside those who did not or
could not go to college. Slowly, those with college degrees would increasingly take
up design works, creating an exclusive distinction from those infrastructure
engineering and work function was still the same- in construction who had no college
degrees. But, the discipline .<component x="317.47" y="51.79" width="251.49"

Improvements of Roads and Inland Navigation , which sought to promote the technical
functions of civil engineers, was perhaps the earliest public works organization in
North America, being founded in 1789. They concerned themselves with activities such
as canals, locks, bridges, roads, tunnels, tramways, breakwaters, harbor works, and
industrial installations. L'Ecole Militaire Given that the military engineers of were
Royal Enconsidered the finest, most sophisticated, and that the gineers West Point in
Britain had already been formed, had started to produce military engineers engaged in
infrastructure The Society for Promoting the Improveprojects, and the fact that ments
of Roads and Inland Navigation had already commenced ICE its activities, whereas had
received a Royal Charter, a group led by Mr. John Jervis proposed to start a national
civil engineering organization, in 1836, that was distinct from the poorly trained
builders, on the one side, and the military engineers, on the other. There was a need
to make that distinction as the civilian and military engineers worked on identical
types of infrastructure and public works projects, and the realities of contracting
as well as professional pride dictated such a distinction necessary. However, it was
not until 1839 that this group was able to coordinate its efforts to meet in
Baltimore Fairweather 2002; Calhoun ( 1960 . During their deliberations, there were
divisions among the ( attendees, and the effort to form a civil engineering society
was not successful. It was not again until 1852-a long, 13 years later-that the group
of 1839 met with a slightly expanded group, reinforced by those in the building
trade, and formally established the "American Society of Civil Engineers and
Architects" ASCEA . ( ( A statement crafted by the committee in 1839 to describe the
work of their profession, brings out that their major interest was public
infrastructure works . They also recognized the success of the Institution of Civil
Engineers U.K. Wisely 1974 , thereby ( ( ( ( accepting de facto ICE's definition that
constituted the art and practice of civil engineering. Though journals of civil
engineering American Railroad Journal appeared later, the was already in existence,
and an article in that journal in 1840 explained reasons behind the collapse of the
1839 effort in forming a civil engineering society, basically disagreements where the
members were not convinced of the need, not to mention that some participants came
from varying states and had not known each other. Railroad engineering was
quintessentially the same field of study as other infrastructure engineering fields,
such as roads and bridges, the principles of alignment and curve being similar. In
this regard, it American Railroad Journal is interesting that the was started in
1832, some time before the civil engineering societies were formed. The Boston
Society of Civil Engineers BSCE , founded in ( ( 1848, was consequently the first
civil engineering organization in America, not to mention that it was the first
engineering society of the United States, as well. Boston had a large concentration
of public works engineers, and Massachusetts was among the first colonies to induct
European technology, much of it from Great Britain, becoming economically and
technologically well developed. Boston had a bustling harbor, an elaborate road
feeder system, and was a cultural hub for two centuries from the 17th to the 19th
Centuries. But, as the BSCE was restricted to Massachusetts and Connecticut, a civil
engineering society was indicated to serve the nation at large. A New York Institute
of Civil Engineers was formed in 1848, but ceased activity in 1850 for lack of
support. Though the ASCEA was formed in 1852, the architects opted out and formed
their own society in 1857, thereby prompting ASCEA to change their name to just
"ASCE" in 1868. It was going to be 1877 before the name, ASCE, was registered legally
Fairweather 2002 . ( ( In any case, the ASCEA founded in 1852 met regularly until
1855, after which it experienced a hiatus of 12 years, much of which can be
attributed to the civil war, but also due to the fact that the first President, James
Laurie, a prime mover of ASCEA, took assignments in Nova Scotia for two years,
evaluating railroads and planning extensions; and six years as Chief Engineer of the
New Haven-Springfield and Hartford Railroad. Interestingly, James Laurie was one of
the founding fathers of the BSCE, in addition to his activities in ASCE Fairweather
2002 . ( ( Other societies were formed in the United States after ASCE, as follows: 
American Institute of Architects, AIA: 1857;  American Institute of Mining
Engineers, AIME: 1871;  American Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME: 1880; 
Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, IEEE: 1884; and  American
Institute of Chemical Engineers, AIChE: 1908. ASCE, ASME, IEEE, and AIME were
founding members of the United Engineering Trustees, which operated the United
Engineering Center in New York that had been kindly provided with a $1 million
donation by Carnegie. ASCE is thus the oldest of the American engineering societies.
ICE is perhaps the oldest engineering society in the world, none other known to exist
before her. This correlates well with infrastructure engineering being the first
known engineering activity of ancient times, and with all engineering being
considered synonymous to civil engineering. Basically, it appears that the move to
form civil engineering societies was to embody the knowledge pertaining to the
practice of infrastructure engineering and building construction. Much as in earlier
years, where all engineering was synonymous with civil engineering, ASCEA first
sought to be the society for allengineers and architects. ASCEA opened applications
for its membership to architects, mining engineers, mechanical engineers, and naval
engineers. It was a mistaken and arrogant judgment, in the writer's opinion, that
motivated the civil engineers of the day to feel that all engineers should come under
their umbrella, when they well knew that not all engineers understood the designing
of machines and naval ships, neither through education nor through training. It is
understandable, however, to see why they sought to include mining engineers, as the
mining engineers moved and supported earth much in the same way as the construction
engineers did. It is also understandable to see why they sought to include the
architects because the constructors of buildings were among those who worked on
internal improvement projects as well, and West Point had defined civil engineering
to include building engineering and architecture. However, the industrial progress of
the 19th Century was to exert alternate forces that would lead to other engineering
bodies forming their own societies, the architects to break away from ASCEA, and for
ASCE to stop asking mining, naval, and mechanical engineers to join their
society.<component x="42.08" y="51.79" width="251.49" height="489.16" page="8"

engineering subdisciplines are given here. Construction engineering " " takes
directly from the Latin construere meaning to make, build, or erect, thus directly
relating to the activities of the construction engineer. Basically, all that the
construction engineers really do is put together, organize, assemble, and build. Cost
engineering " ," we understand, implies the optimal management of money, which comes
from the Latin word constare, meaning to cost. There is no doubt what cost engineers
aim to achieve with respect to their profession. Environmental engineering " " takes
from the French word around environ meaning "around," implying the city, the
surrounding area, or the city outskirts, which is what environmental engineering
concerns itself with-of the surrounding areas of habitation, the forests, greens, and
other life-supporting surrounds. Environ comes from two syllables in French-en mean(
ing "in" viron meaning circle, circuit . Hence, environ means ((( ( to enclose a
circle, or encircle. Ment is a suffix suggesting "about." Thus, "environment" means
"about the surrounds." Geotechnical engineering " " has geo as the root word, coming
from the Greek geo, which comes from ge, meaning "Earth." Obviously, "geotechnical"
has to do with the technical properties of soils and rocks that are of the Earth, and
so their name represents the functions they are engaged in. Hydraulics engineering, "
" that studies the movement of water and liquids, takes from the root word hydro
meaning water, which was the initial liquid studied as a general standard, not to
mention that rivers, lakes, and canals were all largely made of water in contrast to
other liquids. Hydro is a later adaptation of the Greek hudor meaning water. The
original form of hydraulics is the Greek hydraulikos, which comes from three
syllables- hydr meaning water aulis meaning a reed instrument through ( (( ( which
water is conducted ikos meaning "relating to" . Hence, (( ( ( hydraulics means
relating to the flow of water through enclosures-a very functional description.
Sanitary engineering, " " which is often studied under environmental engineering,
relates to tasks that improve health conditions. "Sanitary" comes from the French
sanitaire and the Latin sanitas-meaning of or relating to health. Hence, the phrase
"sanitary engineering" portrays the area of emphasis of their work. Structural
engineering " " comes from the Latin structus and structura-a past participle of
struere, which means to construct, which is what structural engineers primarily
purport to do. Their designs serve to allow construction to take place. The French
word surveiller meaning to watch over, and the medieval Latin word supervidere
meaning to look over, both contribute to the development of the modern word "survey"

give a name at all, if that is the case? However, names are important for
representation and identification. It is the name that makes a person. Names are the
nom de plume of people, institutions, and nations. Agonizing hours and days are often
spent in giving names to new committees, a newborn child, and to new institutions.
All those hours are meant to serve a purpose. Often, people are urged to "live up to
their name," implying that only reputable, ethical, legal, and honorable tasks should
be done. It is the name that buys reputation and prestige. A name says it all! Native
Indian names attempt to represent an activity of a permeaning son. Names of people in
most parts of the world carry a to them. Names of institutions generally seek to
represent the activity given they are engaged in. For instance, no one can doubt that
the American Concrete Institute deals with concrete. I cannot see how anyone can deny
that the name of an institution must be representative of its activities. But, in the
case of ASCE, civil engineering just does not represent the functions of its
engineers.<component x="317.47" y="310.08" width="251.48" height="220.99" page="9"

evolution, and education of civil engineering, it becomes clear that nothing that is
not infrastructure, public works, and building or factory construction is civil
engineering. It is important to see this in the opposite way to understand what civil
engineers are all about. When we look at the history and origin of civil engineering,
we discover a pattern of activities in infrastructure activities for both civilian
and military use, with building engineering added later starting with West Point's
definition of civil engineering. That notwithstanding, there is no cogent reason for
civil engineering to be given the name it has, for it to have relevance in the modern
world. Moreover, its activities are undertaken by military engineers as well, and we
all know that military engineers get their degrees in civil, electrical, and
mechanical engineering from civilian schools. Military engineers use civil
engineering technologies to build houses, roads, ports, harbors, airfields, and so on
for military installations. Military engineers are extremely involved in
construction, hydraulics, and environmental engineering. Military and civil are all
mixed up here! The prime difference between them and their uniformed brethren is not
at all in the engineering tasks performed, but in that their uniformed brethren learn
to carry a rifle, are trained in combat and bomb disposal techniques, and learn
military strategy. There are many other engineering activities practiced in the
civilian sector-such as electrical and mechanical-that are not called civil
engineering, even though the military uses those fields of engineering. Hence, there
is little logic in assigning the name of civil engineering to the infrastructure
activities of civilianengineers alone engaged in works. The evolution and origin of
the names of engineering disciplines is very logical and meaningful in representing
the activities they are engaged in, tracing to Greek, French, or Latin words,
sometimes to mythology, exceptfor that of civil engineering. There is no use for
civil engineers to continue living in the past for the constraints of military and
civilian that are not applicable in the emancipated and educated society of today
where globalization is commonplace. The militaries of the 18th and 19th Centuries in
Britain and France were particularly elitist, and this created a class distinction
between the activities of the military engineers and other engineers engaged in
similar works. There is no compelling reason today for the discipline to distinguish
itself from the military engineers. The British military, for instance, and some
other professional militaries around the world, as well, have a Corps of Signals
responsible for communication services- having electronics engineering as the core
discipline there. Armies also have a Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers for
repair and maintenance of ordnance, weapons, and armaments, including battle tanks;
this corps has mechanical and electrical engineering as its basic functions.
Apparently, even the name Corps' of Engineers is past in its value, as mechanical,
electrical, industrial, or chemical engineers, or any other engineer save civil
engineer do not become members of the corps. CorreCorps' of Engineers spondingly, is
an anachronism, as well. Military engineering has vastly changed in composition,
nature, and emphasis over the past 150 years. Similarly, civil engineering is no
longer applicable for the profession it wishes to represent, belonging instead to an
era long gone by. Quite frankly, it is strange for military engineers to call
themselves civil engineers as they do these days: quite an oxymoron, since military
is the antonym of civilian. Many civilian activities are not engineering, many
civilian engineering activities involve other disciplines, and many military
engineering activities incorporate civil engineering. Hence, civil engineering fits
in neither one mold nor the other. There is no apparent need for the profession of
Civil Engineering to play second fiddle to Military Engineering. But, tracing the
origins of Civil Engineering Civil Engineering, it is apparent that was secMilitary
Engineering ond or subordinate to in the 18th and 19th Centuries. It therefore seems
that it is time to give a true name to the practice of civil engineering works, such
that it can stand in its own right, rather than being in contrast or comparison to
any other discipline or profession.<component x="317.47" y="51.78" width="251.5"

appropriate enough to describe the activities of the civil engineering profession,
having been a word that traces to the 14th Century, and deriving from the Greek
&#x2425;&#x2427;&#x242F;that originates in the Sanskrit jan, meaning life, implying
that engineers give life to creative ideas. Up until the 18th Century, engineer was
synonymous with the tasks of infrastructure engineering, and it was not until John
Smeaton was compelled to submit his testimony to court that differentiation became
necessary between the military and civilian engineers. The British Corps of Royal
Engineers were commonly known as engineers and performed functions of all engineering
disciplines. Even today, the British and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are known as
just that-"Corps of Engineers"-not "Corps of Civil Engineers," even though the
functions of the Corps of Engineers are subject matter learned in civil engineering
schools. The study confirms that engineering was the name assigned, since the very
beginning of civilization, to activities such as the construction of roads and
bridges, aqueducts, river training, and irrigation, and represent the application of
ingenuity. The word engineer, it was seen, also has nontechnical applications in the
English language. However, the word civil in civil engineering was a word coined out
of convenience-not to represent any function of the engineers practicing
infrastructure development-but to differentiate those working in the civilian sector
from those engaged in military engineering. Whereas, the roots of names of all the
other industrial, minengineering disciplines discussed in the paper- ing, electrical,
chemical, mechanical, agricultural, safety, etc. - are traced to a specific function
they perform, civil can best be civilis traced to civilian and the Latin meaning
polite. This renders civil engineering the only engineering discipline to have a name
that does not represent the works it undertakes. The roots of all civil engineering
subdisciplines- geotechnical, surveying, structures, transportation, cost, and
hydraulics -are also all seen to have their root in a term that represents the
functional applications of the subdiscipline, which is consistent with what we are
seeking. Again, civil engineering is the only exception, even in comparison to its
subdisciplines. Consequently, civil engineering is a term whose era is past and
application is null. To differentiate the military engineer from the civilian
engineer is a meaningless concept rooted in the past, with no significance today,
because all functional tasks performed by the civilian engineers are performed by the
military engineers, as well. There is an incongruity between calling some military
engineers as civil engineers for at least three reasons: 1. The works he does are
undertaken by civil engineers, as well; 2. Civil is already an antonym of military;
hence, the fact they are oxymorons; and 3. Numerous engineering activities taking
place in the civilian realm are not those related to infrastructure or public works
engineering. Thus, mechanical and electrical engineering, for example, would also be
called civil engineering if the logic of the 18th Century were to be applied today.
Thus, the oldest engineering discipline, and the very first engineering society of
the United States still in existence today- ASCE-has a name that has lost its
relevance. This paper extracts-after a comprehensive study of the history, evolution,
and formation of the discipline and its societies-that the name of civil engineering
is void of substance that does not connote what the discipline is about. This does
not imply that civil engineering ( itself is void of substance, and no such meaning
is intentioned. ( This indicates that a name change may be in order. So, what's in a
name? Actually, plenty is. A name is the nom de plume of an institution. Civil
engineers cannot boast of their name representing the tasks and functions they
perform. What the new name should or should not be is not attempted to be addressed
in this paper. Appendix I. Contemporary Words Having Their Root in Gen Word source:

attended no formal, technical school, but was certified as a fully qualified surveyor
by William and Mary College upon the passing of an examination. This article says "On
June 9, 1778, at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, General George Washington issued a call
for engineers and engineering education. This order is considered the genesis of a
U.S. Army Engineer School, which found its permanent home at Fort Belvoir, Virginia."
Again, "In 1794, President Washington established a Corps of Artillerists and

1852, civil engineering already had a history, and the British Institution of Civil
Engineers had preceded ASCE by half a century. Engineers had styled themselves as
"civil engineers" and universities offered courses in civil engineering. The
construction of public roads and bridges, and canals and drainage systems had been
practiced since time immemorial, and had been recorded for thousands of years. But
somehow, "civil engineering" came to be spoken of only in the 18th Century. The
"engineer," however, has been around for centuries. Many engineers, especially today,
have a misconception of the origin of the word engineer, thinking that it derives
from engine; nothing is farther from the truth, as this study explores. This paper
studies the origin of "civil engineer" and proposes that the word "civil" is an
anachronism. Moreover, the name does not reflect the reality of the technical
functions, nor the actual type of work performed in this glorious branch of
engineering. Does a name affect anything at all? Perhaps yes, or yet again, perhaps
not, depending on how the issue is viewed. If it is viewed from the former
perspective, then there can be cause for concern and chagrin. Nevertheless, this
paper is the result of a study to determine whether there is a fit between civil and
the "engineering" works performed by the civil engineer.<component x="42.08"

the Latin, French, and Middle English McDonald 1914; ASCE 1970 : ( (  Middle Latin:
ingeniarius;  Old French: engignier;  Middle English: engyneour; and  French:
ingenieur. Also related to these are the words ingenuity coming from the Latin
ingenuita and French ingenuite; and ingenious comes from the Latin ingeniosus. Quite
apparently, all have gen as their root term. "Origin" 1910 has the best and most
clear-cut explanation of ( ( the root gen. That article asserts "The root of both the
words, Engineer and Engine is found in the Sanskrit jan, to be born, from gen
&#x2425;&#x2427;&#x242F; which came the Greek form and the Latin , the latter genere
ingebeing embodied in the old verb , with its compound nere ingignere changed into (
(, to implant by birth, and in the later ingenium substantive , an innate or natural
quality." McDonald 1914 , a Past President of ASCE, confirms from an ( ( independent
study through the consultation of a lexicographer, that the Sanskrit root jan is the
true origin of the Greek and Latin root of gen, which has led to the formation of
many words in English in common use even today see Appendix I . This should ( ( ( not
be surprising: numerous words in English have their root in Sanskrit. ( Consequently,
the engineer is someone who gives life to ideas, bringing to life various machines
and systems, which makes a lot of sense in modern day terms. Therefore, the Engineer
"creates." gen He applies his "ingenuity," which has its roots in , to give "life" to
things and develop new systems. Consequently, the word "generate" is understood to
mean something that is given life to gen and put into action, where , again, is the
root word. The word gen "genius" is understood in its derivation from as someone who
can give life and vitality to words and things, which is what geniuses do when they
invent new systems or solve difficult problems. Similarly, the implied derivatives of
the words listed in Appendix I can be traced back to gen, which is traced back to
jan, which means life. As a matter of record, jan does not really mean birth, but
means life. In all likelihood, "Origin" 1910 made a minor error, ( ( probably because
of unfamiliarity with Sanskrit. Birth is actually derived from jan, when life is
given to a soul or entity, but is not jan itself in Sanskrit, jan= life and
janam=birth . Nevertheless, ( ( &#x2425;&#x2427;&#x242F; this does not detract from
jan being the root of the Greek .<component x="317.47" y="51.69" width="251.49"

engineer has its roots in the root word gen, and not in the word engine, which itself
is derived from gen. The common misconception that engineer came from engine is,
however, understandable because the operators of steam engines were called engineers.
The Oxford English Dictionary defined the engineer as one who managed engines or had
charge of steam engines; in the United States, the driver of a locomotive engine was
often called an engineer; the engineer was also known as a contriver or maker of
engines. For instance the obituary of John Hampson, Esq., Engineer, in 1854, read at
an ASCE meeting, stated Hunt 1897 : "Mr. Hampson aided in the construction of ( ( as
a machinist and ran as Engineman, the first Locomotive En( ( gine built in America .
. ." In history, actually, the water wheel was referred to as an engine, as it
brought water up, whereas the designer and maker of the water wheel was known as an
engineer, which is true even today. Various machines have been invented in the world
going back to the time of Archimedes and before The History Channel ( 2004 . Is this
a chicken and egg problem, as to what came first- ( the engine or the engineer? No.
Clearly, the engine could not have been created without the brains of some engineer.
engineer Moreover, the word has nowhere been reported to be derived engine from ,
though the misconception is somewhat popular among people, especially after the onset
of the steam engine in locomotives. Correspondingly, it is quite logical to un( (
derstand that engine and engineer are related Herbert 1633 and have their root in a
common word, gen.<component x="42.08" y="310.08" width="251.48" height="299.21"

credited with the day when engineering blossomed as a formal discipline, although all
engineering was combined in one, and there was no differentiation between Corps of
the disciplines. This was the day of the formation of the Engineers of the military
of Great Britain ASCE 1970 . The ( ( Oxford English Dictionary subsequently carried a
definition of engineer that reflected the military engineer: "One who designs Corps
of and constructs military works for attack or defense." The Engineers Corps of Royal
Engineers was renamed in 1787, and was charged with the designing and constructing of
military fortifications, ramparts, canals, river management, railways, road, and
bridge making. They were also tasked with penetrating enemy fortifications using
whatever technologies they could muster. For instance, the battle-tank of World War I
was a design of the Royal Engineers practicing general engineering, when they first
installed steel plates around a four-wheel drive vehicle to attack infantry
positions, though Leonardo da Vinci had first proposed armor around a cart to the
Ruler of Milan in the 15th century. Later editions of the Oxford English Dictionary
in the 18th Century defined engineer as "one whose profession is the designing and
constructing of works of public utility, such as bridges, roads, canals, railways,
harbors, drainage works, gas, and water works," which we can see, are public works
items. Therefore, by the end of the 18th Century, the word engineer, itself, was
taken public works engineering as . As the use of engineer and civil engineer were
practically synonymous with respect to civilians, civilian engineer the was
distinguished on the professional level military engineers Diconly from (Calhoun 1960
. The French ( tionnaire de la Langue Francais of the 18th Century carried the
following definitions of engineer, bringing out the fact that public works engineers
in the civilian sector performed works undertaken by the military engineers, as well
McDonald 1914 : ( ( 1. Engineer-one who plans, lays out, and directs field work and
fortifications, for attacking, defending, or fortifying places. 2. Engineer-one who

the record of practice notes that the person engaged in such practice was, indeed,
classified as an engineer, in that he designed and constructed new systems, and
brought life to his constructions. The public used those systems en masse-for general
consumption of the populace.<component x="42.08" y="51.78" width="251.48"

roots of names of common engineering disciplines in alphabetical order : ( (
Aeronautical engineering " " traces its origin to the prefix aer meaning air, gas, or
atmosphere. Aer is originally a Greek and Latin word meaning air, so when we wish to
study the flight of aircraft in air, it is quite logical to call it aeronautical
engineering. An "architect" is one who designs and supervises the construction of
buildings-coming from the Greek arkhitekton, meaning master builder. It is logical to
observe that " architecture" has been derived from arkhitekton. agricultural
engineering Improving soil cultivation is " ." "Agriculture" comes from two
roots-ager, meaning "field" in Latin; and cultura, meaning to cultivate. Ager has
been the root word for growing of food and crops for many millennia. The meaning of
the tasks and functions performed by agricultural engineering are immediately clear
from their roots. Biological engineering " ," an up and coming field of study,
derives from the root words bios-Greek for life-and logia- Greek for study. Nothing
could more truly represent the engineering applied to the study of living species.
Chemistry has been around for ages-and anything to do with preparing chemical plants
and kilns or handling chemicals was chemical engineerrightfully and justifiably given
the name of " ing ." The alchemist strove for centuries to transmute ordinary
materials and chemical substances into gold. Medieval Latin referred to that pursuit
as alchemia, alchimicus, and alchymia. The practitioner was called in New Latin as
chimicus or alchemist. Therefore, it was quite natural to come up with the name of
chemical engineering for the study of chemical plants and machinery, as chemistry was
already known and derived from alchemia. The root is traced to the French chimic for
"chemical," and Late Greek chemeia for "chemistry." Computer engineering " " comes
from the Latin word computare, meaning the ability to make determinations by
numerical methods. For centuries, mathematicians had toiled with computing strategies
until they hit on the abacus, the logarithm tables, slide rule, and then, finally,
the computer after the discovery of electronics. Goddess Electra was said to appear
to mortals in the form of a comet . The bright light of the comet, its flare, and the
ominous power of comets made quite an impression on humans. It was quite logical,
therefore, for "electrical engineering" to be given this name for the study of
electricity that dealt with power and light. Thomas Edison, if we recall, brought
electricity from the heavens in his experiment with a kite that led to the light
bulb. Electra electrical engiGoing from to "electricity" and then to neering was not
far-fetched at all. Moreover, "electric" derives from the Greek electron, akin to
Greek elektor meaning beaming sun. Elektor is reported to come from the Sanskrit ulka
meaning fiery phenomenon in sky, or meteor. Hence, Goddess Electra was given a
suitable name in reference to her characteristic. fire protection engineers The " "
took their name from the Old English fyr, meaning fire. They did not have to go far
to find their name to represent their basic function. hospital engineers The Society
for " " takes their name from the modern "hospital," which took its name from the
Latin hospitum meaning hospitality; the Latin hospitalis, meaning good treatment of a
guest; and the Latin hospes, meaning host, as it is in the hospital that patients are
treated with care and love hope( fully , much as traditional cultures treat well and
respectfully a ( host or guest. The word Hospital refers to treating well those who
come to the hospital, thereby reflecting a major function of the hospital and
hospital engineers. When workers sweat from their brow to produce industrial goods,
and when people work hard in factories to produce goods, we know they have been
"industrious" in the exercise of their duties-coming from the Latin industria meaning
diligent, and Middle English industrie. It is no surprise that the branch of
engineering dealing with workplace productivity and manufacture industrial
engineering of goods is called " ." The word "industrial is further composed of two
roots-Indo and struus. Indo comes from Indu that comes from endo that means "within."
Struus comes from the Latin struere that means to arrange and build; in this sense,
it is similar to the root of "construction," explained later. Together, indo and
struus mean "building within"-in other words, working hard, or diligent. Marine
engineering " " has to do with the oceans and seas, and it would be quite logical to
expect marine to have something to do with ocean or sea. Marine comes from the Old
French marin, which comes from the Latin marinus, which comes from mare, meaning sea.
The "mariner" is, thus, one who explores the sea. Hence, we have a direct connection
here to the functions of the marine engineers in their name. Mekhane is the original
Greek word for machine. Anything that is suggestive of or appropriate for performance
of a machine mechanical enis, therefore, quite logically given the name of "
gineering ." The word mekhane has been around for millennia, so it was reasonable
when the word mechanical engineering was chosen for the study of modern machines.
Military engineering " " comes from the word military that comes from the Latin root
miles meaning soldier and the Latin root militare meaning to serve as a soldier.
Mining engineering " ," another very old and important form of engineering,
considering how important metals such as gold have been through the centuries, even
before Christ. The root of "mining" comes to us from the Welsh and the Old French.
The Welsh origin, mywn, meaning "ore" is expected to be of Celtic origin. The Old
French origin, miniere or mine, means "mineral." Nuclear engineering " " deals with
harnessing the power of the nucleus of atoms. The word "nuclear" derives directly
from the Latin nucleus or nuculeus. In physics, "nucleus" represents the central
region of an atom whose energy is harnessed in nuclear ( engineering and containing
almost all of the mass of an atom. ( The word itself means the kernel-the most
material and central part: The core. Nucleus further derives from nux, meaning nut,
wherein it is implied that the nucleus of the atom is like a nut and grouping of
subatomic particles. Petroleum engineering " " deals with drawing oil from under the
layers of rock and beds of earth. Truly enough, petroleum is derived from Latin
petra, meaning rock and the Latin oleum, meaning oil, giving an instantaneous
understanding of the type of work and tasks involved-where the name explains the
functions. "safety engineering" Finally, is one of the most obvious cases where the
name of the engineering discipline directly implies the type of work being
undertaken. Safety engineering concerns itself with being safe, free from danger or
harm, unhurt- of maintain( ( ing health. The word safe comes to us from the Middle
English sauf and from the Latin salvus meaning healthy. ( Hence, it is apparent that
the names of all major engineering disciplines except civil engineering that has not
been defined yet ( come from root words that represent their technical
functions.<component x="42.08" y="51.78" width="251.49" height="422.12" page="3"

claim to having discovered or invented engineering. From the earliest times, human
settlements have sought to construct dams and barrages for water supply; move earth
to build embankments; quarried and hewed to patterns and line; dug rivulets to
increase irrigation for the fields; and applied the lever, roller, and the inclined
plane from Sumeria to Mohenjo-Daro, Egypt to China. All known ancient civilizations
of Assyria, Babylonia, China, Etruscia, India, Misr Egypt , Per(( sia, and Phoenicia
built canals and aqueducts, docks and harbors, palaces and cities, roads and
suspension bridges, and drainage and water supply systems. All these activities were
performed for humankind to quench their thirst, grow crops, keep the environment
clean through sanitation, and basically improve their quality of life. The urge to
improve one's lot is a characteristic of the human race. Biblical records tell us
that Noah used bitumen in the construction of his ark; bitumen was also used to make
watertight, the casket in which Moses was committed to the Nile as a forlorn baby
Watkins 1891 . These were the humble beginnings of the ( ( field of study known as
civil engineering. Later to be added to this field were military pursuits, such as
fortifications and ramparts, moats and bridges, tunnels and catapults. Three prime
examples out of the hundreds and thousands that were executed of the practice of
engineering in the ancient world-marvels of ingenuity in their time-that are all
infrastructure projects, are as follows Watkins 1891 : ( (  1000 B.C.: Phoenicia:
Harbors of Tyre and Sidon;  875 B.C.: Assyria: Tunnel at Negoub connected to an open
channel excavated in rock, for the purpose of conducting water of the river Zab to
the city of Numrud; and  800 B.C.: Assyria: Construction of sewers at Khorsabad with
pointed arches that supported the earth above them; construction of docks and
warehouses at Port Cadiz; working of tin mines. All these were done for the purposes
of trading everywhere along the Mediterranean. Interestingly, the construction of
buildings is nowhere mentioned as primarily an engineering work, though references to
engineers supporting the master-builder architect are discovered in literature. The
many wonders of the ancient world-the pyramids, construction of palaces and halls, or
the beauty of cathedrals and temples are placed in the realm of the master-builder
architect, and are nowhere recorded as falling under the purview of the engineer or
public works engineering. The Medes, Carthaginians, and Greeks were to follow the
Phoenicians and Assyrians with larger infrastructure projects for the maintenance of
their cities. Similarly, we know that Julius Caesar was an expert on public and
infrastructure works prior to his ascension as the Ruler of Rome. For instance, he
was called upon to solve the transport crisis in Rome, much as we would have
transportation engineers do today. As "all roads literally ( ( led to Rome" owing to
Rome's central position in the trade and commerce of the nation, Rome was afflicted
with a severe traffic problem for which Julius Caesar presented solutions, not all of
which were successful, though Singh 2000 . ( ( The Romans were known to have enormous
engineering accomplishments to serve their war machine, and applied their skills to
public works too. There were estimated 250 mi of aqueducts during the Roman period,
50 mi of which were supported on stone arches. It was estimated that these aqueducts
poured into Rome over 300 million gallons per day Watkins 1891 . ( ( Rome continued
to build canals and locks, being among the first in relatively recent times to build
canals, especially in Milan, a city dependent on canals, and later aided by Leonardo
da Vinci who offered his services as an infrastructure expert to the Ruler of Milan.
Interestingly, these public works were distinguished from building works. Public
works applications are evident throughout the world from China to the Mayan Empire,
Viking maritime operations in Northern Europe to Central Asian road constructions,
and they cannot all be mentioned. Suffice to say that it is discovered that all the
works undertaken in earlier millennia that led to the modinfrastructure works ern
practice of Civil Engineering cover for public improvements . Calhoun 1960 opines
that the "precise definition of the term ( ( 'civil engineer' can cause needless
concern." From a practical perspective, he has a somewhat valid point. He argues that
civil engineering evolved over time from the many activities of a large variety of
engineers, coming from a mixed source of agrarian, mercantile, and military origins,
in addition to newer industrial ways. The ingenuity of the public works or civil
engineer had to vast array many fields be applied to a of applications in of
activity. In addition, a name is often the superset of dynamic language, culturally
inspired, and socially shaped. Moreover, as Calhoun implies, the tasks and functions
of the civil engineer do not change no matter what the name is. Further, the name has
been in vogue for many decades and has been accepted, so why bother with the name at
all? Nevertheless, it is obvious that the name has caused concern to people, as
Calhoun implies; we do not know whom, though. However, the name, or lack of an
appropriate name, is a matter of interest to the author.<component x="42.08"

transport of factory goods. In 1850, there were 83 municipal water supplies Calhoun
1960 . ( ( Much infrastructure engineering work had also been accomplished in the
nonmilitary area. The 1787 law establishing the Northwest Territory decreed that 2%
of land revenues be allocated to construction of the National Road, the "Cumberland
Pike" from Washington to the Ohio River. By 1820, the United States had 9,000 mi of
rock and gravel surfaced roads Wisely ( 1974 . Railroads greatly stimulated the need
for infrastructure en( gineers. In 1840, there were 9,000 miles of railroads in the
United States; 30,000 in 1850, with about $300 million being invested that year for
the construction of railroads Houghton Mifflin ( 2004 . ( America carried over much
of the European social patterns. As Europeans came to the new world in search of a
better life, all the skills and trades were brought with them. It was necessary to
build the new nation from scratch. European society had recognized the military
engineer, the architect, and the civilian engineer as appropriate men to plan and
direct large public works Calhoun ( 1960 . The year 1785 saw a surge in the hiring of
engineers, for ( example, for the improvement of navigation in the Potomac River by
the Potomac Company, whose President was George Washington himself Kaylor 2005 . It
was difficult to get an engineer all ( ( the way from Europe, and earlier personnel
selected by the Potomac Company to manage the engineering proved unsatisfactory in
their work. Engineers were in short supply, and the shortage continued to be felt
through to the civil war. John Quincy Adams, then Minister to Great Britain, once
transmitted the application of an English engineer anxious to seek employment in the
United States. However, European engineers were generally hard to get. The preference
was usually for French engineers who were considered more scientifically educated
Calhoun 1960 . ( ( There was confusion as to the type of engineer that could be found
for infrastructure projects. Architects often doubled up as managers of works, such
as Benjamin Latrobe who worked as a civil engineer on the Susquehanna navigation
survey, Philadelphia works, and the Chesapeake and Delaware canals. For various
reasons, he felt himself not appreciated in America. The owners and presidents of
canal and river improvement companies themselves felt uncertain on how to find the
necessary supervision for their projects. They tried various personnel, meeting with
disappointment for a long time, until they finally realized, as in the case of Mr.
Phillip Schuyler, President of Western and Northern infrastructure engineers rienced,
professional Inland Lock Navigation Companies, that only the hiring of expewould
fulfill their needs and demands of project success Calhoun 1960 . Basically, ( ( it
is evident that those who had worked specifically on infrastructure projects would be
qualified then for the type of work we call civil engineering today. There was some
difficulty in hiring architects to fulfill engineering roles. The architect's task is
largely to arrange materials artistically to enhance the internal living experience
as much as possible. The training of an architect did little to equip him with
knowledge of soils for moving earth, or properties of channel flow for river
training, or the sinking of caissons for bridge foundations, which was knowledge
required in the practice of infrastructure development. The difficulty in acquiring
competent engineers prompted the U.S. Congress to establish West Point, as a starter,
for training engineers for military infrastructure projects. This set the stimulus
for private schools to begin civil engineering instruction. In 1816, the states of
New York, Virginia, and South Carolina sought engineers for canal and road building.
Whereas, the preference was for an engineer, the jobs were still filled by
architects, land surveyors, contractors, and draftsmen owing to a general shortage of
qualified engineers. It is reported that the total number of engineers or
quasi-engineers active or available in the United States up to 1816 never averaged
more than two per state Calhoun ( public works 1960 . However, they were all engaged
in . They ( came from all over-they were surveyors, landholders, speculators,
builders, contractors, lawyers, architects, and military engineers. Thus, it is
straight to see that the tasks engineers performed for which they were later named
civil engineers were what we cominfrastructure engineering monly know today as . It
was nowhere for building engineering that they were called civil engineers, but
public works infrastrucbasically for improvement projects of an ture nature. The
fundamental finding of this section is that the skills that employers sought in civil
engineers related to public works or infrastructure works, a somewhat embodied field
of knowledge by the mid-19th century. The shortage was not felt for building works,
since there were architects available for the design and construction of
buildings.<component x="42.08" y="51.8" width="251.5" height="546.13" page="5"

engineer of his times is recorded as the first person to sign himself as a civil
engineer, in 1761 "Origin" 1910; McDonald 1914 . Wisely 1974 mentions that ( ( ( (
Smeaton signed himself in as civil engineer, as he was engaged in the building of
roads, structures, and canals in England in a civilian capacity. Fairweather 2002
reports that Smeaton signed him( ( self so while presenting testimony to the courts
in 1782. This was probably in addition to his signing in 1761, but there could be
confusion on the dates in the historical records, but this does not detract from the
fact that Smeaton is credited with being the first person to style himself as civil
engineer. By 1761, it can be inferred that calling oneself an engineer Corps of Royal
Engineers meant one was in the . As Smeaton could not misrepresent himself in court,
he had to come up with an alternate to engineer and military engineer. Moreover,
there was no precedence in the matter before Smeaton, and he suitably struck on civil
engineer. It is probably logical to speculate that he took counsel in the matter,
that he had support of the professional community, and that others in the profession
had been referring to themselves as civil engineers in the vernacular. The
distinction between military and civilian engineering was Dictionnaire de la Langue
Francaise brought out by the French of the 18th Century, carrying the following
definition: "Civil Engineer-name given to engineers who are not trained in technical
schools or who work for private industry." An interesting part of this definition is
the portion about training in technical schools. Though no one today could be
recognized as a civil engineer without training education in a techni( ( cal
engineering school, only military engineers were trained in ( ( school in 18th
Century France. The others, who worked in the School of civilian sector, earned their
credentials through the Hard Knocks (which refers in the colloquial to learning that
takes place on the job or on the streets, in contrast to formal learning in school .
Thus, civil engineers were differentiated from their mili( tary engineering
counterparts in 18th Century France through the above-mentioned definition. The
Society of Civil Engineers SCE in Great Britain was the ( ( first civil engineering
society in the world, formed in 1793 following years of effort that dated back to
1771, a good 55 years after the formation of the British Corps of Engineers, and at
least a decade after Smeaton had styled himself as civil engineer. The SCE served to
formalize and embody what was only loosely civilian engineer civil engineer used-the
term and style of , or , for short. The SCE transformed in 1818 to the British
Institution of Civil Engineers ICE . Thomas Telford, who had a career as a surveyor,
( ( and road, bridge, and canal builder, was appointed its first President in 1820,
in which position he served until his death in 1834. He helped ICE get a Royal
Charter in 1828-a recognition that helped establish ICE as the preeminent
organization for civil engineers "Encyclopedia" 2005 . ( ( At home, the U.S. Congress
legislated the Army Corps of Engineers in 1794, and the U.S. Military Academy was
created at West Point in 1802, with the specific purpose of supporting military
engineering functions. In 1821, the Congress enacted legislation specifically
directing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct surveys of roads and canals
jointly with "engineer officcivilians ers" of the Corps and engineers from among
engaged in such work, who the Congress referred to as civil engineers. Hence, this
was the first official recognition of this special nature civil engineering of work
being given the name of . In 1824, Congress further passed an act authorizing the
President to use engicivilian neer officers from the army, as well as engineers, to
make surveys for roads and canals considered of national importance Wisely 1974;
Calhoun 1960 . ( ( When the Oxford English Dictionary enhanced its definition of
engineering in the 18th Century, they contrasted works that the military performed
with identical works performed in the civilian community, defining such professionals
in the civilian community civil engineer as a , for distinction from the military
engineer. It was not until ICE had been formed that in 1828 they formally defined
civil engineering as ". . . that species of knowledge which constitutes the
profession of a civil engineer; being the art of directing the great source of power
in nature for the use and convenience of man; of the means of production and of
traffic in states, both for external and internal trade, as applied in the
construction of roads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation, and docks, for
internal intercourse and exchange; and in the construction of ports, harbors, moles,
breakwaters, and light-houses; commerce; and in the construction and adoption of
machinery; and in the drainage of cities and towns." Somewhat similar to the ICE
definition was the West Point definition of civil engineering prepared in December
1831 U.S. ( Congress 1831 . It differed partially from the ICE definition to the (
extent that the West Point definition incorporated building engiCivil Engineering
neering within the field of civil engineering: " , viz.: the properties, preparation
and use of materials; elementary parts of buildings; composition and distribution of
buildings; art of construction; decorative architecture; manner of laying out and
constructing roads; discussion of the different kinds of stone, iron, and wooden
bridges, with the methods of construction; consideration of the obstacles impeding
the navigation of rivers, and their remedies; details of the various constructions on
a canal; survey, location, and construction of a canal; calculation of the economy of
canal transportation; different kinds of rail-roads; survey, location, and
construction of a line of railway; economy of transportation on railroads; and
construction of artificial and improvement of natural harbors." However, the word
civil in civil engineering is nowhere seen to explain any activity being undertaken:
Civil actually traces its roots to the Latin civilis meaning polite; "civilian" is
derived from civilis, which comes from the Latin, Middle English, and Middle French
word of civis, meaning citizen. Civil also means mannerly, presentable, courteous,
courtly, gallant, chivalrous, forThe American bearance from rudeness or
unpleasantness refer to ( Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 3rd Ed. , none
of ( which represent the engineering functions of civil engineering. In contrast, the
word "military" is derived from the Latin miles meaning soldier, which well explains
the military engineer. Civil is not a technical root of engineering functions, and
therefore is a gross misnomer for civil engineering. Civil is used from out of
convenience rather than to represent function, thereby making civil engineering the
sole exception to all engineering disciplines mentioned in this article.<component

benefits from its colonies around the world, immigration and the conquest of a large
frontier in North America was increasing the need for infrastructure projects there,
largely for transportation purposes that had a direct impact on economic activity and
personal mobility. Moreover, the U.S. military needed the same type of infrastructure
for the conquests of the vast frontiers. This demand led to West Point being started
as the first engineering academy in the country in 1802, as was mentioned earlier. At
the time, the primary engineering tasks taught were surveying, road making, and
design and construction of hydraulic locks and railroads. Prior to 1802, there was no
formal education in civil engineering in the United States, and practitioners
acquired their knowledge through apprenticeship and fieldwork, with some of them
having completed a course of study in the sciences and mathematics. However, the
first and oldest school of civil engineering was L'Ecole Militaire de Saint Cyr the ,
established in Paris in 1763. For a long time, it was considered a fine institution,
ranked high among all nations. French engineers, graduates of that institution were
highly sought Calhoun 1960 , especially by the U.S. gov( ( ernment between the period
1775 and 1825, during which time French military engineers helped Napoleonic power
become the premier world power. Colleges and universities in the United States that
began to offer civil engineering instruction following the creation of West Point are
listed in the following Wisely ( 1974 ; the dates given represent the first degrees
offered, and it ( must be noted that the universities began their civil engineering (
programs a few years before these dates refer to Phelan et al. 1995 : (  1821:
American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy renamed Lewis College, and later
renamed Norwich Univer( sity , known popularly as the "Partridge Academy" after Allen
( Partridge, its founder;  1835: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute;  1845: Union
College;  1846: Yale College; and  1846: Harvard College. In spite of this
education, there were only 512 civil engineers by 1850. For even those who listed
their profession as engineer in contrast to civil engineer, most worked on canals and
railroads, which goes to show again how synonymous and interchangeable the two terms
were. To many, the engineer was known as a person responsible for infrastructure,
industrial, and municipal improvements where the most commonly understood
infrastructure im( provements were railroads; canals and locks for river navigation
and agriculture; roads, highways, and bridges Calhoun 1960 . ( ( ( Popular literature
of the early 19th Century assumed that the eninternal improvements gineer was mainly
a designer of -what we would call infrastructure today; the 1824 Act of Congress,
menBoard of Engineers for Intioned previously, was overseen by a ternal Improvements
in the War Department. Allen Partridge was formerly a Superintendent of West Point,
from where he resigned after clashing with his superiors. He opened the Partridge
Academy at Norwich, used the same textbooks as West Point, and offered his graduates
jobs on the New York canals. In 1825, Partridge wrote to the Governor of New York, De
Witt Clinton, that his course was "to prepare young men for the scientific discharg
sic. of the duties of Civil Engineers." (( He felt that if the country could prepare
its own engineers, they would never have to look to Europe for them. Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute RPI taught mensuration, ( ( surveying, and engineering.
Professor Amos Eaton, who taught the course, felt that advanced mathematics was
unnecessary to teach to engineering students, and even politely criticized the text
Elementary Course in Civil used by West Point instructor, Mahan, Engineering , a
textbook that was popular and saw seven editions from 1837 to 1868 Calhoun 1960 . The
opinion of Professor ( ( Eaton resonates today in the education of the modern
construction manager in the United States, exemplified in university curricula
accredited by the American Council on Construction Education ACCE , whose graduates
supervise construction projects identi( ( cal to the construction engineers from
ABET-accredited schools. However, much of the earlier civil engineering courses were
taught by professors of mathematics at a variety of schools-a disposition that
somewhat characterizes the profession and is reflected in the heavy mathematics
required today for civil engineers in an ABET-accredited curriculum. In Hanover
College, a professor of mathematics taught civil engineering courses; at the
University of Michigan in 1837, the professor of mathematics was also professor of
natural philosophy and civil engineering; whereas at the University of Virginia in
1836-1837, professors of mathematics and natural philosophy taught civil engineering
courses; in 1837, Charles Hackley, a professor of mathematics taught civil
engineering at the University of New York Calhoun ( 1960 . The first half of the 19th
Century was to witness the slow ( but steady maturing of civil engineering as a
profession, largely through formal education. Other schools offering some kind of
engineering courses between 1831 and 1852 included the following:  Geneva College; 
Dartmouth College, Hanover, N.H.;  Lehigh University, Pa.;  City Academy,
Washington, D.C.;  William and Mary College;  Georgetown College, Ky.;  Elijah
Slack's School, Cincinnati;  Miami University, Miami;  University of Alabama;  St.
John's College, Md.;  East Tennessee College; and  Virginia Military Institute.
However, these engineering courses were no more than a minor part of the instruction.
It is important to observe that their emphainfrastructure engineering sis was the
teaching of -the main job market of engineers of the time being railroads, canals,
roads, bridges, barrages, and harbors. Building engineering was added quite as a
consequence, since the principles of science for analyzing and designing bridges was
identical to that for buildings, essentially those pertaining to Newton's laws of
motions and calculus. As can be evidently observed, the courses and content in all
universities were geared to the training of engineers for infrastructure
development-whether they were in the military or civilian practice. However, by the
early 1800s, the name of civil engineer had become "stuck," and universities had no
opportunity to give a different name to their training.<component x="317.47"

1850. However, alarmed by the number of West Point graduates leaving military service
for civilian service, apparently for better fortunes based on their excellent
education, Congress forbade all army engineers in 1838 to take employment with
private companies. This put pressure on private universities to take up civil
engineering education, resulting in Yale and Harvard to begin teaching the subject.
With the formation of the American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects ASCEA ,
civil engineering ( ( education would be given a major boost, and the need to debar
military engineers from entering civilian service would be slowly diminished.
Nevertheless, we again see that the engineers were primarily sought to work on
internal improvement projects such as railroads, canals, harbors and docks, and roads
and bridges-items required for military mobility, as well as trade and commerce.
Thus, it is evident that the West Point engineer and the training imparted at West
Point served immensely to define the discipline L'Ecole Militaire of Civil
Engineering, as did the of France, and the Corps' of Engineers of Great Britain. It
is also evident that the Partridge Academy and RPI were formed as a consequence of
the existence of West Point. Further, there was none to little distinction between
the work of West Point graduates engaged in military projects and those of Partridge
and RPI engaged in civilian public works projects. The only feature that
distinguished them was their uniform and their work in the military or civilian
sectors. Hence, the concretization of civil engineering. Moreover, those who could,
went on to college, but they still ended up working alongside those who did not or
could not go to college. Slowly, those with college degrees would increasingly take
up design works, creating an exclusive distinction from those infrastructure
engineering and work function was still the same- in construction who had no college
degrees. But, the discipline .<component x="317.47" y="51.79" width="251.49"

Improvements of Roads and Inland Navigation , which sought to promote the technical
functions of civil engineers, was perhaps the earliest public works organization in
North America, being founded in 1789. They concerned themselves with activities such
as canals, locks, bridges, roads, tunnels, tramways, breakwaters, harbor works, and
industrial installations. L'Ecole Militaire Given that the military engineers of were
Royal Enconsidered the finest, most sophisticated, and that the gineers West Point in
Britain had already been formed, had started to produce military engineers engaged in
infrastructure The Society for Promoting the Improveprojects, and the fact that ments
of Roads and Inland Navigation had already commenced ICE its activities, whereas had
received a Royal Charter, a group led by Mr. John Jervis proposed to start a national
civil engineering organization, in 1836, that was distinct from the poorly trained
builders, on the one side, and the military engineers, on the other. There was a need
to make that distinction as the civilian and military engineers worked on identical
types of infrastructure and public works projects, and the realities of contracting
as well as professional pride dictated such a distinction necessary. However, it was
not until 1839 that this group was able to coordinate its efforts to meet in
Baltimore Fairweather 2002; Calhoun ( 1960 . During their deliberations, there were
divisions among the ( attendees, and the effort to form a civil engineering society
was not successful. It was not again until 1852-a long, 13 years later-that the group
of 1839 met with a slightly expanded group, reinforced by those in the building
trade, and formally established the "American Society of Civil Engineers and
Architects" ASCEA . ( ( A statement crafted by the committee in 1839 to describe the
work of their profession, brings out that their major interest was public
infrastructure works . They also recognized the success of the Institution of Civil
Engineers U.K. Wisely 1974 , thereby ( ( ( ( accepting de facto ICE's definition that
constituted the art and practice of civil engineering. Though journals of civil
engineering American Railroad Journal appeared later, the was already in existence,
and an article in that journal in 1840 explained reasons behind the collapse of the
1839 effort in forming a civil engineering society, basically disagreements where the
members were not convinced of the need, not to mention that some participants came
from varying states and had not known each other. Railroad engineering was
quintessentially the same field of study as other infrastructure engineering fields,
such as roads and bridges, the principles of alignment and curve being similar. In
this regard, it American Railroad Journal is interesting that the was started in
1832, some time before the civil engineering societies were formed. The Boston
Society of Civil Engineers BSCE , founded in ( ( 1848, was consequently the first
civil engineering organization in America, not to mention that it was the first
engineering society of the United States, as well. Boston had a large concentration
of public works engineers, and Massachusetts was among the first colonies to induct
European technology, much of it from Great Britain, becoming economically and
technologically well developed. Boston had a bustling harbor, an elaborate road
feeder system, and was a cultural hub for two centuries from the 17th to the 19th
Centuries. But, as the BSCE was restricted to Massachusetts and Connecticut, a civil
engineering society was indicated to serve the nation at large. A New York Institute
of Civil Engineers was formed in 1848, but ceased activity in 1850 for lack of
support. Though the ASCEA was formed in 1852, the architects opted out and formed
their own society in 1857, thereby prompting ASCEA to change their name to just
"ASCE" in 1868. It was going to be 1877 before the name, ASCE, was registered legally
Fairweather 2002 . ( ( In any case, the ASCEA founded in 1852 met regularly until
1855, after which it experienced a hiatus of 12 years, much of which can be
attributed to the civil war, but also due to the fact that the first President, James
Laurie, a prime mover of ASCEA, took assignments in Nova Scotia for two years,
evaluating railroads and planning extensions; and six years as Chief Engineer of the
New Haven-Springfield and Hartford Railroad. Interestingly, James Laurie was one of
the founding fathers of the BSCE, in addition to his activities in ASCE Fairweather
2002 . ( ( Other societies were formed in the United States after ASCE, as follows: 
American Institute of Architects, AIA: 1857;  American Institute of Mining
Engineers, AIME: 1871;  American Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME: 1880; 
Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, IEEE: 1884; and  American
Institute of Chemical Engineers, AIChE: 1908. ASCE, ASME, IEEE, and AIME were
founding members of the United Engineering Trustees, which operated the United
Engineering Center in New York that had been kindly provided with a $1 million
donation by Carnegie. ASCE is thus the oldest of the American engineering societies.
ICE is perhaps the oldest engineering society in the world, none other known to exist
before her. This correlates well with infrastructure engineering being the first
known engineering activity of ancient times, and with all engineering being
considered synonymous to civil engineering. Basically, it appears that the move to
form civil engineering societies was to embody the knowledge pertaining to the
practice of infrastructure engineering and building construction. Much as in earlier
years, where all engineering was synonymous with civil engineering, ASCEA first
sought to be the society for allengineers and architects. ASCEA opened applications
for its membership to architects, mining engineers, mechanical engineers, and naval
engineers. It was a mistaken and arrogant judgment, in the writer's opinion, that
motivated the civil engineers of the day to feel that all engineers should come under
their umbrella, when they well knew that not all engineers understood the designing
of machines and naval ships, neither through education nor through training. It is
understandable, however, to see why they sought to include mining engineers, as the
mining engineers moved and supported earth much in the same way as the construction
engineers did. It is also understandable to see why they sought to include the
architects because the constructors of buildings were among those who worked on
internal improvement projects as well, and West Point had defined civil engineering
to include building engineering and architecture. However, the industrial progress of
the 19th Century was to exert alternate forces that would lead to other engineering
bodies forming their own societies, the architects to break away from ASCEA, and for
ASCE to stop asking mining, naval, and mechanical engineers to join their
society.<component x="42.08" y="51.79" width="251.49" height="489.16" page="8"

engineering subdisciplines are given here. Construction engineering " " takes
directly from the Latin construere meaning to make, build, or erect, thus directly
relating to the activities of the construction engineer. Basically, all that the
construction engineers really do is put together, organize, assemble, and build. Cost
engineering " ," we understand, implies the optimal management of money, which comes
from the Latin word constare, meaning to cost. There is no doubt what cost engineers
aim to achieve with respect to their profession. Environmental engineering " " takes
from the French word around environ meaning "around," implying the city, the
surrounding area, or the city outskirts, which is what environmental engineering
concerns itself with-of the surrounding areas of habitation, the forests, greens, and
other life-supporting surrounds. Environ comes from two syllables in French-en mean(
ing "in" viron meaning circle, circuit . Hence, environ means ((( ( to enclose a
circle, or encircle. Ment is a suffix suggesting "about." Thus, "environment" means
"about the surrounds." Geotechnical engineering " " has geo as the root word, coming
from the Greek geo, which comes from ge, meaning "Earth." Obviously, "geotechnical"
has to do with the technical properties of soils and rocks that are of the Earth, and
so their name represents the functions they are engaged in. Hydraulics engineering, "
" that studies the movement of water and liquids, takes from the root word hydro
meaning water, which was the initial liquid studied as a general standard, not to
mention that rivers, lakes, and canals were all largely made of water in contrast to
other liquids. Hydro is a later adaptation of the Greek hudor meaning water. The
original form of hydraulics is the Greek hydraulikos, which comes from three
syllables- hydr meaning water aulis meaning a reed instrument through ( (( ( which
water is conducted ikos meaning "relating to" . Hence, (( ( ( hydraulics means
relating to the flow of water through enclosures-a very functional description.
Sanitary engineering, " " which is often studied under environmental engineering,
relates to tasks that improve health conditions. "Sanitary" comes from the French
sanitaire and the Latin sanitas-meaning of or relating to health. Hence, the phrase
"sanitary engineering" portrays the area of emphasis of their work. Structural
engineering " " comes from the Latin structus and structura-a past participle of
struere, which means to construct, which is what structural engineers primarily
purport to do. Their designs serve to allow construction to take place. The French
word surveiller meaning to watch over, and the medieval Latin word supervidere
meaning to look over, both contribute to the development of the modern word "survey"

give a name at all, if that is the case? However, names are important for
representation and identification. It is the name that makes a person. Names are the
nom de plume of people, institutions, and nations. Agonizing hours and days are often
spent in giving names to new committees, a newborn child, and to new institutions.
All those hours are meant to serve a purpose. Often, people are urged to "live up to
their name," implying that only reputable, ethical, legal, and honorable tasks should
be done. It is the name that buys reputation and prestige. A name says it all! Native
Indian names attempt to represent an activity of a permeaning son. Names of people in

represent the activity given they are engaged in. For instance, no one can doubt that
the American Concrete Institute deals with concrete. I cannot see how anyone can deny
that the name of an institution must be representative of its activities. But, in the
case of ASCE, civil engineering just does not represent the functions of its
engineers.<component x="317.47" y="310.08" width="251.48" height="220.99" page="9"

evolution, and education of civil engineering, it becomes clear that nothing that is
not infrastructure, public works, and building or factory construction is civil
engineering. It is important to see this in the opposite way to understand what civil
engineers are all about. When we look at the history and origin of civil engineering,
we discover a pattern of activities in infrastructure activities for both civilian
and military use, with building engineering added later starting with West Point's
definition of civil engineering. That notwithstanding, there is no cogent reason for
civil engineering to be given the name it has, for it to have relevance in the modern
world. Moreover, its activities are undertaken by military engineers as well, and we
all know that military engineers get their degrees in civil, electrical, and
mechanical engineering from civilian schools. Military engineers use civil
engineering technologies to build houses, roads, ports, harbors, airfields, and so on
for military installations. Military engineers are extremely involved in
construction, hydraulics, and environmental engineering. Military and civil are all
mixed up here! The prime difference between them and their uniformed brethren is not
at all in the engineering tasks performed, but in that their uniformed brethren learn
to carry a rifle, are trained in combat and bomb disposal techniques, and learn
military strategy. There are many other engineering activities practiced in the
civilian sector-such as electrical and mechanical-that are not called civil
engineering, even though the military uses those fields of engineering. Hence, there
is little logic in assigning the name of civil engineering to the infrastructure
activities of civilianengineers alone engaged in works. The evolution and origin of
the names of engineering disciplines is very logical and meaningful in representing
the activities they are engaged in, tracing to Greek, French, or Latin words,
sometimes to mythology, exceptfor that of civil engineering. There is no use for
civil engineers to continue living in the past for the constraints of military and
civilian that are not applicable in the emancipated and educated society of today
where globalization is commonplace. The militaries of the 18th and 19th Centuries in
Britain and France were particularly elitist, and this created a class distinction
between the activities of the military engineers and other engineers engaged in
similar works. There is no compelling reason today for the discipline to distinguish
itself from the military engineers. The British military, for instance, and some
other professional militaries around the world, as well, have a Corps of Signals
responsible for communication services- having electronics engineering as the core
discipline there. Armies also have a Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers for
repair and maintenance of ordnance, weapons, and armaments, including battle tanks;
this corps has mechanical and electrical engineering as its basic functions.
Apparently, even the name Corps' of Engineers is past in its value, as mechanical,
electrical, industrial, or chemical engineers, or any other engineer save civil
engineer do not become members of the corps. CorreCorps' of Engineers spondingly, is
an anachronism, as well. Military engineering has vastly changed in composition,
nature, and emphasis over the past 150 years. Similarly, civil engineering is no
longer applicable for the profession it wishes to represent, belonging instead to an
era long gone by. Quite frankly, it is strange for military engineers to call
themselves civil engineers as they do these days: quite an oxymoron, since military
is the antonym of civilian. Many civilian activities are not engineering, many
civilian engineering activities involve other disciplines, and many military
engineering activities incorporate civil engineering. Hence, civil engineering fits
in neither one mold nor the other. There is no apparent need for the profession of
Civil Engineering to play second fiddle to Military Engineering. But, tracing the
origins of Civil Engineering Civil Engineering, it is apparent that was secMilitary
Engineering ond or subordinate to in the 18th and 19th Centuries. It therefore seems
that it is time to give a true name to the practice of civil engineering works, such
that it can stand in its own right, rather than being in contrast or comparison to
any other discipline or profession.<component x="317.47" y="51.78" width="251.5"

appropriate enough to describe the activities of the civil engineering profession,
having been a word that traces to the 14th Century, and deriving from the Greek
&#x2425;&#x2427;&#x242F;that originates in the Sanskrit jan, meaning life, implying
that engineers give life to creative ideas. Up until the 18th Century, engineer was
synonymous with the tasks of infrastructure engineering, and it was not until John
Smeaton was compelled to submit his testimony to court that differentiation became
necessary between the military and civilian engineers. The British Corps of Royal
Engineers were commonly known as engineers and performed functions of all engineering
disciplines. Even today, the British and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are known as
just that-"Corps of Engineers"-not "Corps of Civil Engineers," even though the
functions of the Corps of Engineers are subject matter learned in civil engineering
schools. The study confirms that engineering was the name assigned, since the very
beginning of civilization, to activities such as the construction of roads and
bridges, aqueducts, river training, and irrigation, and represent the application of
ingenuity. The word engineer, it was seen, also has nontechnical applications in the
English language. However, the word civil in civil engineering was a word coined out
of convenience-not to represent any function of the engineers practicing
infrastructure development-but to differentiate those working in the civilian sector
from those engaged in military engineering. Whereas, the roots of names of all the
other industrial, minengineering disciplines discussed in the paper- ing, electrical,
chemical, mechanical, agricultural, safety, etc. - are traced to a specific function
they perform, civil can best be civilis traced to civilian and the Latin meaning
polite. This renders civil engineering the only engineering discipline to have a name
that does not represent the works it undertakes. The roots of all civil engineering
subdisciplines- geotechnical, surveying, structures, transportation, cost, and
hydraulics -are also all seen to have their root in a term that represents the
functional applications of the subdiscipline, which is consistent with what we are
seeking. Again, civil engineering is the only exception, even in comparison to its
subdisciplines. Consequently, civil engineering is a term whose era is past and
application is null. To differentiate the military engineer from the civilian
engineer is a meaningless concept rooted in the past, with no significance today,
because all functional tasks performed by the civilian engineers are performed by the
military engineers, as well. There is an incongruity between calling some military
engineers as civil engineers for at least three reasons: 1. The works he does are
undertaken by civil engineers, as well; 2. Civil is already an antonym of military;
hence, the fact they are oxymorons; and 3. Numerous engineering activities taking
place in the civilian realm are not those related to infrastructure or public works
engineering. Thus, mechanical and electrical engineering, for example, would also be
called civil engineering if the logic of the 18th Century were to be applied today.
Thus, the oldest engineering discipline, and the very first engineering society of
the United States still in existence today- ASCE-has a name that has lost its
relevance. This paper extracts-after a comprehensive study of the history, evolution,
and formation of the discipline and its societies-that the name of civil engineering
is void of substance that does not connote what the discipline is about. This does
not imply that civil engineering ( itself is void of substance, and no such meaning
is intentioned. ( This indicates that a name change may be in order. So, what's in a
name? Actually, plenty is. A name is the nom de plume of an institution. Civil
engineers cannot boast of their name representing the tasks and functions they
perform. What the new name should or should not be is not attempted to be addressed
in this paper. Appendix I. Contemporary Words Having Their Root in Gen Word source:

presidency of John Quincy Adams 1825-1829 was particu( ( larly noteworthy for
infrastructure engineers. He proposed that the Federal Government bring the States
together with a network of highways and canals, and that it develop and conserve the
public domain, using funds from the sale of public lands. In 1828, he broke ground
for the 185 mil C&amp;0 Canal thereby giving impetus to public works engineering.

Technology Press, Cambridge, Mass. In March 1794, Congress authorized George
Washington to construct fortifications for the protection of harbors along the East
Coast. As there were few engineers in America, the President temporarily hired French
engineers for the task. The reason for French engineers to be selected and preferred
is given in Wat( kins 1891 . One reason why they were somewhat preferred ( L'Ecole
Militaire was because of , which was considered the finest institution of its time,
and whose graduates had left the military to work in the civilian sector, and were

reputation of civil engineers is tarnished because of the corruption prevalent in the
industry. It is thus possible to civil impute that there is serious concern in the
community that engineers impolite uncivilized are and in the practice of their
contractual obligations, a commentary on a meaning of their name that is not. st.

of American civil engineering, as public works engineers gained experience and
expertise in that area. There were 93,000 miles of railroads in 1880; and 164,000 in
1890. Strangely, Calhoun 1960 reports only ( ( 500 mi of Railroads in 1850! This
cannot be expected to be an accurate estimate, since more reliable historical
records, as quoted above, are available. 2 There was $2.5 billion invest( ( ment in
railroads in 1870, equivalent to approximately $131 billion in 2004 dollars-a
sizeable amount. Hence, railroads were a major source of employment for public works
engineers. Kaylor, D. 2005 ( (. "George Washington-The First US Engineer," ASME

the nation's "first engineer," with 2005 . The first President of the United States
is credited with being traditionally celebrated during the week of his birthday-the
last week of February. George Washington started as a surveyor apprentice at the
tender age of 15 and went on to become reputed for his surveying skills. However, he
attended no formal, technical school, but was certified as a fully qualified surveyor
by William and Mary College upon the passing of an examination. This article says "On
June 9, 1778, at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, General George Washington issued a call
for engineers and engineering education. This order is considered the genesis of a
U.S. Army Engineer School, which found its permanent home at Fort Belvoir, Virginia."
Again, "In 1794, President Washington established a Corps of Artillerists and
Engineers to be educated and stationed at West Point in New York, which later become
the US Military Academy at West Point." The author adds "He George Washington pro( (
moted construction of roads, canals, the Capitol, docks and ports, water works, and
new efforts to extract coal and ores and develop manufacturing resources." The
infrastructure and know-how to build infrastructure thus developed, helped USA expand
westwards in the 1800s. Leonardo. 2004 . "The life of Leonardo da Vinci,"

Engineering ( ( needs are seen to have their source in the needs of war. The Ruler of
Milan was beset with foes, and Leonardo offered various original inventions to him
for his defense. Such military needs were carried on to later centuries, with the
military becoming the foremost user of engineering skills, which is what led to civil
engineering receiving the name it did. London Gazette . 1787 . No. 12850 London 197.

Hindi and Sanskrit. Among many words, Shipley writes that the words "bind, bond,
band, bandage, bondage, riband, and ribbon" trace to the Sanskrit bhendh { bandh}

root to the Sanskrit root gn gyana from whence came (meaning "knowledge" ; Shipley (
reports that the word, "know, knew, and knowledge " follow ( ( gn gn from , and this
can be recognized as the phonetics of and "kn" are the same in English. More
interestingly, he reports gua that the words "come" and "go" follow from the Sanskrit
gue(n) agayo ga and and , respectively, (commonly known as ( though the
transformations to "come" are not explained. . . . Whereas, he alludes to Sanskrit
roots for prolific variants of sthun "stand," he fails to mention that the Sanskrit ,
meaning sthan stationary and , meaning fixed place, are the derivatives of words such
as "stand, stay, stance, circumstance, status, static, standard, density,
destination, constant, constitution, store, storage, statue, statutory, station,
stationary, and tenure." Further, the words "create and creator" bear a striking
