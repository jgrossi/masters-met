The method in TR585 neglects the residual increase in curvature ˜*1/rm that remains after unloading from peak loads (see Fig. 8). This omission was justified in the development of the method by observing that the effect of neglecting ˜*1/rm in the calculation of the long-term curvature under wperm is largely compensated by overestimating the loss in tension stiffening under the peak construction load. Proposed method for deflection prediction It is proposed that the rigorous method for deflection prediction in TR585 should be modified by calculating the interpolation coefficient in equation (1) correspond10080604020 M co nc m ea n: k N m 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 Time: days (a) Measured S3 Predicted beta S3 30025020015010050 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 0 Time: days (b) M co nc m ea n: k N m Predicted S5 Measured S5 30025020015010050 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 Time: days (c) M co nc m ea n: k N m Predicted S6 measured Fig. 15.

Variations in construction loading, concrete strengths and reinforcement between floors led to significant variations in deflection between floors. Analysis of the Cardington data1,2,7 showed that the measured deflections under the permanent load, at a specific location, varied almost linearly with the minimum value of a coefficient k, which was defined as k  p f ct=w (4) where fct and w were evaluated at either striking, under the peak construction load or under the permanent load. The minimum value of k corresponds to the loading stage which induces the worst cracking. It was assumed that the interpolation coefficient  corresponding to kmin governs long-term deflections as cracking is irreversible. The long-term deflections were shown to be governed by striking or peak construction loads provided that  was taken as less than 0.86 in kstrike and kpeak.

Three approaches were used to estimate the in situ flexural strength of the concrete in the slabs. In method M1, the in situ strength was estimated by reducing the flexural strength of the control beams by the tensile stress induced in the slabs by restrained shrinkage which was estimated as follows f ctsh(t)  Essh(ts)S1(h x1)=I1 þ AsEssh(ts)=(Ac(1þ mr)) (6) where r  As/Ac, m is the effective modular ratio Es/ Eceff and ts is the time at onset of shrinkage.

In method M3, the flexural strength was chosen to give a good fit between the instantaneous measured deflections and those predicted by Eurocode 2 with   1.

In practice, peak can be calculated under the applied loading using fctmod (see equation (11)) and Mpeak/Mperm can be approximated as wpeak/wperm for uniformly loaded slabs. The coefficient  used in the calculation of peak can be estimated with equation (10) if the duration of the peak construction load is known or, more conservatively,  can be taken as 0.7 for peak construction loads of up to five weeks duration. It is suggested that the interpolation coefficient  should be taken as the greatest of either frequent (where frequent is calculated under the frequent load with   0.5) or * in the calculation of long-term deflections.
