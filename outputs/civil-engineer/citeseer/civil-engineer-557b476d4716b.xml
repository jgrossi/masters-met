				<p>The paper presents a thesis that the word " civil " in " civil engineering " is anachronistic and does not represent the works of the so-called civil engineer. The origin and root of the words " engineer " and civil are traced. Engineer is seen to have its roots via the Greek and Latin in the Sanskrit word jan, meaning life, whereas civil is traced to the differentiation that engineers of the 18th and 19th centuries created from their military engineer counterparts. The word engineer was used as far back as the 14th century, though, much of it in nontechnical terms. The evolution of the practice of civil engineering, and the history of the formation of societies are studied to determine how tasks relate to the word civil. Of particular interest is to see what the practitioners and founders of societies aimed to embody in this field of civil engineering. The paper aims to explore the factors and influences in the practice and naming of the civil engineer. It delves into the roots and origins of the names of a number of engineering disciplines, giving explanations and commentary on the implications of those names, and finds that all those names relate to technical functions. The paper concludes that the name of civil engineering does not represent the functional tasks of the civil engineer, in contrast to names of other engineering disciplines, and is, moreover, out of place with modern times. What's in a name? This paper seeks to find out.</p>

Therefore, by the end of the 18th Century, the word engineer, itself, was taken as public works engineering. As the use of engineer and civil engineer were practically synonymous with respect to civilians, the civilian engineer was distinguished on the professional level only from military engineers Calhoun 1960.

In 1840, there were 9,000 miles of railroads in the United States; 30,000 in 1850, with about $300 million being invested that year for the construction of railroads Houghton Mifflin 2004. America carried over much of the European social patterns. As Europeans came to the new world in search of a better life, all the skills and trades were brought with them. It was necessary to build the new nation from scratch. European society had recognized the military engineer, the architect, and the civilian engineer as appropriate men to plan and direct large public works Calhoun 1960. The year 1785 saw a surge in the hiring of engineers, for example, for the improvement of navigation in the Potomac River by the Potomac Company, whose President was George Washington himself Kaylor 2005. It was difficult to get an engineer all the way from Europe, and earlier personnel selected by the Potomac Company to manage the engineering proved unsatisfactory in their work. Engineers were in short supply, and the shortage continued to be felt through to the civil war. John Quincy Adams, then Minister to Great Britain, once transmitted the application of an English engineer anxious t</context>
<context citStr="Calhoun 1960" endWordPosition="5588" position="32985" startWordPosition="5587">rter, for training engineers for military infrastructure projects. This set the stimulus for private schools to begin civil engineering instruction. In 1816, the states of New York, Virginia, and South Carolina sought engineers for canal and road building. Whereas, the preference was for an engineer, the jobs were still filled by architects, land surveyors, contractors, and draftsmen owing to a general shortage of qualified engineers. It is reported that the total number of engineers or quasi-engineers active or available in the United States up to 1816 never averaged more than two per state Calhoun 1960. However, they were all engaged in public works. They came from all over—they were surveyors, landholders, speculators, builders, contractors, lawyers, architects, and military engineers. Thus, it is straight to see that the tasks engineers performed for which they were later named civil engineers were what we commonly know today as infrastructure engineering. It was nowhere for building engineering that they were called civil engineers, but basically for public works improvement projects of an infrastructure nature. The fundamental finding of this section is that the skills that employers s</context>

Hence, this was the first official recognition of this special nature of work being given the name of civil engineering. In 1824, Congress further passed an act authorizing the President to use engineer officers from the army, as well as civilian engineers, to make surveys for roads and canals considered of national importance Wisely 1974; Calhoun 1960. When the Oxford English Dictionary enhanced its definition of engineering in the 18th Century, they contrasted works that the military performed with identical works performed in the civilian community, defining such professionals in the civilian community as a civil engineer, for distinction from the military engineer. It was not until ICE had been formed that in 1828 they formally defined civil engineering as “. . . that species of knowledge which constitutes the profession of a civil engineer; being the art of directing the great source of power in nature for the use and convenience of m</context>

Prior to 1802, there was no formal education in civil engineering in the United States, and practitioners acquired their knowledge through apprenticeship and fieldwork, with some of them having completed a course of study in the sciences and mathematics. However, the first and oldest school of civil engineering was the L’Ecole Militaire de Saint Cyr, established in Paris in 1763. For a long time, it was considered a fine institution, ranked high among all nations. French engineers, graduates of that institution were highly sought Calhoun 1960, especially by the U.S. government between the period 1775 and 1825, during which time French military engineers helped Napoleonic power become the premier world power. Colleges and universities in the United States that began to offer civil engineering instruction following the creation of West Point are listed in the following Wisely 1974; the dates given represent the first degrees offered, and it must be noted that the universities began their civil engineering programs a few years before these dates refer to Phelan et al. 1995:ERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE © ASCE / JANUARY 2007 / 23 </context>
<context citStr="Calhoun 1960" endWordPosition="7476" position="44360" startWordPosition="7475">Yale College; and • 1846: Harvard College. In spite of this education, there were only 512 civil engineers by 1850. For even those who listed their profession as engineer in contrast to civil engineer, most worked on canals and railroads, which goes to show again how synonymous and interchangeable the two terms were. To many, the engineer was known as a person responsible for infrastructure, industrial, and municipal improvements where the most commonly understood infrastructure improvements were railroads; canals and locks for river navigation and agriculture; roads, highways, and bridges Calhoun 1960. Popular literature of the early 19th Century assumed that the engineer was mainly a designer of internal improvements—what we would call infrastructure today; the 1824 Act of Congress, mentioned previously, was overseen by a Board of Engineers for Internal Improvements in the War Department. Allen Partridge was formerly a Superintendent of West Point, from where he resigned after clashing with his superiors. He opened the Partridge Academy at Norwich, used the same textbooks as West Point, and offered his graduates jobs on the New York canals. In 1825, Partridge wrote to the Governor of New</context>

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute RPI taught mensuration, surveying, and engineering. Professor Amos Eaton, who taught the course, felt that advanced mathematics was unnecessary to teach to engineering students, and even politely criticized the text used by West Point instructor, Mahan, Elementary Course in Civil Engineering, a textbook that was popular and saw seven editions from 1837 to 1868 Calhoun 1960. The opinion of Professor Eaton resonates today in the education of the modern construction manager in the United States, exemplified in university curricula accredited by the American Council on Construction Education ACCE, whose graduates supervise construction projects identical to the construction engineers from ABET-accredited schools. However, much of the earlier civil engineering courses were taught by professors of mathematics at a variety of schools—a disposition that somewhat characterizes the profession and is reflected in the heavy mathematics required today for civil engineers</context>

Graduating Civil Engineers: 1802–1852 The number of West Point graduates entering civilian service began in 1818 with one individual. This number slowly increased until it reached approximately 10 in 1828, 15 in 1830, passed 25 in 1833, was 39 in 1836, 96 in 1837, and 107 in 1838. The cumulative number of civilian engineers, however, was more than this, probably reaching 200 in 1837. Compare this to about 200,000 civil engineers in the United States today. A total of 231 West Point engineers from 1802 to 1837 went into civilian service at some point in their lives Calhoun 1960. Between 1826 and 1843, the Partridge Academy produced about 40–50 civilian engineers. RPI produced 48 civilian engineers from the 102 who graduated from their program between 1835 and 1843. West Point, Partridge Academy, and RPI were the three main suppliers of public works engineers in the days 1802–1843. Other on-the-job trained engineers continued to exist. There are no available formal census figures for the number of engineers and civil engineers in the United States before 1850.

There was a need to make that distinction as the civilian and military engineers worked on identical types of infrastructure and public works projects, and the realities of contracting as well as professional pride dictated such a distinction necessary. However, it was not until 1839 that this group was able to coordinate its efforts to meet in Baltimore Fairweather 2002; Calhoun 1960. During their deliberations, there were divisions among the attendees, and the effort to form a civil engineering society was not successful. It was not again until 1852—a long, 13 years later—that the group of 1839 met with a slightly expanded group, reinforced by those in the building trade, and formally established the “American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects” ASCEA. A statement crafted by the committee in 1839 to describe the work of their profession, brings out that their major interest was public infrastructure works.

Is this a chicken and egg problem, as to what came first— the engine or the engineer? No. Clearly, the engine could not have been created without the brains of some engineer. Moreover, the word engineer has nowhere been reported to be derived from engine, though the misconception is somewhat popular among people, especially after the onset of the steam engine in locomotives.

The paper concludes that the name of civil engineering does es of other engineering disciplines, and is, moreover, out of place ng education. Origin of the Word Engineer Engineer comes directly from the Latin, French, and Middle English McDonald 1914; ASCE 1970: • Middle Latin: ingeniarius; • Old French: engignier; • Middle English: engyneour; and • French: ingenieur. Also related to these are the words ingenuity coming from the Latin ingenuita and French ingenuite; and ingenious comes from the Latin ingeniosus.

Therefore, by the end of the 18th Century, the word engineer, itself, was taken as public works engineering. As the use of engineer and civil engineer were practically synonymous with respect to civilians, the civilian engineer was distinguished on the professional level only from military engineers Calhoun 1960. The French Dictionnaire de la Langue Francais of the 18th Century carried the following definitions of engineer, bringing out the fact that public works engineers in the civilian sector performed works undertaken by the military engineers, as well McDonald 1914: 1. Engineer—one who plans, lays out, and directs field work and fortifications, for attacking, defending, or fortifying places. 2. Engineer—one who directs private works or public works, such as the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges, working of mines, etc. Engineer of bridges and roads. Mining engineer, naval engineer or marine engineer, railroad engineer. Hence, the record of public works practice notes that the person engaged in such practice was, indeed, classified as an engineer, in that he designed and constructed new systems, and brought life to his constructions.

The fundamental finding of this section is that the skills that employers sought in civil engineers related to public works or infrastructure works, a somewhat embodied field of knowledge by the mid-19th century. The shortage was not felt for building works, since there were architects available for the design and construction of buildings. Origin and Definition of the Term Civil Engineering John Smeaton, an eminent civil engineer of his times is recorded as the first person to sign himself as a civil engineer, in 1761 “Origin” 1910; McDonald 1914. Wisely 1974 mentions that Smeaton signed himself in as civil engineer, as he was engaged in the building of roads, structures, and canals in England in a civilian capacity. Fairweather 2002 reports that Smeaton signed himself so while presenting testimony to the courts in 1782. This was probably in addition to his signing in 1761, but there could be confusion on the dates in the historical records, but this does not detract from the fact that Smeaton is credited with being the first person to style himself as civil engineer.
