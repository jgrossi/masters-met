			<abstract>
				<p>The economic growth of a country depends significantly on its transportation system. The highways that form part of this system sometimes pass over compressible soft soil deposits. Two major geotechnical problems associated with the construction of road embankments on these soil deposits are stability during construction and long-term settlement. If the latter problem is not addressed adequately , excessive post-construction settlement will have serious consequences for the maintenance of road pavement , in addition to the unwarranted downdrag force (negative skin friction) and lateral pressure on the piles supporting the bridge abutments and ancillary structures. To mitigate these adverse effects, deep-seated saturated clays are pre-consolidated with Fibredrain, a vertical drain manufactured with biodegradable jute and coir fibre, and surcharge, and surface deposits of granular, clayey or peaty materials are treated by high-energy impact (HEI) application to enforce settlement and improve their bearing capacity. If post-construction secondary compression is significant it can be reduced by placing a higher surcharge than required for primary consolidation. Because of their cost-effectiveness these techniques have been and are being used in several soil improvement projects in the Southeast Asian region. Details of the treatment, the properties of and design procedure for Fibredrains, and the application of HEI are discussed.</p>

Fibredrains were installed at a spacing of 1.1 m and sand drains at 2.5 m spacing for comparative assessment. A considerable excess pore pressure remained in the clay at the end of 8 months in the sand drain area (Aboshi, 1999). Figure 13 shows the monitoring results of piezometers installed in the clay in the Fibredrain area at El. 9.2 m, 12.5 m and 19 m, where the clay occurs between El. 8.5 m and 25 m. Piezometers were also installed at El. 10.6 m, 13.6 m, 16.6 m, 19.6 m and 22.6 m within the Fibredrain core to investigate the well resistance. Within the same 8-month period, the piezometers in the Fibredrain core showed only an excess pore pressure not exceeding 10 kPa, indicating that well resistance was insignificant and the axial flow capacity was more than adequate.

On back-analysis, at consolidation pressures of 98 kPa and 294 kPa, the effective Ch was found to be 1.35 m 2/yr and 2.19 m2/yr with PD, and 9.2 m2/yr and 10.7 m2/yr with Fibredrain respectively. Figs 8 and 9 show the deformed shapes of the two drains after carefully removing the clay around the drains at the end of consolidation (Miura et al., 1995b; Aboshi et al., 2001). The PD has deformed significantly, resulting in kinking and decreased axial drainage capacity. The deformation of Fibredrain, on the other hand, was confined largely to an increase in the thickness and longitudinal compression of the drain without kinking. Axial compression in the Fibredrain is manifested largely as an increase in cross-sectional area, mainly because of the unwinding characteristics of jute fibres in both the filter layer and the core. The resulting increase in cross-sectional area and the decrease in filter opening size enhance the unclogged water flow into the drain. The a</context>

In soil improvement projects where the PVD is observed to be underperforming, the effective discharge capacity of the PVD should be examined, with particular reference to the effect of kinking under axial strain caused by settlement and clogging. The damage caused by installation stresses may be important for PVD with lower tensile strength. For Fibredrain the effect of these factors is not significant, as discussed earlier.

It should be emphasised that the time of consolidation cannot be reduced by decreasing D because this leads to larger QR, which will be greater than the effective discharge capacity of the drain under the lateral pressure and hydraulic gradient. In most cases the effective Ch is smaller than the Ch of the soil determined in the laboratory (Rowe, 1968; Head, 1985). If the latter is smaller, it should be used in equation (3) to determine the time of consolidation. Back-analysis of field settlement–time data obtained in Singapore marine clay using a plastic PVD (Choa et al., 1979) showed effective Ch values in the range 2–10 m 2/yr. Figs 10(a) and 10(b) show that for i  0.5 and a lateral pressure of 200 kPa, the values of effective Ch corresponding to settlements of 3, 2 and 1 m are 3, 5 and 7 m2/yr respectively.

HEI application consists of dropping a heavy pounder ranging from l0 to 40 t from a height, usually about 10– 25 m, via a platform of granular fill. To treat loose granular deposits dynamic compaction (DC) was used effectively for more than three decades (Menard and Broise, 1975; Ramaswamy et al., 1979). In the case of soft clay it is found to be ineffective when used alone on saturated soft clay as the pore pressure dissipation is governed only by the permeability of the clay (Choa et al., 1979). For partly saturated cohesive soil it is found to be quite effective (Ramaswamy et al., 1979). When the clay is soft and saturated, sand columns can be formed with HEI by systematically punching sand into the clay. This method, known as dynamic replacement (DR), has been used successfully even in a gap-graded sandy soil (Lee et al., 1984). An adaptation of DR for peaty clay (Lee et al., 1984) produced sand columns and sand claquage within the peat when increased pounding energy was applied directly on the sand columns. This technique, described as dynamic replacement and mixing (DRM), has be</context>

In recent field measurements of installation stresses on plastic PVDs, a tensile force of 1.4 kN on the filter was recorded at an installation depth of 30 m (Karunaratne et al., 2002). It is imperative that the PVD should possess sufficient tensile strength to withstand these tensile forces. Filter permeability and clogging potential The large apparent opening size (AOS) of Fibredrains, in the range 200–600 m, serves to tap pervious layers and lenses in clay deposits. The double filter layer, which has a smaller effective AOS, intercepts the clay slurry generated immediately after installation of the Fibredrain in the clay as the mandrel is withdrawn. The cross-plane permeability of the filter was measured under a constant head across a stack of four identical burlaps fas</context>

Effective discharge capacity of PVD The effective discharge capacity of a PVD can be determined by field tests, or can be deduced from laboratory tests. Depending on how close the simulation of the laboratory test is to field conditions, the effective discharge capacity Q in the field should be deduced from the laboratory values Q9 by Q  Q9 R (8) where R denotes a reduction factor suggested by Koerner (1997) in the form R  FiFdFcFbFk (9) Koerner (1997) suggested that Q9 be determined from short-term laboratory tests in accordance with ASTM D4716 (1991).

For partly saturated cohesive soil it is found to be quite effective (Ramaswamy et al., 1979). When the clay is soft and saturated, sand columns can be formed with HEI by systematically punching sand into the clay.

An adaptation of DR for peaty clay (Lee et al., 1984) produced sand columns and sand claquage within the peat when increased pounding energy was applied directly on the sand columns.

This case record shows that using vertical drains, surcharge and HEI application, a safe bearing capacity adequate for five-storey residential houses can be easily achieved. For highway embankment construction this treatment method can be easily adopted. Peaty soil treatment in Singapore A series of field trials was conducted for evaluating the feasibility of stabilising the peaty clay and fluvial clay at the Bishan Depot site of the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit System (Lee et al., 1984). Techniques involving surcharge only, vertical drains and surcharge, and the dynamic replacement and mixing (DRM) method of HEI application were investigated. In Zone B of the site, designated for DRM, some 7.8 m of peaty clay was underlain by 5.6 m of fluvial clay. Fibredrains were installed at 2.2 m square spacing from a 1 m thick sand blanket to improve the deepseated fluvial clay. Afterwards, HEI application was used in treating the upper layer of peaty clay. 188 S. L. Lee and G. P. Karunaratne The HEI application consisted in dropping a 15 t pounder from a height of 15–20 m.

The strength deterioration with time in the Ariake clay shows the biodegradability of the fibres. It should be pointed out that the deterioration in strength does not imply a reduction in drainage capacity, as observed in the Pantai Mutiara reclamation project in Jakarta, Indonesia (see below), where Fibredrains performed satisfactorily for more than two years (Lee et al., 1988). Because of the high tensile strength (6.8 kN with 8.7% strain at rupture), robustness and flexibility of the core and the jute filter layers, Fibredrain can withstand installation stresses, and high-energy tamping while retaining its drainage functions unimpaired.

With an average Ch of about 9 m2/yr, a drain spacing of 1.4 m was adopted to achieve this degree of consolidation in 3 months with an appropriate surcharge (Lee et al., 1988). In this reclamation, excavation for drainage channels in an area where Fibredrain was installed about eight years earlier revealed no trace of its existence, which verified the biodegradability and hence the ecological friendliness of Fibredrain. A typical section of the western breakwater was at a seabed level of El. 4.5 m.

High-energy impact Because of the large extent of highways over a variety of site conditions, varying subsoil material may be encountered, ranging from cohesive to granular soil, including organic peat in waterlogged ground, and waste material from mine areas and landfills. The deep-seated clay soil can be treated with Fibredrains and surcharge. For surface deposits, the application of high-energy impact (HEI) has been successfully employed in several projects in this region (Choa et al., 1979; Lee et al., 1989) and elsewhere (Lukas, 1986). When improving in situ soil deposits by HEI, one of the physical limitations usually met is the depth. With standard HEI techniques it is generally not economical or practical to reach depths exceeding 5–7 m below the ground surface for clay or 8–l0 m below the ground surface for sand. When the type of soil to be improved varies, it is customary to change the improvement technique. With HEI application the method and equipment remain essentially the same, but allowance is made in the application of the energy level and intensity. HEI application consists of droppi</context>

Piezometers were also installed at El. 10.6 m, 13.6 m, 16.6 m, 19.6 m and 22.6 m within the Fibredrain core to investigate the well resistance. Within the same 8-month period, the piezometers in the Fibredrain core showed only an excess pore pressure not exceeding 10 kPa, indicating that well resistance was insignificant and the axial flow capacity was more than adequate. Treatment of ex-mining land Near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia The use of vertical drains and surcharge in conjunction with HEI application for the treatment of ex-mining land for a housing project (Lee et al., 1989) is briefly presented. A safe bearing pressure of 60 kN/m2 with a factor of safety of 2.5 was necessary for this project. The site, near Kuala Lumpur, is composed of mine tailing soils consisting of loose sandy deposits to very soft clayey soils. Soil profiles from typical borehole log show that N values are less than 2 blows/30 cm in clays and between 2 and 10 blows/30 cm in sands. The construction commenced with placing a working platform with selected fill materials containing fines less than 10%.

Properties of Fibredrain Most prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) are manufactured with a polymeric core and a geotextile filter sleeve. Fibredrain, a PVD developed at the National University of Singapore, consists of four axial coir strands enveloped within a filter comprising two layers of jute burlap (Lee et al., 1995).

When the type of soil to be improved varies, it is customary to change the improvement technique. With HEI application the method and equipment remain essentially the same, but allowance is made in the application of the energy level and intensity. HEI application consists of dropping a heavy pounder ranging from l0 to 40 t from a height, usually about 10– 25 m, via a platform of granular fill. To treat loose granular deposits dynamic compaction (DC) was used effectively for more than three decades (Menard and Broise, 1975; Ramaswamy et al., 1979). In the case of soft clay it is found to be ineffective when used alone on saturated soft clay as the pore pressure dissipation is governed only by the permeability of the clay (Choa et al., 1979). For partly saturated cohesive soil it is found to be quite effective (Ramaswamy et al., 1979). When the clay is soft and saturated, sand columns can be formed with HEI by systematically punching sand into the clay. This method, known as dynamic replacement (DR), has been used successfully even in a gap-graded sandy soil (Lee et al., 1984). An adaptation of DR for peaty clay (Lee et al., 1984) produ</context>

The time of consolidation by equation (3) corresponding to U  80%, Sf  2 m, Ch  5 m2/yr and D  1.5 m is t  84 days. It should be emphasised that the time of consolidation cannot be reduced by decreasing D because this leads to larger QR, which will be greater than the effective discharge capacity of the drain under the lateral pressure and hydraulic gradient. In most cases the effective Ch is smaller than the Ch of the soil determined in the laboratory (Rowe, 1968; Head, 1985). If the latter is smaller, it should be used in equation (3) to determine the time of consolidation. Back-analysis of field settlement–time data obtained in Singapore marine clay using a plastic PVD (Choa et al., 1979) showed effective Ch values in the range 2–10 m 2/yr. Figs 10(a) and 10(b) show that for i  0.5 and a lateral pressure of 200 kPa, the values of effective Ch corresponding to settlements of 3, 2 and 1 m are 3, 5 and 7 m2/yr respectively.

A suitable material should be selected; highly swelling minerals should be avoided in order to prevent excessive absorption of water within the embankment during wet weather and shrinkage during dry weather, which might result in distress in the pavement. In the event that the use of such materials is unavoidable, then they should be shielded from fluctuations of the water table and from flooding.
