				<p>ABSRRACT: In order to solve the traffic congestion problems around Nantou area, the roadway network should be completely reviewed, especially for the National Highway 3's interchange system. The key assess is the Zucih bridge located at the edge of the Nantou city with the station 228K+500 on the National Freeway 3. Well constructed interchange system will definitely improve the traffic congestion problem in Nantou City. After that the Nantou County will possess the advantages for developing the industrious field. The purpose of this study is to conduct a quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefit-cost analysis of the construction project in order to evaluate the economic benefits of the location and route of the Nantou interchange. To do this, benefit-cost ratio(B/C) and net present value(NPV) will be used as quantifiable indicators, while for non-quantifiable indicators (such as land value, property value, and commerce benefits) more concrete figures will be used when possible in order to fully understand the economic benefits of this project. Further steps were taken to analyze the feasibility of the proposed construction. The findings of our research are to be used to contribute to the project's construction team.</p>

Sensitivity Analysis In view of the above assumed factors of economic benefit analysis, there still exists many uncertainties. Therefore, this study conducted a sensitivity analysis of the variables (factors such as the construction cost, land acquisition cost, operating cost, inflation cost, discount rate, time value of money, travel cost and the time value of goods) which could possibly affect the assessment results in order to understand how a change in each factor could affect the economic benefit analysis (Helton et al. 2006). Overall, while conducting an analysis of the affects of variations in variables, if the change in a factor does not affect the possibility of plan implementation, then this factor can be considered stable and controllable. Otherwise, a risk management assessment should be carried out on those that are not stable and controllable. Discount rate changes in the sensitivity analysis The higher the discount rate, the higher the cost of investment, and the lower the economic benefits of investment. This project is feasible at a discount rate under 17%. However, at a 17% discount rate the NPV would</context>

Net Present Value Net present value is a convenient and widely used method for assessing public construction investment projects because it takes into account the time value of money as well as the cost and benefit of the project’s entire lifespan. During the assessment period, the difference between the present value of the total benefit stream and the present value of the total cost stream is measured (Luis and Luis, 2008). When the benefit is greater than the cost, the investment plan is conducive to the use of social resources. The method of calculation is as follows: The formula, NPV = net present value Bt = benefits of the period t years Ct = cost of the period t years n = assessment years i = discount rate Benefit-Cost Ratio The benefit-cost ratio uses the difference between the net present value of the benefits and the net present value of the costs as an analytical assessment of the feasibility of the project.

Economic Benefit Assessment The construction of the ramp in Nantou City and the Zucih bridge, in addition to enhancing the performance of transport outside of Nantou, can also effectively improve transport accessibility in the Nantou area and therefore can lead to overall area development. However, discount rate, assessment period, inflation trend, etc. must first be considered (Wang and Luo, 2010; Roberts and Goodwin 2002). Discount Rate Discount rate is used to convert the costs and benefits of different years into a monetary value of the base year. Usually, depending on the investment preferences of investors, the interest rate of investment and other factors, the discount rate varies. Therefore the market interest rate is usually used as a reference to calculate the discount rate. In recent years, with continuous adjustment of the central bank deposit rate, government bond interest rates have continued to weaken, which should reduce the discount rate.

In recent years, with continuous adjustment of the central bank deposit rate, government bond interest rates have continued to weaken, which should reduce the discount rate. After having economically evaluated the construction project, the government will generally, in view of the results, decide whether or not to promote a specific construction project or decide which projects to promote first. Thus, this study, with reference to the discount rate, should be considered with an assessment of general transport investment and from a consistent standpoint (Sáez and Requena, 2007). Based on this, a 5.0% discount rate will be used for the relevant assessment. Using the 2007 currency value, the total benefits and costs were analyzed according to discount rates at 1%, 3%, 5%, 8%, 11%, 14% and 17% (see Table 6.1 below).
