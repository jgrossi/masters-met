			<abstract>
				<p>Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (d 13 C and d 15 N) have been used widely in archaeology to investigate palaeodiet. Sulphur stable isotope ratios (d 34 S) have shown great promise in this regard but the potential of this technique within archaeological science has yet to be fully explored. Here we report d 34 S, d 13 C and d 15 N values for 129 samples of animal bone col-lagen from Skú tustaðir, an early Viking age (landná m) settlement in northeast Iceland. This dataset represents the most comprehensive study to date of its kind on archaeological material and the results show a clear offset in d 34 S values between animals deriving their dietary resources from terrestrial (mean = +5.6 ± 2.8&amp;), freshwater (mean = À2.7 ± 1.4&amp;) or marine (mean = +15.9 ± 1.5&amp;) reservoirs (with the three food groups being significantly different at 2r). This offset allows reconstruction of the dietary history of domesticated herbivores and demonstrates differences in husbandry practices and animal movement/trade, which would be otherwise impossible using only d 13 C and d 15 N values. For example, several terrestrial her-bivores displayed enriched bone collagen d 34 S values compared to the geology of the Lake My´vatn region, indicating they may have been affected by sea-spray whilst being pastured closer to the coast, before being traded inland. Additionally, the combination of heavy d 15 N values coupled with light d 34 S values within pig bone collagen suggests that these omnivores were consuming freshwater fish as a significant portion of their diet. Arctic foxes were also found to be consuming large quantities of freshwater resources and radiocarbon dating of both the pigs and foxes confirmed previous studies showing that a large freshwater radiocarbon (14 C) reservoir effect exists within the lake. Overall, these stable isotope and 14 C data have important implications for obtaining a fuller reconstruction of the diets of the early Viking settlers in Iceland, and may allow a clearer identification of the marine and/or freshwater 14 C reservoir effects that are known to exist in human bone collagen.</p>

Sulphur isotopes have also been exploited to explore the variability in terrestrial, marine- and freshwater-based diets (Craig et al., 2006; Privat et al., 2007; Nehlich et al., 2010, 2011; Lamb et al., 2012), have been used as indicators of environmental changes (Wadleigh, 2003; Newton and Bottrell, 2007; Yun et al., 2010) and are regularly utilised in food authentication studies (Bahar et al., 2008; Rummel et al., 2010; Tanz and Schmidt, 2010; Osorio et al., 2011). Previous findings from the Lake Myvatn region of north-east Iceland have demonstrated a significant overlap between the d15N values of both modern and archaeological-age terrestrial herbivore bone collagen and the d15N values of modern and archaeological-age freshwater fish. d13C values of freshwater biota were also found to be similar to those of marine resources (Ascough et al., 2010), and consequently, separation of herbivores, freshwater fish and marine fish as components of human diet is difficult using only d13C and d1</context>

Cattle grazing near Lake Myvatn are likely to have consumed plant material that was enriched in 15N due to the decomposition of chironomid midges, which transports nitrogen from the lake to the shore, whilst for cows foraging further afield, their d15N values may be less enriched due to a decreasing effect of chironomid numbers with increasing distance from the shore (Gratton et al., 2008). Alternatively, animals being farmed closer to Lake Myvatn may have elevated d15N values due to the soil being fertilised with manure (Bogaard et al., 2007; Fraser et al., 2011). Although the average d13C and d15N values for cattle and caprines are very similar (21.5&amp; vs. 21.2&amp; and +3.9&amp; vs. +2.5&amp;), their average d34S values are slightly different (+4.1&amp; vs. +6.7&amp;) (Fig. 4), suggesting differing diet and/or grazing areas between the two groups. If sheep and goats were grazing in the Krafla lava fields, then they may have been consuming moss and lichens that are capable of accumulating their sulphur directly from atmospheric SO2. Given that atmospheric SO2 is likely to have varied over time due to numerous volcanic eruptions, it is not inconcei</context>

Similarly, the analysis of moss, grass, willow and liverwort specimens from Kerlingarfjoll produced d15N values between 5.5&amp; and 1.7&amp; (Skrzypek et al., 2008). Ascough et al. (in press) determined that modern flora from around Lake Myvatn had d15N values between 9.1&amp; and +6.5&amp;. It has been noted that in soils depleted in phosphorous, plants and lichens that take up ammonia from the atmosphere are capable of generating negative d15N values (Erskine et al., 1998; McKee et al., 2002). Ascough et al. (2007, 2010, 2012, in press) found that d15N values for modern and archaeological terrestrial animals ranged between 1.5&amp; and +5.9&amp;, whilst freshwater fish displayed d15N values from +3.1&amp; to +8.5&amp;, and north-east Atlantic cod yielded d15N values from +11.9&amp; to +15.4&amp; (Barrett et al., 2008, 2011; Russell et al., 2011).

Oceanic primary producers demonstrate sulphate d34S values between +17&amp; and +21&amp; (Peterson and Fry, 1987), however, d34S values for organisms living within a freshwater environment have been shown to vary anywhere between 22&amp; and +20&amp; due to differing sulphur sources in the local geology as well as anaerobic bacteria residing within lakes and rivers, which can reduce sulphate ions to hydrogen sulphide (H2S) (Faure, 1977; Peterson and Fry, 1987). For mammals to successfully thrive, sulphur-containing biochemical compounds, such as the essential amino acids, methionine and cysteine, need to be acquired from the diet. Studies have demonstrated that there is a negligible trophic level shift for sulphur isotopes compared to the large range of d34S values shown within terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments (Peterson et al., 1985; Richards et al., 2003). Therefore, consumers eating produce from within the Lake Myvatn vicinity should have similar d34S values to the surrounding terrestrial vegetation. Curre</context>

Cattle grazing near Lake Myvatn are likely to have consumed plant material that was enriched in 15N due to the decomposition of chironomid midges, which transports nitrogen from the lake to the shore, whilst for cows foraging further afield, their d15N values may be less enriched due to a decreasing effect of chironomid numbers with increasing distance from the shore (Gratton et al., 2008). Alternatively, animals being farmed closer to Lake Myvatn may have elevated d15N values due to the soil being fertilised with manure (Bogaard et al., 2007; Fraser et al., 2011). Although the average d13C and d15N values for cattle and caprines are very similar (21.5&amp; vs. 21.2&amp; and +3.9&amp; vs. +2.5&amp;), their average d34S values are slightly different (+4.1&amp; vs. +6.7&amp;) (Fig. 4), suggesting differing diet and/or grazing areas between the two groups. If sheep and goats were grazing in the Krafla lava fields, then they may have been consuming moss and lichens that are capable of accumulating their sulphur directly from atmospheric SO2. Given that atmospheric SO2 is likely to have varied over time due to numerous volcanic eruptions, it is not inconceivable that the higher </context>

BACKGROUND 2.1. Geographical and historical information The animal bones analysed in this study were from Skutustaðir, an archaeological site to the south of Lake Myvatn (meaning “the lake of midges” in Icelandic) in the north-eastern highlands of Iceland. Famed, as its name suggests, for its abundant insect life, this shallow lake, located 50 km inland and at an altitude of 277 m above sea level (Fig. 1), is a sanctuary for breeding waterfowl (Einarsson, 2004; Gardarsson, 2006). The region has been documented as an area of major archaeological importance with respect to the settlement of Viking communities during the landnam from around AD 870 onwards (Vesteinsson, 1998; McGovern et al., 2007; Einarsson and Aldred, 2011). Radiocarbon dating of terrestrial animal remains and tephrochronological studies from various sites surrounding Lake Myvatn have shown that settlers populated the region from the late 9th century (McGovern et al., 2006, 2007). The presence of these inhabitants is thought to have had a large environmental impact on the area, with the introduction</context>

The midden site is on a natural rise in the landscape, and due to the porous nature of the bedrock, drainage conditions are good and no pockets of waterlogged sediments were noted. The pH of the soil is around 6.5, providing favourable conditions for preservation of animal bones.

Analysis of total sulphur in volcanic rocks from the Krafla-Namafjall fissure swarm neighbouring Lake Myvatn provided d34S values that ranged between 2.0&amp; and +4.2&amp; (mean: 0.8&amp;) (Torssander, 1989),whilst examination of transitional basaltic and rhyolitic rocks from the Katla Volcanic Centre in southern Iceland gave similar d34S values, ranging between 1.8&amp; and +2.4&amp; (Hildebrand and Torssander, 1998). As isotopic fractionation between plants and sulphates deposited in the soil from the weathering of local bedrock is relatively small, d34S values of Lake Myvatn flora should be similar to those reported by Torssander (1989). However, Icelandic lava fields are sparsely vegetated with lichen and moss (Bjarnason, 1991), which can accumulate their sulphur directly from atmospheric sulphur dioxide (SO2) with very little isotopic fractionation (Krouse, 1977).

Studies have shown that sea-spray not only influences coastal soil d34S values, as sulphate particles can be propelled inland over extensive distances (Zazzo et al., 2011), however, it is unlikely that the land around Lake Myvatn would have been affected by sea-spray as the d34S values of these six animals are very distinct from the average d34S values of their contemporaries. The rate of bone collagen turnover is poorly understood, with estimates ranging from less than a year in birds (Hobson and Clark, 1992) to over ten years in adult humans (Hedges et al., 2007). Assuming that fully matured animals are slaughtered within a few years of being brought inland, their 34S signature is unlikely to have changed significantly from when they first arrived at Lake Myvatn. However, collagen turnover rates in juveniles should be higher than in adults, and therefore if young livestock grazing on coastal vegetation were then traded inland and reared for the remainder of their lives in the Lake Myvatn region, it is likely that their d34S values would lie somewhere between a marine signature and the d34S valu</context>

FREs are brought about by the input of low 14C-activity carbon (e.g. carbon from dissolution of geological carbonates or from high temperature geothermal water–rock interac-tions), or restriction of atmosphere-water CO2 exchange (e.g. via density stratification or ice cover). Unlike the MRE, a universal amendment cannot be implemented as the magnitude of FREs is site dependent and can fluctuate significantly (Ascough et al., 2011; Keaveney and Reimer, 2012). The purpose of this study was to utilise d34S stable isotope measurements in animal and bird bone collagen from remains found in midden deposits at a Viking farmstead on Lake Myvatn in an attempt to distinguish between terrestrial, marine and freshwater dietary components. In turn, this could allow the identification of terrestrial, freshwater and marine components in the human diet. To date, this is the first study of its kind to examine sulphur isotopes in bone collagen from archaeological remains found in Iceland.

As isotopic fractionation between plants and sulphates deposited in the soil from the weathering of local bedrock is relatively small, d34S values of Lake Myvatn flora should be similar to those reported by Torssander (1989). However, Icelandic lava fields are sparsely vegetated with lichen and moss (Bjarnason, 1991), which can accumulate their sulphur directly from atmospheric sulphur dioxide (SO2) with very little isotopic fractionation (Krouse, 1977). SO2 gas produced during the eruption of Krafla in July 1980 yielded d34S values between 1.8&amp; and +3.4&amp; (Torssander, 1988), however, it is conceivable that atmospheric SO2 in Iceland has varied with time due to the volcanic nature of the island. or stable isotope (d13C, d15N and d34S) and radiocarbon (14C)Wet deposition of sulphate from the aqueous oxidation of atmospheric SO2 can provide soil with an additional source of sulphur and isotopic fractionation during this process can be very large (ca. 11&amp; to +17&amp;) (Harris et al., 2012).

Sulphur isotopes have also been exploited to explore the variability in terrestrial, marine- and freshwater-based diets (Craig et al., 2006; Privat et al., 2007; Nehlich et al., 2010, 2011; Lamb et al., 2012), have been used as indicators of environmental changes (Wadleigh, 2003; Newton and Bottrell, 2007; Yun et al., 2010) and are regularly utilised in food authentication studies (Bahar et al., 2008; Rummel et al., 2010; Tanz and Schmidt, 2010; Osorio et al., 2011). Previous findings from the Lake Myvatn region of north-east Iceland have demonstrated a significant overlap between the d15N values of both modern and archaeological-age terrestrial herbivore bone collagen and the d15N values of modern and archaeological-age freshwater fish. d13C values of freshwater biota were also found to be simil</context>

The pH of the soil is around 6.5, providing favourable conditions for preservation of animal bones. The work discussed in this paper deals solely with excavations carried out during the 2008 and 2009 field trips and a list of all samples analysed with their stratigraphic context and chronology is presented in the Supplementary data section. 3.2. Extraction of bone collagen A modified version of the Longin method was used to extract the collagen component from the animal bones (Longin, 1971). Sample surfaces were initially cleaned using a Dremel multi-tool, before they were lightly crushed into smaller fragments and immersed in 1 M HCl for approx. 24 h to effect demineralisation. The acid was then decanted and samples were rinsed with ultra-pure water to remove any remaining dissociated carbonates, acid soluble from around Iceland and the Lake Myvatn region. 536 K.L.

Within the marine environment, d15N values can range between +15&amp; to +20&amp; as a consequence of the food chains being considerably longer than in the terrestrial biosphere (DeNiro and Epstein, 1981; Schoeninger et al., 1983; Schoeninger and DeNiro, 1984). However, organisms lower down in the marine food chain such as gastropods, molluscs, Polychaeta and Maxillopoda demonstrate lighter d13C (23.2&amp; to 17.1&amp;) and d15N values (+5.9&amp; to +9.7&amp;) (Mateo et al., 2008). Freshwater fish have also displayed enriched d15N values; however studies have shown that some species have d13C and d15N values that are similar to those observed within a terrestrial environment (Dufour et al., 1999). Therefore, the introduction of a third stable isotope, namely sulphur, to aid in the distinction between these two food groups, is potentially highly advantageous.

The region has been documented as an area of major archaeological importance with respect to the settlement of Viking communities during the landnam from around AD 870 onwards (Vesteinsson, 1998; McGovern et al., 2007; Einarsson and Aldred, 2011). Radiocarbon dating of terrestrial animal remains and tephrochronological studies from various sites surrounding Lake Myvatn have shown that settlers populated the region from the late 9th century (McGovern et al., 2006, 2007). The presence of these inhabitants is thought to have had a large environmental impact on the area, with the introduction of grazing livestock and rapid deforestation (Hallsdottir, 1987), leading to significant soil erosion (Arnalds et al., 1997; Vesteinsson et al., 2002; Dugmore et al., 2005; Lawson et al., 2007). 2.2.

In coastal regions, sulphur-containing particles can be propelled inland in a process known as the sea-spray effect, causing soil d34S values to be similar to that of seawater (Wadleigh et al., 1994). Intensive weathering of igneous rocks causes leached sulphides to filter into ground and stream water systems, enabling plants to accumulate the oxidised sulphate form in their roots.

The eruption of the Grımsvotn volcano in 1996, which is situated below the Vatnajokull Glacier in south-east Iceland, caused the Skeiðara River to flood, and water samples taken before and during the early stages of the overflow revealed a post-eruption increase in sulphur concentration.

For mammals to successfully thrive, sulphur-containing biochemical compounds, such as the essential amino acids, methionine and cysteine, need to be acquired from the diet. Studies have demonstrated that there is a negligible trophic level shift for sulphur isotopes compared to the large range of d34S values shown within terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments (Peterson et al., 1985; Richards et al., 2003). Therefore, consumers eating produce from within the Lake Myvatn vicinity should have similar d34S values to the surrounding terrestrial vegetation. Currently, there are no published d34S values for either animal or human archaeological remains from Iceland, and globally only a small number of sulphur isotope studies have been undertaken on archaeological material.

Therefore, it is conceivable that the d34S value of sulphur in the Myvatn region could range from 2.0&amp; to +10.1&amp;, and since plants are depleted in 34S by 1.5&amp; relative to their sulphate source (Trust and Fry, 1992), vegetation in the region is likely to have a d34S value that can vary between 3.5&amp; and +8.6&amp;. Similarly, isotopic fractionation of sulphur in mammals is small relative to their diet (Peterson et al., 1985; Richards et al., 2003), and hence domestic animals raised in Myvatn and consuming local vegetation would not be expected to display a d34S value greater than +10&amp;, however, this cut off value remains ambiguous until d34S values of flora and water samples in the area have been measured.

For mammals to successfully thrive, sulphur-containing biochemical compounds, such as the essential amino acids, methionine and cysteine, need to be acquired from the diet. Studies have demonstrated that there is a negligible trophic level shift for sulphur isotopes compared to the large range of d34S values shown within terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments (Peterson et al., 1985; Richards et al., 2003). Therefore, consumers eating produce from within the Lake Myvatn vicinity should have similar d34S values to the surrounding terrestrial vegetation. Currently, there are no published d34S values for either animal or human archaeological remains from Iceland, and globally only a small number of sulphur isotope studies have been undertaken on archaeological material.

However, cod from four archaeological sites in the north-east Atlantic yielded d13C values between 14.7&amp; and 11.3&amp; (Barrett et al., 2008, 2011; Russell et al., 2011).

It has been noted that in soils depleted in phosphorous, plants and lichens that take up ammonia from the atmosphere are capable of generating negative d15N values (Erskine et al., 1998; McKee et al., 2002). Ascough et al. (2007, 2010, 2012, in press) found that d15N values for modern and archaeological terrestrial animals ranged between 1.5&amp; and +5.9&amp;, whilst freshwater fish displayed d15N values from +3.1&amp; to +8.5&amp;, and north-east Atlantic cod yielded d15N values from +11.9&amp; to +15.4&amp; (Barrett et al., 2008, 2011; Russell et al., 2011).

Intensive weathering of igneous rocks causes leached sulphides to filter into ground and stream water systems, enabling plants to accumulate the oxidised sulphate form in their roots.

However, Icelandic lava fields are sparsely vegetated with lichen and moss (Bjarnason, 1991), which can accumulate their sulphur directly from atmospheric sulphur dioxide (SO2) with very little isotopic fractionation (Krouse, 1977).

Therefore, it is conceivable that the d34S value of sulphur in the Myvatn region could range from 2.0&amp; to +10.1&amp;, and since plants are depleted in 34S by 1.5&amp; relative to their sulphate source (Trust and Fry, 1992), vegetation in the region is likely to have a d34S value that can vary between 3.5&amp; and +8.6&amp;. Similarly, isotopic fractionation of sulphur in mammals is small relative to their diet (Peterson et al., 1985; Richards et al., 2003), and hence domestic animals raised in Myvatn and consuming local vegetation would not be expected to display a d34S value greater than +10&amp;, however, this cut off value remains ambiguous until d34S values of flora and water samples in the area have been measured.

Two samples (highlighted by an asterisk in their respective data tables) have still been included as their values fall within the desired ranges when corrected for weighing errors on the analytical balance. 3.4. Radiocarbon dating Radiocarbon ages were obtained from selected samples in this study. CO2 was generated from collagen via combustion following the method of Vandeputte et al. (1996). Following cryogenic purification, d13C was measured on an aliquot of the CO2 for normalization of sample 14C/13C ratios. This was achieved on a VG SIRA 10 isotope ratio mass spectrometer, using NBS 22 (oil) and NBS 19 (marble) as standards. The method of Slota et al. (1987) was used to convert a 3 ml aliquot of the CO2 to graphite for 14C measurement by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Sample 14C/13C ratios were measured with carbon in the +1 charge state on the SUERC SSAMS at 245 keV. Calibrated age ranges at 2r were obtained from sample 14C ages using the atmospheric IntCal09 curve (Re</context>

Freshwater fish have also displayed enriched d15N values; however studies have shown that some species have d13C and d15N values that are similar to those observed within a terrestrial environment (Dufour et al., 1999). Therefore, the introduction of a third stable isotope, namely sulphur, to aid in the distinction between these two food groups, is potentially highly advantageous. Wang and Wooller (2006) carried out d15N analysis on the plants and lichens recovered from the four sites mentioned previously in northern Iceland and found that values ranged from 12.4&amp; to +5.6&amp;, with many of the samples Icelandic sulphur sources. having values lower than 6.0&amp;.

Archaeologists were very quick to exploit this theory and stable isotope analysis of preserved bone collagen is now routinely utilised in palaeodietary reconstruction studies, providing archaeologists with a detailed insight into prehistoric diet (Van der Merwe and Vogel, 1978; Tauber, 1981; Schoeninger et al., 1983). Recent advances in continuous-flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (CF-IRMS) have allowed sulphur isotopes (d34S) to be measured from organic and inorganic materials (Giesemann et al., 1994; Fry et al., 1996; Grassineau et al., 2001; Yun et al., 2005; Fritzsche and Tichomirowa, 2006; Grassineau, 2006; Fry, 2007; Hansen et al., 2009) and over the past decade there has been a marked increase in the use of sulphur isotopes in conjunction with carbon and nitrogen isotopes to aid our understanding of the diet and movement of prehistoric animals and humans (Macko et al., 1999; Richards et al., 2001, 2003; Hu et al., 2009; Vika, 2009; Craig et al., 2010; Howcroft et al., 2012; Nehlich et al., 2012; Oelze et al., 2012a,b).

Sulphur isotopes have also been exploited to explore the variability in terrestrial, marine- and freshwater-based diets (Craig et al., 2006; Privat et al., 2007; Nehlich et al., 2010, 2011; Lamb et al., 2012), have been used as indicators of environmental changes (Wadleigh, 2003; Newton and Bottrell, 2007; Yun et al., 2010) and are regularly utilised in food authentication studies (Bahar et al., 2008; Rummel et al., 2010; Tanz and Schmidt, 2010; Osorio et al., 2011). Previous findings from the Lake Myvatn region of north-east Iceland have demonstrated a significant overlap between the d15N values of both modern and archaeological-age terrestrial herbivore bone collagen and the d15N values of modern and archaeological-age freshwater fish. d13C values of freshwater biota were also found to be similar to those of marine resources (Ascough et al., 2010), and consequently, separation of herbivores, freshwater fish a</context>

The higher d34S values may be attributed to the consumption of vegetation containing marine-derived sulphur, suggesting these animals may have been reared closer to the coast and trading of domestic animals was also occurring within Icelandic Norse communities. Studies have shown that sea-spray not only influences coastal soil d34S values, as sulphate particles can be propelled inland over extensive distances (Zazzo et al., 2011), however, it is unlikely that the land around Lake Myvatn would have been affected by sea-spray as the d34S values of these six animals are very distinct from the average d34S values of their contemporaries. The rate of bone collagen turnover is poorly understood, with estimates ranging from less than a year in birds (Hobson and Clark, 1992) to over ten years in adult humans (Hedges et al., 2007). Assuming that fully matured animals are slaughtered within a few years of being brought inland, their 34S signature is unlikely to have changed significantly from when they first arrived at Lake My</context>
