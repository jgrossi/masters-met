			<abstract>
				<p>Doramectin (DOR), metronidazole (MET), florfenicol (FLO), and oxytetracycline (OXT) are among the most widely used veterinary drugs in animal husbandry or in aquaculture. Contamination of the environment by these pharmaceuticals has given cause for concern in recent years. Even though their toxicity has been thoroughly analyzed, knowledge of their ecotoxicity is still limited. We investigated their aquatic toxicity using tests with marine bacteria (Vibrio fischeri), green algae (Scenedesmus vacuolatus), duckweed (Lemna minor) and crustaceans (Daphnia magna). All the ecotoxicological tests were supported by chemical analyses to confirm the exposure concentrations of the pharmaceuticals used in the toxicity experiments, since deviations from the nominal concentration can result in underestimation of biological effects. It was found that OXT and FLO have a stronger adverse effect on duckweed (EC 50 = 3.26 and 2.96 mg L À1 respectively) and green algae (EC 50 = 40.4 and 18.0 mg L À1) than on bacteria (EC 50 = 108 and 29.4 mg L À1) and crustaceans (EC 50 = 114 and 337 mg L À1), whereas MET did not exhibit any adverse effect in the tested concentration range. For DOR a very low EC 50 of 6.37 Â 10 À5 mg L À1 towards D. magna was determined , which is five orders of magnitude lower than values known for the toxic reference compound K 2 Cr 2 O 7. Our data show the strong influence of certain veterinary drugs on aquatic organisms and contribute to a sound assessment of the environmental hazards posed by commonly used pharmaceuticals.</p>

Luminescence inhibition assay with marine bacteria The results listed in Table 4 show that none of the tested drugs displayed a high level of acute toxicity toward V. fischeri. The lowest EC50 was found for FLO (29.4 mg L1); the values for OXT and MET were &amp;gt;100 mg L1. No effect up to 0.24 mg L1 could be determined for DOR. This concentration is, however, well above environmentally relevant concentrations, which range from ng L1 to hundreds of lg L1 (Boxall et al., 2006). The 30 min EC50 obtained for OXT (108 mg L1) is comparable to the results reported by Lalumera et al. (2004) (121–139 mg L1) (Table 2). However, no clear correlation between available ecotoxiciy data for OXT to V. fischeri and exposure time can be observed. Isidori et al. (2005) highlighted that most of the toxicity data available for V. fischeri using short exposure times (between 5 and 30 min) rather than a 24 h exposure show that most pharmaceuticals have a low toxic potential in this respect, because these compounds interfere only slightly with biosynthetic pathways. For example, the l</context>

Such a high toxicity of DOR to D. magna reveals a serious threat when this compound reaches the aquatic environment. But so far only limited data have been available concerning the occurrence and fate of anthelmintics (including DOR) in the environment (Horvat et al., 2012). Pfizer Inc. (1996) calculated the maximum expected concentrations of DOR in a surface water body to range from 0.24 to 0.42 ng L1, values backed up by Boxall et al. (2006). Even though these estimated concentrations are lower than observed EC50s, it must be pointed out that organisms are typically exposed to multi-component chemical mixtures. It is possible that DOR, in predicted environmental concentrations and in combination with residues of veterinary products and/or other pharmaceu-ce compounds (aPalma et al., 2008, bFaust et al., 2001; cTeodorovic et al., 2012, dKaiser L. minor D. magna nr3 6.37  105 (5.72  105 – 7.09  105) &amp;gt;25 211 (170–258) 2.96 (2.63–3.35) 337 (261–447) 3.26 (2.82–3.86) 114 (96–138) 0.188c 35.5a 0.6 – 2.1e 3663f &amp;gt;1000f here 92 (20</context>

Effects were found for OXT and FLO – both EC50 values were around 3 mg L1 – but they were one order of magnitude higher than the values determined for the toxic reference compound atrazine. Pro et al. (2003) and Zounková et al. (2011) determined the toxicity of OXT toward L. minor in a 7-d test, obtaining EC50s of 4.92 mg L1 and 2.1 mg L1, respectively. Brain et al. (2004), however, assessed the phytotoxicity of OXT to Lemna gibba in 7-d static-renewal tests at the level of EC50 = 1.01 mg L1 (calculated for the frond number). Halling-Sørensen (2000) suggested that the toxic effect may have been underestimated in static tests because, for example, of photodegradation of compounds with short halflives like OXT. Other authors, however, have confirmed the negligible influence of photodegradation on the results under the conditions of a 7-d static test (Zounková et al., 2011). Photodegradation can also be presumed insignificant in the context of the current study, </context>

The nitroimidazole MET is an antibiotic effective against anaerobic bacteria, protozoans and certain parasites. It acts by entering bacterial and protozoan cells and interfering with DNA (Lanzky and Halling-Sørensen, 1997). DOR is an antiparasitic drug which is a one of themost popular compound for curing anthelmintic disease. DOR binds to receptors that increase membrane permeability to chloride ions. This inhibits the electrical activity of nerve cells in nematodes and muscle cells in arthropods, paralyzing and ultimately killing the parasites (Horvat et al., 2012; Lumaret et al., 2012).

Furthermore, in accordance to the IMS Health Market Prognosis (2012) the global pharmaceutical market has grown twice during the last decade. However the real amounts of drugs entering the environment can be much more higher due to lack of control with type and amounts of pharmaceuticals usage in developing countries e.g. India, Thailand, Indonesia (Sarmah et al., 2006). The relatively low cost and the broad spectrum of activity of these pharmaceuticals means they are very commonly used not only in animal husbandry (DOR, MET, FLO, OXT) but also in aquaculture (MET, FLO, OXT) (Christensen et al., 2006; Ferreira et al., 2007; Lai et al., 2009; Lumaret et al., 2012; Horvat et al., 2012). It must be pointed out that the veterinary medicines used in aquaculture are commonly administered as a medicated feed mainly as a bath formulation (Hekoten et al., 1995; Boxall, 2010). Hence a considerable proportion of these drugs administered in an intensive fish farm was found to have been released into the aquatic environment via urinary and fecal excretions and in uncon-M.w.

For DOR 0.2% of ACN was added to the control samples in the toxicity test to offset the influence of this solvent on the test organisms.2.2. Luminescent inhibition assay with marine bacteria The toxicity test based on Vibrio fischeri was done using the LCK 482 test kit (Dr Lange GmbH, Germany). The 30-min standard bioluminescence inhibition assay was carried out according to a modified DIN 38412-L34 protocol (1991). The tests were carried out at least twice for each substance. At least four controls (2% NaCl solution, phosphate-buffered) were used during each test. The tests were performed at 15 C using thermostats (LUMIStherm, Dr. Lange GmbH, Germany). The luminescence was measured with a luminometer (LUMIStox 300, Dr Lange GmbH, Germany). The lyophilized bacteria were rehydrated according to the test protocol; then, 500 lL aliquots of the bacteria solution were pre-incubated for 15 min at 15 C. After the initial luminescence had been measured, 500 lL of the diluted samples were added to the bacteria</context>

However the real amounts of drugs entering the environment can be much more higher due to lack of control with type and amounts of pharmaceuticals usage in developing countries e.g. India, Thailand, Indonesia (Sarmah et al., 2006). The relatively low cost and the broad spectrum of activity of these pharmaceuticals means they are very commonly used not only in animal husbandry (DOR, MET, FLO, OXT) but also in aquaculture (MET, FLO, OXT) (Christensen et al., 2006; Ferreira et al., 2007; Lai et al., 2009; Lumaret et al., 2012; Horvat et al., 2012). It must be pointed out that the veterinary medicines used in aquaculture are commonly administered as a medicated feed mainly as a bath formulation (Hekoten et al., 1995; Boxall, 2010). Hence a considerable proportion of these drugs administered in an intensive fish farm was found to have been released into the aquatic environment via urinary and fecal excretions and in uncon-M.w.

Effects were found for OXT and FLO – both EC50 values were around 3 mg L1 – but they were one order of magnitude higher than the values determined for the toxic reference compound atrazine. Pro et al. (2003) and Zounková et al. (2011) determined the toxicity of OXT toward L. minor in a 7-d test, obtaining EC50s of 4.92 mg L1 and 2.1 mg L1, respectively. Brain et al. (2004), however, assessed the phytotoxicity of OXT to Lemna gibba in 7-d static-renewal tests at the level of EC50 = 1.01 mg L1 (calculated for the frond number). Halling-Sørensen (2000) suggested that the toxic effect may have been underestimated in static tests because, for example, of photodegradation of compounds with short halflives like OXT. Other authors, however, have confirmed the negligible influence of photodegradation on the results under the conditions of a 7-d static test (Zounková et al., 2011). Photodegradation can also be presumed insignificant in the context of the current study, because the EC50 for OXT calculated in this study is generally comparable with the results obtained by both static and static-renewal tests (Brain et al. 2004; Zounková et al., 2011</context>

The lowest EC50 was found for FLO (29.4 mg L1); the values for OXT and MET were &amp;gt;100 mg L1. No effect up to 0.24 mg L1 could be determined for DOR. This concentration is, however, well above environmentally relevant concentrations, which range from ng L1 to hundreds of lg L1 (Boxall et al., 2006). The 30 min EC50 obtained for OXT (108 mg L1) is comparable to the results reported by Lalumera et al. (2004) (121–139 mg L1) (Table 2). However, no clear correlation between available ecotoxiciy data for OXT to V. fischeri and exposure time can be observed. Isidori et al. (2005) highlighted that most of the toxicity data available for V. fischeri using short exposure times (between 5 and 30 min) rather than a 24 h exposure show that most pharmaceuticals have a low toxic potential in this respect, because these compounds interfere only slightly with biosynthetic pathways. For example, the low sensitivity of V. fischeri to OXT can be explained by its mode of action on protein synthesis, which is not of importance during short-term bioluminescence testing (Zounková et al., 2011). 3.2.2.

(2000) for both OXT and MET; these observations are in agreement with our results for these two compounds. No data about the toxicity of FLO toward D. magna are available to date. Our investigation demonstrated the very low toxicity of this compound toward D. magna – 337 mg L1.However, we obtained strong effects (EC50 = 0.0637 lg L1) with DOR, which shows that this compound is five orders of magnitude more toxic than K2Cr2O7, the reference substance for this test. This was also stated by Pfizer Inc. (1996), who reported an EC50 of 0.1 lg L1 for DOR. In their experiments, however, the authors did not consider determining the water-soluble fraction of this drug in biological media, which can be lower than in pure water. Hence the amount of compound which can cause harmful effect on the tested organisms can be lower than suspected. Therefore the EC50 of DOR that they determined was almost twice as high as our value (Pfizer Inc., 1996). These results highlight the importance of combining ecotoxicity tests with instrumental analysis in order to obtain reliable data, and to confirm the exposure conc</context>

Halling-Sørensen (2000) suggested that the toxic effect may have been underestimated in static tests because, for example, of photodegradation of compounds with short halflives like OXT. Other authors, however, have confirmed the negligible influence of photodegradation on the results under the conditions of a 7-d static test (Zounková et al., 2011).

Pfizer Inc. (1996) calculated the maximum expected concentrations of DOR in a surface water body to range from 0.24 to 0.42 ng L1, values backed up by Boxall et al. (2006). Even though these estimated concentrations are lower than observed EC50s, it must be pointed out that organisms are typically exposed to multi-component chemical mixtures.

Isidori et al. (2005) highlighted that most of the toxicity data available for V. fischeri using short exposure times (between 5 and 30 min) rather than a 24 h exposure show that most pharmaceuticals have a low toxic potential in this respect, because these compounds interfere only slightly with biosynthetic pathways. For example, the low sensitivity of V. fischeri to OXT can be explained by its mode of action on protein synthesis, which is not of importance during short-term bioluminescence testing (Zounková et al., 2011). 3.2.2. Reproduction inhibition assay with green algae The toxicity of veterinary drugs toward S. vacuolatus is reported for the first time. Our results indicate that this limnic green alga was generally more sensitive than V. fischeri for FLO and OXT. FLO exhibited the strongest growth inhibition against S. vacuolatus, followed by OXT and MET. The toxicity of DOR to green algae has not been calculated yet, but our study found its EC50 to be &amp;gt;0.34 mg L1.

As a result, despite having the same general mode of action, FLO was found to be more toxic (EC50 = 6.06 mg L1) than OXT (EC50 = 11.18 mg L1), a situation backed up by our findings. 3.2.3. Growth inhibition assay with duckweed No toxic effect toward L. minor was found for the maximal soluble fraction of MET (&amp;gt;25 mg L1) and DOR (&amp;gt;0.31 mg L1). Effects were found for OXT and FLO – both EC50 values were around 3 mg L1 – but they were one order of magnitude higher than the values determined for the toxic reference compound atrazine. Pro et al. (2003) and Zounková et al. (2011) determined the toxicity of OXT toward L. minor in a 7-d test, obtaining EC50s of 4.92 mg L1 and 2.1 mg L1, respectively. Brain et al. (2004), however, assessed the phytotoxicity of OXT to Lemna gibba in 7-d static-renewal tests at the level of EC50 = 1.01 mg L1 (calculated for the frond number). Halling-Sørensen (2000) suggested that the toxic effect may have been underestimated in static tests because, for example, of photodegradation of compounds with short halflives like OXT.

It must be pointed out that the veterinary medicines used in aquaculture are commonly administered as a medicated feed mainly as a bath formulation (Hekoten et al., 1995; Boxall, 2010). Hence a considerable proportion of these drugs administered in an intensive fish farm was found to have been released into the aquatic environment via urinary and fecal excretions and in uncon-M.w.

(2007) highlighted that when OXT was administrated orally, fish took up only about 10–30% of the total amount administered, while 70–90% of it entered the environment and was available for distribution to other compartments. Disregarding the different routes by which these pharmaceuticals enter the environment, their presence in its different compartments has already been determined (Kolpin et al., 2002; Kay et al., 2005).

The plants were grown in open Erlenmeyer flasks in sterilized Steinberg medium (pH 5.5 ± 0.2) in a climate chamber with a constant temperature of 25 ± 2 C. To exclude pH effects on plant growth, the pH was checked at the beginning and end of the test. Based on control samples evaluation the pH changes did not affect growth inhibition. The chamber was illuminated continuously with a maximum of 6 klx. The assays were performed on six-well cell culture plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, here 92 (2013) 1253–1259Frickenhausen, Germany). All compounds were tested twice in three replicates, with a minimum of six controls in each test. The test started with one plant consisting of three duckweed fronds, and the measured endpoint was the inhibition of the growth rate determined by the frond area (mm2), which was calculated for the treated plants in relation to the untreated controls. The frond area was detected using a Scanalyzer from Lemnatec GmbH (Würselen, Germany). 2.5.

Even though these estimated concentrations are lower than observed EC50s, it must be pointed out that organisms are typically exposed to multi-component chemical mixtures. It is possible that DOR, in predicted environmental concentrations and in combination with residues of veterinary products and/or other pharmaceu-ce compounds (aPalma et al., 2008, bFaust et al., 2001; cTeodorovic et al., 2012, dKaiser L. minor D. magna nr3 6.37  105 (5.72  105 – 7.09  105) &amp;gt;25 211 (170–258) 2.96 (2.63–3.35) 337 (261–447) 3.26 (2.82–3.86) 114 (96–138) 0.188c 35.5a 0.6 – 2.1e 3663f &amp;gt;1000f here 92 (2013) 1253–1259ticals/pollutants, will cause adverse effects to biota. 4. Conclusions As a result of such a comparative ecotoxicological analysis, the potential effects of four selected veterinary drugs, most commonly used in livestock or in aquacultures, on aquatic organisms were defined. DOR was found to be highly toxic toward D. magna.
