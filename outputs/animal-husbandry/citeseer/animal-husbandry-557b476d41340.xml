			<abstract>
				<p>Farm animals are confronted with major changes in their environment as they go through different phases of the production system. Examples include introduction to a new housing system, provision of a new type of feed, mixing with unfamiliar conspecifics or being exposed to new human handlers. Learning processes that reduce uncertainty in such situations are likely to be very important both for animal welfare and for performance. The aim of this paper is to describe, from the animal's point of view, situations typical of learning in farm animal husbandry and to provide a framework for assessing the significance of learning processes for farm animal husbandry and welfare. The literature reviewed covers experimental studies into the learning abilities of ruminants, pigs and poultry as well as evidence stemming from applied studies showing problems farm animals may face in situations of change. We argue that knowledge of species-specific learning abilities may help in the design of housing systems and the establishment of management routines that facilitate learning by the animals. Having searched the literature, we conclude that there is a lack of studies focusing on the initial phase after the introduction of farm animals into a new housing system and on the way they learn to use new housing equipment. Moreover, we suggest that studies into: (a) learning of farm animals during transport and in the slaughterhouse, (b) their motivation to explore the environment and (c) the development of enrichment tasks taking into account their learning abilities may provide solutions to some animal welfare problems.</p>

Such preferences can be used to facilitate farm animals’ learning about the housing system. For example, cows have a preference for a soft surface of the floor in the place they lie down (Herlin, 1997). Such information can be used to design cubicles that are well accepted as lying places. With poultry, Appleby and McRae (1986) showed that enclosure is an important stimulus in nest-site selection by laying hens, and Duncan and Kite (1989) found that hens opt for nests containing loose material that can be moulded by body and feet movements. As noted above, knowledge of such preferences is important for the design of aviary systems to ensure that the hens will learn to lay their eggs in the available nest boxes and not elsewhere in the housing system.Moreover, chicks of both broiler and layer strains preferentially show active behaviour in bright light and resting and perching in dim light (Davis et al., 1999). Consequently, it may be useful to structure the housing system according to this preference with feeding and drinking </context>

As a consequence of these results, loose-house systems for farrowing sows have been developed (e.g. Cronin et al., 2000; Weber, 2000). In line with this example, it is generally agreed that farm animal welfare is at a high level when the animals can behave naturally, i.e. in the way their behaviour has been shaped by evolution in adaptation to the habitat of their ancestors, and thereby satisfy their behavioural needs (Fraser et al., 1997; Wechsler, 2007). The concept of adaptation refers, however, not only to evolutionary adaptation but also to changes in behaviour brought about during the lifetime of an individual animal by processes of learning. Consequently, learning processes should also be considered to assess the animals’ ability to adapt to and cope with a given housing system. Wechsler (1995) defined coping as ‘‘behavioural responses that aim at reducing the effect of aversive stimuli on fitness or physiological measures related to fitness’’. If the aversive situation can be attenuated or removed by the coping respons</context>

(1999) reported that calves who could eat a novel food in early ontogeny when housed together with their dam, who was familiar with that food, were more likely to feed on it 12 weeks later than calves without such a social experience. With weaned piglets, the presence of a piglet that is already experienced with eating solid food stimulates food intake of an inexperienced piglet (Morgan et al., 2001). It has also been found that an experimentally induced feed aversion my be overcome by social learning. For example, Ralphs and Olsen (1990) observed that averted heifers started to sample of the formerly avoided feed when paired with non-averted conspecifics, and the aversion was even extinguished in some animals. Similar results were obtained in a study with sheep (Thorhallsdottir et al., 1990). With fattening ruminants in intensive housing, it is typical that they have to learn to accept food they would not eat in their natural environment. For example, Chapple et al. (1987a) observed how sheep learned to eat wheat and reported that it took up to 14 days until a sheep began eating this feed. In this case too, sheep learned the </context>

Tasks should be based on the animals’ motivation to explore their housing system and to derive rules of behavioural responses to redundant patterns in their environment upon reinforcement. Given the fact that farm animals usually have plenty of time to explore and manipulate their environment, it is likely that they will sooner or later solve enrichment tasks by trial and error learning. For example, Smith et al. (1990) reported that caged laying hens developed three different methods of opening a door in order to lay in a dust bath and spent on average 34 min attempting to open the door before access was finally achieved. 5. Conclusion The ability of farm animals to adapt to and cope with their housing conditions is likely to be much influenced by learning processes. We therefore suggest that studies focusing on the initial phase after changes in the housing environment would be promising for both identifying and solving problems animals may face when exposed to such changes.

If an operant response is required to produce more food or water, for example, pressing on a bar to induce the delivery of food pellets or squeezing a nipple drinker to start a continuous flow of water, it is always recommended that the interval between the behaviour of the animal about to learn and the delivery of the resource should be as short as possible. Experiments in tightly controlled situations show that even the briefest delay between response and reinforcement can greatly slow learning (Grice, 1948). However, in simple operant situations of the sort likely to be encountered in agricultural practice, learning can still occur even with quite substantial response-reinforcer delays (Lattal and Gleeson, 1990; Wilkenfeld et al., 1992), and in any case the effects of response-reinforcer delay can usually be overcome by providing an immediate stimulus which has been pre-associated with food (Schlinger and Blakely, 1994). This ‘‘bridging’’ effect of a stimulus, which becomes a conditioned reinforcer, has been well understood from the time of Grice’s work, and one of the purposes of procedures suc</context>

Rather, we have to suppose that the area where a given behaviour has been made possible by the design of the living quarters is, from the animal’s point of view, unsuitable in some way. Firstly, it is possible that the perceptual cues available are inadequate to elicit the required behaviour in a given area. For example, pigs prefer to show eliminative behaviour at sites that are wet and where they can have contact with pigs in a neighbouring pen (Mollet andWechsler, 1991; Hacker et al., 1994). However, if these environmental characteristics are not limited to a specific area of a pen but can be found at different sites within the pen the pigs will find it difficult to choose a specific site where all members of the group defecate. Similarly, sows due to farrow typically select as a nest site an area with straw bedding and solid walls separating it from neighbouring pens (Arey et al., 1992; Schmid, 1992). In pens where these cues are provided in a specific area supposed to be the nest site they will show eliminative behaviour away from that site. Schmid (1992, 1997) followed the pr</context>

With chicks, Jones (1994) reported that regular gentle handling in early ontogeny reliably reduces the animals’ fear of humans. Moreover, he found that chicks habituated to one person through regular handling also exhibited reduced fear of other people wearing either similar or different types of clothing, thus showing stimulus generalisation.

Similarly, specific cues in the environment of newly hatched chicks are important for the development of sufficient eating behaviour to ensure their survival (Shreck et al., 1963). Such preferences can be used to facilitate farm animals’ learning about the housing system. For example, cows have a preference for a soft surface of the floor in the place they lie down (Herlin, 1997). Such information can be used to design cubicles that are well accepted as lying places. With poultry, Appleby and McRae (1986) showed that enclosure is an important stimulus in nest-site selection by laying hens, and Duncan and Kite (1989) found that hens opt for nests containing loose material that can be moulded by body and feet movements. As noted above, knowledge of such preferences is important for the design of aviary systems to ensure that the hens will learn to lay their eggs in the available nest boxes and not elsewhere in the housing system.Moreover, chicks of both broiler and laye</context>

(1996) reported that turkeys had more and more difficulty in using elevated perches for resting during the fattening period, and this was paralleled by an increase in leg problems. 2.2. Learning about what to eat It is not surprising that farm animal species have innate preferences for food over non-food items, a phenomenon that has been investigated extensively in poultry (Dawkins, 1968). Nevertheless, they do have to learn what they can eat in the environment in which they actually grow up (Hogan, 1973), and there is much experimental evidence in various species that food avoidance learning occurs when animals are given the experience of harmful feed (e.g. cattle: Kronberg et al., 1993; sheep: Burritt and Provenza, 1989; goats: Zahorik et al., 1990; poultry: Hale and Green, 1988); conversely, goats and sheep may learn to eat foods that have a medicinal effect (Rogosic et al., 2006; Villalba et al., 2006). Several studies with farm animals have shown that social learning may be important for feed acceptance. For example, Fukasawa et al. (1999) reported that calves who could eat a novel food i</context>

Facilitating learning in farm animal husbandry Inglis (2000) emphasised the role of uncertainty reduction in determining animal behaviour, and this aspect of behavioural organisation is not only important in the wild, but also for farm animals. The process includes information gathering as well as information processing resulting in a cognitive model of the environment, from which rules of behavioural responses to specific environmental situations are derived and further selected based on the feedback the animal gets when performing the response.

In applied animal behaviour science, standardised test situations, such as open field tests or novel object tests have also been used as a measure of fear or personality traits (e.g. Andersen et al., 2000; Thodberg et al., 1999). What is missing, however, are studies that focus in similar detail on the behaviour of individuals when they are confronted with a novel situation typical for farm animal husbandry, such as being introduced to a new housin</context>

Introduction When adaptation of farm animals to a given housing system is addressed in papers on animal welfare, it is typically emphasised that the behavioural organisation of domestic animals has been shaped by evolution, resulting in species-specific behavioural needs that have to be considered in the design and management of the housing system. For example, studies into the behaviour of domestic pigs kept in semi-natural enclosures showed that nest-building behaviour is still performed by sows of domestic breeds (Stolba andWood-Gush, 1984; Jensen, 1989), thus calling into question the housing of sows due to farrow in crates and without provision of straw. Furthermore, experimental studies analysing the behavioural organisation of farrowing sows provided evidence that the sows are highly motivated to have access to nest-building material on the day before farrowing (Arey, 1992) and are stressed if kept in crates and without straw during that period (Lawrence et al., 1994). As a consequence of these results, loose-house systems for farrowing sows have been developed (e.g. Cronin et al., 2000; Weber, 2000). In line with this example, it is gene</context>

(2001) found in maze experiments that sheep could discriminate between human faces. Several studies have provided evidence that animals’ initial fear of humans can be overcome by regular handling. For example, Miura et al. (1996) observed that regularly handled weanling pigs showed significantly less aversion to a non-familiar human than did non-handled pigs. With chicks, Jones (1994) reported that regular gentle handling in early ontogeny reliably reduces the animals’ fear of humans. Moreover, he found that chicks habituated to one person through regular handling also exhibited reduced fear of other people wearing either similar or different types of clothing, thus showing stimulus generalisation. Similarly, Hemsworth et al. (1996) observed that pigs fed by an experimenter were subsequently less fearful both of the handler and of other humans. With farm animals, it is inevitable that they sometimes have negative experiences with humans, for example when they are caught fo</context>

Similarly, Tanida et al. (1994) found that piglets receiving regular handling showed less aversion and even tried to make frequent physical contact with an experimenter in spite of repeated chasing and catching events. Interestingly, Jones and Waddington (1992) reported that early environmental enrichment also attenuated the tonic immobility reaction of chicks to manual restraint, suggesting that enrichment may have modified general, non-specific fearfulness.

In order to encourage correct manipulation of feeders or drinkers it is usually helpful to spread some feed or sprinkle water in the vicinity of the equipment. Studies of natural foraging have shown that, when hungry or thirsty, animals will look for cues for food and water and, once they have found small quantities, typically modify their behaviour so that they stay in the vicinity (Smith, 1974), so long as the source is not experienced as being exhausted (Kamil, 1978). Of course, food may also be used to draw the attention of animals to a site for other reasons than feeding. Prescott et al. (1998) showed experimentally that food is significantly more rewarding than milking and likely to be a necessary incentive to attract cows to an automatic milking system. If an operant response is required to produce more food or water, for example, pressing on a bar to induce the delivery of food pellets or squeezing a nipple drinker to start a continuous flow of water, it is always recommended that the interval between the behaviour of the animal about to learn and th</context>

Learning about housing equipment Because of the development of the technology used in farm animal husbandry, animals have to learn more and more about housing equipment. For example, sows learn to feed from electronic feeding stations and dairy cows may have to get used to be milked in an automatic milking system. There are, however, only a few studies in which the process of adaptation to housing equipment has been monitored extensively. For example, Pojtner et al. (1984) described the adaptation of dairy cows to automatic feeders and Kashiwamura et al. (2001) reported how habituation was used to encourage dairy cows to enter the milking boxes of an automatic milking system. Evidence from experimental studies suggests that social learning may help animals to learn about housing equipment. In a study with heifers, Veissier (1993) found that the activity of a demonstrator would draw the attention of observers to stimuli involved in a task (pushing a panel to get food into a box) and hence enhance the learning of the task. Veissier and Stefanova (1993) showed that newborn lambs learned to suck milk from a bucket provided with teats in 3 days rather th</context>

At first sight, such a differentiation in the use of different areas of a housing system for different activities seems to be trivial. After all, the housing systems were designed to be used in a particular way, and activity and resting areas are labelled on the plans drawn by the architects. Animals, however, do not read architects’ plans. There is evidence that there are problems with fattening pigs fouling the pen floor (Randall et al., 1983; Aarnink et al., 1996), dairy cows lying down outside the cubicles (Kjaestad and Myren, 2001), and hens laying eggs outside the nest boxes (floor eggs) (Appleby et al., 1988; Cooper and Appleby, 1996). Consequently, it is worth having a closer look at the learning processes leading to appropriate use of the housing systems as well as at possible constraints on learning responsible for any difficulty animals may find in selecting the right place for a given activity. Experimental investigations with farm species have shown that they are good at solving tasks requiring spatial memory. For example, Mendl et al.

Learning about what to eat It is not surprising that farm animal species have innate preferences for food over non-food items, a phenomenon that has been investigated extensively in poultry (Dawkins, 1968). Nevertheless, they do have to learn what they can eat in the environment in which they actually grow up (Hogan, 1973), and there is much experimental evidence in various species that food avoidance learning occurs when animals are given the experience of harmful feed (e.g. cattle: Kronberg et al., 1993; sheep: Burritt and Provenza, 1989; goats: Zahorik et al., 1990; poultry: Hale and Green, 1988); conversely, goats and sheep may learn to eat foods that have a medicinal effect (Rogosic et al., 2006; Villalba et al., 2006). Several studies with farm animals have shown that social learning may be important for feed acceptance. For example, Fukasawa et al. (1999) reported that calves who could eat a novel food in early ontogeny when housed together with their dam, who was familiar with that food, were more likely to feed on it 12 weeks later than calves without such a social experience.

Experiments in tightly controlled situations show that even the briefest delay between response and reinforcement can greatly slow learning (Grice, 1948). However, in simple operant situations of the sort likely to be encountered in agricultural practice, learning can still occur even with quite substantial response-reinforcer delays (Lattal and Gleeson, 1990; Wilkenfeld et al., 1992), and in any case the effects of response-reinforcer delay can usually be overcome by providing an immediate stimulus which has been pre-associated with food (Schlinger and Blakely, 1994). This ‘‘bridging’’ effect of a stimulus, which becomes a conditioned reinforcer, has been well understood from the time of Grice’s work, and one of the purposes of procedures such as clicker training is to provide it.

In our opinion, the cognitive skills of farm animals would allow them to solve evenmore sophisticated tasks to attain a given resource. To be used on practical farms, however, the tasks should ideally be designed B. Wechsler, S.E.G. Lea / Applied Animal Behaviour Science 108 (2007) 197–214208 such that there is no need for human assisted training, and laboratory experiments have shown that animals will learn simple operant tasks without human intervention (Lattal and Gleeson, 1990). Tasks should be based on the animals’ motivation to explore their housing system and to derive rules of behavioural responses to redundant patterns in their environment upon reinforcement. Given the fact that farm animals usually have plenty of time to explore and manipulate their environment, it is likely that they will sooner or later solve enrichment tasks by trial and error learning. For example, Smith et al. (1990) reported that caged laying hens developed three different methods of opening a door in order to lay in a dust bath and spent on average 34 min attempting to open the door bef</context>

(1987a) observed how sheep learned to eat wheat and reported that it took up to 14 days until a sheep began eating this feed. In this case too, sheep learned the new type of feed faster if they were grouped with conspecifics who were experienced in eating wheat (Chapple et al., 1987b). Another problem farm animals may face is that the food they are offered changes suddenly; this is often the case when animals are weaned or translated from rangeland to intensive housing for finishing, for example. Experimental evidence shows that there are several ways of promoting intake of a novel food. Launchbaugh et al. (1997) found that addition of a familiar flavour to a novel food may increase its acceptance. Lambs that were used to eating onion-flavoured barley ate more onion-flavoured rice than lambs that had previously eaten only unflavoured barley. Moreover, it may help animals to accept a novel food if it is provided in a familiar environment. Burritt and Provenza (1997) reported that lambs ate less of the novel feeds at an unfamiliar than at a familiar location suggesting that feed neophobia is greater in unfamiliar environments. Therefore, a simultaneous change of the environment and the feed should be av</context>

Furthermore, experimental studies analysing the behavioural organisation of farrowing sows provided evidence that the sows are highly motivated to have access to nest-building material on the day before farrowing (Arey, 1992) and are stressed if kept in crates and without straw during that period (Lawrence et al., 1994). As a consequence of these results, loose-house systems for farrowing sows have been developed (e.g. Cronin et al., 2000; Weber, 2000). In line with this example, it is generally agreed that farm animal welfare is at a high level when the animals can behave naturally, i.e. in the way their behaviour has been shaped by evolution in adaptation to the habitat of their ancestors, and thereby satisfy their behavioural needs (Fraser et al., 1997; Wechsler, 2007).

Secondly, animals may be reluctant to use a specific site within their housing system for a given behaviour because of negative experiences they made on previous use of that site. For example, dairy cows need ample space in front of the lying area in cubicles to make a head swing when standing up (Lidfors, 1989). If large cows are housed in stables with cubicles that are too short, the difficulty of standing up in these cubicles may result in cows lying in the alleys rather B. Wechsler, S.E.G.

Consequently, it is worth having a closer look at the learning processes leading to appropriate use of the housing systems as well as at possible constraints on learning responsible for any difficulty animals may find in selecting the right place for a given activity. Experimental investigations with farm species have shown that they are good at solving tasks requiring spatial memory. For example, Mendl et al. (1997) reported that pigs could remember the location of food across a 2-h retention interval. Edwards et al. (1996) and Dumont and Petit (1998) showed that sheep remembered the spatial location of patches in which they had found food 12 and 24 h previously, and Edwards et al. found that the sheep’s performance did not decline when the time between successive visits was increased to 72 h. Similarly, chicks accurately return to the geometric location of food 24 h after training (Tommasi and Vallortigara, 2000). Both chicks and grazing cattle may use long-term spatial memory to return to food location</context>

With chicks, Jones (1994) reported that regular gentle handling in early ontogeny reliably reduces the animals’ fear of humans. Moreover, he found that chicks habituated to one person through regular handling also exhibited reduced fear of other people wearing either similar or different types of clothing, thus showing stimulus generalisation.

Several studies with farm animals have shown that social learning may be important for feed acceptance. For example, Fukasawa et al. (1999) reported that calves who could eat a novel food in early ontogeny when housed together with their dam, who was familiar with that food, were more likely to feed on it 12 weeks later than calves without such a social experience. With weaned piglets, the presence of a piglet that is already experienced with eating solid food stimulates food intake of an inexperienced piglet (Morgan et al., 2001). It has also been found that an experimentally induced feed aversion my be overcome by social learning. For example, Ralphs and Olsen (1990) observed that averted heifers started to sample of the formerly avoided feed when paired with non-averted conspecifics, and the aversion was even extinguished in some animals. Similar results were obtained in a study with sheep (Thorhallsdottir et al., 1990). With fattening ruminants in intensive housing, it is typical that they have to learn to accept food they would not eat in their natural environment. For example, Chapple et al.

Similarly, the possibility of building up social relationships in early ontogeny may have a significant influence on the animals’ future learning ability, as it does in non-farm animals, such as rats (e.g. Morgan, 1973). The effects of environmental enrichment on brain development and cognitive abilities have been studied extensively in laboratory animals (e.g. Rosenzweig and Bennett, 1996; van Praag et al., 2000; Wurbel, 2001) and results achieved in these studies may also be relevant for farm animals. 3.3.

As discussed above, social learning occurs in farm animal species in a variety of situations, probably mainly in the form of local or stimulus enhancement. If possible, it may thus be preferable to introduce naıve animals to groups that are already familiar with a given housing system or equipment instead of composing groups in which all individuals lack experience. In line with this, Nicol (1995) suggested that few trained demonstrators could be added to newly established groups to facilitate habituation and correct use of equipment by naıve animals. 3.4.

Lea / Applied Animal Behaviour Science 108 (2007) 197–214206 In experimental psychology, a number of standard tests exists in which animals are confronted with defined experimental situations to measure their response to novel environments, from the traditional open field test introduced by Hall (1934) to more recently introduced procedures, such as the ‘‘strange situation’’ adapted from experiments with human children (Topal et al., 1998). The ways animals approach spatial or manipulative tasks and the cues they use have been investigated extensively (e.g. Jacobs and Schenk, 2003; Osthaus et al., 2005). Thus, the methods for such recording and analysis of behaviour can be found in the publications of this field of research. In applied animal behaviour science, standardised test situations, such as open field tests or novel object tests have also been used as a measure of fear or personality traits (e.g. Andersen et al., 2000; Thodberg et al., 1999). What is missing, however, are studies that focus in similar detail on the behaviour of individuals when they are confronted with a novel situation typical for farm animal husbandry, such as being introduced to a new housing system or having to l</context>

Similarly, Koba and Tanida (1999) observed that miniature pigs could differentiate between a handler who touched and fed them on approach and a non-handler in a familiar environment, though they had difficulty discriminating the two people in a new place. Sheep that were rewarded in the presence of a handler but not in the presence of a second handler also showed the ability to differentiate between individual humans (Davis et al., 1998). Rybarczyk et al. (2001) showed in formal experiments that cattle used both face and height information to discriminate between people, while Peirce et al. (2001) found in maze experiments that sheep could discriminate between human faces. Several studies have provided evidence that animals’ initial fear of humans can be overcome by regular handling. For example, Miura et al. (1996) observed that regularly handled weanling pigs showed significantly less aversion to a non-familiar human than did non-handled pigs. With chicks, Jones (1994) reported that regular gentle handling in early ontogeny reliably reduces the animals’ fear of humans. Moreover, he found that chicks habituated to one person through regular handling also exhibited reduced fear of othe</context>

Consequently, it may be useful to structure the housing system according to this preference with feeding and drinking equipment provided in brighter areas than perches. Dairy cows have a clear preference for lighted over unlighted passageways (Phillips and Morris, 2001) and it is important to take this into account in order to ensure that cows return willingly to the different resources of their housing system, such as the concentrate feeder or the milking parlour. 3.2. Previous experiences of animals Given that the behaviour of animals is modified by previous experience, taking such experience into account and, where possible, actively providing possibilities for new experiences is an important way of facilitating animals’ ability to adapt to new situations.

Learning about housing equipment Because of the development of the technology used in farm animal husbandry, animals have to learn more and more about housing equipment. For example, sows learn to feed from electronic feeding stations and dairy cows may have to get used to be milked in an automatic milking system. There are, however, only a few studies in which the process of adaptation to housing equipment has been monitored extensively. For example, Pojtner et al. (1984) described the adaptation of dairy cows to automatic feeders and Kashiwamura et al. (2001) reported how habituation was used to encourage dairy cows to enter the milking boxes of an automatic milking system. Evidence from experimental studies suggests that social learning may help animals to learn about housing equipment. In a study with heifers, Veissier (1993) found that the activity of a demonstrator would draw the attention of observers to stimuli involved in a task (pushing a panel to get food into a box) and hence enhance the learning of the task.

In order to encourage correct manipulation of feeders or drinkers it is usually helpful to spread some feed or sprinkle water in the vicinity of the equipment. Studies of natural foraging have shown that, when hungry or thirsty, animals will look for cues for food and water and, once they have found small quantities, typically modify their behaviour so that they stay in the vicinity (Smith, 1974), so long as the source is not experienced as being exhausted (Kamil, 1978). Of course, food may also be used to draw the attention of animals to a site for other reasons than feeding. Prescott et al. (1998) showed experimentally that food is significantly more rewarding than milking and likely to be a necessary incentive to attract cows to an automatic milking system. If an operant response is required to produce more food or water, for example, pressing on a bar to induce the delivery of food pellets or squeezing a nipple drinker to start a continuous flow of water, it is always recommended that the interval between the behaviour of the animal about to learn and the delivery of the resource should be as short as possible.

(1999) reported that calves who could eat a novel food in early ontogeny when housed together with their dam, who was familiar with that food, were more likely to feed on it 12 weeks later than calves without such a social experience. With weaned piglets, the presence of a piglet that is already experienced with eating solid food stimulates food intake of an inexperienced piglet (Morgan et al., 2001). It has also been found that an experimentally induced feed aversion my be overcome by social learning. For example, Ralphs and Olsen (1990) observed that averted heifers started to sample of the formerly avoided feed when paired with non-averted conspecifics, and the aversion was even extinguished in some animals. Similar results were obtained in a study with sheep (Thorhallsdottir et al., 1990). With fattening ruminants in intensive housing, it is typical that they have to learn to accept food they would not eat in their natural environment. For example, Chapple et al. (1987a) observed how sheep learned to eat wheat and reported that it took up to 14 days until a sheep began eating this feed. In this case too, sheep learned the </context>

At first sight, such a differentiation in the use of different areas of a housing system for different activities seems to be trivial. After all, the housing systems were designed to be used in a particular way, and activity and resting areas are labelled on the plans drawn by the architects. Animals, however, do not read architects’ plans. There is evidence that there are problems with fattening pigs fouling the pen floor (Randall et al., 1983; Aarnink et al., 1996), dairy cows lying down outside the cubicles (Kjaestad and Myren, 2001), and hens laying eggs outside the nest boxes (floor eggs) (Appleby et al., 1988; Cooper and Appleby, 1996). Consequently, it is worth having a closer look at the learning processes leading to appropriate use of the housing systems as well as at possible constraints on learning responsible for any difficulty animals may find in selecting the right place for a given activity. Experimental investigations with farm species have shown that they are good at solving tasks requiring spatial memory. For examp</context>

Furthermore, there have been many studies using operant conditioning techniques to measure farm animals’ motivation to work for a given resource (e.g. pigs: Matthews and Ladewig, 1994; poultry: Cooper and Appleby, 2003; cattle: Jensen et al., 2004), and a range of apparatus has been designed with farm species particularly in mind (Kilgour et al., 1991).

Nevertheless, they do have to learn what they can eat in the environment in which they actually grow up (Hogan, 1973), and there is much experimental evidence in various species that food avoidance learning occurs when animals are given the experience of harmful feed (e.g. cattle: Kronberg et al., 1993; sheep: Burritt and Provenza, 1989; goats: Zahorik et al., 1990; poultry: Hale and Green, 1988); conversely, goats and sheep may learn to eat foods that have a medicinal effect (Rogosic et al., 2006; Villalba et al., 2006).

Similarly, the possibility of building up social relationships in early ontogeny may have a significant influence on the animals’ future learning ability, as it does in non-farm animals, such as rats (e.g. Morgan, 1973). The effects of environmental enrichment on brain development and cognitive abilities have been studied extensively in laboratory animals (e.g. Rosenzweig and Bennett, 1996; van Praag et al., 2000; Wurbel, 2001) and results achieved in these studies may also be relevant for farm animals. 3.3.

For example, pigs prefer to show eliminative behaviour at sites that are wet and where they can have contact with pigs in a neighbouring pen (Mollet andWechsler, 1991; Hacker et al., 1994). However, if these environmental characteristics are not limited to a specific area of a pen but can be found at different sites within the pen the pigs will find it difficult to choose a specific site where all members of the group defecate. Similarly, sows due to farrow typically select as a nest site an area with straw bedding and solid walls separating it from neighbouring pens (Arey et al., 1992; Schmid, 1992). In pens where these cues are provided in a specific area supposed to be the nest site they will show eliminative behaviour away from that site. Schmid (1992, 1997) followed the process of selection of a dunging area both in sows due to farrow and in fattening pigs after introduction into new pens and observed that eliminative behaviour is more scattered over the whole pen floor on the 1st day than thereafter, showing that learning does take place. Secondly, animals may be reluctant to use a specific site within their housing system for a given behaviour because of negative experiences they m</context>

For example, for newborn piglets, cues of the sow, such as udder shape and temperature, are probably of much importance in terms of survival. It is thus not surprising that behavioural organisation is characterised by innate preferences regarding cues to which they will react, as exemplified by the preference of newborn piglets to approach and lie down close to soft and warm tissue (Welch and Baxter, 1986). Similarly, specific cues in the environment of newly hatched chicks are important for the development of sufficient eating behaviour to ensure their survival (Shreck et al., 1963). Such preferences can be used to facilitate farm animals’ learning about the housing system. For example, cows have a preference for a soft surface of the floor in the place they lie down (Herlin, 1997). Such information can be used to design cubicles that are well accepted as lying places. With poultry, Appleby and McRae (1986) showed that enclosure is an important stimulus in nest-site selection by laying hens, and Duncan and Kite (1989) found that hens opt for nests containing loose material that can be moulded by body and feet movements. As noted above, knowledge of such preferences is im</context>

In order to encourage correct manipulation of feeders or drinkers it is usually helpful to spread some feed or sprinkle water in the vicinity of the equipment. Studies of natural foraging have shown that, when hungry or thirsty, animals will look for cues for food and water and, once they have found small quantities, typically modify their behaviour so that they stay in the vicinity (Smith, 1974), so long as the source is not experienced as being exhausted (Kamil, 1978). Of course, food may also be used to draw the attention of animals to a site for other reasons than feeding. Prescott et al. (1998) showed experimentally that food is significantly more rewarding than milking and likely to be a necessary incentive to attract cows to an automatic milking system. If an operant response is required to produce more food or water, for example, pressing on a bar to induce the delivery of food pellets or squeezing a nipple drinker to start a continuous flow of water, it is always recommended </context>

Tasks should be based on the animals’ motivation to explore their housing system and to derive rules of behavioural responses to redundant patterns in their environment upon reinforcement. Given the fact that farm animals usually have plenty of time to explore and manipulate their environment, it is likely that they will sooner or later solve enrichment tasks by trial and error learning. For example, Smith et al. (1990) reported that caged laying hens developed three different methods of opening a door in order to lay in a dust bath and spent on average 34 min attempting to open the door before access was finally achieved. 5. Conclusion The ability of farm animals to adapt to and cope with their housing conditions is likely to be much influenced by learning processes. We therefore suggest that studies focusing on the initial phase after changes in the housing environment would be promising for both identifying and solving problems animals may face when exposed to such changes.

Laying hens that will be kept in aviary systems during the laying period should preferentially also be raised in aviary systems that allow them to use different vertical levels, thus enhancing their ability to cope with this housing system (Hane et al., 2000). Rearing farm animals in enriched rather than barren environments seems to be another promising approach for enhancing their learning ability and thus their ability to cope with challenges they will meet later in life. For example, Sneddon et al. (2000) found that growing pigs performed better in both an operant task which involved learning to push a panel for a reward and a maze test which involved spatial learning if they had been reared in an enriched environment, incorporating extra space and areas which contained peat and straw in a rack, compared to pigs from barren, intensive housing. Similarly, the possibility of building up social relationships in early ontogeny may have a significant influence on the animals’ future learning ability, as it does in non-farm animals, such as rats (e.g. Morgan, 1973).

With weaned piglets, the presence of a piglet that is already experienced with eating solid food stimulates food intake of an inexperienced piglet (Morgan et al., 2001). It has also been found that an experimentally induced feed aversion my be overcome by social learning. For example, Ralphs and Olsen (1990) observed that averted heifers started to sample of the formerly avoided feed when paired with non-averted conspecifics, and the aversion was even extinguished in some animals. Similar results were obtained in a study with sheep (Thorhallsdottir et al., 1990). With fattening ruminants in intensive housing, it is typical that they have to learn to accept food they would not eat in their natural environment. For example, Chapple et al. (1987a) observed how sheep learned to eat wheat and reported that it took up to 14 days until a sheep began eating this feed. In this case too, sheep learned the new type of feed faster if they were grouped with conspecifics who were experienced in eating wheat (Chapple et al., 1987b). Another problem farm animals may face is that the food they are offered changes suddenly; this is often the case when animals are wean</context>

(1996) and Dumont and Petit (1998) showed that sheep remembered the spatial location of patches in which they had found food 12 and 24 h previously, and Edwards et al. found that the sheep’s performance did not decline when the time between successive visits was increased to 72 h. Similarly, chicks accurately return to the geometric location of food 24 h after training (Tommasi and Vallortigara, 2000). Both chicks and grazing cattle may use long-term spatial memory to return to food locations (Zimmerman et al., 2003; Laca, 1998), and cattle can remember food locations accurately for at least 48 days (Ksiksi and Laca, 2002). Given this evidence, when farm animals do not use a given area of a housing system adequately, it is unlikely that this is because of any difficulty in remembering which site they had used previously to perform a given behaviour.

Furthermore, experimental studies analysing the behavioural organisation of farrowing sows provided evidence that the sows are highly motivated to have access to nest-building material on the day before farrowing (Arey, 1992) and are stressed if kept in crates and without straw during that period (Lawrence et al., 1994). As a consequence of these results, loose-house systems for farrowing sows have been developed (e.g. Cronin et al., 2000; Weber, 2000).

Innate preferences regarding relevant cues For an animal, not all aspects of its environment are equally relevant. For example, for newborn piglets, cues of the sow, such as udder shape and temperature, are probably of much importance in terms of survival. It is thus not surprising that behavioural organisation is characterised by innate preferences regarding cues to which they will react, as exemplified by the preference of newborn piglets to approach and lie down close to soft and warm tissue (Welch and Baxter, 1986). Similarly, specific cues in the environment of newly hatched chicks are important for the development of sufficient eating behaviour to ensure their survival (Shreck et al., 1963). Such preferences can be used to facilitate farm animals’ learning about the housing system. For example, cows have a preference for a soft surface of the floor in the place they lie down (Herlin, 1997). Such information can be used to design cubicles that are well accepted as lying places. With poultry, Appleby and McRae (1986) showed that enclosure is an important stimulus in nest-site selection by laying hens, a</context>

Experiments in tightly controlled situations show that even the briefest delay between response and reinforcement can greatly slow learning (Grice, 1948). However, in simple operant situations of the sort likely to be encountered in agricultural practice, learning can still occur even with quite substantial response-reinforcer delays (Lattal and Gleeson, 1990; Wilkenfeld et al., 1992), and in any case the effects of response-reinforcer delay can usually be overcome by providing an immediate stimulus which has been pre-associated with food (Schlinger and Blakely, 1994). This ‘‘bridging’’ effect of a stimulus, which becomes a conditioned reinforcer, has been well understood from the time of Grice’s work, and one of the purposes of procedures such as clicker training is to provide it. With farm animal equipment, there is pressure to make learning to operate equipment correctly as easy for the animals as possible.

With regard to animal welfare, studies into the exploratory behaviour of farm animals may also result in hypotheses concerning the development of redirected behaviour, such as feather pecking in laying hens (Huber-Eicher and Wechsler, 1998) or tail-biting in fattening pigs (Day et al., 2002). In the process of redirecting foraging behaviour from environmental structures to the body of a conspecific, i.e. learning to use an alternative substrate to perform such behaviour, exploration and emotionally rewarding aspects of learning are likely to be crucial (Wood-Gush and Vestergaard, 1989). 4.4. Learning abilities and enrichment tasks In recent years, farm animals have been increasingly used in experiments on animal cognition, such as discrimination learning (e.g. cattle: Rehkamper and Gorlach, 1997; pigs: Moustgaard et al., 2004; poultry: Lea et al., 2006), spatial learning (e.g. cattle: Bailey et al., 1989; pigs: Held et al., 2005; poultry: Regolin et al., 2005) and use of environmental cues for spatial learning (e.g. cattle: Howery et al., 2000; pigs: Croney et al., 2003; poultry: Ueda et al., 2005).

Motivation to show exploratory behaviour Exploratory behaviour is an important part of animal learning, and there is a theoretical discussion whether information gathering may be motivated per se or only in the context of other needs (Inglis, 2000). For example, animals will work for food even though identical food is easily accessible in a trough, a phenomenon called contrafreeloading. Inglis et al. (1997) argue that this may be based upon the advantage of gathering information for animals living in changing environments. Wood-Gush and Vestergaard (1991) investigated the reaction of piglets to novel objects and concluded that they seem to possess a high level of curiosity and show inquisitive exploration, defined as an animal acting so as to initiate a change in its environment rather than responding to a stimulus. Hagen and Broom (2004) reported that heifers subjected to a learning task had higher heart rates and tended to move more vigorously along the race on the way to their food reward if they had made clear improvements in learning, indicating that cattle may react emotionally to their own learning improvement.

Edwards et al. (1996) and Dumont and Petit (1998) showed that sheep remembered the spatial location of patches in which they had found food 12 and 24 h previously, and Edwards et al. found that the sheep’s performance did not decline when the time between successive visits was increased to 72 h. Similarly, chicks accurately return to the geometric location of food 24 h after training (Tommasi and Vallortigara, 2000). Both chicks and grazing cattle may use long-term spatial memory to return to food locations (Zimmerman et al., 2003; Laca, 1998), and cattle can remember food locations accurately for at least 48 days (Ksiksi and Laca, 2002). Given this evidence, when farm animals do not use a given area of a housing system adequately, it is unlikely that this is because of any difficulty in remembering which site they had used previously to perform a given behaviour. Rather, we have to suppose that the area where a given behaviour has been made possible by the design of the living quarters is, from the animal’s point of view, unsuitable in some way. Firstly, it is possible that the perceptual cues available are inadequate</context>
