There have been a large number of publications describing training technique, training terminology and various uses for training (Bloomsmith et al., 2007; Coleman and Maier, 2010; Kazdin, 2001; Laule and Whittaker, 2001, 2007; Ramirez, 1999; Schapiro et al., 2005). However, issues related to designing and initiating animal training programs have been less well described. Animal training programs are an important refinement in the care of laboratory primates as they can help to reduce stress experienced by animals and improve their research use by minimizing this confound.

There have been a large number of publications describing training technique, training terminology and various uses for training (Bloomsmith et al., 2007; Coleman and Maier, 2010; Kazdin, 2001; Laule and Whittaker, 2001, 2007; Ramirez, 1999; Schapiro et al., 2005). However, issues related to designing and initiating animal training programs have been less well described. Animal training programs are an important refinement in the care of laboratory primates as they can help to reduce stress experienced by animals and improve their research use by minimizing this confound.
