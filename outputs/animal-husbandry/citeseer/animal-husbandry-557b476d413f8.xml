				<p>Introduction: Air from animal feeding operations (AFOs) has been shown to transport numerous contaminants of public health concern. While federal statutes like the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) generally require that facilities report hazardous releases, AFOs have been exempted from most of these requirements by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We assessed the availability of information about AFO airborne hazardous releases following these exemptions.</p>

Finally, even when AFOs do report releases, public records requests may not assure timely access to EPCRA reports. For example, while most states responded to our requests in a timely manner, NC never responded substantively. To assure public access to reported information, emergency management committees should consider alternative methods for releasing EPCRA reports, such as publishing reports online upon their submission. Alternatives to EPCRA Despite the accumulating body of evidence linking residential proximity to AFOs and adverse health outcomes [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], little is known about the magnitude, temporality, and variability of community exposures to AFO hazardous releases. Even less is known about how the geographic clustering of these operations may impact air quality in agricultural communities. The development of regulations and other interventions to minimize harmful exposures would be enhanced through a clearer understanding of these processes and relationships. The first step toward characterization of the contribution of AFOs to rural community air quality would be the establishment of pollution monitors both at AFOs and in communities. Th</context>

The substances released by AFOs that are designated as hazardous under CERCLA [24] and/or extremely hazardous under EPCRA [25] include ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and multiple volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [26]. From 2001-2006, litigation by environmental advocates and, in two cases, the EPA confirmed that the reporting requirements of CERCLA Section 103 and EPCRA Section 304 applied to AFOs, resulting in penalties for multiple operations that released ammonia in excess of its RQ and did not report their releases [27].

For continuous releases, estimates of the quantity released must be reported in two ways: estimates of the upper and lower bounds on the quantity released over any 24-hour period during the previous year and an estimate of the total amount released during the same year [37,45]. The quantities of some AFO releases have been estimated by multiplying the number of animals of a particular species at an AFO by a constant “emissions factor” for a given substance, animal species, and time period (e.g., x lbs of ammonia per broiler chicken per 24 hours) [26]. Multiple forms available to AFOs were designed to record the species and number of animals at an AFO in addition to or in lieu of actual estimates of the quantity released, and we assessed availability of this information as well. The only required information regarding potentially exposed populations is the population density within a one-mile radius of the AFO and the identity and the location Figure 2.

It is also likely that many otherwise reportable releases were not reported due to the 2005 agreement and/or the 2008 rule. Under the rule, only Large CAFOs are required to report under EPCRA. Under the agreement, the EPA has agreed not to sue AFOs, including Large CAFOs, that participated in NAEMS for civil violations of this and other requirements. The 2005 agreement will expire following the finalization of EEMs by the EPA [30]. The 2008 rule is indefinite, although the EPA has suggested that it may be revised [49]. A withdrawal or revision of the 2008 rule could substantially increase the number of AFOs that report airborne hazardous releases. Any revision should be accompanied by enhanced enforcement of reporting requirements, as AFO compliance with environmental statutes may be limited [46].

The availability of information encompasses two elements: whether information was reported and whether reported information is accessible to the public. These elements in turn depend on multiple factors. Reporting factors are determined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency via rulemaking.

For continuous releases, estimates of the quantity released must be reported in two ways: estimates of the upper and lower bounds on the quantity released over any 24-hour period during the previous year and an estimate of the total amount released during the same year [37,45]. The quantities of some AFO releases have been estimated by multiplying the number of animals of a particular species at an AFO by a constant “emissions factor” for a given substance, animal species, and time period (e.g., x lbs of ammonia per broiler chicken per 24 hours) [26].

The included states contain large numbers of poultry, swine, and dairy cattle operations. A limitation of our study was that it did not include a major beef-cattle state. The requirement to obtain a CWA or analogous permit and AFO compliance with permitting requirements vary by state, and it has been estimated that a majority of AFOs are not permitted [46]. Unpermitted AFOs could not be included in our denominators, as these were based on state permitting databases. The denominators therefore are underestimates of the actual numbers of AFOs by state and, accordingly, our results are likely to be overestimates of the proportions of AFOs for which information was available. There is no comprehensive database of AFOs across multiple states, limiting the development of more accurate denominators.

A withdrawal or revision of the 2008 rule could substantially increase the number of AFOs that report airborne hazardous releases. Any revision should be accompanied by enhanced enforcement of reporting requirements, as AFO compliance with environmental statutes may be limited [46]. Additionally, although the accuracy of available information was not assessed in this study, it is notable that EPCRA Section 304 directs facilities to report estimates of the quantity released rather than measure releases directly. A study found that trends in estimates reported to the TRI under EPCRA Section 313 were not matched by trends in measurements taken by EPA pollution monitors, suggesting that reported estimates were inaccurate [50].

Information via EPCRA continuous release reporting As noted above, the concept of availability under EPCRA encompasses both whether information was reported to state and local emergency management committees and whether the reported information was accessible. We believe that the lack of availability observed was influenced more by a lack of reporting than by a lack of access, but a limitation of our study was that the method employed did not allow us to attribute the lack of availability to specific factors.

In contrast, two adjacent AFOs that release 50 lbs of ammonia per day are not required to report under either statute, although the resulting human exposure may be similar. Additionally, exposure that results from a single release of less than 100 lbs of ammonia per day may pose a health risk, depending on factors that influence human exposure and susceptibility. The RQ for a given substance is based on the intrinsic properties of that substance and not on projections of human exposure or resulting health risks [48], limiting the efficacy of the reporting requirements of EPCRA Section 304 for informing exposed communities about the risks posed by hazardous releases. It is also likely that many otherwise reportable releases were not reported due to the 2005 agreement and/or the 2008 rule. Under the rule, only Large CAFOs are required to report under EPCRA.

Development of the these process-based models, which incorporate data on chemical, biological and physical processes at play in AFOs, have been recommended by the EPA’s Science Advisory Board [51].
