Introduction: Air from animal feeding operations (AFOs) has been shown to transport numerous contaminants of
public health concern. While federal statutes like the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act
(EPCRA) generally require that facilities report hazardous releases, AFOs have been exempted from most of these
requirements by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We assessed the availability of information about
AFO airborne hazardous releases following these exemptions.
Methods: We submitted public records requests to 7 states overlapping with or adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay
watershed for reports of hazardous releases made by AFOs under EPCRA. From the records received, we
calculated the proportion of AFOs in each state for which ≥1 reports were available. We also determined the
availability of specific types of information required under EPCRA. The numbers of AFOs permitted under the Clean
Water Act (CWA) or analogous state laws, as determined from permitting databases obtained from states, were used
as denominators.
Results: We received both EPCRA reports and permitting databases from 4 of 7 states. Across these 4 states, the
mean proportion of AFOs for which ≥1 EPCRA reports were available was 15% (range: 2-33%). The mean
proportions of AFOs for which the name or identity of the substance released, ≥1 estimates of quantity released, and
information about nearby population density and sensitive populations were available were 15% (range: 2-33%), 8%
(range: 0-22%), and 14% (range: 2-8%), respectively.
Discussion: These results suggest that information about the airborne hazardous releases of a large majority of
AFOs is not available under federal law in the states that we investigated. While the results cannot be attributed to
specific factors by this method, attention to multiple factors, including revision of the EPA’s exemptions, may increase
the availability of information relevant to the health of populations living or working near AFOs.

Introduction
Agency (EPA) terms these facilities “animal feeding operations”
(AFOs) [4]. As defined by the Agency, AFOs are sites where
non-aquatic animals are confined for ≥45 days/year and where
crops or vegetation are not sustained or stored in the normal
growing season [4]. The largest AFOs are known as
“concentrated animal feeding operations” (CAFOs) and are
classified as such based on the number of animals on-site (the
number varies based on the type of animal) [4].
Research has shown that this model of food animal
production and associated methods of waste management can
contribute to compromised air quality [5,6]. Air within and
Industrial food animal production is the dominant model of
meat, poultry, dairy and egg production in the United States
[1,2]. The model typically involves housing thousands to
hundreds of thousands of animals in confinement at a single
site, and results in the accumulation of large quantities of
animal waste. Depending on the type of animal produced and
the waste management system utilized, waste may be stored
on-site for extended periods of time or piped into large cesspits
known as “lagoons” [3]. The U.S. Environmental Protection

Hazardous Releases from Animal Feeding Operations
committees once by telephone and once in writing within 30
days of the notification by telephone; subsequent releases that
are similar to the initial reported release are not reportable [37].
The 2005 agreement and the 2008 rule were both in effect
as of November 2013. The combined effect of the agreement
and the rule is that, of all AFOs, only Large CAFOs currently
are required to report under EPCRA and the EPA will not
enforce this requirement against Large CAFOs that are
participating in NAEMS. Large CAFOs that do report under
EPCRA use an abbreviated reporting format designed for
continuous releases. It is generally assumed that these
changes have limited the availability of information about AFO
hazardous releases [31,36], but this has not been confirmed.
The concept of availability encompasses both whether
information was reported by an AFO and whether the reported
information is accessible to the public. Both elements of
availability in turn depend on multiple factors (Figure 1).
CERCLA and EPCRA reporting reflect whether an AFO
releases a hazardous or extremely hazardous substance in
excess of its RQ, whether the release is exempt from reporting
under the 2008 rule, and whether the AFO complies with
applicable reporting requirements. Notably, amnesty from civil
prosecution under the 2005 agreement may influence AFO
compliance. If an AFO complies fully, the types of information
reported will vary with regulatory requirements; for example,
reporting continuous releases under EPCRA requires AFOs to
provide less information than does reporting other releases.
Availability also requires access to reported information, which
depends on proper receipt and storage of reports by
emergency management committees, as well as disclosure of
these reports in response to public records requests.
The purpose of this study was to assess availability of
information concerning airborne hazardous releases from
AFOs under EPCRA following the 2005 agreement and
promulgation of the 2008 rule. We determined the proportions
of AFOs for which ≥1 EPCRA reports were available and the
proportions of AFOs for which specific types of information
required under EPCRA regulations were available. We discuss
the feasibility of assessing human exposure to hazardous
releases using the information available under EPCRA and
options for assuring the availability of information needed to
assess exposure.
emanating from AFOs has been shown to transport numerous
contaminants of public health concern, including gases,
particulate matter, bacterial and viral pathogens, endotoxins,
and animal dander [7-13]. Epidemiologic investigations have
illustrated relationships between residential proximity to AFOs
and respiratory effects [14-16], mental health outcomes
[17-19], and other quality-of-life-related impacts [20,21].
Federal statutes generally require that facilities report
estimates of their emissions if these emissions exceed certain
rates. Section 103 of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) requires
facilities that release one or more “hazardous substances” in
excess of “reportable quantities” (RQs, expressed as rates in
pounds per day [lbs/day]) to immediately notify the National
Response Center, unless the release is permitted under
another federal statute [22]. Section 304 of the Emergency
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) similarly
requires facilities that release one or more “extremely
hazardous substances” in excess of RQs to immediately notify
state and local emergency management committees [23].
EPCRA requires these committees to make reports of
hazardous releases available to the public [23].
The substances released by AFOs that are designated as
hazardous under CERCLA [24] and/or extremely hazardous
under EPCRA [25] include ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and
multiple volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [26]. From
2001-2006, litigation by environmental advocates and, in two
cases, the EPA confirmed that the reporting requirements of
CERCLA Section 103 and EPCRA Section 304 applied to
AFOs, resulting in penalties for multiple operations that
released ammonia in excess of its RQ and did not report their
releases [27]. (Agricultural operations, including AFOs, are not
required to report to the Toxic Release Inventory established
by EPCRA Section 313 [28].) Industry trade associations and
some members of Congress subsequently proposed legislation
to exempt AFOs from these requirements and petitioned the
EPA to exempt AFOs by regulation [27,29]. The legislation was
not enacted; despite this, the agency subsequently exempted
most AFOs from the requirements of both statutes.
In 2005, the EPA and industry trade associations initiated the
National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS) to develop
emissions-estimating methodologies (EEMs) for AFO air
emissions [30,31]. More than 13,000 AFOs agreed to fund
NAEMS under a 2005 consent agreement with the agency. In
exchange, the EPA agreed not to sue participating AFOs for
civil violations of CERCLA and EPCRA reporting requirements
that occur before the EPA publishes final EEMs [32,33].. In
2008, the EPA finalized a rule that indefinitely exempted all
airborne hazardous releases from animal waste at farms
(including AFOs) from CERCLA reporting requirements [34-36].
The same rule also indefinitely exempted such releases from
all but Large CAFOs (the largest CAFOs, which in turn are the
largest AFOs) from EPCRA reporting requirements [34,35]. In
its preamble to the rule, the EPA also stated that reportable
releases by Large CAFOs generally qualify for reduced EPCRA
reporting requirements that were developed for reporting
continuous releases [34,36]. Under these requirements, Large
CAFOs must report releases to emergency management

We investigated the availability of information under EPCRA
Section 304 because this section contains the only requirement
under federal law (and therefore applicable across multiple
states) to report airborne hazardous releases that currently
applies to AFOs.
Between September 2010 and February 2012, we submitted
public records requests to the six states that overlap with the
Chesapeake Bay watershed (Delaware [DE], Maryland [MD],
New York [NY], Pennsylvania [PA], Virginia [VA], and West
Virginia [WV]) and North Carolina (NC) (Figure 2). The
requests sought reports submitted by AFOs under the 2008
rule, as described by an EPA document [38]. The Chesapeake
Bay watershed was chosen because the high density of AFOs

of information encompasses two elements: whether information was reported and whether reported information is accessible to the
public. These elements in turn depend on multiple factors. Reporting factors are determined by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency via rulemaking. Access factors are determined by the state and local emergency management committees that receive
reports under EPCRA.
doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0085342.g001
We then determined the proportion of AFOs in each state for
which ≥1 EPCRA reports were submitted to state or local
emergency management committees. For the numerators, we
used the number of AFOs in each state for which we received
≥1 forms. To develop denominators, we obtained databases of
AFOs permitted under the Clean Water Act (CWA) or similar
state laws (such as the Virginia Pollution Abatement Permit
Regulation and Pollutant Discharge Elimination Programs [44])
from states with active permitting programs. We divided the
numerator for each state by the number of permitted AFOs in
that state to obtain the proportion. Because permitting
databases only include permitted AFOs, denominators derived
from these databases likely are underestimates of the number
of AFOs in each state; consequentially, the proportions
calculated with these denominators likely are overestimates of
the true percentage of AFOs that have reported airborne
hazardous releases.
We then assessed availability of 6 types of information,
including the identity of the substance released, estimates of
the quantity released, and characteristics of potentially
exposed populations, as required by EPCRA regulations. The
identity of the substance released must be reported by its
chemical name and Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number
in this region has impacted environmental quality [39]. NC is
the second-largest swine producer in the U.S. [40], and was
included so that production of most major food animal types
(i.e., poultry, swine, and dairy cattle) was represented; NC was
chosen as the swine-producing state because it is contiguous
with the other states investigated.
Multiple forms are available to assist AFOs in reporting
continuous releases under EPCRA, including forms developed
by the EPA, state governments, and industry trade
associations [41-43]. AFOs may choose which forms to use for
their submissions. We developed a database of EPCRA forms
received in response to our requests. For each form, we
recorded the name of the AFO and the name of the AFO owner
or operator. Because some AFOs submitted multiple forms, we
matched the forms by the names of the AFO and/or AFO
owner or operator and consolidated records to create one
record per AFO. In some cases, releases from multiple AFOs
were reported jointly on a single form. From these forms, we
created separate records for each AFO. The end-result was a
database with one record per AFO for which ≥1 forms was
received. We recorded which forms were submitted by each

[37,45]. For continuous releases, estimates of the quantity
released must be reported in two ways: estimates of the upper
and lower bounds on the quantity released over any 24-hour
period during the previous year and an estimate of the total
amount released during the same year [37,45]. The quantities
of some AFO releases have been estimated by multiplying the
number of animals of a particular species at an AFO by a
constant “emissions factor” for a given substance, animal

an AFO in addition to or in lieu of actual estimates of the
quantity released, and we assessed availability of this
information as well. The only required information regarding

We received EPCRA reports from 5 of 7 states (see Table
1). NY reported that the requested records could not be found
and NC did not respond substantively to the request despite
our follow up by email and phone. The permitting databases
used to estimate the number of AFOs in each state were
obtained from every state except WV, which was still
developing its permitting program for AFOs and had not
permitted any AFOs as of June 2013. For the 4 states from

The mean proportion of AFOs for which the presence of

unsuccessful in obtaining EPCRA reports submitted in 2 states,

states. Across 4 other states, the mean proportion of AFOs for

Hazardous Releases from Animal Feeding Operations
investigated. The included states contain large numbers of
poultry, swine, and dairy cattle operations. A limitation of our
study was that it did not include a major beef-cattle state.
The requirement to obtain a CWA or analogous permit and
AFO compliance with permitting requirements vary by state,
and it has been estimated that a majority of AFOs are not
permitted [46]. Unpermitted AFOs could not be included in our
denominators, as these were based on state permitting
databases. The denominators therefore are underestimates of
the actual numbers of AFOs by state and, accordingly, our
results are likely to be overestimates of the proportions of
AFOs for which information was available. There is no
comprehensive database of AFOs across multiple states,
limiting the development of more accurate denominators. The
U.S. Government Accountability Office has recommended that
the EPA develop such a database [46]. In July 2012, however,
the agency withdrew a proposed rule that would have required
many AFOs to report their location and characteristics
regardless of whether they are required to obtain a CWA permit
[47].
EPCRA. Under the agreement, the EPA has agreed not to sue
AFOs, including Large CAFOs, that participated in NAEMS for
civil violations of this and other requirements. The 2005
agreement will expire following the finalization of EEMs by the
EPA [30]. The 2008 rule is indefinite, although the EPA has
suggested that it may be revised [49]. A withdrawal or revision
of the 2008 rule could substantially increase the number of
AFOs that report airborne hazardous releases. Any revision
should be accompanied by enhanced enforcement of reporting
requirements, as AFO compliance with environmental statutes
may be limited [46].
Additionally, although the accuracy of available information
was not assessed in this study, it is notable that EPCRA
Section 304 directs facilities to report estimates of the quantity
released rather than measure releases directly. A study found
that trends in estimates reported to the TRI under EPCRA
Section 313 were not matched by trends in measurements
taken by EPA pollution monitors, suggesting that reported
estimates were inaccurate [50]. This may mean that at least
some of the limited information available under EPCRA Section
304 is not accurate, which would limit its value.
Finally, even when AFOs do report releases, public records
requests may not assure timely access to EPCRA reports. For
example, while most states responded to our requests in a
timely manner, NC never responded substantively. To assure
public access to reported information, emergency management
committees should consider alternative methods for releasing
EPCRA reports, such as publishing reports online upon their
submission.
Information via EPCRA continuous release reporting
As noted above, the concept of availability under EPCRA
encompasses both whether information was reported to state
and local emergency management committees and whether
the reported information was accessible. We believe that the
lack of availability observed was influenced more by a lack of
reporting than by a lack of access, but a limitation of our study
was that the method employed did not allow us to attribute the
lack of availability to specific factors. Attention to the factors
that influence reporting and access (Figure 1), however, may
allow the EPA and emergency management committees to
increase availability of information relevant to the health of
populations that live or work near AFOs.
AFOs that do not release an extremely hazardous substance
in excess of the corresponding RQ are not required to report
under EPCRA. Information about AFO releases below RQs is
not currently available under federal law. Hazardous releases
below RQs may nevertheless pose a health risk to exposed
populations, either singularly or through cumulative exposure to
releases from multiple sources. For example, a single AFO that
releases ammonia at a rate of 100 lbs/day or more would be
required to report the release under CERCLA and EPCRA
unless exempted. In contrast, two adjacent AFOs that release
50 lbs of ammonia per day are not required to report under
either statute, although the resulting human exposure may be
similar. Additionally, exposure that results from a single release
of less than 100 lbs of ammonia per day may pose a health
risk, depending on factors that influence human exposure and
susceptibility. The RQ for a given substance is based on the
intrinsic properties of that substance and not on projections of
human exposure or resulting health risks [48], limiting the
efficacy of the reporting requirements of EPCRA Section 304
for informing exposed communities about the risks posed by
hazardous releases.
It is also likely that many otherwise reportable releases were
not reported due to the 2005 agreement and/or the 2008 rule.

Despite the accumulating body of evidence linking residential
proximity to AFOs and adverse health outcomes [14-21], little is
known about the magnitude, temporality, and variability of
community exposures to AFO hazardous releases. Even less is
known about how the geographic clustering of these operations
may impact air quality in agricultural communities. The
development of regulations and other interventions to minimize
harmful exposures would be enhanced through a clearer
understanding of these processes and relationships.
The first step toward characterization of the contribution of
AFOs to rural community air quality would be the establishment
of pollution monitors both at AFOs and in communities. These
data, paired with AFO-specific production characteristics and
information about atmospheric conditions, would allow for the
development of process-based models that facilitate geospatial
estimation of airborne concentrations of pollutants of AFO
origin. Development of the these process-based models, which
incorporate data on chemical, biological and physical
processes at play in AFOs, have been recommended by the
EPA’s Science Advisory Board [51]. Such information would
serve multiple purposes, allowing both for epidemiologic
investigations aimed at characterizing the community health
risks posed by AFOs and for examinations of the public health
benefits offered by interventions designed to mitigate risks.

that information on AFO hazardous releases is not available to
residents of affected communities. Lowering RQs, withdrawing
exemptions for AFOs, and improving public access to EPCRA
reports could increase availability within the existing statutory
framework. Ultimately, however, air monitoring at AFOs and in
surrounding communities will be needed to more robustly
characterize the public health impacts of AFO air pollution.
Despite literature associating AFOs with compromised air
quality and residential proximity to AFOs with adverse health
outcomes, availability of information concerning AFO airborne
hazardous releases ranged from limited to nonexistent across
the states that we examined. These data would be
complemented by a national spatially-referenced database of
AFO locations, which would provide supporting information
regarding the clustering of these operations in rural
communities. These data gaps compromise the ability of public
health officials and scientists to characterize exposures and
risks, and limit their ability to implement and evaluate
interventions when appropriate. The lack of data also means

For continuous releases, estimates of the quantity released must be reported in two ways: estimates of the upper and lower bounds on the quantity released over any 24-hour period during the previous year and an estimate of the total amount released during the same year [37,45]. The quantities of some AFO releases have been estimated by multiplying the number of animals of a particular species at an AFO by a constant “emissions factor” for a given substance, animal PLOS ONE |www.plosone.org species, and time period (e.g., x lbs of ammonia per broiler chicken per 24 hours) [26]. Multiple forms available to AFOs were designed to record the species and number of animals at an AFO in addition to or in lieu of actual estimates of the quantity released, and we assessed availability of this information as well.

The 2005 agreement and the 2008 rule were both in effect as of November 2013. The combined effect of the agreement and the rule is that, of all AFOs, only Large CAFOs currently are required to report under EPCRA and the EPA will not enforce this requirement against Large CAFOs that are participating in NAEMS. Large CAFOs that do report under EPCRA use an abbreviated reporting format designed for continuous releases. It is generally assumed that these changes have limited the availability of information about AFO hazardous releases [31,36], but this has not been confirmed. The concept of availability encompasses both whether information was reported by an AFO and whether the reported information is accessible to the public. Both elements of availability in turn depend on multiple factors (Figure 1). CERCLA and EPCRA reporting reflect whether an AFO releases a hazardous or extremely hazardous substance in excess of its RQ, whether the release is exempt from reporting under the 2008 rule, and whether the AFO complies with applicable reporting requirements.

We discuss the feasibility of assessing human exposure to hazardous releases using the information available under EPCRA and options for assuring the availability of information needed to assess exposure. emanating from AFOs has been shown to transport numerous contaminants of public health concern, including gases, particulate matter, bacterial and viral pathogens, endotoxins, and animal dander [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Epidemiologic investigations have illustrated relationships between residential proximity to AFOs and respiratory effects [14, 15, 16], mental health outcomes [17, 18, 19], and other quality-of-life-related impacts [20,21]. Federal statutes generally require that facilities report estimates of their emissions if these emissions exceed certain rates. Section 103 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) requires facilities that release one or more “hazardous substances” in excess of “reportable quantities” (RQs, expressed as rates in pounds per day </context>
