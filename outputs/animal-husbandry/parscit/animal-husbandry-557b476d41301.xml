Previous studies of system innovations mainly focused on historical cases that were driven by commercial motivations of pioneers and entrepreneurs. This article investigates a system innovation in the
making that is driven by normative concerns, such as sustainability or animal welfare, initially formulated by outsiders like special-interest groups. Our central research question is: How, when and why is
normative contestation of existing regimes effective in inﬂuencing the orientation of transitions in the
making?
The conceptual framework enriches innovation studies and the multi-level perspective with insights
from social movement theory (SMT) and political science. SMT is used to analyze the build up of normative pressure (through framing, resource mobilization, and political opportunity structures). From
political science we use the notion of multiple streams, in our analysis a problem, regulatory, market and
technology stream.
The research design consists of a comparative case study of pig husbandry systems. One case analyses
the sub-sector of pregnant sows where normative pressures, after several decades, led to the changes
advocated by the contestants. The second case concerns the sub-sector of pig fattening where normative
pressure was less successful.
The difference is partly explained by the normative pressure for pregnant sows being larger than for
fattening pigs. The other part of the explanation is that in the ﬁrst case normative pressure aligned better
with the three other streams (regulatory, market and technology) to lead to the changes desired by the
contestants.

This article explicitly introduces the topic of normative orientation into the debate about socio-technical transitions and system
innovation (Kemp et al., 1998; Elzen et al., 2004; Smith et al.,
2005). Many historical cases that have been studied by transition
scholars were driven by commercial motivations of pioneers and
entrepreneurs, e.g. cars replacing horses (Geels, 2005), mechanical
cargo handling machines replacing manual unloading of ships (Van
Driel and Schot, 2005), steamships replacing sailing ships (Geels,
2002), jet engines replacing piston engines (Geels, 2006a). While

normative and cultural changes were often implicated in these
transitions, these were not the main drivers.4 The issue of normative orientation therefore forms a new substantive contribution,
which has particular relevance for scholars who are interested in
transitions towards societal goals like sustainability (Elzen et al.,
2004). In particular, we are interested in transitions where the initial impulse for change consists of normative contestation from
regime outsiders (Van de Poel, 2000), such as social movements
or concerned researchers, who ﬁnd certain performance aspects
of existing socio-technological regimes normatively unacceptable
and in need of change. We call these ‘transitions in the making’,
not because we are able to foresee this will lead to a transition, but
because new developments are started that question some of the
basic assumptions in the existing regime which may (or may not)
eventually lead to a transition.

The topic of normative orientation is particularly difﬁcult for
transitions ‘in the making’, because multiple transition paths often
co-exist and are pursued simultaneously by different actors and
social groups (Stirling, 2009).5 Which possible path eventually
becomes dominant thus depends on interactions between multiple actors, moves and countermoves, strategic games, shifting
alliances, political support, economic success, technological learning processes and changing perceptions.
The article’s general research question is: How, when and why
is normative contestation of existing regimes effective in inﬂuencing the orientation of transitions in the making? By ‘effective
in inﬂuencing the orientation’ we mean that the developments
in the regime move in a direction that the contestants advocate.
We address this question in two steps. Firstly, we will enrich
the multi-level perspective, which provides a useful conceptualization of transitions, with insights from social movement theory
(SMT) and political science. We add SMT to conceptualize how outsiders such as animal welfare groups exert normative pressure on
existing regimes. From political science, we use Kingdon’s (1984)
multiple stream model to argue that normative pressure is more
likely to lead to regime change if alignments with other developments (in markets, regulations and technology) create a ‘package’
between problems and solutions that is attractive to various stakeholders.
Second, we investigate two case studies where normative pressures tried to destabilize an existing regime and call for alternatives
that might lead to a future transition. The two cases concern two
sub-sectors in pig husbandry in the Netherlands and the inﬂuence
from animal welfare concerns (1970–2008). We have chosen these
cases because animal welfare concerns are entirely about normative considerations in contrast to negative externalities that affect
people or sectors. They differ from concerns over pig manure, which
caused functional problems of water pollution, stench, ammonia
emissions and acid rain that hindered water companies, local residents and urbanites.
Deﬁning socio-technological regimes as rules and routines (Rip
and Kemp, 1998), in tandem with technological artefacts in practice, the two comparative cases are about technical changes in
pig husbandry systems (e.g. automatic feeding systems, manure
removal systems, and ﬂoor design), certain changes in husbandry
routines (e.g. feeding routines) and market changes. The regime
reconﬁgurations in both cases are still ‘in the making’, although
one case has progressed substantially while the other has not. We
will use our conceptual additions to explain this difference.
In Section 2, we provide a conceptualization of the relevant processes and mechanisms in normatively oriented transitions in the
making. Section 3 discusses the data sources of our comparative
case study and historical pre-developments that set the scene. Subsequently we analyze and compare two cases that form sub-sectors
within pig husbandry: sow breeding and pig fattening. Section
4 describes the ﬁrst case (sow breeding), where animal welfare
pressure led to the large-scale introduction of new, group housing
systems. Section 5 describes the second case (pig fattening), where
the contestants were less successful. Three innovation projects
(Hercules, Comfort Class, and Canadian Bedding) that constitute
alternative paths for transitions in the making did not progress
much in terms of wider diffusion. The discussion and analysis in
Section 6 explains the difference in outcomes with the conceptual perspective. The article ends in Section 7 with conclusions and
suggestions for further research.

2. Conceptual perspective
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997819489795918">
In this section we will present our conceptual framework for
analysing the inﬂuence of normative contestation on the orientation of transitions in the making. As there are no existing conceptual
frameworks that address the relation between normative contestation and innovation we will combine some existing approaches to
tackle our research question. We take the multi-level perspective
as a starting point (Section 2.1) and enrich this with insights from
social movement theory (Section 2.2) and political science (Section
2.3).
2.1. The multi-level dynamic
The multi-level perspective (MLP) distinguishes three analytical
levels (Rip and Kemp, 1998; Geels, 2002; Geels and Schot, 2007).
Niches are seen as the locus for learning and experimentation with
radical innovation. The socio-technical regime refers to the semicoherent set of rules and actors that reproduce, maintain and incrementally change elements that together fulﬁl a societal function
such as transport or meat production and consumption. The regime
is characterized by stability and path dependence because of lockin mechanisms on various dimensions (e.g. costs, shared beliefs,
sunk investments, capabilities, user preferences and life styles).
The socio-technical landscape is an exogenous environment that
inﬂuences niche and regime developments. The MLP proposes that
transitions, which are deﬁned as regime shifts, come about through
interacting processes within and between these levels. Transitions
do not come about easily, because existing regimes are oriented
towards stability and incremental innovation along predictable trajectories. Radical innovations emerge in niches, where dedicated
actors engage in innovation projects to create ‘conﬁgurations that
work’ (Rip and Kemp, 1998). Wider diffusion of niche-innovations
depends on internal dynamics and on windows of opportunity at
the regime level, which may arise from external landscape developments or from normative pressures, as we will show in this article.
We propose a speciﬁc operationalization of the socio-technical
regime concept to accommodate our empirical focus on pig farmers
and the animal husbandry systems they operate in. While pig farmers are our focal group, we use an embeddedness approach (Dacin
et al., 1999) to capture the relations with various other actors such
as slaughterhouses, supermarkets, consumers, technology suppliers, research institutes and universities, social movements such as
the Animal Protection Society, public opinion, and policy. To further conceptualize these relations, we suggest that enterprises such
as pig farms operate simultaneously in two environments (Oliver,
1997): (1) a task environment which includes social groups that
engage in economic exchanges and transactions with industries
(e.g. consumers, suppliers); economic competitiveness, efﬁciency,
and ﬁnancial performance are dominant selection criteria, and
(2) an institutional environment which contains social groups
that affect industries in non-commercial ways, e.g. policy makers,
social movements, the wider public, media, public opinion; regulatory legitimacy and cultural-normative legitimacy are the main
selection criteria (Suchman, 1995). Fig. 1 links the MLP to this conceptualization of socio-technical regimes for pig farming.
This operationalization of the MLP enables us to address the
question of normative orientation by investigating how initial normative pressure from the institutional environment, in particular
from social movements and public opinion, inﬂuences policy and
the task environment (consumer preferences, market demand,
etc.). It also helps us study how normative pressure inﬂuences
the various niche-innovations that may help transform the incumbent regime. It thus helps us answer our research question, i.e. to
analyze the effectiveness of normative contestation in inﬂuencing
transitions in the making.

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.969904057142857">
To conceptualize normative pressure we mobilize insights from
social movement theory. SMT is useful for our research question,
because it generally deals with conﬂicts between established orders
and groups that aim to correct some perceived injustice. Because
SMT traditionally focused on the labour movement, the civil rights
movement, suffragettes, etc., much of the work has a political focus.
Recent work by technology-oriented scholars, however, shows that
SMT can be usefully applied to technological innovations and industries as well (Lounsbury et al., 2003; Hess, 2005; Smith, 2005).
The existing literature suggests that the following three processes
from the social movement literature are particularly relevant to
understand how movements create normative pressure on existing
political regimes: (1) resource mobilization, (2) framing processes,
and (3) political opportunity structures (McAdam et al., 1996; Davis
et al., 2005).
(1) The mobilization of resources is important for internal development of a social movement and for external inﬂuence on
other actors (e.g. public opinion, policy makers). Important
resources are: money, members, internal and external networks, expertise, credibility, respectability, and contacts. If
social movements mobilize more resources, their (normative)
appeals gather strength (McCarthy and Zald, 1977).
(2) Framing processes are important ways through which social
movements aim to inﬂuence public opinion and the discourses
by which issues are discussed (Hajer, 1995). Issues or problems
do not have meaning by themselves. Instead, meaning arises
from the frames into which issues are placed, i.e. the “schemata
of interpretation” that enable actors “to locate, perceive, identify and label” (Goffman, 1974, p. 21) them. ‘Framing’ thus is a
process through which actors deﬁne problems, attribute causality and responsibility, and generally inﬂuence the meaning of
issues or problems. Framing is consequential because collective constructions of reality make certain actions and response
strategies more (or less) likely. Social movements frame problems in ways to enhance their salience and appeal to wider
publics. This way they aim to shape the cognitive space in
which issues are debated (Eyerman and Jamison, 1991) and
inﬂuence public opinion, which then exerts credibility pressure on policy makers. Building on Benford and Snow (2000),
we propose that the strength or mobilization potential of collective frames is inﬂuenced by: (a) their focus (addressing too
many issues dilutes the strength), (b) their empirical credibility
(perceived ﬁt with ongoing events around the issue), (c) their
cultural resonance (ﬁt with broader repertoires and discourses),
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978321333333333">
(d) their emotional-normative appeal (often through images,
metaphors, etc.).
(3) Political opportunity structures (e.g. the strength of the state

<bodyText confidence="0.96571125">
vis-à-vis civil society, the constellation of political parties in
power, the structure of the political agenda, etc.) inﬂuence
the chances for social movements to be effective in bringing
about political change. Elections, shifts in political coalitions
and the rise of new political parties may create a more (or
less) favourable political opportunity structure. While social
movement theory traditionally has a political focus, the broader
implication of this third point is that it emphasises structural opportunities, while the previous two points place more
emphasis on social movement agency. Because we address
a broader topic (socio-technical regimes) rather than traditional social movement theory, we need to distinguish broader
kinds of opportunity structures. We will address this in Section
2.3 where we discuss alignments between normative pressure
with other socio-technical developments.
The normative pressure on regimes increases if these three
sub-processes grow stronger. This increase depends on (changing) circumstances and events. Major shocks or accidents, for
instance, can push an issue higher on the agenda and strengthen
the empirical credibility of particular discourses. Issues also compete for public attention with other problems (Hilgartner and Bosk,
1988) and often experience issue-attention cycles (McComas and
Shanahan, 1999; Brossard et al., 2004) with problems rising and
falling on public agendas as media and audiences get bored and
search for new issues. Increases in normative pressure are likely
to have more effect on transitions if they coincide with and can
become linked to other developments, leading to a particular ‘package’ (Kingdon, 1984) that can be pushed through. We turn to these
alignments now.

Normative pressure, even when it is increasing, cannot bring
about substantial regime change on its own. We argue that such
regime changes require alignments of normative pressure with
other socio-technical developments in Fig. 1, e.g. regulations,
consumer demand, or market pressure from supermarkets, nicheinnovations, etc. While social movements may try to inﬂuence the
developments in other domains (market, technology/innovation,

regulation), these domains also have their own dynamics. From the
perspective of social movements, these changes in other domains
thus form ‘opportunity structures’, to which normative pressures
can (or cannot) be linked. To further operationalize this alignment,
we mobilize some insights from political science, in particular
Kingdon (1984), and adapt these for our research question.
Kingdon criticized the linear view on policy making, and instead
argued that major policy changes come about through alignments
of three streams that have relatively independent dynamics: problem stream, politics stream, and policy/solution stream. Although
his multiple stream model has much to offer for understanding
political decision making, his focus on policy is somewhat too narrow for our research topic. We therefore adapt some of Kingdon’s
ideas and propose a broader view on streams, distinguishing four
of them. The ﬁrst stream follows from our interest in normative
contestation, the second and third stream are based on the two
‘environments’ in Fig. 1, and the fourth is relevant because of our
focus on innovation. These streams are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.931296166666667">
1. Problem stream. In our case articulated as the normative orientation in the pressure by social movements.
2. Regulatory and political stream. Since we focus on innovation
and socio-technical regimes, rather than policy per se, we have
merged the policy and politics stream from Kingdon’s model.
3. Market stream. The dynamics in the system can be affected by
consumer preferences (households or businesses). If normative
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.967132266666667">
concerns and cultural discourses lead to changes in consumer
preferences, then normatively oriented transitions become more
likely. But while citizens may publicly express concerns about
normative problems, such as animal welfare, they often buy
the cheapest products as consumers (Te Velde et al., 2002).
Social movements therefore tend to target supermarkets which
are often more sensitive to legitimacy and reputation effects.
Because supermarkets are important players in the meat chain,
changes in their policies may have substantial effects on pig
farming practices.
4. Technology stream. This generates potential technical solutions
through R&amp;D activities and innovation projects. Mainstream
researchers with close ties to the regime tend to generate
incremental innovations, while researchers that deviate from
established regime rules tend to focus on more radical innovations. The latter are what Van de Poel (2000) calls outside
professionals, who tend to operate at the niche level in the MLP.6
These streams have their own dynamics, but also partially
interact. Building on Kingdon, we suggest that the chances
for normatively-oriented transitions greatly increase if various
streams can be combined into a coherent ‘package’. Despite his policy focus, Kingdon (1984: 21) articulates this dynamic eloquently:
“The separate streams come together at certain critical times,
solutions become joined to problems, and both of them are
joined to favourable political forces. This coupling is most likely
when policy windows (opportunities for pushing pet proposals or conceptions of problems) are open. (. . .) Windows are
opened either by the appearance of compelling problems or by
happenings in the political stream. (. . .) Signiﬁcant movement
is much more likely if problems, policy proposals, and politics
are all coupled into a package” (Kingdon, 1984: 21).
Windows of opportunity may open up because of crises and
disasters (which can act as events that focus public opinion and

industrial animal husbandry systems. Some researchers, however, began to develop
alternative husbandry systems which paid more attention to animal welfare.
push problems onto political agendas), elections, national mood
swings, the appearance of new political parties, or technological
breakthroughs. But windows also close again and problems that
may have risen on the agenda because of social movement activities and normative pressures, can also fall down again if they cannot
be linked to a technological solution. Kingdon (1984: 210) suggests
that (policy) windows may be missed if proposals and solutions
“have not already gone through the long gestation process before
the window opens”.
In contrast to Kingdon, who suggests that the four streams
are independent (he only sees somewhat free ﬂoating policy
entrepreneurs as bringing about linkages), we believe that actors
in problem and technical solution streams may actively work on
bringing about alignments and linkages. Zahariadis (1999) made
a similar criticism. Social movements, such as the Animal Protection Society, may actively support innovation projects that aim to
address problems. And researchers, designers, and ﬁrms who are
engaged in innovation projects, follow and anticipate what happens
in civil society, markets and regulations. Innovators are ‘heterogeneous engineers’ (Law, 1987) who work not only on inanimate
physical materials, but also incorporate economic, political, and
social dimensions in the speciﬁcation of their design criteria and
goals for innovation projects. Within innovation projects, actors
can thus deliberately work on creating a ‘package’
With these conceptual additions, and the combinations between
social movement theory, political science and innovation studies,
we have developed a perspective that is particularly tailored to
the issue of normative orientation in socio-technical transitions.
This perspective builds on the MLP, but pays more detailed attention to the roles of civil society actors and policy makers, who play
an important role in normative transitions, and their interactions
with innovation processes and market dynamics. We will use this
framework to answer our research question on the inﬂuence of normative contestation on transitions in the making by applying it in
a comparative case study in the following sections.
3. Data sources and introduction to the case studies
We analyze and compare two cases that form sub-sectors within
pig husbandry: sow breeding and pig fattening. Both sub-sectors
are characterized by mechanization, specialization, rationalization
and economies of scale, which form overarching guiding principles and routines. But they are also different: socially they consist
of different networks, with some farmers specializing in breeding and others in fattening; in terms of technological knowledge
and routines, sow breeding draws on artiﬁcial insemination, breeding research, artiﬁcial heating, antibiotics and nurturing, while pig
fattening draws on physiological research, food uptake and conversion rates, designer foods, rapid growth and mass production. They
also operate on different markets (Geels, 2009). If we are precise,
we need to call them sub-regimes since there are also clear links,
e.g. with the sows sub-regime providing piglets that are the starting ‘material’ for the fattening pigs sub-regime. For the purpose of
our analysis, however, these relations play no role and therefore
we can treat them as two separate regimes, i.e. as two separate
cases.
The case studies are based on various technical and economic
reports from research institutes, sector organizations and the Ministry of Agriculture.7 These data sources were supplemented with
eight semi-structured interviews, especially to explore the reasons

The full name initially was Ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management and
Fisheries. Later it became Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, allowing
continued use of the same Dutch acronym: LNV. In this article we will refer to it
simply as the Ministry of Agriculture.

behind various developments described in the reports. These interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. We interviewed
representatives from the farmers association (LTO), slaughtering
industry (Vion), Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Protection Society
and researchers who have been involved in various developments
described. In the case description these are referred to by giving
the interviewee’s organizational background. To receive feedback
to our initial ﬁndings we organized a workshop with sector representatives and agricultural scientists from different disciplines.
Before we dive into the case, we give a broad sketch of the development of pig farming in the Netherlands after the Second World
War. Fig. 2 illustrates that the number of pigs expanded rapidly to a
total of 14 million in 1990. After the year 2000, the number slightly
decreased to about 11.5 million in the years 2005–2007 (De Bont
and Van der Knijff, 2007, p. 50). In 2004, about 56% of all pigs were
exported (Central Bureau of Statistics: http://www.cbs.nl). Most of
these pigs were slaughtered by the Dutch slaughtering industry
where a concentration took place in the early 2000s. This led to the
establishment of the Vion group that held two thirds of the Dutch
market by 2007 and became the largest in Europe.
The growth in pig farming, which turned into an economically
ﬂourishing sector, was accompanied by a shift towards industrial
animal production systems that were based on guiding principles such as mechanization, specialization, rationalization and
economies of scale. During this shift, pig farming developed into an
integrated chain with strong ties between animal food providers,
pig farmers, slaughterhouses, supermarkets, and consumers (Geels,
2009). Pig farming itself transformed into a factory-like mass production system, with farms of increasing size. The average number
of pigs per farm increased from 25 in 1960 to 1300 in 2006 (Table 1).
The scale increase in pigs per farm was accompanied by a decrease
in the number of farms, from about 120,000 in 1960 to 9040 in
2006, a 92% drop.
Sectoral evolution is characterized by a struggle for survival,
with cost-competition driving further scale increases. Consumers
and supermarkets contribute to the strong cost focus in the sector.
For supermarkets, meat fulﬁls the role of trafﬁc generator: advertised at low prices, meat should seduce customers to enter their
shops, assuming they will also buy other products with larger proﬁt
margins (Hoste et al., 2004, pp. 7–8). This practice creates strong
backward pressure from supermarkets to farmers to produce meat
as cheaply as possible.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.990367">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.982640962962963">
Scale increase was accompanied by specialization that resulted
in two sub-sectors in pig farming: (1) fattening and meat production and (2) breeding, which focuses on sows and piglets. While
the Dutch fattening sector was always export oriented, the breeding sector has also become an international player during the past
few decades, growing from virtually no exports in the mid-1980s
to an annual export of 4.5 million and 5 million piglets in 2006 and
2007, respectively (Bolhuis and Wisman, 2008).
Pigs to be fattened (or porkers) were kept in groups of about a
dozen in units separated from each other by metal fences with an
average ﬂoor space of 0.7 m2 per pig until 1998. The ﬂoors were
typically made of slatted concrete on which the pigs urinated and
defecated. By walking around, the pigs pressed the faeces through
the slits to be collected in cellars underneath. This made the ﬂoors
very slippery causing many claw problems. Furthermore, the pigs
experienced boredom in the small conﬁnements making them bite
the tails of neighbours, resulting in wounds and infection. To reduce
this problem, tails were often cut off and teeth commonly clipped.
Pregnant sows were kept differently because of their eating
habits. While pigs generally continue to grow when eating more,
mature sows do not grow larger but get fatter. This was prevented by giving them limited rations, made possible by keeping
them individually, sometimes in boxes separated from each other.
Another option were semi-open pigsties with fences between the
animals in which they were tethered to the ﬂoor with either a chain
or a belt ﬁxed around the shoulder.
Since the early 1970s, the shift to industrial mass production
methods in pig farming has been accompanied by criticism from
special-interest groups that represented new societal values such
as animal welfare and the environment. In 1972, the opening of a
model pig farm (de Flevohof), intended as the pride of the livestock
sector to inform the public about progress in animal husbandry,
invoked strong protest against industrialized living conditions of
pigs and gave rise to the creation of an action group ‘Sweet Animal’
(‘Lekker Dier’). The same year, the Foundation for Nature and Environment published a critical report called Bio Industry that warned
that pigs were no longer seen as living creatures but as resources
and input materials for industrial processes. The term ‘bio industry’
was coined deliberately to frame the damaging effects of industrial methods on farming. The report also drew attention to stench
problems, pollution of water and soil from manure surpluses, and
damage to the natural landscape (Crijns, 1998).
The Animal Protection Society (APS; ‘Dierenbescherming’), a
respectable NGO established in 1864 with over 200,000 members
and 70 staff members in the early 2000s, (APS website) also saw
industrial animal husbandry as a step backward for animal welfare
and favoured keeping animals according to organic principles. In
the 1970s, organic pig farming constituted a small market niche
of about 1%, carried by small subsection of ‘moral consumers’ who
were willing to pay about 30–40% more for organically produced
pork. This meat came from animals that were kept in a more ‘natural’ environment, had room to play and could exhibit their natural
behaviour. This organic niche slowly expanded to about 2% in the
early 2000s.
Initially, pig farmers downplayed and ignored animal welfare
concerns. In the late 1990s, however, the sub-sector of pregnant
sows, which initially kept sows in individual boxes, began moving
to group husbandry systems, which entailed the adoption of new

technical feeding systems and new farming routines. National and
EU regulations reinforced this shift, mandating that this transformation should be completed for the whole subsector by 2013. In
contrast, changes in the fattening pigs sub-sector have been less
substantial, consisting mainly of regulatory changes that specify
somewhat more space for pigs (from 0.7 m2 to 0.8 m2 in the early
2000s) and some other provisions. These limited changes were
not for lack of efforts, because researchers, technology ﬁrms and
outsiders developed a variety of alternative paths, including new
husbandry systems under the names of Hercules, Pigs in Comfort
Class and Canadian Bedding. We will use these contrasting development paths and outcomes for a comparative case study that
illustrates the inﬂuence of normative pressure on the orientation
of transitions in the making. We ﬁrst describe the sows case (Section 4) and then turn to fattening pigs (Section 5). The main results
of the two cases in terms of alignment of the various ‘streams’
distinguished in Section 2 (normative, regulatory, technology and
market) are summarised in Tables 2 and 3 in Section 6.

4. Animal welfare and innovations in pregnant sow
husbandry systems
4.1. Rising expectations on group housing (1980–1990)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988957284615384">
In 1973, the Ministry of Agriculture established a commission
“Animal husbandry – animal welfare” to investigate how pregnant sows were kept. In 1975, the committee published a report
that concluded that sow husbandry had some weaknesses, which
could be remedied with various technical means (NRLO, 1975). In
practice, however, little changed in the following years.
The debate intensiﬁed in the early 1980s. In 1982 the APS
released a study that was very critical of sow husbandry, focussing
on chained sows stating: “The short chain only allows the sow to
stand op or lie down. Turning around or walking a few steps is out of
the question” (Dierenbescherming, 1982, p. 7). The study concluded
that the way sows were kept in the Netherlands was ‘completely
unacceptable’ (p. 41). With various campaigns, the APS tried to generate public awareness. To this end they framed the problem using
the catchy term ‘chain sow’ for the pregnant sows that were tethered to the ﬂoor. This term and the accompanying images struck
an emotional chord in public opinion which felt that these animals
deserved better treatment (Fig. 3; Interview APS).
Shortly after the release of the APS report, the Ministry of Agriculture set up a new commission for pig welfare issues. Its 1984
Fig. 3. ‘Chain-sow’ (Dierenbescherming, 1982, p. 26).
report was quite critical on sow husbandry (Commissie Welzijn
Varkens, 1984). The APS started discussions with the ministry and
the pig industry on how to proceed. In 1986, they came to a joint
agreement that individual housing of sows should become forbidden as soon as ‘acceptable systems for group housing would be
available’ (Dierenbescherming, 1999, p. 21).
To realise this, the ministry started working on future legislation
(Werkgroep, 1988). Furthermore, all research into housing of sows
was integrated in a national programme. In the period 1987–1990
a research project was carried out at the Research Institute for
Pig Husbandry at Rosmalen, comparing individual systems with a
group housing system. For the latter, the main innovation needed
would be a system to feed the sows individually. Such a system
already existed for cows and was adapted for pregnant sows. The
initial design consisted of an open space where the sows were
kept in groups that was connected to an electronic sow feeding
station with individual boxes via access gates where each pig was
fed a speciﬁc ration. After feeding, the sow would have to step out
to the shared space and the next one could enter to be fed. Various
changes were made to the feeding station in the course of the
project (Bokma, 1990).
During the same period, triggered by the public and political
discussion, several pig farmers agreed that individual sow housing
was not very friendly to the animal. In the late 1980s, in parallel
to the research programme, some of them started to convert their
pigsty to a Rosmalen-like system. Their numbers grew at a modest
rate until a total of several hundred, some 5% of the total, by 1990
(Interview animal researcher).
4.2. Stagnation and decline (1990–1997)
Gradually it became clear, however, both in research and practice, that group housing had serious problems. The reason was that
the basic design was copied from the cattle sector, without taking
into account that pigs behave differently from cows. While cows
tend to wait their turn to be fed, sows are prepared to ﬁght for
more food and eat as much as they can. If one sow was eating, for
instance, a stronger sister might bite her in the rear to chase her
away to start eating a second ration.
In the early 1990s, many pig-farmers, who had moved to group
housing, shifted back to the individual system. About half of them,
however, stuck to group housing. These pig farmers had developed speciﬁc farming skills for successfully keeping pigs in groups
(Interview animal researcher).
Scientists at the Rosmalen research institute continued to investigate group housing systems. The fact that some 2% of the farmers
had no serious problem with the group housing suggested that the
system could work despite its bad image. APS and the scientists also
referred to the UK where group-housing was more widely applied
and where a new bill would enforce it by the end of the decade.
In the early 1990s, the scientists occasionally interacted with the
ministry and the APS on research ﬁndings and on shaping further
research. By 1996 they had developed and tested a second generation of group housing systems. They concluded that group housing
was now ready for practical use but that it would require new
managerial skills and competencies from the pig farmer (Backus,
1997).
The sector and the ministry, however, showed little interest.
At the time, there was much more societal concern for disposal
of manure and emissions from the bio industry than animal welfare which was rather low on the political and societal agenda
(Interview animal researcher). Thus, in terms of our conceptual vocabulary, the political opportunity structure that had been
favourable to group housing in the late 1980s, had disappeared in
the mid 1990s.
B. Elzen et al. / Research Policy 40 (2011) 263–275
According to one involved researcher it was almost taboo to
talk about group housing in the mid 1990s. In his view this was
due to a surplus of eagerness to move to group housing in the
1980s, pushed by certain pig farmers and the ministry. They used
crude concepts adapted from the cattle sector and then found these
did not work very well. This eventually led to sector-wide hostility
towards group housing of pregnant sows in general which was difﬁcult to counter with results from further research, no matter how
hard the scientist tried to show that the second-generation system
worked well (Interview LTO).
4.3. Swine-fever: the aftermath of an external shock (1997–2007)
After 4 February 1997, the political opportunity structure turned
completely due to an external shock. The trigger was an outbreak
of swine-fever that spread rapidly. On numerous pig farms, all pigs
were killed and cranes were used to load dead pigs onto huge
trucks to take them to destroyers. These scenes were broadcasted
widely on Dutch television and stimulated a lively societal debate.
In total, over 11 million pigs were killed including almost 3 million 3–17 day old piglets (Ministry of Agriculture data, cited in
Dierenbescherming, 1999, 47). Many, including politicians as well
as the public, felt something really had to change in pig husbandry.
Within a few months, new legislation was drafted that would
make group-housing compulsory in ten years, i.e. in 2008. The sector protested heavily but did not stand a chance against the societal
and political pressure and determination. LTO, the sector representative, realised that it made no sense to ﬁght this change further
and that it had to ﬁnd ways to inform farmers on how to make
a smooth transition. They organised meetings with pig-farmers
throughout the country at which the Rosmalen researchers were
often invited to inform the attendees of their ﬁndings. The unrest
lasted about half a year and then gradually disappeared (Interview
animal researcher).
Market forces also played a role in the change towards group
housing. The crucial economic factor was the export of Dutch pork
to the UK. As of 1 January 1999, pregnant sows in the UK would
have to be kept in groups. UK pig producers, animal welfare and
consumer organizations put pressure on British retailers to sell
only bacon and other pig meat that came from pigs whose mothers
had been kept in groups. They were successful and because the UK
formed a large export market, the Dutch slaughter industry became
interested in ensuring that a signiﬁcant share of Dutch pregnant
sows would be kept in groups (Vermeer et al., 1999). This made
Dumeco, then a major slaughter company that later became part of
the Vion group, give a bonus to farmers who kept pregnant sows in
groups (Interview LTO). Thus, the normatively driven innovation in
the niche aligned with market developments in the regime.
Also at the European level, pig husbandry increasingly became
a matter of concern. The European Commission enacted new regulations that resembled the Dutch although they lagged a few years.
New EU regulation forbade keeping pregnant sows on chains as of
2005 (2001 in the Netherlands) and by 2013 all pregnant sows in
the EU should be kept in groups. The Dutch pig sector argued that
this meant unfair competition as for them group housing was compulsory by 2008 and to comply, the date has been changed to 2013
in the Netherlands as well (Enting et al., 2006). In anticipation of
this new regulation, by 2008 about half the pig farmers had already
changed to group housing.
Thus, in terms of our conceptual framework, we see that normative pressure was exerted from the 1980s onward, although with
varying strength. The regulatory opportunity stream showed more
variation and gained an enormous boost after an external shock, the
outbreak of swine fever. The technology stream showed a hypedisappointment cycle with high expectations in the late 1980s,
disappointment in the early 1990s and development of a second

generation of feeding systems in the mid 1990s. Concerning the
market stream, the direct market for piglets (the farmers who subsequently fattened them) was hardly affected but in the late 1990s
indirect market pressure came from the UK. In the late 1990s, all
these streams came together and from then on the regime started
to transform in the direction that the contestants advocated.

In the early 1970s, animal welfare groups criticized pig fattening
husbandry systems on a range of issues:

Keeping large numbers of pigs in small units;
Not allowing pigs to go outside;
Bare, concrete ﬂoors where pigs could not root;
Cutting tails and clipping teeth;
Castration without using anaesthetic;
General aversion towards the bio industry (treating animals as
commodities rather than living beings).
Representatives from the sector claimed either that problems
were not that bad or that economic pressures made it impossible to change. For instance, letting pigs outside would make them
more susceptible to diseases and make the controlled disposal of
manure, urine and atmospheric emissions problematic. Covering
the ﬂoor with straw would also worsen the manure problem and
make cleaning more difﬁcult.
For the Dutch government, economic considerations prevailed
over animal welfare concerns. Internal criticisms were silenced by
the Ministry. In 1972, one researcher at the Institute for Animal
Husbandry Research wrote a report that noted that pigs were biting
each other’s tails and ears because of boredom and stress, related to
conﬁnement in small spaces. The Ministry stopped publication of
the report and forbade the author to speak about it in public (Crijns,
1998).
Animal welfare received little political and social attention in
the 1980s and early 1990s because the agenda was dominated by
exacerbating manure problems. In 1984, stench and water pollution problems were visible, smellable, and pressing. That year, the
CBS (Central Bureau of Statistics) published a manure report that
the Ministry of Agriculture had tried to hold back for many years
(Frouws, 1994). This report crystallized societal frustration and led
to high political pressure for change in relation to environmental
issues.
Animal welfare concerns, however, were placed on the backburner. An EU-directive mandated a minimal space of 0.65 m2 per
pig, just enough for a 110 kg pig to lay down. The Dutch standard
was slightly better, 0.7 m2 per pig. This did not damage Dutch competitiveness because, as experience indicated, pigs do not grow
well if they have too little space (Hyun et al., 1998). The APS
frequently argued for further increases of ﬂoor space to enhance
animal welfare. The sector representative LTO opposed this, arguing
that additional costs would undermine the Dutch export position
and the Dutch ministry concurred.
5.2. Renewed contestation and gradual transformation
(1997–2000)
After the 1997 swine fever outbreak, NGO and public protest
against the bio industry intensiﬁed. The same year, two new NGOs
emerged with a more radical agenda than the APS, notably Awake
Animal (‘Wakker Dier’) and Pigs in Despair (‘Varkens in Nood’). Both

groups sought to end the bio industry altogether. In this context,
animal welfare concerns rose rapidly on the public and political
agenda. The societal pressure and the political determination led
to a slight tightening of rules, which triggered a gradual regime
transformation path. Although economic considerations remained
prominent for the government, more attention was given to animal
welfare issues.
To understand the discussion on regulations it is relevant to
know that many laws and regulations in the pig sector are communal, meaning that regulation is laid down in directives of the
EU. Member states have to translate these into national legal and
administrative measures. In relation to pig welfare, the relevant
EU directive is 91/630/EEC that speciﬁes a minimum ﬂoor space of
0.65 m2 per pig (Enting et al., 2006). Since 1994, the Netherlands
had speciﬁed a somewhat stricter rule, notably demanding 0.7 m2
per pig. Furthermore, the Dutch ruling (‘Varkensbesluit’) speciﬁed that in due course it would be forbidden to keep pigs on
ﬂoors that were 100% slatted (to collect manure and urine in
underlying cellars). For new pigsties, 0.3 m2 per pig would have
to be solid and by 2003 fully slatted ﬂoors would be prohibited
(Spoolder et al., 2003). The EU directive does not have such a provision.
Shortly after the outbreak of swine fever the Dutch government
decided that in 1998 the ﬂoor space standard would be raised to
1 m2 and that by the year 2000 the mandated solid ﬂoor area would
be 0.6 m2 (LNV, 1999). The sector protested heavily as this implied
they could keep 35% fewer pigs in the same area as their European
competitors. The Dutch government conceded and the rules were
somewhat relaxed. As of 2008, new pigsties would have to provide
0.8 m2 per pig which would increase to 1 m2 by 2013 with a solid
area of 0.4 m2 (Enting et al., 2006).
Another new rule, speciﬁed in the EU directive, was that as of
1 January 2003 pigs should have permanent access to a sufﬁcient
quantity of material “to enable proper investigation and manipulation activities, such as straw, hay, wood, sawdust, mushroom
compost, peat or a mixture of such” (Enting et al., 2006). As stated,
member countries had to make their own interpretations of these
directives and the Dutch ruling was far less precise. The typical
solution in the Netherlands was to hang a chain in the sty that pigs
could bite in and pull on, something that Dutch regulators allowed
(Interviews APS, Animal researcher).
Pig farmers were anything but happy with the new regulations,
especially the 2013 rule of 1 m2 per pig. They argued that this would
undermine their competitive position in the international market.
Going from the minimum of 0.7 m2 for existing pigsties to 1 m2
was expected to cost D 75 per pig-place which added 2.8 eurocents
per kilogram to the price of meat. Because this was more or less
the farmer’s proﬁt margin, this was not considered economically
viable (Interview LTO).
5.3. Further contestation and the development of new husbandry
systems (2000–2008)
A concentration of animal diseases in the late 1990s and early
2000s (swine fever, BSE, foot and mouth disease, avian ﬂu) further
deteriorated the public image of industrial animal production. In
2002 it led to a new political party that exclusively focussed on
animals. This Party for the Animals (‘Partij voor de Dieren’) participated in the 2003 general elections but won no seats. In 2006, they
were more successful, gaining 2 parliamentary seats out of 150.
They were supported by a wide variety of public ﬁgures including
authors, artists and TV personalities. This strategy of network building increased their visibility and legitimacy, and enabled them to
inﬂuence the public debate.
Since 2006, the party has bombarded the ministry with parliamentary questions on all sorts of issues relating to animal welfare
(cf. website http://www.partijvoordedieren.nl). Their visibility also
required other political parties and the Minister of Agriculture to
become more outspoken on animal welfare issues. In 2007, animal welfare issues also received more attention at the European
level, leading to debates about raising the EU ﬂoor space standard
from 0.65 m2 to about 0.75 m2 by 2013 (Interview LTO). Thus, a new
political opportunity structure developed for animal welfare issues
and innovations.
In response to these new social and political pressures, the pig
sector set up image campaigns like ‘Pigs in Sight’ (‘Varkens in Zicht’).
Some pig farms were equipped with sky boxes where the public
could watch pigsties and the behaviour of pigs. This campaign was
intended to convince the public that pigs were treated well and that
there was no reason for change (Interviews LTO, animal researcher).
While political actors and pig farmers focused on framing and
regulations, several outside actors worked on innovative projects.
These innovations involved new components and husbandry systems (mainly developed by engineers and scientists in various
research institutes) and new market segments (mainly developed
by new retailers). We ﬁrst discuss two more radical concepts, the
Hercules pigsty and Pigs in Comfort Class, and then a concept that
is closer to the mainstream, Canadian Bedding.
5.3.1. Hercules pigsty
Researchers at WUR started the Hercules8 project in 1998. Their
approach was based on the expectation that emission standards
would be tightened in the future and that, especially after the 1997
outbreak of swine-fever, tighter animal welfare rules would also be
imposed (Ogink et al., 2001).
Processing of manure became a focal point in the design and
communication on the Hercules project. In a conventional pigsty,
most of the ﬂoor space is slatted. Manure and urine fall on the ﬂoor
and are pressed through it by the pigs walking around. It is collected in underground cellars and disposed of. Because of the large
slatted area it is problematic to use straw since this will clog up the
openings. For animal welfare reasons, the government intended
to mandate an increase of the solid ﬂoor area. Farmers were not
happy with this because the larger the solid area made cleaning
more difﬁcult.
One of the focal points in Hercules was to design a system for
separation of manure and urine in order to lower the emissions of
ammonia. The technical approach was to develop a slightly convex
moving manure belt under a row of pigpens. The liquid fraction
(the urine) would drip from the sides and was collected underneath
while the solid fraction (the manure) was collected at the end of the
belt in a concentrated form (Ogink et al., 2001).
Although the Hercules design was primarily inspired for environmental reasons it also had various animal welfare beneﬁts. In
view of costs, this moving belt could not be too wide implying that
the slatted part of the pigsty, where pigs should relieve themselves,
should also be smaller. This had the advantage that there was more
solid ﬂoor space. The concept provided 1 m2 of ﬂoor space per pig
(25% more than the regulated standard) of which 75% was solid.
This ﬂoor could be cooled or warmed by running either cold or
warm water through hoses in the ﬂoor. An increased area of solid
ﬂoor could also be better combined with the use of straw which
had become an icon in animal welfare. Pigs like to play with straw,
chew on it and root in it. Part of the Hercules design was a device
called the ‘straw swing’. Pigs could play with it with their snout
for which they were rewarded with some straw. Because of these

Named after the Greek hero who was awarded the divine status for his heroic
deeds one of which was to change the course of two rivers to clean the king’s pigsties.
For a detailed description and analysis of the Hercules project see Bos and Grin
(2008).
B. Elzen et al. / Research Policy 40 (2011) 263–275
provisions the Hercules concept was expected to be some 5–10%
more expensive than a conventional pigsty. After several years of
research and development the ensuing Hercules system was considered “complex but feasible” (Van den Top et al., 2005).
The business studies school from WUR explored the market
introduction of Hercules. In parallel with the technical research
they carried out surveys among pig farmers to assess their judgement. These farmers were quite positive about the reduction of
emissions and the processing of manure. They also thought the concept was close to what consumers desired but had serious doubts
about energy use (the concept used various active systems that
consumed energy) and economic proﬁtability (Joldersma, 2003).
By 2005, when the technical research was ﬁnished, the world of
pig farming had changed signiﬁcantly compared to the late 1990s.
Although animal welfare and environmental concerns were still
present in the societal and political debate, they were less prominent. The sense of urgency that had followed the 1997 outbreak of
swine fever and other animal diseases had largely disappeared. In
2003, a new government had taken ofﬁce that strongly emphasised
deregulation. So, when the Hercules concept was considered ready
for practical use, the alignment between the political process and
normative pressure had weakened considerably. Consequently, the
project results were shelved.9
5.3.2. Pigs in comfort class
In the year 2000, the APS proposed an activity on ‘animal centred design’ to the Ministry of Agriculture within its long-term
programme on ‘Animal Production 2030’. The ministry agreed and
a desk study was started by APS and WUR-researchers (another
group than the one working on Hercules) to explore this. They
took pig husbandry as an example to elaborate the methodology.
The methodology started by identifying ten basic needs of pigs
that were subsequently translated into various technical solutions
which, together, deﬁned the pigsty concept. The main conclusion
was that it was possible to take animal welfare as a starting point to
design pigsties in which animals could be kept in an economically
viable way. APS proposed to LTO that they could try to build such a
pigsty together, to prove that it could indeed be done. LTO, feeling
the societal pressure to develop new forms of husbandry, accepted
(Interviews LTO and APS).
Although they agreed on building the pigsty there were differences in the visions of the partners. LTO saw the project primarily as
a research project that might have an impact in the long term. APS,
however, aimed for a pigsty that could operate within the existing
system and be economically viable (Interviews LTO and APS). Eventually, a compromise was developed between aiming for the long
and the short term. First, a demonstration pigsty would be built to
demonstrate the technical viability. Then pigs would be introduced
to demonstrate that they were actually better off in the new pigsty.
After that, ﬁve pig farmers would be sought to use the new design
principles in their own pigsty and demonstrate the economic viability. Thus, it was not only a research project but it would also have to
operate in practice (LTO and Dierenbescherming, 2006). This eventually led to the development of a new pigsty concept called Pigs in
Comfort Class (PCC) with a term derived from the aviation sector.10
The PCC-approach speciﬁes the 10 basic needs of pigs, but it
does not prescribe technical solutions to satisfy these needs (LTO
and Dierenbescherming, 2006, 4). To give an example, in a popular
vision pigs have a need to be outside and roll in the mud, allegedly

Regular sties were basically designed according to economic criteria, thus housing pigs in ‘economy class’. In contrast, the new stables were called ‘comfort class’,
because pigs were much better off. (Interview APS)

because they are dirty animals. The PCC approach, however, looks
at the reasons behind this behaviour. Pigs do not roll in the mud
because they are intrinsically dirty but because it serves two very
useful functions: it helps them to cool down when it is warm and
it frees them from skin-bugs which they pick up walking around.
When kept indoors, however, pigs are hardly pestered by skin-bugs
and cooling down can also be realised by various technical solutions, e.g. by cool air, a cooled ﬂoor or an occasional cold shower
(Interview animal researcher).
In Raalte, in the province of Overijssel, the demonstration pigsty
was built in 2006. The speciﬁcation of needs resulted in a ﬂoor space
of 2.4 m2 per pig, three times the regulated standard. WUR animal scientists considered this area necessary to provide pigs with
various functional areas for eating, sleeping, playing and relieving
themselves (De Lauwere and Luttik, 2006). LTO was convinced that
the large ﬂoor space could not be upheld in practice on economic
grounds but it wanted to stretch the design for the demonstration
project to assess what this might lead to (Interview LTO).
The next step would be to gradually strip the design of some of
its features until a concept would be reached that was considered
economically viable. The ﬁrst results indicated that this was possible at least in some respects as pigs tend to mix function areas and
would therefore need less space (Interview LTO).
Mid 2007, ﬁve farmers were chosen to implement the PCC concept in their own pigsties and receive a subsidy for the extra cost
they would have to make. They did not build new pigsties but
refurnished some units, rather than the whole pigfarm. Following the PCC philosophy of specifying needs rather than solutions
these farmers applied various techniques to satisfy the needs. Some
chose a different type of bedding, another applied natural ventilation, again another just used a conventional pigsty and made a few
small modiﬁcations. Strikingly, none of them implemented anything near the 2.4 m2 per pig considered necessary by the scientists
and that was used in the Raalte demonstration project (Interviews
APS and LTO).
The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture had high expectations of the
PCC concept. Late 2007, the Minister of Agriculture published a
white paper on animal welfare which set the goal of keeping 5% of
the animals in ‘integrally sustainable’ husbandry systems in 2011
(LNV, 2007, p. 5). It was not speciﬁed what this meant but for pigs
the solution favoured by the ministry was Pigs in Comfort Class
(Interview LNV ministry). The sector, however, was less enthusiastic because the PCC concept would make pork more expensive. As
a result, stakeholders in the pork chain, including farmers, slaughtering industry and supermarkets were not keen on moving in this
direction (Interviews Vion, LTO).
In terms of our conceptual approach, the timing of PCC better
aligned with the regulatory dynamic than Hercules. In 2007, three
streams came together, notably the problem, regulatory and technology stream. However, there was still a serious mismatch with
the market stream.
5.3.3. Canadian bedding
Trying to ﬁnd other routes to improve the keeping of animals the
APS has worked with a relatively new Dutch retailer, Jumbo supermarkets. Jumbo is a family owned company, a relative outsider in
the supermarket world that seeks to proﬁle itself with low prices
and care for quality and sustainability. On its website, Jumbo has
several pages addressing “responsible food” which also provides
information on how animals are kept for some of its ‘responsible’
products and contrasts this with the bio industry.11

Following its discussions with the APS, Jumbo started to sell a
special type of pork, in addition to regular pork, that comes from
pigs that are kept in so-called Canadian Bedding pigsties. This concept was developed in the Vancouver area in western Canada where
the lumber industry produces a lot of sawdust that local pig farmers use as a bedding in their pigsties. This is soft for pigs to lie on
and gives them something to root in and chew on. This concept has
also been adopted by a small number of Dutch pig farmers. Jumbo
has embraced the concept and now sells meat from pigs from one
farmer who houses pigs in these pigsties, calling it “Jumbo conscious pork”. APS has designed a special quality label that Jumbo is
allowed to use. This meat is about 15% more expensive than typical
supermarket pork. In 2006, Jumbo started to sell it in six shops and
in 2007 did so in all of its over 100 outlets12 (Interview APS).
In this case, three streams aligned, notably normative pressure,
technology (Canadian Bedding) and market. There are no indications that regulation played a serious role in developing this
concept. It can hardly be stated that this started a transformation
as the husbandry concept was already used and the market share
of this pork at the time of writing was so small that it did not lead
to an increased use of the Canadian Bedding concept.

Our research question was: How, when and why is normative
contestation of existing regimes effective in inﬂuencing the orientation of transitions in the making? We can now answer this
question for the two empirical cases, explaining the different outcomes with the conceptualizations from Section 2.
In the case of pregnant sows, normative contestations from
NGOs and animal scientists reached their aspired goals. By 2009
about half the pig farmers had converted to group housing systems and the others will soon follow because group housing will
be legally enforced as of 2013. In the case of fattening pigs, normative contestations had less success, leading only to gradual changes
in ﬂoor space (from 0.7 m2 per pig via 0.8 m2 for new pigsties as of
2008 and 1 m2 in 2013), a slight increase in solid ﬂoor space in 2013
and the provision of toys. Various alternative husbandry concepts
were developed but did not diffuse widely. To explain these differences, we will look at two main processes: (a) increasing normative
pressure, and (b) alignment of normative pressure with economic,
regulatory, and technological niche developments.
6.1. Increasing normative pressure
To analyze normative pressure, Section 2 proposed three
concepts: (1) resource mobilization, (2) (political) opportunity
structures, and (3) framing, which was sub-divided into focus,
empirical credibility, cultural resonance and emotional appeal. We
will apply these concepts in turn.
(Ad 1) Resource mobilization occurred more or less similarly in
both cases. The Animal Protection Society (APS) sought to
mobilize public opinion and exert political pressure for
both sub-sectors. The APS interacted frequently with policymakers and sector representatives, stressing that animal
welfare required a change of husbandry concepts. Networks
between social movements and (outsider) animal scientists
were also present in both cases, with the scientists also voicing criticisms and developing alternatives. In the fattening

pigs case, APS performed additional work by teaming up
with LTO, the (pig-) farmers representative, to demonstrate
an alternative concept (PCC). Until 2009, this had relatively
little effect on wider diffusion.
Political opportunity structures were also more or less the
same for both cases. Until the turn of the century, the structural characteristics of the political constellation relevant
for animal welfare changed relatively little. This changed
with the advent of the Party for the Animals in early 2007. It
succeeded in pushing animal welfare concerns high on the
political agenda and these have remained there since.
Framing by animal welfare organizations differed considerably for both cases. Firstly, the framing had more focus
for pregnant sows, both in terms of problems (the ‘chain
sow’) and solutions (keeping pregnant sows in groups).
For fattening pigs, the framing was less focused, because a
wide variety of animal welfare problems struggled for attention. Furthermore, animal welfare problems competed with
sustainability issues related to emissions (ammonia) and
manure disposal. This multitude of problems limited the
focus and strength of framing processes for the fattening
pigs case.
Secondly, framing processes had stronger emotional appeal
for pregnant sows, especially through the catchy term and
images of ‘chain sows’. The public, policy makers and even
some farmers agreed that a sow with a chain or belt around
the shoulder was unfriendly to the animal. The APS used this
powerful image to articulate a moral framing of unacceptability. The alternative (group housing) was also well framed
by linking it with notions of pigs as sociable animals. For fattening pigs, in contrast, the framing was less successful in
terms of emotional appeal. Furthermore, the pig farmers,
especially their representative body LTO, were more successful in counter-framing for fattening pigs than for pregnant sows. For fattening pigs, the farmers argued that strong
international cost-based competition prevented them from
adopting the more substantial animal welfare innovations
that would raise costs and reduce competitiveness. Initially,
in the early 1990s, a counter-framing strategy also worked
successfully for pregnant sows (“experience shows pregnant sows in groups is a disaster”) even though proponents
pointed to 2% of the sow farmer’s population who had successfully implemented the alternative in practice.
In the late 1990s, a sequence of external shocks changed the
context drastically. These included the swine fever outbreak
in 1997 and a number of other animal diseases and food
scandals shortly thereafter. This considerably reduced the
strength of the LTO counter-framing while the general
problem framing by animal welfare groups gained empirical
credibility and cultural resonance. This strengthened general
concerns about industrial animal production and mobilized
public opinion as an additional resource to put pressure on
political and regulatory processes.
The overall dynamic of the normative pressure in both cases
is depicted in Tables 2 and 3 below. These tables also show how
this pressure aligned with other relevant dynamics that will be
discussed in the next section.

Building on Kingdon’s (1984) multiple streams model, we proposed to investigate the alignments between four streams: (1)
problem stream (articulated as normative pressure by social movements), (2) R&amp;D and technology stream, (3) market stream, (4)
regulatory/policy stream.

The shift to group housing for pregnant sows entailed a change
in practices—the management of sows required farmers to develop
some new routines (e.g. to manage sows in groups), which many
of them initially resisted, as well as development and adoption of
new technical components (especially new feeding systems that
separated eating sows from each other). Thus, technological change
was important, especially the development from ﬁrst generation
(late 1980s) to second generation feeding systems (mid-1990s). The
technology experienced a hype-disappointment cycle, with farmers having high expectations in the late 1980s when about 5% of
sow farmers shifted to group housing. However, teething problems
with the ﬁrst generation feeding systems led to disappointments
causing a decline in group farming to about 2%. Around 1995, when
second generation systems were developed, negative perceptions
of group housing had hardened, which frustrated further diffusion.
The swine fever shock in 1997, however, provided a window of
opportunity, which advocates of group housing took advantage of.
Alignment with public opinion led to strong normative pressure
on policy makers. Policy makers then issued regulations that made
group housing compulsory in 10 years time. Farmers protested,
arguing that this was not possible and would reduce competitiveness (counter-framing) but NGOs and policy makers could overrule
these protests by pointing both to technical progress (second generation) and the 2% of farmers who showed that such concepts could
be applied successfully. Market forces also played a role, especially
from UK supermarkets (which faced pressure from more radical
animal rights groups) which in 1999 demanded group housing in
relation to imported bacon. This dynamic of the various streams is
summarised in Table 2.
As Kingdom noted, the coming together of various streams at the
same time to form a coherent package greatly enhances the chances
for regime change. In the case of pregnant sows, this is what happened in 1997. It was particularly crucial that the second generation
of technical alternatives were sufﬁciently developed when the window of opportunity opened (due to the swine fever shock) and that
2% of farmers had demonstrated economic feasibility. Both aspects
enabled policy makers to issue strict regulations that pushed the
alternative through.
For fattening pigs, the development of alternatives such as Hercules, Pigs in Comfort Class (PCC) and Canadian Bedding resulted in
stabilized concepts in the early 2000s. At the time of the 1997 crisis,
however, such concepts were not available because most innovation efforts in the 1980s had not focused on animal welfare, but on
manure problems. So there were no well-developed alternatives
when the 1997 window of opportunity opened. By 2005, when the
Hercules project was ﬁnished the political interest had gone and
the concept was shelved. Two years later, with the upcoming of
the Party for the Animals the interest rose again and the PCC concept, that was then in the middle of its development, gained a better
reception, thus reinforcing the conclusion about the importance of
creating a package.
Furthermore, regulatory pressure was weak in the case of fattening pigs, partly because there were no available alternatives
that could be pushed through when the normative pressure was
high, and partly because the counter-framing strategies of farmers
(welfare innovations would reduce competitiveness) were more
successful. Market demand was also weaker in this case, with mainstream consumers not translating moral concerns into purchasing
decisions, buying the cheapest meat in supermarkets instead. The
2008–2009 attempts by Jumbo, then a relative fringe actor in the
supermarket sector, to create an intermediary ‘animal friendly’ segment (between organic and regular pork) are interesting in this
respect, but have not produced major successes at the time of writing. In sum, while these alternatives might constitute the onset of
a transition path, the lack of alignment with regulatory and market
processes hindered broader diffusion.
As a result, the overall development path in the fattening pig
sub-sector has been gradual change, driven primarily by somewhat stricter regulations in response to normative pressure and
public concerns. Following the 1997 crisis, and in response to the
accompanying public outrage, government regulations mandated
increased ﬂoor space from 0.7 m2 to 0.8 m2 per pig for new pigsties
which will increase to 1 m2 by 2013. Further regulations also speciﬁed the introduction of toys and and a minimum area of solid
ﬂoor.
Table 3 summarises the dynamic of the various streams for
different periods in the pig fattening case. Normative pressure
from outsiders was present throughout de studied timeframe
although with different strength for the various periods. The
dynamic of the other streams shows more variation, esp. from 2002
onward.
Comparing Tables 2 and 3 we conclude that the ‘coherent package’, to use Kingdon’s term, that developed in the sows case did
not develop in the fattening case, neither in terms of problems
nor in terms of solutions. In the case of sows there was a rather
uniform problem deﬁnition of keeping sows separate, using the

‘chain sow’ as a strong symbol for framing. In the fattening pigs
case, many animal welfare issues competed for attention like little
room per pig, no possibility to root and play, cutting tails, clipping
teeth, castration without using anaesthetic. Moreover, there were
also environmental concerns in connection with manure disposal,
(ammonia) emissions and stench. Concerning solutions, in the sows
case there was a clear way to go, i.e. to move towards group housing. For pig fattening, the variety in problem deﬁnitions also led to
a variety in (technical as well as market/institutional) solutions. In
this case no coherent package could therefore be offered that could
be ‘pushed through’ with the proper alignment of different forces.

This article has introduced the topic of normative orientation
into the debate on transitions and enriched the multi-level perspective with insights from social movement theory and political
science. More speciﬁcally, it investigated the question how normative contestation of existing regimes can inﬂuence the orientation
of transitions in the making. Our analysis shows that there are two
sides to this question: the ﬁrst concerns the dynamic of the contestation process, the second concerns the alignment with three other
processes or streams in our analysis.
Social movement theory was helpful in analysing the contestation dynamic. Three key concepts (resource mobilization, (political)
opportunity structures, and framing) were useful to analyze how
contestation by regime outsiders may lead to increased normative
pressure on regimes. One conclusion from our study is that the existence of a variety of problem deﬁnitions may considerably weaken
the normative pressure. But our cases also show that the strength
of normative pressure forms only part of the explanation.
The second part of the explanation is that ongoing processes
may create ‘opportunity’ structures that allow normative pressure
to be effective. Building on Kingdon and the multi-level perspective, we suggested that four ‘streams’ are relevant to determine
this opportunity structure, notably a problem, regulatory/policy,
technology and market stream. Each of these streams has its own
dynamic although various actors involved make explicit attempts
to link them. As a general conclusion, normative contestation has
its largest impact when the other streams become aligned at a
certain point in time to create what Kingdon calls a ‘coherent package’. Because the four streams have their own dynamic the issue of
timing is critical for the creation of such a package.
Interestingly, in our case we see that a variety of problem definitions in the fattening pigs case is accompanied by a variety in
technical solutions (Hercules, PCC, Canadian Bedding). It seems that
this variety on the problem side and variety on the solution side
both weaken the possibility of alignment and hence the onset of a
transformation process. Using a term from innovation studies, we
presume that the creation of a successful package increases if preceding innovation processes have resulted in a ‘dominant design’
that can be linked to problems if a policy window opens. If various
designs exist, this linkage is more difﬁcult. More research would be
needed to analyze how this works exactly.
This article has addressed the topic of normative orientation
with a conceptual framework and a comparative case study. Our
ﬁndings therefore have a ‘proof of principle’ character. To generalise
the ﬁndings and elaborate the perspective, we hope that other studies will further investigate these topics. On a more general note, we
think that these topics also have relevance for the ﬁeld of innovation
studies, which has produced substantial knowledge about factors
that inﬂuence general innovativeness (often related to economic
issues of competitiveness and proﬁtability) and the speed of technical trajectories, but paid less attention to questions surrounding

APS and the scientists also referred to the UK where group-housing was more widely applied and where a new bill would enforce it by the end of the decade. In the early 1990s, the scientists occasionally interacted with the ministry and the APS on research ﬁndings and on shaping further research. By 1996 they had developed and tested a second generation of group housing systems. They concluded that group housing was now ready for practical use but that it would require new managerial skills and competencies from the pig farmer (Backus, 1997). The sector and the ministry, however, showed little interest. At the time, there was much more societal concern for disposal of manure and emissions from the bio industry than animal welfare which was rather low on the political and societal agenda (Interview animal researcher). Thus, in terms of our conceptual vocabulary, the political opportunity structure that had been favourable to group housing in the late 1980s, had disappeared in the mid 1990s. B.

Framing is consequential because collective constructions of reality make certain actions and response strategies more (or less) likely. Social movements frame problems in ways to enhance their salience and appeal to wider publics. This way they aim to shape the cognitive space in which issues are debated (Eyerman and Jamison, 1991) and inﬂuence public opinion, which then exerts credibility pressure on policy makers. Building on Benford and Snow (2000), we propose that the strength or mobilization potential of collective frames is inﬂuenced by: (a) their focus (addressing too many issues dilutes the strength), (b) their empirical credibility (perceived ﬁt with ongoing events around the issue), (c) their cultural resonance (ﬁt with broader repertoires and discourses), (d) their emotional-normative appeal (often through images, metaphors, etc.).

This practice creates strong backward pressure from supermarkets to farmers to produce meat as cheaply as possible. 267 Scale increase was accompanied by specialization that resulted in two sub-sectors in pig farming: (1) fattening and meat production and (2) breeding, which focuses on sows and piglets. While the Dutch fattening sector was always export oriented, the breeding sector has also become an international player during the past few decades, growing from virtually no exports in the mid-1980s to an annual export of 4.5 million and 5 million piglets in 2006 and 2007, respectively (Bolhuis and Wisman, 2008). Pigs to be fattened (or porkers) were kept in groups of about a dozen in units separated from each other by metal fences with an average ﬂoor space of 0.7 m2 per pig until 1998. The ﬂoors were typically made of slatted concrete on which the pigs urinated and defecated. By walking around, the pigs pressed the faeces through the slits to be collected in cellars underneath. This made the ﬂoors very slippery causing many claw problems. Furthermore, the pigs experienced boredom in the small conﬁnements making them bite the tails of neighbours, resulting in wounds and infection. To reduce this pro</context>

An increased area of solid ﬂoor could also be better combined with the use of straw which had become an icon in animal welfare. Pigs like to play with straw, chew on it and root in it. Part of the Hercules design was a device called the ‘straw swing’. Pigs could play with it with their snout for which they were rewarded with some straw. Because of these 8 Named after the Greek hero who was awarded the divine status for his heroic deeds one of which was to change the course of two rivers to clean the king’s pigsties.

Elzen et al. / Research Policy 40 (2011) 263–275 provisions the Hercules concept was expected to be some 5–10% more expensive than a conventional pigsty. After several years of research and development the ensuing Hercules system was considered “complex but feasible” (Van den Top et al., 2005). The business studies school from WUR explored the market introduction of Hercules. In parallel with the technical research they carried out surveys among pig farmers to assess their judgement. These farmers were quite positive about the reduction of emissions and the processing of manure. They also</context>

Thus, it was not only a research project but it would also have to operate in practice (LTO and Dierenbescherming, 2006). This eventually led to the development of a new pigsty concept called Pigs in Comfort Class (PCC) with a term derived from the aviation sector.10 The PCC-approach speciﬁes the 10 basic needs of pigs, but it does not prescribe technical solutions to satisfy these needs (LTO and Dierenbescherming, 2006, 4). To give an example, in a popular vision pigs have a need to be outside and roll in the mud, allegedly 9 More precisely, Bos and Grin (2008) have identiﬁed ﬁve factors why it didn’t take off. 10 Regular sties were basically designed according to economic criteria, thus housing pigs in ‘economy class’. In contrast, the new stables were called ‘comfort class’, because pigs were much better off. (Interview APS) 271 because they are dirty animals. The PCC approach, however, looks at the reasons behind this behaviour. Pigs do not roll in the mud because they are intrinsically dirty but because it serves two very useful functions: it helps them to cool down when it is warm and it frees them from skin-bugs which they pick up walking arou</context>

We will address this in Section 2.3 where we discuss alignments between normative pressure with other socio-technical developments. The normative pressure on regimes increases if these three sub-processes grow stronger. This increase depends on (changing) circumstances and events. Major shocks or accidents, for instance, can push an issue higher on the agenda and strengthen the empirical credibility of particular discourses. Issues also compete for public attention with other problems (Hilgartner and Bosk, 1988) and often experience issue-attention cycles (McComas and Shanahan, 1999; Brossard et al., 2004) with problems rising and falling on public agendas as media and audiences get bored and search for new issues. Increases in normative pressure are likely to have more effect on transitions if they coincide with and can become linked to other developments, leading to a particular ‘package’ (Kingdon, 1984) that can be pushed through. We turn to these alignments now. 2.3. Alignments with other socio-technical developments Normative pressure, even when it is increasing, cannot bring about substantial regime change on its own.

By ‘effective in inﬂuencing the orientation’ we mean that the developments in the regime move in a direction that the contestants advocate. We address this question in two steps. Firstly, we will enrich the multi-level perspective, which provides a useful conceptualization of transitions, with insights from social movement theory (SMT) and political science. We add SMT to conceptualize how outsiders such as animal welfare groups exert normative pressure on existing regimes. From political science, we use Kingdon’s (1984) multiple stream model to argue that normative pressure is more likely to lead to regime change if alignments with other developments (in markets, regulations and technology) create a ‘package’ between problems and solutions that is attractive to various stakeholders. Second, we investigate two case studies where normative pressures tried to destabilize an existing regime and call for alternatives that might lead to a future transition. The two cases concern two sub-sectors in pig husbandry in the Netherlands and the inﬂuence from animal welfare concerns (1970–2008). We have chosen these cases</context>
<context position="18283" citStr="(1984)" startWordPosition="2629" endWordPosition="2629">1, e.g. regulations, consumer demand, or market pressure from supermarkets, nicheinnovations, etc. While social movements may try to inﬂuence the developments in other domains (market, technology/innovation, 266 B. Elzen et al. / Research Policy 40 (2011) 263–275 regulation), these domains also have their own dynamics. From the perspective of social movements, these changes in other domains thus form ‘opportunity structures’, to which normative pressures can (or cannot) be linked. To further operationalize this alignment, we mobilize some insights from political science, in particular Kingdon (1984), and adapt these for our research question. Kingdon criticized the linear view on policy making, and instead argued that major policy changes come about through alignments of three streams that have relatively independent dynamics: problem stream, politics stream, and policy/solution stream. Although his multiple stream model has much to offer for understanding political decision making, his focus on policy is somewhat too narrow for our research topic. We therefore adapt some of Kingdon’s ideas and propose a broader view on streams, distinguishing four of them. The ﬁrst stream follows from o</context>

This strengthened general concerns about industrial animal production and mobilized public opinion as an additional resource to put pressure on political and regulatory processes. The overall dynamic of the normative pressure in both cases is depicted in Tables 2 and 3 below. These tables also show how this pressure aligned with other relevant dynamics that will be discussed in the next section. 6.2. Alignments with other socio-technical developments Building on Kingdon’s (1984) multiple streams model, we proposed to investigate the alignments between four streams: (1) problem stream (articulated as normative pressure by social movements), (2) R&amp;D and technology stream, (3) market stream, (4) regulatory/policy stream.

The same year, the Foundation for Nature and Environment published a critical report called Bio Industry that warned that pigs were no longer seen as living creatures but as resources and input materials for industrial processes. The term ‘bio industry’ was coined deliberately to frame the damaging effects of industrial methods on farming. The report also drew attention to stench problems, pollution of water and soil from manure surpluses, and damage to the natural landscape (Crijns, 1998). The Animal Protection Society (APS; ‘Dierenbescherming’), a respectable NGO established in 1864 with over 200,000 members and 70 staff members in the early 2000s, (APS website) also saw industrial animal husbandry as a step backward for animal welfare and favoured keeping animals according to organic principles. In the 1970s, organic pig farming constituted a small market niche of about 1%, carried by small subsection of ‘moral consumers’ who were willing to pay about 30–40% more for organically produced pork. This meat came from animals that were kept in a more ‘natural’ environment, had ro</context>

Covering the ﬂoor with straw would also worsen the manure problem and make cleaning more difﬁcult. For the Dutch government, economic considerations prevailed over animal welfare concerns. Internal criticisms were silenced by the Ministry. In 1972, one researcher at the Institute for Animal Husbandry Research wrote a report that noted that pigs were biting each other’s tails and ears because of boredom and stress, related to conﬁnement in small spaces. The Ministry stopped publication of the report and forbade the author to speak about it in public (Crijns, 1998). Animal welfare received little political and social attention in the 1980s and early 1990s because the agenda was dominated by exacerbating manure problems. In 1984, stench and water pollution problems were visible, smellable, and pressing. That year, the CBS (Central Bureau of Statistics) published a manure report that the Ministry of Agriculture had tried to hold back for many years (Frouws, 1994). This report crystallized societal frustration and led to high political pressure for change in relation to environmental issues. Animal welfare concerns, however, were placed on the backburner. </context>

Wider diffusion of niche-innovations depends on internal dynamics and on windows of opportunity at the regime level, which may arise from external landscape developments or from normative pressures, as we will show in this article. We propose a speciﬁc operationalization of the socio-technical regime concept to accommodate our empirical focus on pig farmers and the animal husbandry systems they operate in. While pig farmers are our focal group, we use an embeddedness approach (Dacin et al., 1999) to capture the relations with various other actors such as slaughterhouses, supermarkets, consumers, technology suppliers, research institutes and universities, social movements such as the Animal Protection Society, public opinion, and policy. To further conceptualize these relations, we suggest that enterprises such as pig farms operate simultaneously in two environments (Oliver, 1997): (1) a task environment which includes social groups that engage in economic exchanges and transactions with industries (e.g. consumers, suppliers); economic competitiveness, efﬁciency, and ﬁnancial performan</context>

Recent work by technology-oriented scholars, however, shows that SMT can be usefully applied to technological innovations and industries as well (Lounsbury et al., 2003; Hess, 2005; Smith, 2005). The existing literature suggests that the following three processes from the social movement literature are particularly relevant to understand how movements create normative pressure on existing political regimes: (1) resource mobilization, (2) framing processes, and (3) political opportunity structures (McAdam et al., 1996; Davis et al., 2005). (1) The mobilization of resources is important for internal development of a social movement and for external inﬂuence on other actors (e.g. public opinion, policy makers). Important resources are: money, members, internal and external networks, expertise, credibility, respectability, and contacts. If social movements mobilize more resources, their (normative) appeals gather strength (McCarthy and Zald, 1977).

In 1975, the committee published a report that concluded that sow husbandry had some weaknesses, which could be remedied with various technical means (NRLO, 1975). In practice, however, little changed in the following years. The debate intensiﬁed in the early 1980s. In 1982 the APS released a study that was very critical of sow husbandry, focussing on chained sows stating: “The short chain only allows the sow to stand op or lie down. Turning around or walking a few steps is out of the question” (Dierenbescherming, 1982, p. 7). The study concluded that the way sows were kept in the Netherlands was ‘completely unacceptable’ (p. 41). With various campaigns, the APS tried to generate public awareness. To this end they framed the problem using the catchy term ‘chain sow’ for the pregnant sows that were tethered to the ﬂoor. This term and the accompanying images struck an emotional chord in public opinion which felt that these animals deserved better treatment (Fig. 3; Interview APS).

Shortly after the release of the APS report, the Ministry of Agriculture set up a new commission for pig welfare issues. Its 1984 Fig. 3. ‘Chain-sow’ (Dierenbescherming, 1982, p. 26). report was quite critical on sow husbandry (Commissie Welzijn Varkens, 1984). The APS started discussions with the ministry and the pig industry on how to proceed. In 1986, they came to a joint agreement that individual housing of sows should become forbidden as soon as ‘acceptable systems for group housing would be available’ (Dierenbescherming, 1999, p. 21). To realise this, the ministry started working on future legislation (Werkgroep, 1988). Furthermore, all research into housing of sows was integrated in a national programme. In the period 1987–1990 a research project was carried out at the Research Institute for Pig Husbandry at Rosmalen, comparing individual systems with a group housing system. For the latter, the main innovation needed would be a system to feed the sows individually. Such a system already existed for cows and was adapted for pregnant sows. The initial design consisted of an open space where the sows were kept in gr</context>

Swine-fever: the aftermath of an external shock (1997–2007) After 4 February 1997, the political opportunity structure turned completely due to an external shock. The trigger was an outbreak of swine-fever that spread rapidly. On numerous pig farms, all pigs were killed and cranes were used to load dead pigs onto huge trucks to take them to destroyers. These scenes were broadcasted widely on Dutch television and stimulated a lively societal debate. In total, over 11 million pigs were killed including almost 3 million 3–17 day old piglets (Ministry of Agriculture data, cited in Dierenbescherming, 1999, 47). Many, including politicians as well as the public, felt something really had to change in pig husbandry. Within a few months, new legislation was drafted that would make group-housing compulsory in ten years, i.e. in 2008. The sector protested heavily but did not stand a chance against the societal and political pressure and determination. LTO, the sector representative, realised that it made no sense to ﬁght this change further and that it had to ﬁnd ways to inform farmers on how to make a smooth transition. They organised meetings with pig-farmers throughout the country at which the R</context>

Eventually, a compromise was developed between aiming for the long and the short term. First, a demonstration pigsty would be built to demonstrate the technical viability. Then pigs would be introduced to demonstrate that they were actually better off in the new pigsty. After that, ﬁve pig farmers would be sought to use the new design principles in their own pigsty and demonstrate the economic viability. Thus, it was not only a research project but it would also have to operate in practice (LTO and Dierenbescherming, 2006). This eventually led to the development of a new pigsty concept called Pigs in Comfort Class (PCC) with a term derived from the aviation sector.10 The PCC-approach speciﬁes the 10 basic needs of pigs, but it does not prescribe technical solutions to satisfy these needs (LTO and Dierenbescherming, 2006, 4). To give an example, in a popular vision pigs have a need to be outside and roll in the mud, allegedly 9 More precisely, Bos and Grin (2008) have identiﬁed ﬁve factors why it didn’t take off. 10 Regular sties were basically designed according to economic criteria, thus housing pigs in ‘econo</context>

Framing is consequential because collective constructions of reality make certain actions and response strategies more (or less) likely. Social movements frame problems in ways to enhance their salience and appeal to wider publics. This way they aim to shape the cognitive space in which issues are debated (Eyerman and Jamison, 1991) and inﬂuence public opinion, which then exerts credibility pressure on policy makers. Building on Benford and Snow (2000), we propose that the strength or mobilization potential of collective frames is inﬂuenced by: (a) their focus (addressing too many issues dilutes the strength), (b) their empirical credibility (perceived ﬁt with ongoing events around the issue), (c) their cultural resonance (ﬁt with broader repertoires and discourses), (d) their emotional-normative appeal (often through images, metaphors, etc.).

The Ministry stopped publication of the report and forbade the author to speak about it in public (Crijns, 1998). Animal welfare received little political and social attention in the 1980s and early 1990s because the agenda was dominated by exacerbating manure problems. In 1984, stench and water pollution problems were visible, smellable, and pressing. That year, the CBS (Central Bureau of Statistics) published a manure report that the Ministry of Agriculture had tried to hold back for many years (Frouws, 1994). This report crystallized societal frustration and led to high political pressure for change in relation to environmental issues. Animal welfare concerns, however, were placed on the backburner. An EU-directive mandated a minimal space of 0.65 m2 per pig, just enough for a 110 kg pig to lay down. The Dutch standard was slightly better, 0.7 m2 per pig. This did not damage Dutch competitiveness because, as experience indicated, pigs do not grow well if they have too little space (Hyun et al., 1998). The APS frequently argued for further increases of ﬂoor space to enhance animal welfare. The sec</context>

As there are no existing conceptual frameworks that address the relation between normative contestation and innovation we will combine some existing approaches to tackle our research question. We take the multi-level perspective as a starting point (Section 2.1) and enrich this with insights from social movement theory (Section 2.2) and political science (Section 2.3). 2.1. The multi-level dynamic The multi-level perspective (MLP) distinguishes three analytical levels (Rip and Kemp, 1998; Geels, 2002; Geels and Schot, 2007). Niches are seen as the locus for learning and experimentation with radical innovation. The socio-technical regime refers to the semicoherent set of rules and actors that reproduce, maintain and incrementally change elements that together fulﬁl a societal function such as transport or meat production and consumption. The regime is characterized by stability and path dependence because of lockin mechanisms on various dimensions (e.g. costs, shared beliefs, sunk investments, capabilities, user preferences and life styles).

But they are also different: socially they consist of different networks, with some farmers specializing in breeding and others in fattening; in terms of technological knowledge and routines, sow breeding draws on artiﬁcial insemination, breeding research, artiﬁcial heating, antibiotics and nurturing, while pig fattening draws on physiological research, food uptake and conversion rates, designer foods, rapid growth and mass production. They also operate on different markets (Geels, 2009). If we are precise, we need to call them sub-regimes since there are also clear links, e.g. with the sows sub-regime providing piglets that are the starting ‘material’ for the fattening pigs sub-regime. For the purpose of our analysis, however, these relations play no role and therefore we can treat them as two separate regimes, i.e. as two separate cases. The case studies are based on various technical and economic reports from research institutes, sector organizations and the Ministry of Agriculture.7 These data sources were supplemented with eight semi-structured interviews, especially to </context>

This led to the establishment of the Vion group that held two thirds of the Dutch market by 2007 and became the largest in Europe. The growth in pig farming, which turned into an economically ﬂourishing sector, was accompanied by a shift towards industrial animal production systems that were based on guiding principles such as mechanization, specialization, rationalization and economies of scale. During this shift, pig farming developed into an integrated chain with strong ties between animal food providers, pig farmers, slaughterhouses, supermarkets, and consumers (Geels, 2009). Pig farming itself transformed into a factory-like mass production system, with farms of increasing size. The average number of pigs per farm increased from 25 in 1960 to 1300 in 2006 (Table 1). The scale increase in pigs per farm was accompanied by a decrease in the number of farms, from about 120,000 in 1960 to 9040 in 2006, a 92% drop. Sectoral evolution is characterized by a struggle for survival, with cost-competition driving further scale increases. Consumers and supermarkets contribute to the strong cost focus in the sector.

Section 5 describes the second case (pig fattening), where the contestants were less successful. Three innovation projects (Hercules, Comfort Class, and Canadian Bedding) that constitute alternative paths for transitions in the making did not progress much in terms of wider diffusion. The discussion and analysis in Section 6 explains the difference in outcomes with the conceptual perspective. The article ends in Section 7 with conclusions and suggestions for further research. 5 There has been work on transition pathways (Geels and Schot, 2007), but this was based on historical case studies where directionality was identiﬁed ex-post. 2. Conceptual perspective In this section we will present our conceptual framework for analysing the inﬂuence of normative contestation on the orientation of transitions in the making. As there are no existing conceptual frameworks that address the relation between normative contestation and innovation we will combine some existing approaches to tackle our research question. We take the multi-level perspective as a starting point (Section 2.1) and enrich this with insights from social movement theory (S</context>

Increasing normative pressure To conceptualize normative pressure we mobilize insights from social movement theory. SMT is useful for our research question, because it generally deals with conﬂicts between established orders and groups that aim to correct some perceived injustice. Because SMT traditionally focused on the labour movement, the civil rights movement, suffragettes, etc., much of the work has a political focus. Recent work by technology-oriented scholars, however, shows that SMT can be usefully applied to technological innovations and industries as well (Lounsbury et al., 2003; Hess, 2005; Smith, 2005). The existing literature suggests that the following three processes from the social movement literature are particularly relevant to understand how movements create normative pressure on existing political regimes: (1) resource mobilization, (2) framing processes, and (3) political opportunity structures (McAdam et al., 1996; Davis et al., 2005).

We will address this in Section 2.3 where we discuss alignments between normative pressure with other socio-technical developments. The normative pressure on regimes increases if these three sub-processes grow stronger. This increase depends on (changing) circumstances and events. Major shocks or accidents, for instance, can push an issue higher on the agenda and strengthen the empirical credibility of particular discourses. Issues also compete for public attention with other problems (Hilgartner and Bosk, 1988) and often experience issue-attention cycles (McComas and Shanahan, 1999; Brossard et al., 2004) with problems rising and falling on public agendas as media and audiences get bored and search for new issues. Increases in normative pressure are likely to have more effect on transitions if they coincide with and can become linked to other developments, leading to a particular ‘package’ (Kingdon, 1984) that can be pushed through. We turn to these alignments now. 2.3. Alignments with other socio-technical developments Normative pressure, even when it is increasing, cannot bring about substantial r</context>

The scale increase in pigs per farm was accompanied by a decrease in the number of farms, from about 120,000 in 1960 to 9040 in 2006, a 92% drop. Sectoral evolution is characterized by a struggle for survival, with cost-competition driving further scale increases. Consumers and supermarkets contribute to the strong cost focus in the sector. For supermarkets, meat fulﬁls the role of trafﬁc generator: advertised at low prices, meat should seduce customers to enter their shops, assuming they will also buy other products with larger proﬁt margins (Hoste et al., 2004, pp. 7–8). This practice creates strong backward pressure from supermarkets to farmers to produce meat as cheaply as possible. 267 Scale increase was accompanied by specialization that resulted in two sub-sectors in pig farming: (1) fattening and meat production and (2) breeding, which focuses on sows and piglets. While the Dutch fattening sector was always export oriented, the breeding sector has also become an international player during the past few decades, growing from virtually no exports in the mid-1980s to an annual export of 4.5 million and 5 million piglets in 2006 and 2007, respect</context>

This report crystallized societal frustration and led to high political pressure for change in relation to environmental issues. Animal welfare concerns, however, were placed on the backburner. An EU-directive mandated a minimal space of 0.65 m2 per pig, just enough for a 110 kg pig to lay down. The Dutch standard was slightly better, 0.7 m2 per pig. This did not damage Dutch competitiveness because, as experience indicated, pigs do not grow well if they have too little space (Hyun et al., 1998). The APS frequently argued for further increases of ﬂoor space to enhance animal welfare. The sector representative LTO opposed this, arguing that additional costs would undermine the Dutch export position and the Dutch ministry concurred. 5.2.

The business studies school from WUR explored the market introduction of Hercules. In parallel with the technical research they carried out surveys among pig farmers to assess their judgement. These farmers were quite positive about the reduction of emissions and the processing of manure. They also thought the concept was close to what consumers desired but had serious doubts about energy use (the concept used various active systems that consumed energy) and economic proﬁtability (Joldersma, 2003). By 2005, when the technical research was ﬁnished, the world of pig farming had changed signiﬁcantly compared to the late 1990s. Although animal welfare and environmental concerns were still present in the societal and political debate, they were less prominent. The sense of urgency that had followed the 1997 outbreak of swine fever and other animal diseases had largely disappeared. In 2003, a new government had taken ofﬁce that strongly emphasised deregulation.

Many historical cases that have been studied by transition scholars were driven by commercial motivations of pioneers and entrepreneurs, e.g. cars replacing horses (Geels, 2005), mechanical cargo handling machines replacing manual unloading of ships (Van Driel and Schot, 2005), steamships replacing sailing ships (Geels, 2002), jet engines replacing piston engines (Geels, 2006a).

Increases in normative pressure are likely to have more effect on transitions if they coincide with and can become linked to other developments, leading to a particular ‘package’ (Kingdon, 1984) that can be pushed through. We turn to these alignments now. 2.3. Alignments with other socio-technical developments Normative pressure, even when it is increasing, cannot bring about substantial regime change on its own. We argue that such regime changes require alignments of normative pressure with other socio-technical developments in Fig. 1, e.g. regulations, consumer demand, or market pressure from supermarkets, nicheinnovations, etc. While social movements may try to inﬂuence the developments in other domains (market, technology/innovation, 266 B.

Mainstream researchers with close ties to the regime tend to generate incremental innovations, while researchers that deviate from established regime rules tend to focus on more radical innovations. The latter are what Van de Poel (2000) calls outside professionals, who tend to operate at the niche level in the MLP.6 These streams have their own dynamics, but also partially interact. Building on Kingdon, we suggest that the chances for normatively-oriented transitions greatly increase if various streams can be combined into a coherent ‘package’. Despite his policy focus, Kingdon (1984: 21) articulates this dynamic eloquently: “The separate streams come together at certain critical times, solutions become joined to problems, and both of them are joined to favourable political forces. This coupling is most likely when policy windows (opportunities for pushing pet proposals or conceptions of problems) are open. (. . .) Windows are opened either by the appearance of compelling problems or by happenings in the political stream. (. . .) Signiﬁcant movement is much more likely if problems, policy proposals, and politics are all coupled into a package” (Kingdon, 1984: 21). Windows</context>

But windows also close again and problems that may have risen on the agenda because of social movement activities and normative pressures, can also fall down again if they cannot be linked to a technological solution. Kingdon (1984: 210) suggests that (policy) windows may be missed if proposals and solutions “have not already gone through the long gestation process before the window opens”. In contrast to Kingdon, who suggests that the four streams are independent (he only sees somewhat free ﬂoating policy entrepreneurs as bringing about linkages), we believe that actors in problem and technical solution streams may actively work on bringing about alignments and linkages.

Furthermore, the Dutch ruling (‘Varkensbesluit’) speciﬁed that in due course it would be forbidden to keep pigs on ﬂoors that were 100% slatted (to collect manure and urine in underlying cellars). For new pigsties, 0.3 m2 per pig would have to be solid and by 2003 fully slatted ﬂoors would be prohibited (Spoolder et al., 2003). The EU directive does not have such a provision. Shortly after the outbreak of swine fever the Dutch government decided that in 1998 the ﬂoor space standard would be raised to 1 m2 and that by the year 2000 the mandated solid ﬂoor area would be 0.6 m2 (LNV, 1999). The sector protested heavily as this implied they could keep 35% fewer pigs in the same area as their European competitors. The Dutch government conceded and the rules were somewhat relaxed. As of 2008, new pigsties would have to provide 0.8 m2 per pig which would increase to 1 m2 by 2013 with a solid area of 0.4 m2 (Enting et al., 2006).

Strikingly, none of them implemented anything near the 2.4 m2 per pig considered necessary by the scientists and that was used in the Raalte demonstration project (Interviews APS and LTO). The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture had high expectations of the PCC concept. Late 2007, the Minister of Agriculture published a white paper on animal welfare which set the goal of keeping 5% of the animals in ‘integrally sustainable’ husbandry systems in 2011 (LNV, 2007, p. 5). It was not speciﬁed what this meant but for pigs the solution favoured by the ministry was Pigs in Comfort Class (Interview LNV ministry). The sector, however, was less enthusiastic because the PCC concept would make pork more expensive. As a result, stakeholders in the pork chain, including farmers, slaughtering industry and supermarkets were not keen on moving in this direction (Interviews Vion, LTO). In terms of our conceptual approach, the timing of PCC better aligned with the regulatory dynamic than Hercules. In 2007, three streams came together, notably the problem, regulatory a</context>

We will address this in Section 2.3 where we discuss alignments between normative pressure with other socio-technical developments. The normative pressure on regimes increases if these three sub-processes grow stronger. This increase depends on (changing) circumstances and events. Major shocks or accidents, for instance, can push an issue higher on the agenda and strengthen the empirical credibility of particular discourses. Issues also compete for public attention with other problems (Hilgartner and Bosk, 1988) and often experience issue-attention cycles (McComas and Shanahan, 1999; Brossard et al., 2004) with problems rising and falling on public agendas as media and audiences get bored and search for new issues. Increases in normative pressure are likely to have more effect on transitions if they coincide with and can become linked to other developments, leading to a particular ‘package’ (Kingdon, 1984) that can be pushed through. We turn to these alignments now. 2.3. Alignments with other socio-technical developments Normative pressure, even when it is increasing, cannot bring about substantial regime change on its own.

Animal welfare and innovations in pregnant sow husbandry systems 4.1. Rising expectations on group housing (1980–1990) In 1973, the Ministry of Agriculture established a commission “Animal husbandry – animal welfare” to investigate how pregnant sows were kept. In 1975, the committee published a report that concluded that sow husbandry had some weaknesses, which could be remedied with various technical means (NRLO, 1975). In practice, however, little changed in the following years. The debate intensiﬁed in the early 1980s. In 1982 the APS released a study that was very critical of sow husbandry, focussing on chained sows stating: “The short chain only allows the sow to stand op or lie down. Turning around or walking a few steps is out of the question” (Dierenbescherming, 1982, p. 7). The study concluded that the way sows were kept in the Netherlands was ‘completely unacceptable’ (p. 41). With various campaigns, the APS tried to generate public awareness.

To further conceptualize these relations, we suggest that enterprises such as pig farms operate simultaneously in two environments (Oliver, 1997): (1) a task environment which includes social groups that engage in economic exchanges and transactions with industries (e.g. consumers, suppliers); economic competitiveness, efﬁciency, and ﬁnancial performance are dominant selection criteria, and (2) an institutional environment which contains social groups that affect industries in non-commercial ways, e.g. policy makers, social movements, the wider public, media, public opinion; regulatory legitimacy and cultural-normative legitimacy are the main selection criteria (Suchman, 1995).

The two cases concern two sub-sectors in pig husbandry in the Netherlands and the inﬂuence from animal welfare concerns (1970–2008). We have chosen these cases because animal welfare concerns are entirely about normative considerations in contrast to negative externalities that affect people or sectors. They differ from concerns over pig manure, which caused functional problems of water pollution, stench, ammonia emissions and acid rain that hindered water companies, local residents and urbanites. Deﬁning socio-technological regimes as rules and routines (Rip and Kemp, 1998), in tandem with technological artefacts in practice, the two comparative cases are about technical changes in pig husbandry systems (e.g. automatic feeding systems, manure removal systems, and ﬂoor design), certain changes in husbandry routines (e.g. feeding routines) and market changes. The regime reconﬁgurations in both cases are still ‘in the making’, although one case has progressed substantially while the other has not.

As there are no existing conceptual frameworks that address the relation between normative contestation and innovation we will combine some existing approaches to tackle our research question.

Niches are seen as the locus for learning and experimentation with radical innovation. The socio-technical regime refers to the semicoherent set of rules and actors that reproduce, maintain and incrementally change elements that together fulﬁl a societal function such as transport or meat production and consumption. The regime is characterized by stability and path dependence because of lockin mechanisms on various dimensions (e.g. costs, shared beliefs, sunk investments, capabilities, user preferences and life styles).

Introduction This article explicitly introduces the topic of normative orientation into the debate about socio-technical transitions and system innovation (Kemp et al., 1998; Elzen et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2005). Many historical cases that have been studied by transition scholars were driven by commercial motivations of pioneers and entrepreneurs, e.g. cars replacing horses (Geels, 2005), mechanical cargo handling machines replacing manual unloading of ships (Van Driel and Schot, 2005), steamships replacing sailing ships (Geels, 2002), jet engines replacing piston engines (Geels, 2006a).

Elzen et al. / Research Policy 40 (2011) 263–275 The topic of normative orientation is particularly difﬁcult for transitions ‘in the making’, because multiple transition paths often co-exist and are pursued simultaneously by different actors and social groups (Stirling, 2009).5 Which possible path eventually becomes dominant thus depends on interactions between multiple actors, moves and countermoves, strategic games, shifting alliances, political support, economic success, technological learning processes and changing perceptions. The article’s general research question is: How, when and why is normative contestation of existing regimes effective in inﬂuencing the orientation of transitions in the making? By ‘effective in inﬂuencing the orientation’ we mean that the developments in the regime move in a direction that the contestants advocate. We address this ques</context>

The crucial economic factor was the export of Dutch pork to the UK. As of 1 January 1999, pregnant sows in the UK would have to be kept in groups. UK pig producers, animal welfare and consumer organizations put pressure on British retailers to sell only bacon and other pig meat that came from pigs whose mothers had been kept in groups. They were successful and because the UK formed a large export market, the Dutch slaughter industry became interested in ensuring that a signiﬁcant share of Dutch pregnant sows would be kept in groups (Vermeer et al., 1999). This made Dumeco, then a major slaughter company that later became part of the Vion group, give a bonus to farmers who kept pregnant sows in groups (Interview LTO). Thus, the normatively driven innovation in the niche aligned with market developments in the regime. Also at the European level, pig husbandry increasingly became a matter of concern. The European Commission enacted new regulations that resembled the Dutch although they lagged a few years. New EU regulation forbade keeping pregnant sows on chains as of 2005 (2001 in the Netherlands) and by 2013 all pregnant sows in the EU should </context>

Its 1984 Fig. 3. ‘Chain-sow’ (Dierenbescherming, 1982, p. 26). report was quite critical on sow husbandry (Commissie Welzijn Varkens, 1984). The APS started discussions with the ministry and the pig industry on how to proceed. In 1986, they came to a joint agreement that individual housing of sows should become forbidden as soon as ‘acceptable systems for group housing would be available’ (Dierenbescherming, 1999, p. 21). To realise this, the ministry started working on future legislation (Werkgroep, 1988). Furthermore, all research into housing of sows was integrated in a national programme. In the period 1987–1990 a research project was carried out at the Research Institute for Pig Husbandry at Rosmalen, comparing individual systems with a group housing system. For the latter, the main innovation needed would be a system to feed the sows individually. Such a system already existed for cows and was adapted for pregnant sows. The initial design consisted of an open space where the sows were kept in groups that was connected to an electronic sow feeding station with individual boxes via access g</context>
