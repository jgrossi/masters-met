In the last decade several surveys of primate care and training programs highlight a common theme; despite scientiﬁc evidence that animal training can be effective in reducing
stress, increasing efﬁciency and improving veterinary care, animal training is not widely
incorporated into animal care and management programs in laboratory settings. This is
particularly important with the recent release of the internationally recognized version of
the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” by the National Research Council.
The Guide includes multiple recommendations to incorporate training methods into husbandry and experimental procedures. To address the divide between the regulatory and
scientiﬁcally based support for animal training, and a broader establishment of formal animal training programs, this paper will: describe three approaches to structuring animal
training programs; provide rationale as to why facilities should have animal training programs; report on a recent survey of animal training programs at nine, large USA facilities
housing nonhuman primates; discuss important elements of an animal training program;
discuss negative reinforcement and means to minimize its use; and ﬁnally give a detailed
description of a facility-wide animal training program.

1. What is a laboratory primate training program?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985890894736842">
The systematic application of operant and classical
conditioning techniques to training primates living in laboratory facilities has become much more common over
the last two decades (Bloomsmith et al., 1998; Clay et al.,
2009; Coleman et al., 2008; Fernstrom et al., 2009; Laule
et al., 1996, 2003; Perlman et al., 2010; Reinhardt, 1997;

ﬁeld has been extending the use of positive reinforcement training (PRT) techniques to increase the primates’
cooperation with animal management and research procedures. There have been a large number of publications
describing training technique, training terminology and
various uses for training (Bloomsmith et al., 2007; Coleman
and Maier, 2010; Kazdin, 2001; Laule and Whittaker,
2001, 2007; Ramirez, 1999; Schapiro et al., 2005). However, issues related to designing and initiating animal
training programs have been less well described. Animal
training programs are an important reﬁnement in the
care of laboratory primates as they can help to reduce
stress experienced by animals and improve their research
use by minimizing this confound. The programs may
include dedicated personnel, education programs, routines
J.E. Perlman et al. / Applied Animal Behaviour Science 137 (2012) 114–126
to increase consistency among trainers, documentation
systems, and evaluation of trained animals. The objective
of this manuscript is to assist those caring for laboratory
primates in the development of new, or in the reﬁnement
of existing, primate training programs.
2. Three approaches to structuring animal training
programs
Animal training programs generally fall into three categories: project-based programs, section-wide programs
and facility-wide programs (Whittaker et al., 2008). Within
one institution, multiple approaches may be simultaneously operating or programs may evolve from one type
of structure to another. It is essential to understand the
focus and breadth of the training program to maximize
effectiveness for the animals and staff. Using the framework presented here, one can determine which approach
is best suited for the animal care needs and goals of the
institution.
2.1. Project-based approach
A project-based training program typically includes a
few animals or groups of animals and a limited number of
staff. Speciﬁc behavioral objectives can be addressed. For
example, one group of primates may be trained: (1) by the
primary caregiver to shift from one area to another; (2)
by the veterinary technician to present an arm for ointment application; and (3) by a lab technician to calmly
present for pole attachment to the collar. Resulting beneﬁts
of the project-based training approach include a positive
inﬂuence on animal welfare with the application of PRT
to improve voluntary animal cooperation, and job satisfaction is often enhanced for the person(s) implementing
the training who may take great pride and ownership in
the training project. If successful, other technicians may
take notice of the training accomplishment and may be
motivated to incorporate training into their daily routine. A
project-based approach can serve as the catalyst for other
training projects, and help build the foundation for the
facility’s animal training program. Project-based projects,
when successful, can expand to a section-wide approach.
There are common drawbacks of a project-based
approach. This approach typically does not receive the
institution’s full support, particularly with regard to the
dedication of time and monetary resources. Training is
a skill that must be developed, and with this approach,
support for continuing education such as conference or
workshop attendance is limited. Additionally, supervisor
oversight may be minimal, which may result in compromised safety of the trainer or the animal when technique,
facilities, and protocols are not adequately assessed. Once
animals are trained by the primary trainer, behaviors
should be transferred to others. In the absence of direct
supervision, this process may be difﬁcult to implement,
therefore reducing the scope of application for both the
animals and institution. Finally, few animals beneﬁt from
the training conducted in a small project, and the project
may not persist if the motivated primary trainer leaves the
facility.

2.2. Section-wide approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992294772727273">
A section-wide approach to training is typically
supported within a particular department or research laboratory by the manager, and involves staff implementing
training toward speciﬁc objectives. For example, the objective may be training all primates in a particular laboratory
to calmly move into a restraint chair. This section-wide
approach typically involves a subset of animals at a facility, and there may be support for continuing education
and skills development. Due to the broader scope of this
approach, when applied properly, animal management
will be improved for that particular area or section, and
oversight of safety for animals and humans is available.
If successful, the example may serve as an impetus for
changes in other departments or laboratories within the
facility and, over time, development of a facility-wide
approach may occur.
One drawback of a section-wide approach is limited
communication among all those working with the same
animals. For example, animals will be trained to calmly
move into a restraint chair for research purposes but similar animal movement activities, such as calmly entering
a transfer box for animal care purposes, would unlikely
beneﬁt. Further, if an animal is assigned to another study
with a different manager, there may be little communication between managers regarding the training the animal
received. The program may not persist if the manager
leaves his/her position.
2.3. Facility-wide approach
The most comprehensive is the facility-wide approach
to structuring a training program. This program is implemented throughout the institution and is supported by
multiple management and departmental levels including animal care, veterinary staff, colony management,
behavioral management, research groups, administration,
occupational health and safety, facility or operations managers, and perhaps even public relations or regulatory
oversight committees (e.g., Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee, IACUC). Many more people and animals are
positively impacted in comparison to the other approaches.
The institutional commitment to the facility-wide training
program is demonstrated by hiring for dedicated positions,
supplying continuing education opportunities and training
for staff, providing the necessary tools, facility modiﬁcations and safety oversight. Training responsibilities are
included in appropriate job descriptions and supervisors
ensure accountability for training responsibilities. Goals
and objectives of the training program are communicated
throughout the facility. Progress toward centralized training goals are assessed and reﬁned, as needed, to move the
program forward. A facility-wide training approach creates
a framework of safety, education, consistency and communication for the multiple project-based and section-wide
training applications that are often present in larger institutions.
There are few drawbacks to such a facility-wide
program, but they are signiﬁcant. Development and implementation of such a program takes time and monetary

resources. There are signiﬁcant costs associated with hiring additional personnel, providing training and continuing
education to all staff involved, modifying facilities and providing supplies to support the training program. Additional
drawbacks are staff frustration with perceived additional
responsibilities and time expenditure, as well as lack of
interest to “ﬁx what ain’t broke”.

3. Why primate facilities should have animal
training programs
3.1. Regulatory compliance
3.3. Increase the efﬁciency of working with primates
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996769">
Although animal training requires an initial time investment, it can lead to a savings in the personnel time required
for some tasks over the long-term. Many procedures, such
as moving primates within their enclosures for cleaning,
transporting them between enclosures and collecting biological samples, can be completed much faster once the
primates have been trained. McKinley et al. (2003) reported
saving 91% of the time required to weigh a marmoset by
training them to target at the front of the cage and climb
onto the scale (174.25 s reduced to 159.5 s). Veeder et al.
(2009) trained a group of mangabeys to move from one area
of the enclosure to another for cleaning, saving 46 min a day
of animal care staff time. The total training time required
was recouped in fewer than 35 days. PRT also improves the
ability to collect samples without requiring anesthesia or
social separation. Stone et al. (1994) quickly and reliably
obtained urine samples from chimpanzees without necessitating social isolation, and Kelley and Bramblett (1981)
had similar results with a group of vervet monkeys.
There is increased interest from regulatory agencies
on the effects of animal training on the welfare of nonhuman primates. The recent version of the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (2011) emphasizes
the importance and beneﬁts of animal training programs
with the following recommendation: “Habituating animals
to routine husbandry or experimental procedures should
be encouraged whenever possible as it may assist the animal to better cope with a captive environment by reducing
stress associated with novel procedures or people. The type
and duration of habituation needed will be determined by
the complexity of the procedure. In most cases, principles
of operant conditioning may be employed during training
sessions, using progressive behavioral shaping, to induce
voluntary cooperation with procedures” (pp. 64–65). In a
2010 report of site visits to chimpanzee facilities in the
United States of America, The Ofﬁce of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) also supported the notion that PRT
may help in reducing stress and concluded that when
safe and feasible, nonhuman primates should be afforded
positive reinforcement training opportunities (OLAW,
2010).
Training facilitates veterinary care by improving the
ability to conduct procedures, and observe animals more
closely and more frequently without the use of anesthesia
or restraint. Primates voluntarily participate in procedures
such as conscious blood collection (Coleman et al., 2008;
Laule et al., 1996), urine collection (Laule et al., 1996;
Perlman et al., 2010; Stone et al., 1994), subcutaneous
injections (Perlman et al., 2004; Schapiro et al., 2005), and
voluntary intramuscular injections for anesthesia, antibiotics or vaccines (Lambeth et al., 2006; Schapiro et al., 2005;
Videan et al., 2005).

3.2. Stress reduction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.951219555555556">
3.5. Provide opportunities for choice and control
Experience has shown that trained animals consistently
voluntarily participate in veterinary and research procedures, and are less stressed while doing so (Lambeth et al.,
2006; Reinhardt et al., 1990; Turkkan, 1990). Training laboratory animals to cooperate reduces the need for physical
restraint and/or anesthesia, and thus reduces the stress
that accompanies those procedures. Evidence for stress
reduction includes reductions in cortisol levels, stressrelated abortions, physical resistance to handling, and fear
responses such as fear-grinning, screaming, and acute diarrhea (Clay et al., 2009; Moseley and Davis, 1989; Reinhardt
et al., 1990; Vertein and Reinhardt, 1989). Chimpanzees
who voluntarily presented for injection of an anesthetic
agent had signiﬁcantly reduced physiological measures
of stress when compared to those who did not cooperate and were anesthetized via chemical darts (Lambeth
et al., 2006). These results were supported by within and
between subjects’ comparisons. A study evaluating the
effect of PRT on cortisol, hematology and cardiovascular
measures in cynomolgus macaques found subjects exposed
to daily PRT sessions showed decreased measures of stress
compared to those not exposed to PRT (Koban et al.,
2005).
PRT enables animals to learn about the consequences
of their actions and it relies on their voluntary participation (Bassett and Buchanan-Smith, 2007). If there are
welfare beneﬁts to training that are above and beyond
the beneﬁts of having animals conditioned to calmly and
efﬁciently comply with various husbandry, research and
veterinary needs, then this is another reason to invest time
and resources into animal training programs. The data on
primates indicate that experience with controllable events
fosters exploration, enhances performance on cognitive
tasks, and may attenuate stress reactivity (Hanson et al.,
1976; Mineka et al., 1986; Roma et al., 2006; Washburn
et al., 1991). These are positive contributions to psychological well-being (Novak and Suomi, 1988) and PRT may
provide similar beneﬁts to well-being by stimulating activity that offers primates choice and control over some
aspects of their environment.
3.4. Improve veterinary care and research
3.6. Enhance social housing
There are challenges with managing social groups of
primates that can be addressed through PRT techniques.
One particularly useful technique, known as cooperative
J.E. Perlman et al. / Applied Animal Behaviour Science 137 (2012) 114–126
feeding (Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Whittaker, 2005)
involves reinforcing the dominant individual for allowing
subordinate group members to have desirable resources
such as food, enrichment, or attention from a caregiver.
This technique can reduce ﬁghting during meal times
(Bloomsmith et al., 1994). To further enhance socialization, primates can be taught to tolerate proximity to
one another, and to touch each other gently (Cox, 1987;
Desmond et al., 1987; Schapiro et al., 2001). This type of
training has potential to beneﬁt the process of introducing
unfamiliar primates to one another (Laule and Desmond,
1990). A more advanced technique, collaborative training, involves training animals to work together toward a
common goal by rewarding their mutual efforts (i.e. two
individuals are rewarded for working together to move
an object). The use of collaborative training to purposefully create social ties may also enhance social relationships
(Laule and Whittaker, 2007).

3.7. Address behavioral problems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996827">
Scientists have evaluated PRT’s impact on behavioral
problems to determine whether it can reduce, eliminate
or prevent the expression of problematic behaviors, and
whether these treatment effects generalize to the primates’ overall behavioral repertoire (Baker et al., 2010;
Bloomsmith et al., 2007).
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.421432">
3.7.1. Stereotyped behavior
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99208975">
Training can reduce stereotyped behavior (behavior
that is repetitive, invariant and seems to be without function, such as pacing or repeated ﬂipping, Mason, 1999)
during the period of time the trainer is working with the
primates (Bloomsmith et al., 1997; Morgan et al., 1993).
However there are conﬂicting ﬁndings as to whether PRT
has a generalized effect on abnormal behavior of primates outside of training sessions: two studies showed no
such generalization (Baker et al., 2009; Bloomsmith et al.,
1997), while three other studies did show a generalized
decrease in stereotypies when the trainer was not present
(Bourgeois and Brent, 2005; Coleman and Maier, 2010;
Pomerantz and Terkel, 2009). Training behaviors that are
incompatible with the stereotyped behavior may be an
effective therapy (e.g., reinforcement for remaining still,
for subjects that were pacing) (Bourgeois and Brent, 2005).
PRT may help to prevent the development of stereotyped
behavior, as has been found with young nursery-reared
rhesus monkeys (Brunelli et al., 2009). Combining PRT with
other treatment approaches (social group manipulations,
drug therapy) reduced the extreme stereotyped behavior
in a male bonobo (Prosen and Bell, 2000). While there does
seem to be promise in using PRT as a treatment and perhaps even as a preventative measure, it is important to note
that in no studies did the training eliminate stereotyped
behaviors.
3.7.2. Self-injurious behavior (SIB)
Several studies have evaluated whether SIB can be
modiﬁed through training. A chimpanzee exhibiting SIB
was successfully treated with a combination of therapies
including enrichment, socialization, drug therapy and PRT
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998487">
117
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.996905571428571">
(Bourgeois et al., 2007). Staff avoided the chimpanzee when
he was exhibiting behaviors associated with his SIB, he
was trained to perform an incompatible behavior, and he
was desensitized to arousing stimuli. In combination with
intensive enrichment, socialization changes and drug therapy, the training signiﬁcantly reduced his SIB for several
years (S. Bourgeois, pers. comm.). A similar combination
approach was used by Prosen and Bell (2000) with a bonobo
who exhibited a great deal of SIB, and it was very successful
in reducing his SIB.
In another study, SIB in a baboon was reduced using
a functional analysis (FA) technique (Dorey et al., 2009).
FA is an assessment technique used in humans to treat
behavioral problems by systematically identifying what
is reinforcing a speciﬁc behavior, and then manipulating
that reinforcement. Since the FA revealed the SIB was positively reinforced by human attention, during treatment SIB
was ignored by staff, and the behavior decreased. This FA
approach, while time intensive, shows promise in the treatment of some behavioral problems in nonhuman primates.
3.7.3. Fear and aggression
Fearful behavior in singly housed laboratory primates
has been successfully treated with PRT. Individuals who
showed fear responses to speciﬁc, routine husbandry tasks
(e.g. removing food from a cage, spraying water from a
hose) were desensitized to these experiences, and they displayed signiﬁcantly less fearful responses than those study
animals given additional time to acclimate to their environment, or those who underwent basic husbandry training
(Clay et al., 2009). A recent study using PRT techniques
to reduce rhesus macaque aggression toward humans was
effective in reducing the behavior during and outside of
training sessions (Minier et al., 2011).

3.7.4. Feces throwing
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.855239142857143">
A FA approach was used to assess feces throwing by
a chimpanzee, and conﬁrmed that human attention was
reinforcing this behavior (Martin et al., 2011). The subject was trained to touch a speciﬁc target, or a “functional
communication tool” which served as a request for the
human caregiver to give positive attention to the chimpanzee which reduced the undesirable behavior by about
80%. This effect generalized in the presence of unfamiliar
people.

electronically, and were based on the state of the facilities’
animal training programs at that time. Each facility had the
option to respond or not to each question listed and some
questions were not answered by all facilities; therefore
the number of responses for each question is indicated in
the information below.
4.1. Survey summary, animal training programs
Of the nine reporting facilities, all indicated that they
trained both singly and socially housed primates. Four had
formalized or documented animal training programs, and
ﬁve reported they were in the process of formalizing an animal training program, but that resources such as staff time
(three of ﬁve), funding (two of ﬁve), and qualiﬁed staff (two
of ﬁve) were impeding the implementation. All nine facilities reported animal training programs had been, or were
being initiated by the behavior management units, with
animal care and husbandry (two of nine) and research and
investigation (one of nine) also reported as training program initiators. The respondents reported that their animal
training programs were created to assist research personnel (eight), animal care and husbandry personnel (seven),
and both behavior management and veterinary care personnel (six).
Two methods were identiﬁed as the most effective for
garnering institutional support for animal training programs (ﬁve of eight responding facilities): a presentation
using slides or video; and beginning training with a small
number of animals (see Table 1). This suggests that demonstration via visual examples of animal training piques staff
interest and that small, pilot training projects are effective
in gaining institutional support.
Three of ﬁve responding facilities agreed that having
full-time stafﬁng was a beneﬁt to formalizing their animal
training program, and two others stated either that it would
have been easier to start with full-time staff, or that they
never had full-time training staff and believe this is why
the animal training program has not been fully engaged.
In total, ﬁve full-time (four within a behavior management program and one in a hybrid behavior management
and animal care position) and 26 part-time trainers (11
within behavior management programs, 5 within animal
care programs, 10 in other programs) were employed in the

facilities. This suggests a growing trend in animal training
expertise and implementation. The majority of formalized animal training is conducted by behavior management
staff, followed by research staff and animal care and husbandry staff, who are reported to train about the same
number of primates.
Five of the nine facilities reported the ways in which
their training programs are managed (see Table 2). The
remaining four facilities noted a combination of these components is in development or they are managing animal
training on an animal-by-animal or as-needed basis.
4.2. Survey summary, behaviors and techniques
Despite most facilities maintaining animal numbers
in the thousands, and increased resources being directed
toward the development of training programs, relatively
few animals were reported as being trained in formalized
programs (Fig. 1). This ﬁnding probably is due to the early
stage of development of many of the training programs.
All facilities indicated the use of shaping by approximations as a PRT method, six facilities used both
active desensitization and cooperative/collaborative training methods (see Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Reinhardt,
2003; Schapiro et al., 2001; Wilson and Davison, 1971 for
description of the methods), and four facilities used contraaggression training for human-directed aggression (see
Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Clay et al., 2009; Minier et al., 2011
for description of the method). PRT was used to train all of
the speciﬁc husbandry and research behaviors described in

Table 3, and negative reinforcement training (NRT) was also
applied for some behaviors. Punishment methods were not
used to train animals at any facility.
4.3. Survey summary, beneﬁts and current constraints
Constraints on the formalization of training programs
were reported and may be based on real or perceived
concerns. Monetary expense was reported as the highest
concern (see Table 4). Half of the facilities listed concerns
about increased staff injury, research interference, and

to address safety in the working environment. These programs may have the means to evaluate the safety of training
tools and techniques used within animal training programs.
5.2. Integration of PRT into research objectives
5. Elements of a training program
The most effective primate training program will be
one that includes clearly deﬁned training goals, accountability, assessment and reﬁnement of training effort, and
continuing education for staff. Many of these programmatic
recommendations are also described in other published
papers (Colahan and Breder, 2003; Prescott et al., 2005;
Young and Cipreste, 2004).
</bodyText>

5.1. Safety
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999228698412699">
Fundamental to any animal training program is human
and animal safety (Colahan and Breder, 2003; but see
Young and Cipreste, 2004 for examples of safety features
within a training program). People have good reason to
be concerned for their safety when working with primates
since they are unpredictable, strong, and capable of inﬂicting great harm. Depending on the species and zoonotic
disease risk, personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
gloves, cover clothing, a mask and eye protection may
be necessary. Training can be accomplished with trainers wearing such PPE, and facility policies for PPE should
always be followed while training primates. Trainers must
be aware of their own positioning near the enclosure when
training, and should know how far an animal can reach
out, being conscious of whether social companions are
nearby and may try to grab the trainer. Understanding
species-typical behavior, speciﬁcally fearful behavior, can
help reduce the risk of trainer-directed aggression. Safety
can be enhanced through the use of engineering controls
and safety apparatus such as an enclosed “blood sleeve”
which allows animals to present arms or legs safely outside
of the cage for conscious blood collection, while decreasing the opportunity for the primate to grab the trainer
(Coleman et al., 2008). Targets are used to position primates with their hands in view or holding a peg that falls
if the animal lets go; these tools enhance trainer safety
when working in close proximity to primates. If food reinforcers are offered to the primate by hand, precautions to
reduce the trainers risk of being bitten or grabbed need
to be taken. Two examples include delivering the food at
a distance using a bottle to squirt juice directly into the
primate’s mouth, or placing a receptacle on the cage front
where food can be safely deposited by the trainer and then
retrieved by the animal.
There is a need for the safety of training programs to
be tested. The survey of the NPRCs showed that half of
the respondents reported safety concerns at their facilities, however about half of the behavioral managers
reported increased staff safety as a beneﬁt of a training program. These conﬂicting perspectives highlight the need for
Nearly half of the NPRC’s listed that animal training
was a research interference concern and 38% of respondents listed increased animal stress-related behavior as a
concern. Researchers and behavioral managers can work
together to establish guidelines for incorporating PRT
into protocols. PRT, when applied properly, desensitizes
subjects to potentially stressful elements of research procedures. At the Yerkes National Primate Research Center
(YNPRC), the behavioral management scientist reviews
IACUC protocols and may suggest or require incorporating
PRT techniques to prepare subjects for aspects of the study
(McMillan et al., 2007).
In a research setting, time constraints can inﬂuence
what training is accomplished. Researchers usually do not
budget for subject costs in advance of beginning study procedures, but this may be necessary to have the time to
train subjects to cooperate with study procedures. A greater
commitment to PRT requires considering costs and logistics associated with pre-study animal arrangements, such
as acquiring animals ahead of the onset of the study, initiating training while animals are in quarantine, and ensuring
appropriate staff expertise. In some cases vendors may be
able to provide primates that have received some level of
training or conditioning which may then expedite the animal training process for speciﬁc research procedures. All
should be considered when planning research studies and
writing grant proposals to support research.
The selection of subjects for some studies may be
aided with the involvement of behavioral management
staff members. At the Oregon NPRC, monkey temperament
characteristics have been useful in identifying animals who
are more responsive to PRT than others, and thus may
be more suitable subjects for particular studies (Coleman
et al., 2005). At the California NPRC the animal record keeping system indicates if an animal is trained or in the process
of being trained for a behavior. The Behavioral Management group can be contacted to get speciﬁc information
about the training.

5.3. Continuing education
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979800375">
There are many opportunities available to those
in the laboratory animal community to broaden animal training knowledge. There are numerous books,
articles, internet discussion forums, and websites on
animal training (see Laule and Whittaker, 2001; see
also Prescott et al., 2005; Pryor, 2002; Ramirez, 1999).
Workshops such as the “Primate Training and Enrichment Workshop” (http://ptew.kccmr.org/) are available
and conferences, including International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association (IMATA) (http://www.imata.org)

<bodyText confidence="0.976453804878049">
and the Animal Behavior Management Alliance (ABMA)
(http://www.theabma.org/), focus mostly on training.
Animal training consultants can be useful resources. Additional continuing education opportunities that can be
supported within the institution include journal clubs,
interest groups, an animal training committee, and lectures to hear invited speakers with expertise in behavior
management and animal training. If the primate laboratory employs an animal training specialist, this person can
conduct PRT workshops, lectures, and practical learning
opportunities for individuals working with nonhuman primates. The Joint Working Group on Reﬁnement (2009)
recommends learning outcomes for staff training of familiarity with behavior and how to interact with the relevant
species in a positive way.
5.4. Documentation and record keeping
Documentation is an important component of formalized training programs (Prescott et al., 2005; Young
and Cipreste, 2004). Communication of institutional or
programmatic training goals, training applications and
expectations, and providing opportunities for consistency
and communication among trainers and staff who will be
maintaining any trained behaviors are vital in the success
of a training program. In general there should be some
record of: (a) which animals have been taught what behaviors; (b) the approach used for their training; (c) the cues
used; (d) the animal’s expected behavioral response to the
cue; and (e) some measure of the animal’s consistency in
responding.
Shaping plans, established training protocols, and training documentation sheets are used to record and review
training progress. Training documentation sheets should
include data such as number and duration of sessions,
shaping plan steps trained during a session, and the animal’s response. These data assists trainers in summarizing
training progress and identifying problems. Training documentation improves communication, which is especially
important if multiple trainers work with an individual animal.
5.5. Encouraging consistency and transfer of trained
behaviors
Most primates in laboratories work with several people on a daily basis, and they are often trained by multiple
people. Documentation of universal cues and expected
responses can help increase training consistency across
multiple individuals. For each behavior there should be the
verbal cue, photograph and description of the corresponding visual cue (see Fig. 2a) and a photograph and description
of the animals expected behavioral response (see Fig. 2b).
If all animals are trained using the same cues and all trainers train a behavior to look a speciﬁc way, inconsistency
is minimized. For example, see Minier et al. (2011) for an
assessment of PRT progress using single and multiple trainers to reduce human-directed aggression.
There is often concern over whether primates trained
by one individual will perform the same behavior for others, and dealing with this “transfer” of trained behaviors

between trainers is important. In one model, the primary
trainer is responsible for initial training, following a shaping plan and documenting training sessions. Once the
primate is performing the behavior reliably (e.g., four out
of ﬁve times asked) the behavior is considered trained. At
this point, the trained behavior may be transferred from
the primary trainer to the secondary trainer who will then
be responsible for maintaining the behavior at the same
criterion. At least one study has shown that primates’ performance can be sustained through this transfer process
(Bloomsmith et al., 1998). Not everyone will become a
good primary trainer, but everyone working with primates
should learn the basic principles of animal training and
apply them effectively to maintain trained behaviors.

5.6. Evaluation of training program
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989524">
The evaluation of animal training programs is recommended to assess whether the program is meeting
the needs of the animals, and set goals for husbandry,
veterinary care, and research. Individuals implementing
the training should also be assessed regularly for technique, consistency and progress. Regular meetings among
staff who are planning and implementing the training are

encouraged so progress can be highlighted, and challenges
can be discussed and addressed.
6. Identifying and minimizing negative
reinforcement training (NRT) methods
NRT is widely used in primate facilities (NPRC survey
described above; Prescott and Buchanan-Smith, 2007) and
its use needs to be thoughtfully addressed. Common types
of NRT include:
1. using the squeeze back to move an animal to the cage
front for an injection or treatment;
2. loud voices, clapping or tapping on the cage, threatening
with a net or leather gloves to move an animal from one
location to another;
3. a person entering an enclosure to get an animal to move
away from that person and into a transport box or tunnel;
4. spraying water behind an animal to encourage movement from one location to another; and
5. threatening with a dart gun to get an animal to present
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999210938461539">
for an injection.
Often people using these techniques do not recognize
them as negative reinforcement, but this recognition is an
important step in trying to minimize its use.
To date there is no published literature comparing PRT
and NRT techniques on the behavior or well-being of
primates, but there is some literature on other species.
Differences have been found in equine behavior and physiology based on training techniques employed. Horses
trained with PRT exhibited more exploratory behavior and
participated more in training sessions than those trained
with NRT. A higher heart rate in the PRT group in the later
stages of training was considered a positive physiological
response linked to increased motivation to participate and
anticipation of food rewards (Innes and McBride, 2008).
Comparing horses trained only with NRT to those trained
with a blended approach of NRT followed by PRT showed
those in the latter group expressed behaviors and body
postures indicating improved welfare (Warren-Smith and
McGreevy, 2007). Given the widespread application of NRT
in primate facilities similar assessments should be conducted with nonhuman primates to understand the impact
on welfare measures.
There are signiﬁcant challenges to moving from a
NRT-based system toward a more PRT-based program for
laboratory primates. The large numbers of animals to provide PRT to, limitations due to research protocols, and rigid
schedules and feeding times may make a move toward
a more PRT-based program difﬁcult. Rotating staff, staff
turnover or resistance to a new system may further complicate the process of moving to a more PRT-based program.
Of signiﬁcant importance is the fact that the effective use
of PRT is a skill that takes time and effort to develop. However, given the known beneﬁts of PRT, we suggest that
modern laboratory primate training programs should have
the objective of using as little NRT as possible, moving
toward eliminating its use and replacing it with positive
reinforcement.
When PRT is not currently practical as the sole approach
to all needed animal training, careful consideration should
be given to how a combination of PRT and NRT might be
implemented. Even in a system that will use NRT, animals should ﬁrst be given the chance to cooperate before
any aversive stimulus is presented and all staff should use
clear and consistent cues. If it is necessary to use the aversive stimulus, the mildest negative reinforcement that is
effective for an individual animal should be applied. For
example, to move an animal to the front of a cage, instead
of bringing the squeeze back wall all the way forward as
the ﬁrst step, begin by tapping on the latches that release
the squeeze. If the subject does not respond, unlatch the
latches. If still no response, move the squeeze wall a small
way toward the subject, and so on. When the animal does
the correct behavior, immediately provide a reward, and
remove the aversive stimulus. The animal may not accept
the reward when they are uncomfortable or feel threatened, but trainers should continue to offer it. Over time,
the animal may become more comfortable, and take the
food reward. Patience needs to be exercised as the primates
learn to live in a new system.
Other steps toward emphasizing PRT include planning
ahead and preparing animals in advance of veterinary procedures and research protocols by training individuals to
cooperate with some or all aspects of these procedures.
Even if animals can only be trained to cooperate with some
components of a procedure (e.g., blood collection from the
earlobe can begin with rewarding the subject for approaching the front of the cage and presenting the ear; subjects
can be desensitized to the equipment used, such as needles
and alcohol swabs), this is better than using no training at
all.
Another step in minimizing NRT and emphasizing PRT is
to start with small projects that have a high chance of success. This helps staff develop conﬁdence and demonstrates
the efﬁcacy of PRT. Some important steps to take to make
this shift include:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995400333333333">
1. Identify staff roles and responsibilities by determining
who will be the primary trainers responsible for training
new behaviors from start to ﬁnish.
2. Determine what tools and equipment are necessary to
complete training tasks, and acquire them.
3. While it may not be possible to exclusively use PRT,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.7822173">
every effort should be made to move in that direction.
As a working principle, positive alternatives should be
exhausted before any kind of NRT is employed.
4. When NRT is necessary, it should be kept to a minimum
and balanced by delivering positive reinforcement the
majority of the time.
When moving away from a NRT-based system to a more
PRT-based system, two important steps are to determine
the current status of training practices, and to assess the
interactions between primates and humans working with
them. The following questions should be answered:
J.E. Perlman et al. / Applied Animal Behaviour Science 137 (2012) 114–126
1. How are animals moved between enclosures, into transfer boxes, etc.? Does this process use NRT, PRT, a
combination, or are inconsistent approaches used?
2. How do animals respond to daily husbandry practices?
Are they cooperative, fearful, or is their response staffdependent?
3. What types of restrictions exist for the animals on the
study protocols? Are the animals on a restricted food
and/or liquid diet? Is there more than one laboratory
working with the same animals?
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.950622333333333">
4. What animal behavior problems exist for husbandry,
veterinary, and research staff? Are animals noncooperative, aggressive or fearful?
5. With what frequency and intensity do the above problems occur?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9372285">
Finally, assess the daily, weekly, and as-needed interactions between an animal and various staff members
(husbandry, veterinary, and research). When this information is compiled, the results can be surprising. Often
staff may think PRT is used because a treat is provided
to the animal following a procedure. However upon further investigation, one learns that the animal ‘cooperates’
to avoid something (net, squeeze back, etc.) rather than just
to earn the treat. Conducting observations of practices may
reveal undesirable or abnormal behaviors exhibited by the
animals around the time of these procedures. A thorough
assessment of current practices will provide a good platform upon which to begin the development of a PRT-based
management system.
7. Yerkes National Primate Research Center’s
approach
As an example of one primate institution’s approach to
developing an animal training program, the evolution of
the program at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC) will be described. YNPRC houses nearly 3400
nonhuman primates in two locations in a variety of settings from groups living in corrals and runs, to individuals
living in pairs and singly in cages. These animals are used
in the Center’s research studies on topics such as cognition
and behavior, vaccine development and disease progression. The Division of Animal Resources is responsible for
the care and well-being of the nonhuman primates and
numerous principal investigators and laboratory personnel
conduct the behavioral and biomedical research.
Prior to 2005, Yerkes had accomplished animal training
through numerous project-based approaches, often driven
by research laboratories to meet research objectives, and
through section-wide approaches (e.g., the chimpanzee
section began doing some training with most of the animals). A training consultant was used in some situations.
The result was training success for a limited number of animals, but with little consistency in training methods among
people in the various laboratories or across the many animal housing areas. This approach had weaknesses. For
example, a chimpanzee may have been trained to cooperate with an injection by research personnel, but the
behavior was not always transferred to veterinary staff so
that they could successfully inject that same chimpanzee
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999511628571428">
by voluntary means. Because trainers were working independently, there was no consistency or communication
regarding the cues used for training speciﬁc behaviors,
no centralized documentation of training progress, and no
way to track what behaviors a certain primate had learned.
In 2005, Yerkes adopted a facility-wide approach. Efforts
to raise the program to this level included hiring a full-time
primate training specialist (PTS), establishing an animal
training committee, and setting training goals that included
all species of primates housed at Yerkes, and included primates who live in indoor cages, as well as those housed in
small and large groups. The animal training program originates in the Behavioral Management Unit. The PTS is jointly
supervised by the Behavior Management and Animal Care
Units, which emphasizes the importance of training to
both units. The position is a resource to all Yerkes departments that use primates. This position requires an animal
training background, familiarity with operant conditioning theory and practice, strong problem solving skills, and
strong interpersonal communication skills. The success of
a training program relies heavily on selecting an individual
with a calm demeanor, patience, consistency, and an ability
to analyze one’s own behavior (Prescott et al., 2005; Young
and Cipreste, 2004).
The PTS trains people much more often than she trains
nonhuman primates, and this is an important element in a
large primate facility, since one person would only be able
to work with a small fraction of the animals that should be
trained. The PTS responsibilities include educating staff and
faculty about the Yerkes’ animal training program, teaching
operant conditioning terminology and techniques through
seminars and hands-on instruction, serving as an internal
consultant to assist in developing animal training plans,
and assessing progress on training goals. Some training
consultations between the PTS and principle investigators
conducting research are recommended through the IACUC
protocol review process. Depending on the need, the consultation may entail a review of existing animal training
plans, recommendations for incorporating speciﬁc training methods, and discussion about how the study or study
subjects could beneﬁt from animal training.
Another component to the training program is the
</bodyText>

Animal Training Committee comprised of people from
Behavioral Management, Veterinary Medicine, Animal
Care, Colony Management, Occupational Health and Safety,
and research laboratories. This inclusive, team approach is
consistent with recommendations by others (Prescott et al.,
2005; Prescott and Buchanan-Smith, 2007). The Animal
Training Committee has been responsible for developing
these major advances:

Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Animal Training Philosophy
Training is an animal management tool that facilitates good animal care by promoting animal socialization, enhancing cognitive stimulation, and
decreasing stress. Training also facilitates the conduct of research protocols and facilitates veterinary care of animals. The philosophy of the
animal training program at Yerkes is to enhance the well-being of monkeys and apes by maximizing the use of positive reinforcement training.
Other training methods are also appropriately used in some situations.
There are a number of elements to consider as Yerkes personnel work to achieve our training goal.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.795639">
1. Safety comes first in any training program, including the safety of the animals and the trainers. We use equipment and procedures geared
toward enhancing safety.
2. Educating employees is critical. This includes making sure they understand the correct uses of positive reinforcement training and the

acceptable application and context in which negative reinforcement may be used. Negative reinforcement should be followed with positive
reinforcement when possible. Staff members involved in training are expected to understand the goals of the program, training terminology and
the appropriate use of positive and negative reinforcement methods.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7819584">
3. Good record keeping is part of a successful training program. This includes writte n “shaping plans” for all behaviors, and documentation that
tracks of training sessions. The center’s Primate Training Specialist routinely will review and evaluate training documentation.
4. Evaluation of the training program also will include a quantitative assessment of data (some collected through the documentation system) that
will help answer specific questions about the value of training. As appropriate, some of these evaluation projects will be published.

enhancing care for nonhuman primates.
(3) Determining the basic training information provided
to all new employees working with primates (included
in orientation packets). All staff members are informed
of the scope, function, availability and services of the
animal training program.
(4) Developing a plan to identify staff members that need
to understand training. The “All Staff Training Plan” was
developed to educate all faculty and staff working with
primates about animal training, the services provided
by the PTS, and goals of the animal training program.
The Director of Yerkes strongly encouraged principal
investigators, veterinarians, supervisors, and laboratory managers to be involved. This level of commitment
and dedication from the very top of the administration
was integral in the promotion and continued support
of the animal training program.
Results of this comprehensive training program are
many. With a core group of Animal Care staff familiar with
training, daily training for husbandry can be implemented
(McMillan et al., 2007). Husbandry training objectives
include training primates to voluntarily enter transport
boxes and to shift between areas within home enclosures
(McMillan et al., 2009; Veeder et al., 2009). The majority of the PTS’s consultations with research laboratories
have focused on pole and collar training, chair restraint
training (McMillan et al., 2010), and biological specimen
collection (e.g., blood, urine, semen) (Perlman et al., 2010).
Other behaviors and animal management issues addressed
have included present for injection, desensitization to fearprovoking stimuli (Clay et al., 2009), training to decrease
human-directed aggression (Martin et al., 2011), improving
research testing performance, training to decrease abnormal behavior (Baker et al., 2010), and training to enhance
socialization. The facility-wide approach has enhanced
communication and function between those in various
departments working with the same primates.

8. Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992128">
This paper presents a framework for categorizing the
structure of animal training programs for both existing and
planned programs. The program structure should be developed around the animal care needs and the goals of the
facility. A structure that works for one facility may not be a
good ﬁt for another. Assessments of PRT on husbandry (e.g.,
moving animals), behavior problems (e.g., fear, self injury,
undesirable behavior), and veterinary and experimental
procedures (e.g., present for injection and blood collection)
shows that animals trained with PRT have enhanced welfare. Currently, about half of the NPRCs in the United States
of America have formalized animal training programs,
and the others are in various stages of creating animal
training programs. It is recommended that more primate
facilities develop formalized animal training programs
emphasizing PRT to continue to meet and exceed regulatory requirements and to improve the welfare of their

However there are conﬂicting ﬁndings as to whether PRT has a generalized effect on abnormal behavior of primates outside of training sessions: two studies showed no such generalization (Baker et al., 2009; Bloomsmith et al., 1997), while three other studies did show a generalized decrease in stereotypies when the trainer was not present (Bourgeois and Brent, 2005; Coleman and Maier, 2010; Pomerantz and Terkel, 2009). Training behaviors that are incompatible with the stereotyped behavior may be an effective therapy (e.g., reinforcement for remaining still, for subjects that were pacing) (Bourgeois and Brent, 2005).

These results were supported by within and between subjects’ comparisons. A study evaluating the effect of PRT on cortisol, hematology and cardiovascular measures in cynomolgus macaques found subjects exposed to daily PRT sessions showed decreased measures of stress compared to those not exposed to PRT (Koban et al., 2005). PRT enables animals to learn about the consequences of their actions and it relies on their voluntary participation (Bassett and Buchanan-Smith, 2007). If there are welfare beneﬁts to training that are above and beyond the beneﬁts of having animals conditioned to calmly and efﬁciently comply with various husbandry, research and veterinary needs, then this is another reason to invest time and resources into animal training programs. The data on primates indicate that experience with controllable events fosters exploration, enhances performance on cognitive tasks, and may attenuate stress reactivity (Hanson et al., 1976; Mineka et al., 1986; Roma et al., 2006; Washburn et al., 1991).

These are positive contributions to psychological well-being (Novak and Suomi, 1988) and PRT may provide similar beneﬁts to well-being by stimulating activity that offers primates choice and control over some aspects of their environment. 3.4. Improve veterinary care and research 3.6. Enhance social housing There are challenges with managing social groups of primates that can be addressed through PRT techniques. One particularly useful technique, known as cooperative J.E. Perlman et al. / Applied Animal Behaviour Science 137 (2012) 114–126 feeding (Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Whittaker, 2005) involves reinforcing the dominant individual for allowing subordinate group members to have desirable resources such as food, enrichment, or attention from a caregiver. This technique can reduce ﬁghting during meal times (Bloomsmith et al., 1994). To further enhance socialization, primates can be taught to tolerate proximity to one another, and to touch each other gently (Cox, 1987; Desmond et al., 1987; Schapiro et al., 2001). This type of training has potential to beneﬁt the process of introducing unfamiliar primates to one another (Laule and Desmond, 1990). A more advance</context>

This ﬁnding probably is due to the early stage of development of many of the training programs. All facilities indicated the use of shaping by approximations as a PRT method, six facilities used both active desensitization and cooperative/collaborative training methods (see Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Reinhardt, 2003; Schapiro et al., 2001; Wilson and Davison, 1971 for description of the methods), and four facilities used contraaggression training for human-directed aggression (see Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Clay et al., 2009; Minier et al., 2011 for description of the method).

Address behavioral problems Scientists have evaluated PRT’s impact on behavioral problems to determine whether it can reduce, eliminate or prevent the expression of problematic behaviors, and whether these treatment effects generalize to the primates’ overall behavioral repertoire (Baker et al., 2010; Bloomsmith et al., 2007). 3.7.1.

In one model, the primary trainer is responsible for initial training, following a shaping plan and documenting training sessions. Once the primate is performing the behavior reliably (e.g., four out of ﬁve times asked) the behavior is considered trained. At this point, the trained behavior may be transferred from the primary trainer to the secondary trainer who will then be responsible for maintaining the behavior at the same criterion. At least one study has shown that primates’ performance can be sustained through this transfer process (Bloomsmith et al., 1998). Not everyone will become a good primary trainer, but everyone working with primates should learn the basic principles of animal training and apply them effectively to maintain trained behaviors. 5.6. Evaluation of training program The evaluation of animal training programs is recommended to assess whether the program is meeting the needs of the animals, and set goals for husbandry, veterinary care, and research. Individuals implementing the training should also be assessed regularly for technique, consistency and progress. Regular meetings among staff who are planning and implementing the tr</context>

Staff avoided the chimpanzee when he was exhibiting behaviors associated with his SIB, he was trained to perform an incompatible behavior, and he was desensitized to arousing stimuli. In combination with intensive enrichment, socialization changes and drug therapy, the training signiﬁcantly reduced his SIB for several years (S. Bourgeois, pers. comm.).

Training laboratory animals to cooperate reduces the need for physical restraint and/or anesthesia, and thus reduces the stress that accompanies those procedures. Evidence for stress reduction includes reductions in cortisol levels, stressrelated abortions, physical resistance to handling, and fear responses such as fear-grinning, screaming, and acute diarrhea (Clay et al., 2009; Moseley and Davis, 1989; Reinhardt et al., 1990; Vertein and Reinhardt, 1989). Chimpanzees who voluntarily presented for injection of an anesthetic agent had signiﬁcantly reduced physiological measures of stress when compared to those who did not cooperate and were anesthetized via chemical darts (Lambeth et al., 2006). These results were supported by within and between subjects’ comparisons.

Individuals who showed fear responses to speciﬁc, routine husbandry tasks (e.g. removing food from a cage, spraying water from a hose) were desensitized to these experiences, and they displayed signiﬁcantly less fearful responses than those study animals given additional time to acclimate to their environment, or those who underwent basic husbandry training (Clay et al., 2009). A recent study using PRT techniques to reduce rhesus macaque aggression toward humans was effective in reducing the behavior during and outside of training sessions (Minier et al., 2011). 3.7.4. Feces throwing A FA approach was used to assess feces throwing by a chimpanzee, and conﬁrmed that human attention was reinforcing this behavior (Martin et al., 2011).

Training facilitates veterinary care by improving the ability to conduct procedures, and observe animals more closely and more frequently without the use of anesthesia or restraint. Primates voluntarily participate in procedures such as conscious blood collection (Coleman et al., 2008; Laule et al., 1996), urine collection (Laule et al., 1996; Perlman et al., 2010; Stone et al., 1994), subcutaneous injections (Perlman et al., 2004; Schapiro et al., 2005), and voluntary intramuscular injections for anesthesia, antibiotics or vaccines (Lambeth et al., 2006; Schapiro et al., 2005; Videan et al., 2005). 3.2.

Understanding species-typical behavior, speciﬁcally fearful behavior, can help reduce the risk of trainer-directed aggression. Safety can be enhanced through the use of engineering controls and safety apparatus such as an enclosed “blood sleeve” which allows animals to present arms or legs safely outside of the cage for conscious blood collection, while decreasing the opportunity for the primate to grab the trainer (Coleman et al., 2008). Targets are used to position primates with their hands in view or holding a peg that falls if the animal lets go; these tools enhance trainer safety when working in close proximity to primates. If food reinforcers are offered to the primate by hand, precautions to reduce the trainers risk of being bitten or grabbed need to be taken. Two examples include delivering the food at a distance using a bottle to squirt juice directly into the primate’s mouth, or placing a receptacle on the cage front where food can be safely deposited by the trainer and then retrieved by the animal.

All should be considered when planning research studies and writing grant proposals to support research. The selection of subjects for some studies may be aided with the involvement of behavioral management staff members. At the Oregon NPRC, monkey temperament characteristics have been useful in identifying animals who are more responsive to PRT than others, and thus may be more suitable subjects for particular studies (Coleman et al., 2005). At the California NPRC the animal record keeping system indicates if an animal is trained or in the process of being trained for a behavior. The Behavioral Management group can be contacted to get speciﬁc information about the training. 5.3. Continuing education There are many opportunities available to those in the laboratory animal community to broaden animal training knowledge. There are numerous books, articles, internet discussion forums, and websites on animal training (see Laule and Whittaker, 2001; see also Prescott et al., 2005; Pryor, 2002; Ramirez, 1999).

These programs may have the means to evaluate the safety of training tools and techniques used within animal training programs. 5.2. Integration of PRT into research objectives 5. Elements of a training program The most effective primate training program will be one that includes clearly deﬁned training goals, accountability, assessment and reﬁnement of training effort, and continuing education for staff. Many of these programmatic recommendations are also described in other published papers (Colahan and Breder, 2003; Prescott et al., 2005; Young and Cipreste, 2004). 5.1. Safety Fundamental to any animal training program is human and animal safety (Colahan and Breder, 2003; but see Young and Cipreste, 2004 for examples of safety features within a training program). People have good reason to be concerned for their safety when working with primates since they are unpredictable, strong, and capable of inﬂicting great harm. Depending on the species and zoonotic disease risk, personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, cover clothing, a mask and eye protection may be necessary. Training can be accompl</context>

In combination with intensive enrichment, socialization changes and drug therapy, the training signiﬁcantly reduced his SIB for several years (S. Bourgeois, pers. comm.). A similar combination approach was used by Prosen and Bell (2000) with a bonobo who exhibited a great deal of SIB, and it was very successful in reducing his SIB. In another study, SIB in a baboon was reduced using a functional analysis (FA) technique (Dorey et al., 2009). FA is an assessment technique used in humans to treat behavioral problems by systematically identifying what is reinforcing a speciﬁc behavior, and then manipulating that reinforcement. Since the FA revealed the SIB was positively reinforced by human attention, during treatment SIB was ignored by staff, and the behavior decreased. This FA approach, while time intensive, shows promise in the treatment of some behavioral problems in nonhuman primates. 3.7.3.

The systematic application of operant and classical conditioning techniques to training primates living in laboratory facilities has become much more common over the last two decades (Bloomsmith et al., 1998; Clay et al., 2009; Coleman et al., 2008; Fernstrom et al., 2009; Laule et al., 1996, 2003; Perlman et al., 2010; Reinhardt, 1997; Schapiro et al., 2003, 2005).

If there are welfare beneﬁts to training that are above and beyond the beneﬁts of having animals conditioned to calmly and efﬁciently comply with various husbandry, research and veterinary needs, then this is another reason to invest time and resources into animal training programs. The data on primates indicate that experience with controllable events fosters exploration, enhances performance on cognitive tasks, and may attenuate stress reactivity (Hanson et al., 1976; Mineka et al., 1986; Roma et al., 2006; Washburn et al., 1991). These are positive contributions to psychological well-being (Novak and Suomi, 1988) and PRT may provide similar beneﬁts to well-being by stimulating activity that offers primates choice and control over some aspects of their environment. 3.4.

To date there is no published literature comparing PRT and NRT techniques on the behavior or well-being of primates, but there is some literature on other species. Differences have been found in equine behavior and physiology based on training techniques employed. Horses trained with PRT exhibited more exploratory behavior and participated more in training sessions than those trained with NRT. A higher heart rate in the PRT group in the later stages of training was considered a positive physiological response linked to increased motivation to participate and anticipation of food rewards (Innes and McBride, 2008). Comparing horses trained only with NRT to those trained with a blended approach of NRT followed by PRT showed those in the latter group expressed behaviors and body postures indicating improved welfare (Warren-Smith and McGreevy, 2007). Given the widespread application of NRT in primate facilities similar assessments should be conducted with nonhuman primates to understand the impact on welfare measures. There are signiﬁcant challenges to moving from a NRT-based system toward a more PRT-based program for laboratory primates.

Veeder et al. (2009) trained a group of mangabeys to move from one area of the enclosure to another for cleaning, saving 46 min a day of animal care staff time. The total training time required was recouped in fewer than 35 days. PRT also improves the ability to collect samples without requiring anesthesia or social separation. Stone et al. (1994) quickly and reliably obtained urine samples from chimpanzees without necessitating social isolation, and Kelley and Bramblett (1981) had similar results with a group of vervet monkeys.

The recent version of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (2011) emphasizes the importance and beneﬁts of animal training programs with the following recommendation: “Habituating animals to routine husbandry or experimental procedures should be encouraged whenever possible as it may assist the animal to better cope with a captive environment by reducing stress associated with novel procedures or people.</context>

Chimpanzees who voluntarily presented for injection of an anesthetic agent had signiﬁcantly reduced physiological measures of stress when compared to those who did not cooperate and were anesthetized via chemical darts (Lambeth et al., 2006). These results were supported by within and between subjects’ comparisons. A study evaluating the effect of PRT on cortisol, hematology and cardiovascular measures in cynomolgus macaques found subjects exposed to daily PRT sessions showed decreased measures of stress compared to those not exposed to PRT (Koban et al., 2005).

The systematic application of operant and classical conditioning techniques to training primates living in laboratory facilities has become much more common over the last two decades (Bloomsmith et al., 1998; Clay et al., 2009; Coleman et al., 2008; Fernstrom et al., 2009; Laule et al., 1996, 2003; Perlman et al., 2010; Reinhardt, 1997; Schapiro et al., 2003, 2005).

Training facilitates veterinary care by improving the ability to conduct procedures, and observe animals more closely and more frequently without the use of anesthesia or restraint. Primates voluntarily participate in procedures such as conscious blood collection (Coleman et al., 2008; Laule et al., 1996), urine collection (Laule et al., 1996; Perlman et al., 2010; Stone et al., 1994), subcutaneous injections (Perlman et al., 2004; Schapiro et al., 2005), and voluntary intramuscular injections for anesthesia, antibiotics or vaccines (Lambeth et al., 2006; Schapiro et al., 2005; Videan et al., 2005). 3.2. Stress reduction 3.5.

There have been a large number of publications describing training technique, training terminology and various uses for training (Bloomsmith et al., 2007; Coleman and Maier, 2010; Kazdin, 2001; Laule and Whittaker, 2001, 2007; Ramirez, 1999; Schapiro et al., 2005). However, issues related to designing and initiating animal training programs have been less well described. Animal training programs are an important reﬁnement in the care of laboratory primates as they can help to reduce stress experienced by animals and improve their research use by minimizing this confound.

At the California NPRC the animal record keeping system indicates if an animal is trained or in the process of being trained for a behavior. The Behavioral Management group can be contacted to get speciﬁc information about the training. 5.3. Continuing education There are many opportunities available to those in the laboratory animal community to broaden animal training knowledge. There are numerous books, articles, internet discussion forums, and websites on animal training (see Laule and Whittaker, 2001; see also Prescott et al., 2005; Pryor, 2002; Ramirez, 1999). Workshops such as the “Primate Training and Enrichment Workshop” (http://ptew.kccmr.org/) are available and conferences, including International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association (IMATA) (http://www.imata.org) J.E. Perlman et al. / Applied Animal Behaviour Science 137 (2012) 114–126 121 and the Animal Behavior Management Alliance (ABMA) (http://www.theabma.org/), focus mostly on training.

This type of training has potential to beneﬁt the process of introducing unfamiliar primates to one another (Laule and Desmond, 1990). A more advanced technique, collaborative training, involves training animals to work together toward a common goal by rewarding their mutual efforts (i.e. two individuals are rewarded for working together to move an object). The use of collaborative training to purposefully create social ties may also enhance social relationships (Laule and Whittaker, 2007). 3.7. Address behavioral problems Scientists have evaluated PRT’s impact on behavioral problems to determine whether it can reduce, eliminate or prevent the expression of problematic behaviors, and whether these treatment effects generalize to the primates’ overall behavioral repertoire (Baker et al., 2010; Bloomsmith et al., 2007). 3.7.1.

Why primate facilities should have animal training programs 3.1. Regulatory compliance 3.3. Increase the efﬁciency of working with primates Although animal training requires an initial time investment, it can lead to a savings in the personnel time required for some tasks over the long-term. Many procedures, such as moving primates within their enclosures for cleaning, transporting them between enclosures and collecting biological samples, can be completed much faster once the primates have been trained. McKinley et al. (2003) reported saving 91% of the time required to weigh a marmoset by training them to target at the front of the cage and climb onto the scale (174.25 s reduced to 159.5 s). Veeder et al. (2009) trained a group of mangabeys to move from one area of the enclosure to another for cleaning, saving 46 min a day of animal care staff time. The total training time required was recouped in fewer than 35 days. PRT also improves the ability to collect samples without requiring anesthesia or social separation. Stone et al.

Researchers and behavioral managers can work together to establish guidelines for incorporating PRT into protocols. PRT, when applied properly, desensitizes subjects to potentially stressful elements of research procedures. At the Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC), the behavioral management scientist reviews IACUC protocols and may suggest or require incorporating PRT techniques to prepare subjects for aspects of the study (McMillan et al., 2007). In a research setting, time constraints can inﬂuence what training is accomplished. Researchers usually do not budget for subject costs in advance of beginning study procedures, but this may be necessary to have the time to train subjects to cooperate with study procedures. A greater commitment to PRT requires considering costs and logistics associated with pre-study animal arrangements, such as acquiring animals ahead of the onset of the study, initiating training while animals are in quarantine, and ensuring appropriate staff expertise.

Training laboratory animals to cooperate reduces the need for physical restraint and/or anesthesia, and thus reduces the stress that accompanies those procedures. Evidence for stress reduction includes reductions in cortisol levels, stressrelated abortions, physical resistance to handling, and fear responses such as fear-grinning, screaming, and acute diarrhea (Clay et al., 2009; Moseley and Davis, 1989; Reinhardt et al., 1990; Vertein and Reinhardt, 1989). Chimpanzees who voluntarily presented for injection of an anesthetic agent had signiﬁcantly reduced physiological measures of stress when compared to those who did not cooperate and were anesthetized via chemical darts (Lambeth et al., 2006).

The data on primates indicate that experience with controllable events fosters exploration, enhances performance on cognitive tasks, and may attenuate stress reactivity (Hanson et al., 1976; Mineka et al., 1986; Roma et al., 2006; Washburn et al., 1991). These are positive contributions to psychological well-being (Novak and Suomi, 1988) and PRT may provide similar beneﬁts to well-being by stimulating activity that offers primates choice and control over some aspects of their environment. 3.4.

However there are conﬂicting ﬁndings as to whether PRT has a generalized effect on abnormal behavior of primates outside of training sessions: two studies showed no such generalization (Baker et al., 2009; Bloomsmith et al., 1997), while three other studies did show a generalized decrease in stereotypies when the trainer was not present (Bourgeois and Brent, 2005; Coleman and Maier, 2010; Pomerantz and Terkel, 2009). Training behaviors that are incompatible with the stereotyped behavior may be an effective therapy (e.g., reinforcement for remaining still, for subjects that were pacing) (Bourgeois and Brent, 2005). PRT may help to prevent the development of stereotyped behavior, as has been found with young nursery-reared rhesus monkeys (Brunelli et al., 2009). Combining PRT with other treatment approaches (social group manipulations, drug therapy) reduced the extreme stereotyped behavior in a male bonobo (Prosen and Bell, 2000).

These programs may have the means to evaluate the safety of training tools and techniques used within animal training programs. 5.2. Integration of PRT into research objectives 5. Elements of a training program The most effective primate training program will be one that includes clearly deﬁned training goals, accountability, assessment and reﬁnement of training effort, and continuing education for staff. Many of these programmatic recommendations are also described in other published papers (Colahan and Breder, 2003; Prescott et al., 2005; Young and Cipreste, 2004). 5.1. Safety Fundamental to any animal training program is human and animal safety (Colahan and Breder, 2003; but see Young and Cipreste, 2004 for examples of safety features within a training program). People have good reason to be concerned for their safety when working with primates since they are unpredictable, strong, and capable of inﬂicting great harm. Depending on the species and zoonotic disease risk, personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, cover clothing, a mask and eye protection may be necessary.

At the California NPRC the animal record keeping system indicates if an animal is trained or in the process of being trained for a behavior. The Behavioral Management group can be contacted to get speciﬁc information about the training. 5.3. Continuing education There are many opportunities available to those in the laboratory animal community to broaden animal training knowledge. There are numerous books, articles, internet discussion forums, and websites on animal training (see Laule and Whittaker, 2001; see also Prescott et al., 2005; Pryor, 2002; Ramirez, 1999). Workshops such as the “Primate Training and Enrichment Workshop” (http://ptew.kccmr.org/) are available and conferences, including International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association (IMATA) (http://www.imata.org) J.E. Perlman et al. / Applied Animal Behaviour Science 137 (2012) 114–126 121 and the Animal Behavior Management Alliance (ABMA) (http://www.theabma.org/), focus mostly on training.

If the primate laboratory employs an animal training specialist, this person can conduct PRT workshops, lectures, and practical learning opportunities for individuals working with nonhuman primates. The Joint Working Group on Reﬁnement (2009) recommends learning outcomes for staff training of familiarity with behavior and how to interact with the relevant species in a positive way. 5.4. Documentation and record keeping Documentation is an important component of formalized training programs (Prescott et al., 2005; Young and Cipreste, 2004). Communication of institutional or programmatic training goals, training applications and expectations, and providing opportunities for consistency and communication among trainers and staff who will be maintaining any trained behaviors are vital in the success of a training program. In general there should be some record of: (a) which animals have been taught what behaviors; (b) the approach used for their training; (c) the cues used; (d) the animal’s expected behavioral response to the cue; and (e) some measure of the animal’s consistency in responding.

The PTS is jointly supervised by the Behavior Management and Animal Care Units, which emphasizes the importance of training to both units. The position is a resource to all Yerkes departments that use primates. This position requires an animal training background, familiarity with operant conditioning theory and practice, strong problem solving skills, and strong interpersonal communication skills. The success of a training program relies heavily on selecting an individual with a calm demeanor, patience, consistency, and an ability to analyze one’s own behavior (Prescott et al., 2005; Young and Cipreste, 2004). The PTS trains people much more often than she trains nonhuman primates, and this is an important element in a large primate facility, since one person would only be able to work with a small fraction of the animals that should be trained. The PTS responsibilities include educating staff and faculty about the Yerkes’ animal training program, teaching operant conditioning terminology and techniques through seminars and hands-on instruction, serving as an internal consultant to assist in developing animal training plans, and assessing progress on training goals.

Identifying and minimizing negative reinforcement training (NRT) methods NRT is widely used in primate facilities (NPRC survey described above; Prescott and Buchanan-Smith, 2007) and its use needs to be thoughtfully addressed. Common types of NRT include: 1. using the squeeze back to move an animal to the cage front for an injection or treatment; 2. loud voices, clapping or tapping on the cage, threatening with a net or leather gloves to move an animal from one location to another; 3. a person entering an enclosure to get an animal to move away from that person and into a transport box or tunnel; 4. spraying water behind an animal to encourage movement from one location to another; and 5. threatening with a dart gun to get an animal to present for an injection.

Survey summary, behaviors and techniques Despite most facilities maintaining animal numbers in the thousands, and increased resources being directed toward the development of training programs, relatively few animals were reported as being trained in formalized programs (Fig. 1). This ﬁnding probably is due to the early stage of development of many of the training programs. All facilities indicated the use of shaping by approximations as a PRT method, six facilities used both active desensitization and cooperative/collaborative training methods (see Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Reinhardt, 2003; Schapiro et al., 2001; Wilson and Davison, 1971 for description of the methods), and four facilities used contraaggression training for human-directed aggression (see Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Clay et al., 2009; Minier et al., 2011 for description of the method).

If there are welfare beneﬁts to training that are above and beyond the beneﬁts of having animals conditioned to calmly and efﬁciently comply with various husbandry, research and veterinary needs, then this is another reason to invest time and resources into animal training programs. The data on primates indicate that experience with controllable events fosters exploration, enhances performance on cognitive tasks, and may attenuate stress reactivity (Hanson et al., 1976; Mineka et al., 1986; Roma et al., 2006; Washburn et al., 1991).

Perlman et al. / Applied Animal Behaviour Science 137 (2012) 114–126 feeding (Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Whittaker, 2005) involves reinforcing the dominant individual for allowing subordinate group members to have desirable resources such as food, enrichment, or attention from a caregiver. This technique can reduce ﬁghting during meal times (Bloomsmith et al., 1994). To further enhance socialization, primates can be taught to tolerate proximity to one another, and to touch each other gently (Cox, 1987; Desmond et al., 1987; Schapiro et al., 2001). This type of training has potential to beneﬁt the process of introducing unfamiliar primates to one another (Laule and Desmond, 1990). A more advanced technique, collaborative training, involves training animals to work together toward a common goal by rewarding their mutual efforts (i.e. two individuals are rewarded for working together to move an object). The use of collaborative training to purposefully create social ties may also enhance social relationships (Laule and Whittaker, 2007). 3.7.

Survey summary, behaviors and techniques Despite most facilities maintaining animal numbers in the thousands, and increased resources being directed toward the development of training programs, relatively few animals were reported as being trained in formalized programs (Fig. 1). This ﬁnding probably is due to the early stage of development of many of the training programs. All facilities indicated the use of shaping by approximations as a PRT method, six facilities used both active desensitization and cooperative/collaborative training methods (see Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Reinhardt, 2003; Schapiro et al., 2001; Wilson and Davison, 1971 for description of the methods), and four facilities used contraaggression training for human-directed aggression (see Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Clay et al., 2009; Minier et al., 2011 for description of the method).

Horses trained with PRT exhibited more exploratory behavior and participated more in training sessions than those trained with NRT. A higher heart rate in the PRT group in the later stages of training was considered a positive physiological response linked to increased motivation to participate and anticipation of food rewards (Innes and McBride, 2008). Comparing horses trained only with NRT to those trained with a blended approach of NRT followed by PRT showed those in the latter group expressed behaviors and body postures indicating improved welfare (Warren-Smith and McGreevy, 2007). Given the widespread application of NRT in primate facilities similar assessments should be conducted with nonhuman primates to understand the impact on welfare measures. There are signiﬁcant challenges to moving from a NRT-based system toward a more PRT-based program for laboratory primates. The large numbers of animals to provide PRT to, limitations due to research protocols, and rigid schedules and feeding times may make a move toward a more PRT-based program difﬁcult. Rotating staff, staff turnover or resistance to a new system may further complicate the process of moving to a more PRT-b</context>

These are positive contributions to psychological well-being (Novak and Suomi, 1988) and PRT may provide similar beneﬁts to well-being by stimulating activity that offers primates choice and control over some aspects of their environment. 3.4. Improve veterinary care and research 3.6. Enhance social housing There are challenges with managing social groups of primates that can be addressed through PRT techniques. One particularly useful technique, known as cooperative J.E. Perlman et al. / Applied Animal Behaviour Science 137 (2012) 114–126 feeding (Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Whittaker, 2005) involves reinforcing the dominant individual for allowing subordinate group members to have desirable resources such as food, enrichment, or attention from a caregiver. This technique can reduce ﬁghting during meal times (Bloomsmith et al., 1994). To further enhance socialization, primates can be taught to tolerate proximity to one another, and to touch each other gently (Cox, 1987; Desmond et al., 1987; Schapiro et al., 2001). This type of training has potential to beneﬁt the process of introducing unfamiliar primates to one another (Laule and Desmond, 1990). A more advanced technique, colla</context>

Perlman et al. / Applied Animal Behaviour Science 137 (2012) 114–126 to increase consistency among trainers, documentation systems, and evaluation of trained animals. The objective of this manuscript is to assist those caring for laboratory primates in the development of new, or in the reﬁnement of existing, primate training programs. 2. Three approaches to structuring animal training programs Animal training programs generally fall into three categories: project-based programs, section-wide programs and facility-wide programs (Whittaker et al., 2008). Within one institution, multiple approaches may be simultaneously operating or programs may evolve from one type of structure to another. It is essential to understand the focus and breadth of the training program to maximize effectiveness for the animals and staff. Using the framework presented here, one can determine which approach is best suited for the animal care needs and goals of the institution. 2.1. Project-based approach A project-based training program typically includes a few animals or groups of animals and a limited number of staff. Speciﬁc behavioral objectives can be addresse</context>

This ﬁnding probably is due to the early stage of development of many of the training programs. All facilities indicated the use of shaping by approximations as a PRT method, six facilities used both active desensitization and cooperative/collaborative training methods (see Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Reinhardt, 2003; Schapiro et al., 2001; Wilson and Davison, 1971 for description of the methods), and four facilities used contraaggression training for human-directed aggression (see Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Clay et al., 2009; Minier et al., 2011 for description of the method).

These programs may have the means to evaluate the safety of training tools and techniques used within animal training programs. 5.2. Integration of PRT into research objectives 5. Elements of a training program The most effective primate training program will be one that includes clearly deﬁned training goals, accountability, assessment and reﬁnement of training effort, and continuing education for staff. Many of these programmatic recommendations are also described in other published papers (Colahan and Breder, 2003; Prescott et al., 2005; Young and Cipreste, 2004). 5.1. Safety Fundamental to any animal training program is human and animal safety (Colahan and Breder, 2003; but see Young and Cipreste, 2004 for examples of safety features within a training program). People have good reason to be concerned for their safety when working with primates since they are unpredictable, strong, and capable of inﬂicting great harm. Depending on the species and zoonotic disease risk, personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, cover clothing, a mask and eye protection may be necessary. Training can be accomplished with trainers wearing such PPE, and facility</context>

If the primate laboratory employs an animal training specialist, this person can conduct PRT workshops, lectures, and practical learning opportunities for individuals working with nonhuman primates. The Joint Working Group on Reﬁnement (2009) recommends learning outcomes for staff training of familiarity with behavior and how to interact with the relevant species in a positive way. 5.4. Documentation and record keeping Documentation is an important component of formalized training programs (Prescott et al., 2005; Young and Cipreste, 2004). Communication of institutional or programmatic training goals, training applications and expectations, and providing opportunities for consistency and communication among trainers and staff who will be maintaining any trained behaviors are vital in the success of a training program. In general there should be some record of: (a) which animals have been taught what behaviors; (b) the approach used for their training; (c) the cues used; (d) the animal’s expected behavioral response to the cue; and (e) some measure of the animal’s consistency in responding.

The PTS is jointly supervised by the Behavior Management and Animal Care Units, which emphasizes the importance of training to both units. The position is a resource to all Yerkes departments that use primates. This position requires an animal training background, familiarity with operant conditioning theory and practice, strong problem solving skills, and strong interpersonal communication skills. The success of a training program relies heavily on selecting an individual with a calm demeanor, patience, consistency, and an ability to analyze one’s own behavior (Prescott et al., 2005; Young and Cipreste, 2004). The PTS trains people much more often than she trains nonhuman primates, and this is an important element in a large primate facility, since one person would only be able to work with a small fraction of the animals that should be trained. The PTS responsibilities include educating staff and faculty about the Yerkes’ animal training program, teaching operant conditioning terminology and techniques through seminars and hands-on instruction, serving as an internal consultant to assist in developing animal training plans, and assessing progress on training goals.
