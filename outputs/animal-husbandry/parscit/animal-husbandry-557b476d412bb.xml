Doramectin (DOR), metronidazole (MET), ﬂorfenicol (FLO), and oxytetracycline (OXT) are among the most
widely used veterinary drugs in animal husbandry or in aquaculture. Contamination of the environment
by these pharmaceuticals has given cause for concern in recent years. Even though their toxicity has been
thoroughly analyzed, knowledge of their ecotoxicity is still limited. We investigated their aquatic toxicity
using tests with marine bacteria (Vibrio ﬁscheri), green algae (Scenedesmus vacuolatus), duckweed (Lemna
minor) and crustaceans (Daphnia magna). All the ecotoxicological tests were supported by chemical analyses to conﬁrm the exposure concentrations of the pharmaceuticals used in the toxicity experiments,
since deviations from the nominal concentration can result in underestimation of biological effects. It
was found that OXT and FLO have a stronger adverse effect on duckweed (EC50 = 3.26 and 2.96 mg LÀ1
respectively) and green algae (EC50 = 40.4 and 18.0 mg LÀ1) than on bacteria (EC50 = 108 and 29.4 mg LÀ1)
and crustaceans (EC50 = 114 and 337 mg LÀ1), whereas MET did not exhibit any adverse effect in the
tested concentration range. For DOR a very low EC50 of 6.37 Â 10À5 mg LÀ1 towards D. magna was determined, which is ﬁve orders of magnitude lower than values known for the toxic reference compound
K2Cr2O7. Our data show the strong inﬂuence of certain veterinary drugs on aquatic organisms and contribute to a sound assessment of the environmental hazards posed by commonly used pharmaceuticals.

Large quantities of veterinary pharmaceuticals (VPs) are in use
worldwide. As animals do not completely metabolize these compounds, a large proportion of them are excreted unchanged in feces
and urine. Therefore, both the drugs and their metabolites are released into the environment, either directly from aquaculture

and by grazing animals, or indirectly during manure spreading
(Reemtsma and Jekel, 2006).
Of the various pharmaceuticals commonly used in veterinary
medicine, special attention has been paid to four of them in the
present work: doramectin, metronidazole, ﬂorfenicol and oxytetracycline, which differ in their activity and physicochemical properties (Table 1).
OXT, FLO and MET are antibiotics and have a similar mode of action at the DNA/RNA-level. OXT is commonly used because of its
broad-spectrum efﬁcacy in the treatment of infections caused by
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, mycoplasma and large
viruses. It inhibits protein synthesis by preventing the association
of aminoacyl-tRNA with bacterial ribosomes (Reemtsma and Jekel,
2006). FLO is a ﬂuorinated derivative of thiamphenicol, inhibits
transpeptidation in the bacterial protein synthesis, and is effective

against many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Christensen et al., 2006). The nitroimidazole MET is an antibiotic effective
against anaerobic bacteria, protozoans and certain parasites. It acts
by entering bacterial and protozoan cells and interfering with DNA
(Lanzky and Halling-Sørensen, 1997). DOR is an antiparasitic drug
which is a one of the most popular compound for curing anthelmintic disease. DOR binds to receptors that increase membrane permeability to chloride ions. This inhibits the electrical activity of nerve
cells in nematodes and muscle cells in arthropods, paralyzing and
ultimately killing the parasites (Horvat et al., 2012; Lumaret et al.,
2012). In many countries these pharmaceuticals are registered as
medical premixes so they can be used in feedstuffs for the treatment or prevention of animal diseases. For example the usage of
OXT in the UK in 2000 was 8.5 t and in the US, just in aquacultures
in 2003, was 15 t (Sarmah et al., 2006; Schmidt et al., 2007). Furthermore, in accordance to the IMS Health Market Prognosis
(2012) the global pharmaceutical market has grown twice during
the last decade. However the real amounts of drugs entering the
environment can be much more higher due to lack of control with
type and amounts of pharmaceuticals usage in developing countries e.g. India, Thailand, Indonesia (Sarmah et al., 2006). The relatively low cost and the broad spectrum of activity of these
pharmaceuticals means they are very commonly used not only in
animal husbandry (DOR, MET, FLO, OXT) but also in aquaculture
(MET, FLO, OXT) (Christensen et al., 2006; Ferreira et al., 2007; Lai
et al., 2009; Lumaret et al., 2012; Horvat et al., 2012).
It must be pointed out that the veterinary medicines used in
aquaculture are commonly administered as a medicated feed
mainly as a bath formulation (Hekoten et al., 1995; Boxall, 2010).
Hence a considerable proportion of these drugs administered in
an intensive ﬁsh farm was found to have been released into the
aquatic environment via urinary and fecal excretions and in uncon-

sumed medicated food (Hekoten et al. 1995). For example, Ferreira
et al. (2007) highlighted that when OXT was administrated orally,
ﬁsh took up only about 10–30% of the total amount administered,
while 70–90% of it entered the environment and was available for
distribution to other compartments.
Disregarding the different routes by which these pharmaceuticals enter the environment, their presence in its different compartments has already been determined (Kolpin et al., 2002; Kay et al.,
2005). Despite their quite low concentrations in environmental
samples at the lg LÀ1 or ng LÀ1 level (MET – 30 ng LÀ1, OXT –
340 lg LÀ1, FLO – 2.4 lg LÀ1) (Kolpin et al., 2002; da Silva et al.,
2011; Wei et al., 2012) and their different stabilities in the environment (FLO is resistant to abiotic degradation but easily biodegradable; OXT is susceptible to photodegradation; MET cannot be
biodegraded, photodegradation under UV light is also less effective; DOR is quite susceptible to both biodegradation or photodegradation), they are continuously being released into ecosystems
(Jacobsen and Berglind, 1988; Oka et al., 1989; Lunestad, 1992;
Pﬁzer Inc., 1996; Doi and Stoskopf, 2000). Consequently, these
compounds may be considered pseudo-persistent. Therefore, the
kind of exposure organisms may be subjected to will resemble that
of traditional pollutants (e.g. pesticides, detergents).
This may result in adverse ecological effects, including, for
example, the development of resistant bacterial populations or direct toxicity to microﬂora and microfauna. Since these compounds
(like FLO and MET) are polar pollutants with quite a low sorption
potential and/or are directly introduced into aquatic environment
(like OXT), it can be assumed that aquatic organisms may be the
species most endangered by the presence of pharmaceuticals used
in aquaculture and animal husbandry. Kolar and Kozˇuh Erzˇen
(2006) reported that DOR is excreted mainly with the feces:
almost 98% of the drug is excreted as the non-metabolized

pharmaceutical. DOR’s mobility is very low which is related to the
very high soil organic carbon-water partitioning coefﬁcient (Koc
&gt;1000). The Koc value is very useful in predicting the mobility of organic soil contaminants; generally the higher Koc values the less
mobile organic chemicals. However, studies have shown that the
parent form of this drug can be present in the aquatic environment
at concentration of 0.24–0.42 ng LÀ1 (Pﬁzer Inc., 1996).
Several studies have investigated the aquatic toxicity of some of
these compounds (summarized in Table 2). While hardly any data
is available for DOR; OXT, FLO and MET have been more extensively investigated. Even so, systematic studies investigating these
compounds in different test systems and linking ecotoxicological
research with instrumental analysis are still lacking. The aim of
the present work is to enrich our limited knowledge so far of the
potentially deleterious effects on the environment of commonly
used VPs in aquacultures or animal husbandry. To this end we used
a battery of ecotoxicological tests comprising organisms of different trophic levels and complexity: luminescent marine bacteria
(Vibrio ﬁscheri), limnic unicellular green algae (Scenedesmus vacuolatus), duckweed (Lemna minor) and crustaceans (D. magna).
Although EC50 values for investigated compounds are available in
literature they are highly different. Hence, the objective of our
work was also to evaluate the water soluble fraction of the test
compounds in different test media performed via HPLC–UV measurements. Such experiment is an essential tool to evaluate trustworthy EC50 values and it enhances much reliability of obtained
data.

All the data generated in our study were obtained according to
internationally accepted test guidelines (e.g. OECD, ISO) or on speciﬁc (e.g. national) testing guidelines (e.g. DIN). Hence, according to
the European Medicines Agency (Klimisch et al. (1997) and EMEA,
2008 our results can be classiﬁed under ‘‘reliability index 1’’.
According to Klimisch et al. (1997) different terms are being
used synonymously to characterize the quality of the data of toxicological and ecotoxicological studies: validation/validity, reliability and adequacy. These terms describe not only procedures
to deﬁne the quality of test results (data), but also test methods
are validated to prove their relevance and reproducibility. The
RI category includes studies or data from the tests generated
according to generally valid and/or internationally accepted testing guidelines or in which the test parameters documented are
based on a speciﬁc (national) testing guideline (preferably performed according to Good Laboratory Practice) or in which all
parameters described are closely related/comparable to a guideline method. Therefore, all the ecotoxicological tests used in our
study fulﬁll the validation criteria (for example for ISO 8692
validity criteria includes: the average control growth, variability
of control growth rates (C.V.%), changes of medium pH) stated
in respective Standard Protocols Procedures (SOP) and according

2.1. Chemicals and reagents
DOR, MET, FLO and OXT (HCl salt), acetonitrile (ACN) and salts
(see Table A1, Appendix A) used for the culturing media were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). The standard
stock solution of DOR was prepared by dissolving it in acetonitrile
at a concentration of 500 mg LÀ1; it was then stored at À18 °C in
the dark. All standard stock solutions of OXT (HCl salt), MET and
FLO used in the assays were prepared in the proper medium (buffer) to obtain the desired concentration. For DOR 0.2% of ACN was
added to the control samples in the toxicity test to offset the inﬂuence of this solvent on the test organisms.
2.2. Luminescent inhibition assay with marine bacteria
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997245619047619">
The toxicity test based on Vibrio ﬁscheri was done using the LCK
482 test kit (Dr Lange GmbH, Germany). The 30-min standard bioluminescence inhibition assay was carried out according to a modiﬁed DIN 38412-L34 protocol (1991).
The tests were carried out at least twice for each substance. At
least four controls (2% NaCl solution, phosphate-buffered) were
used during each test.
The tests were performed at 15 °C using thermostats (LUMIStherm, Dr. Lange GmbH, Germany). The luminescence was measured with a luminometer (LUMIStox 300, Dr Lange GmbH,
Germany). The lyophilized bacteria were rehydrated according to
the test protocol; then, 500 lL aliquots of the bacteria solution
were pre-incubated for 15 min at 15 °C. After the initial luminescence had been measured, 500 lL of the diluted samples were
added to the bacteria. The bioluminescence was measured again
after an incubation time of 30 min. The relative toxicity of the samples was expressed as a percentage inhibition compared to the
controls.
2.3. Reproduction inhibition assay with limnic green algae
A synchronized culture of the green algae S. vacuolatus (strain
211-15, SAG (Culture Collection of Algae), Universität Göttingen,
Germany) was used for this assay. The stock culture was grown under photoautotrophic conditions at 28 °C (±0.5 °C) in an inorganic,
sterile medium (pH 6.4) with saturating white light (22–33 klx,
Lumilux Daylight L 36W-11 and Lumilux Interna L 36W-41, Osram,
Berlin, Germany). The cells were aerated with 1.5 vol% CO2 and
synchronized using a 14–10 h light – darkness cycle. The stock culture was diluted every day to a cell density of 5 Â 105 cells mLÀ1.
This test is a modiﬁed version of the assay described by Altenburger et al. (1990), and its sensitivity is comparable to the standardized 72 h test (ISO 8692, 1989).
The toxicity tests started with autospores. The algae were exposed to the test substances for one growth cycle (24 h). The endpoint of this assay is the inhibition of algal reproduction, measured
as the inhibition of population growth. Cell numbers were determined with a Coulter Counter Z2 (Beckmann, Nürnberg, Germany).
The tests were performed in sterilized glass tubes, the algae were
stirred throughout the 24 h test period, and the test conditions
were the same as for the stock culture except for the CO2 source.
Here, 150 lL of NaHCO3 solution was added to each test tube.
The methods of stock culturing and testing are described in detail
by Faust et al. (2001). Growth inhibition was calculated using the
cell counts of the treated samples in relation to the untreated controls. At least six controls were used for each assay. The tests were
performed using six different concentrations in two replicates of
every compound and each test was carried out at least twice.
2.4. Growth inhibition assay with duckweed
The growth inhibition assay with L. minor was performed
according to a modiﬁed version of the test protocol described in
detail by Drost et al. (2007). The plants were grown in open Erlenmeyer ﬂasks in sterilized Steinberg medium (pH 5.5 ± 0.2) in a climate chamber with a constant temperature of 25 ± 2 °C. To exclude
pH effects on plant growth, the pH was checked at the beginning
and end of the test. Based on control samples evaluation the pH
changes did not affect growth inhibition. The chamber was illuminated continuously with a maximum of 6 klx. The assays were performed on six-well cell culture plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH,
Frickenhausen, Germany). All compounds were tested twice in
three replicates, with a minimum of six controls in each test. The
test started with one plant consisting of three duckweed fronds,

and the measured endpoint was the inhibition of the growth rate
determined by the frond area (mm2), which was calculated for
the treated plants in relation to the untreated controls. The frond
area was detected using a Scanalyzer from Lemnatec GmbH
(Würselen, Germany).
ples examination that amount of 0.2% did not affect the organisms
used in the tests. This is also supported by the data presented in
Table 4. However, in the presence of ACN, DOR is generally poorly
soluble in different media (&lt;0.34 mg LÀ1), and is even less so in V.
ﬁscheri media (&lt;0.24 mg LÀ1), which can be explained by the high
ionic strength of this buffer.

Incorporation, Gent, Belgium), referred to OECD guideline 202
(2004). The detailed description of this assay is given in the supplier’s standard operational procedure (MicroBioTest Inc., 1996).
The tests with neonates less than 24 h old, obtained by the hatching of ephippia, were performed at 20 °C in the dark. 5 pre-fed animals were incubated with the toxicants in a volume of 10 mL of
mineral medium. In each test ﬁve different concentrations of the
test substance were investigated in ﬁve parallels and ﬁve controls.
All the experiments were performed twice. The numbers of immobilized organisms were checked after 24 and 48 h. The sensitivity
of the organisms to K2Cr2O7 was checked routinely once a new
batch of organisms was obtained.

<bodyText confidence="0.984522">
In order to determine the soluble fraction of the investigated
compound in biological media (see in Table A1, Appendix A) HPLC
analysis was performed using different conditions depending on
the analyte (see in Appendix A, Table A2). The stock solution concentrations of DOR, MET, FLO and OXT in media solutions used in
four ecotoxicity tests were estimated by ﬁtting chromatographic
peak areas to the calibration curve.

The results presented in Table 3 show that the concentration of
the soluble fraction of MET, FLO and OXT in biological media did
not differ from the nominal concentration of these drugs prepared
in media solution. The accuracy of the results was from 94.4% to
105.6%. It can therefore be assumed that the solubility of the test
compounds in biological media does not affect EC50s.
Because of the very low solubility of DOR in water, solutions
with nominal concentrations were prepared in biological media
with the addition of 0.2% ACN. Although, it is recommended not
to use more than 0.1% of ACN, it was assessed during control sam-
All the EC50 values and conﬁdence intervals (CI) for the drugs
investigated here and the EC50s for the toxic reference compounds
(atrazine, potassium dichromate, acetonitrile and 3,5-dichlorophenol) are presented in Table 4.
3.2.1. Luminescence inhibition assay with marine bacteria
The results listed in Table 4 show that none of the tested drugs
displayed a high level of acute toxicity toward V. ﬁscheri. The lowest EC50 was found for FLO (29.4 mg LÀ1); the values for OXT and
MET were &gt;100 mg LÀ1. No effect up to 0.24 mg LÀ1 could be determined for DOR. This concentration is, however, well above environmentally relevant concentrations, which range from ng LÀ1 to
hundreds of lg LÀ1 (Boxall et al., 2006). The 30 min EC50 obtained
for OXT (108 mg LÀ1) is comparable to the results reported by Lalumera et al. (2004) (121–139 mg LÀ1) (Table 2). However, no clear
correlation between available ecotoxiciy data for OXT to V. ﬁscheri
and exposure time can be observed.
Isidori et al. (2005) highlighted that most of the toxicity data
available for V. ﬁscheri using short exposure times (between 5
and 30 min) rather than a 24 h exposure show that most pharmaceuticals have a low toxic potential in this respect, because these
compounds interfere only slightly with biosynthetic pathways.
For example, the low sensitivity of V. ﬁscheri to OXT can be explained by its mode of action on protein synthesis, which is not
of importance during short-term bioluminescence testing (Zounková et al., 2011).
3.2.2. Reproduction inhibition assay with green algae
The toxicity of veterinary drugs toward S. vacuolatus is reported
for the ﬁrst time. Our results indicate that this limnic green alga
was generally more sensitive than V. ﬁscheri for FLO and OXT.
FLO exhibited the strongest growth inhibition against S. vacuolatus,
followed by OXT and MET. The toxicity of DOR to green algae has
not been calculated yet, but our study found its EC50 to be
&gt;0.34 mg LÀ1. The exact value was not determined because of the
low water solubility of this compound and the necessity of performing the test with an additional concentration of acetonitrile.
Nevertheless, S. vacuolatus was found to be less sensitive to OXT,
MET and FLO than C. vulgaris, P. subcapitata or S. capricornatum,
as shown in Table 2. The results for FLO (EC50 = 18.0 mg LÀ1) are
comparable to those given by Ferreira et al. (2007) and Lai et al.
(2009), who evaluated the toxicity of FLO to different algae (Isochrysis galbana and Tetraselmis chui) (Table 2), widely used as food
sources in early larval cultures of mollusks, ﬁsh and crustaceans.

Tetraselmis chui. As a result, despite having the same general mode
of action, FLO was found to be more toxic (EC50 = 6.06 mg LÀ1) than
OXT (EC50 = 11.18 mg LÀ1), a situation backed up by our ﬁndings.
3.2.3. Growth inhibition assay with duckweed
No toxic effect toward L. minor was found for the maximal soluble fraction of MET (&gt;25 mg LÀ1) and DOR (&gt;0.31 mg LÀ1). Effects
were found for OXT and FLO – both EC50 values were around
3 mg LÀ1 – but they were one order of magnitude higher than
the values determined for the toxic reference compound atrazine.
Pro et al. (2003) and Zounková et al. (2011) determined the toxicity of OXT toward L. minor in a 7-d test, obtaining EC50s of
4.92 mg LÀ1 and 2.1 mg LÀ1, respectively. Brain et al. (2004), however, assessed the phytotoxicity of OXT to Lemna gibba in 7-d static-renewal tests at the level of EC50 = 1.01 mg LÀ1 (calculated for
the frond number). Halling-Sørensen (2000) suggested that the
toxic effect may have been underestimated in static tests because,
for example, of photodegradation of compounds with short halflives like OXT. Other authors, however, have conﬁrmed the negligible inﬂuence of photodegradation on the results under the conditions of a 7-d static test (Zounková et al., 2011).
Photodegradation can also be presumed insigniﬁcant in the context of the current study, because the EC50 for OXT calculated in
this study is generally comparable with the results obtained by
both static and static-renewal tests (Brain et al. 2004; Zounková
et al., 2011). Brain et al. (2004) also suggested that the ability of
antibiotics (like MET, OXT and FLO) to affect plants might be
understood by examining the chloroplast, which originated from
the engulfment of an endosymbiotic Cyanobacteria – like a prokaryotic cell by a larger eukaryotic cell. However, no information
on the toxic effect of DOR toward aquatic higher plants can be
found in the literature. This is probably due to the assumption that
this compound, having a high Koc, will have the potential to sorb to
soil or other solid matrices. As knowledge of its environmental fate
and mobility in the environment is very limited, however, its effects on aquatic organisms should not be excluded from an evaluation of its ecotoxicity potential (Kolar and Kozˇuh Erzˇen, 2006.).
3.2.4. Growth inhibition assay with D. magna
D. magna is usually regarded as the least sensitive organism, toward which, for example, OXT demonstrated no toxicity up to
400 mg LÀ1 in an acute test and only low toxicity in a chronic
reproduction test (Zounková et al., 2011). Similar results were also
obtained by Wollenberger et al. (2000) for both OXT and MET;
these observations are in agreement with our results for these
two compounds. No data about the toxicity of FLO toward D. magna are available to date. Our investigation demonstrated the very
low toxicity of this compound toward D. magna – 337 mg LÀ1.
However, we obtained strong effects (EC50 = 0.0637 lg LÀ1) with
DOR, which shows that this compound is ﬁve orders of magnitude
more toxic than K2Cr2O7, the reference substance for this test. This
was also stated by Pﬁzer Inc. (1996), who reported an EC50 of
0.1 lg LÀ1 for DOR. In their experiments, however, the authors
did not consider determining the water-soluble fraction of this
drug in biological media, which can be lower than in pure water.
Hence the amount of compound which can cause harmful effect
on the tested organisms can be lower than suspected. Therefore
the EC50 of DOR that they determined was almost twice as high
as our value (Pﬁzer Inc., 1996). These results highlight the importance of combining ecotoxicity tests with instrumental analysis
in order to obtain reliable data, and to conﬁrm the exposure concentrations of pharmaceuticals used in toxicity experiments, especially of compounds with a very low water solubility: if this is not
done, chemical hazards may be underestimated as a consequence.
Such a high toxicity of DOR to D. magna reveals a serious threat
when this compound reaches the aquatic environment. But so far
only limited data have been available concerning the occurrence
and fate of anthelmintics (including DOR) in the environment
(Horvat et al., 2012). Pﬁzer Inc. (1996) calculated the maximum expected concentrations of DOR in a surface water body to range
from 0.24 to 0.42 ng LÀ1, values backed up by Boxall et al. (2006).
Even though these estimated concentrations are lower than observed EC50s, it must be pointed out that organisms are typically
exposed to multi-component chemical mixtures. It is possible that
DOR, in predicted environmental concentrations and in combination with residues of veterinary products and/or other pharmaceuticals/pollutants, will cause adverse effects to biota.

4. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995121875">
As a result of such a comparative ecotoxicological analysis, the
potential effects of four selected veterinary drugs, most commonly
used in livestock or in aquacultures, on aquatic organisms were deﬁned. DOR was found to be highly toxic toward D. magna. Even if
environmental concentrations and ‘‘local hot spots’’ during the
application of these pharmaceuticals are still much lower that
the EC50s of these pharmaceuticals vis-à-vis certain organisms, it
must always be borne in mind that these drugs occur in natural
media usually together with others of the same family or type.
Therefore, mixture effects need to be considered, as in such situations toxic thresholds could already be reached. Moreover, ecotoxicological hazard assessments of these pharmaceuticals may be
misleading if only acute toxicity assays are done. Therefore, a further research is necessary. This includes ecotoxicological testing in
combination with analytical methods in order to acquire a complete picture of the exposure to and the risk posed by these pollu-

tants, as we have done in our research. Despite these reservations,
the ecotoxicological test battery used in this study is a suitable tool
for compiling a comprehensive hazard proﬁle for environmentally
relevant contaminants.

Luminescence inhibition assay with marine bacteria The results listed in Table 4 show that none of the tested drugs displayed a high level of acute toxicity toward V. ﬁscheri. The lowest EC50 was found for FLO (29.4 mg LÀ1); the values for OXT and MET were &gt;100 mg LÀ1. No effect up to 0.24 mg LÀ1 could be determined for DOR. This concentration is, however, well above environmentally relevant concentrations, which range from ng LÀ1 to hundreds of lg LÀ1 (Boxall et al., 2006). The 30 min EC50 obtained for OXT (108 mg LÀ1) is comparable to the results reported by Lalumera et al. (2004) (121–139 mg LÀ1) (Table 2). However, no clear correlation between available ecotoxiciy data for OXT to V. ﬁscheri and exposure time can be observed. Isidori et al. (2005) highlighted that most of the toxicity data available for V. ﬁscheri using short exposure times (between 5 and 30 min) rather than a 24 h exposure show that most pharmaceuticals have a low toxic potential in this respect, because these compounds interfere only slightly with biosynthetic pathways. For example, the low</context>

Such a high toxicity of DOR to D. magna reveals a serious threat when this compound reaches the aquatic environment. But so far only limited data have been available concerning the occurrence and fate of anthelmintics (including DOR) in the environment (Horvat et al., 2012). Pﬁzer Inc. (1996) calculated the maximum expected concentrations of DOR in a surface water body to range from 0.24 to 0.42 ng LÀ1, values backed up by Boxall et al. (2006). Even though these estimated concentrations are lower than observed EC50s, it must be pointed out that organisms are typically exposed to multi-component chemical mixtures. It is possible that DOR, in predicted environmental concentrations and in combination with residues of veterinary products and/or other pharmaceuticals/pollutants, will cause adverse effects to biota. 4. Conclusions As a result of such a comparative ecotoxicological analysis, the potential effects of four selected veterinary drugs, most commonly used in livestock or in aquacultures, on aquatic organisms were deﬁned.

Growth inhibition assay with duckweed No toxic effect toward L. minor was found for the maximal soluble fraction of MET (&gt;25 mg LÀ1) and DOR (&gt;0.31 mg LÀ1). Effects were found for OXT and FLO – both EC50 values were around 3 mg LÀ1 – but they were one order of magnitude higher than the values determined for the toxic reference compound atrazine. Pro et al. (2003) and Zounková et al. (2011) determined the toxicity of OXT toward L. minor in a 7-d test, obtaining EC50s of 4.92 mg LÀ1 and 2.1 mg LÀ1, respectively. Brain et al. (2004), however, assessed the phytotoxicity of OXT to Lemna gibba in 7-d static-renewal tests at the level of EC50 = 1.01 mg LÀ1 (calculated for the frond number). Halling-Sørensen (2000) suggested that the toxic effect may have been underestimated in static tests because, for example, of photodegradation of compounds with short halflives like OXT. Other authors, however, have conﬁrmed the negligible inﬂuence of photodegradation on the results under the conditions of a 7-d static test (Zounková et al., 2011).

The nitroimidazole MET is an antibiotic effective against anaerobic bacteria, protozoans and certain parasites. It acts by entering bacterial and protozoan cells and interfering with DNA (Lanzky and Halling-Sørensen, 1997). DOR is an antiparasitic drug which is a one of the most popular compound for curing anthelmintic disease. DOR binds to receptors that increase membrane permeability to chloride ions. This inhibits the electrical activity of nerve cells in nematodes and muscle cells in arthropods, paralyzing and ultimately killing the parasites (Horvat et al., 2012; Lumaret et al., 2012). </context>

Furthermore, in accordance to the IMS Health Market Prognosis (2012) the global pharmaceutical market has grown twice during the last decade. However the real amounts of drugs entering the environment can be much more higher due to lack of control with type and amounts of pharmaceuticals usage in developing countries e.g. India, Thailand, Indonesia (Sarmah et al., 2006). The relatively low cost and the broad spectrum of activity of these pharmaceuticals means they are very commonly used not only in animal husbandry (DOR, MET, FLO, OXT) but also in aquaculture (MET, FLO, OXT) (Christensen et al., 2006; Ferreira et al., 2007; Lai et al., 2009; Lumaret et al., 2012; Horvat et al., 2012). It must be pointed out that the veterinary medicines used in aquaculture are commonly administered as a medicated feed mainly as a bath formulation (Hekoten et al., 1995; Boxall, 2010). Hence a considerable proportion of these drugs administered in an intensive ﬁsh farm was found to have been released into the aquatic environment via urinary and fecal excretions and in unconLog P 4.44 Water solubility (mg LÀ1) 0.025 sumed medicated food (Hekoten et al. 1995).

Experimental All the data generated in our study were obtained according to internationally accepted test guidelines (e.g. OECD, ISO) or on speciﬁc (e.g. national) testing guidelines (e.g. DIN). Hence, according to the European Medicines Agency (Klimisch et al. (1997) and EMEA, 2008 our results can be classiﬁed under ‘‘reliability index 1’’. According to Klimisch et al.

The endpoint of this assay is the inhibition of algal reproduction, measured as the inhibition of population growth. Cell numbers were determined with a Coulter Counter Z2 (Beckmann, Nürnberg, Germany). The tests were performed in sterilized glass tubes, the algae were stirred throughout the 24 h test period, and the test conditions were the same as for the stock culture except for the CO2 source. Here, 150 lL of NaHCO3 solution was added to each test tube. The methods of stock culturing and testing are described in detail by Faust et al. (2001). Growth inhibition was calculated using the cell counts of the treated samples in relation to the untreated controls. At least six controls were used for each assay. The tests were performed using six different concentrations in two replicates of every compound and each test was carried out at least twice. 2.4.

The toxicity of DOR to green algae has not been calculated yet, but our study found its EC50 to be &gt;0.34 mg LÀ1. The exact value was not determined because of the low water solubility of this compound and the necessity of performing the test with an additional concentration of acetonitrile. Nevertheless, S. vacuolatus was found to be less sensitive to OXT, MET and FLO than C. vulgaris, P. subcapitata or S. capricornatum, as shown in Table 2. The results for FLO (EC50 = 18.0 mg LÀ1) are comparable to those given by Ferreira et al. (2007) and Lai et al. (2009), who evaluated the toxicity of FLO to different algae (Isochrysis galbana and Tetraselmis chui) (Table 2), widely used as food sources in early larval cultures of mollusks, ﬁsh and crustaceans.

Effects were found for OXT and FLO – both EC50 values were around 3 mg LÀ1 – but they were one order of magnitude higher than the values determined for the toxic reference compound atrazine. Pro et al. (2003) and Zounková et al. (2011) determined the toxicity of OXT toward L. minor in a 7-d test, obtaining EC50s of 4.92 mg LÀ1 and 2.1 mg LÀ1, respectively. Brain et al. (2004), however, assessed the phytotoxicity of OXT to Lemna gibba in 7-d static-renewal tests at the level of EC50 = 1.01 mg LÀ1 (calculated for the frond number). Halling-Sørensen (2000) suggested that the toxic effect may have been underestimated in static tests because, for example, of photodegradation of compounds with short halflives like OXT. Other authors, however, have conﬁrmed the negligible inﬂuence of photodegradation on the results under the conditions of a 7-d static test (Zounková et al., 2011). Photodegradation can also be presumed insigniﬁcant in the context of the current study, because the EC50 for OXT calculated in this study is generally comparable with the results obtained by both static and static-renewal tests (Brain et al. 2004; Zounková et al., 2011). </context>

(2005) highlighted that most of the toxicity data available for V. ﬁscheri using short exposure times (between 5 and 30 min) rather than a 24 h exposure show that most pharmaceuticals have a low toxic potential in this respect, because these compounds interfere only slightly with biosynthetic pathways. For example, the low sensitivity of V. ﬁscheri to OXT can be explained by its mode of action on protein synthesis, which is not of importance during short-term bioluminescence testing (Zounková et al., 2011). 3.2.2.

However the real amounts of drugs entering the environment can be much more higher due to lack of control with type and amounts of pharmaceuticals usage in developing countries e.g. India, Thailand, Indonesia (Sarmah et al., 2006). The relatively low cost and the broad spectrum of activity of these pharmaceuticals means they are very commonly used not only in animal husbandry (DOR, MET, FLO, OXT) but also in aquaculture (MET, FLO, OXT) (Christensen et al., 2006; Ferreira et al., 2007; Lai et al., 2009; Lumaret et al., 2012; Horvat et al., 2012). It must be pointed out that the veterinary medicines used in aquaculture are commonly administered as a medicated feed mainly as a bath formulation (Hekoten et al., 1995; Boxall, 2010). Hence a considerable proportion of these drugs administered in an intensive ﬁsh farm was found to have been released into the aquatic environment via urinary and fecal excretions and in unconLog P 4.44 Water solubility (mg LÀ1) 0.025 sumed medicated food (Hekoten et al. 1995).

The toxicity of DOR to green algae has not been calculated yet, but our study found its EC50 to be &gt;0.34 mg LÀ1. The exact value was not determined because of the low water solubility of this compound and the necessity of performing the test with an additional concentration of acetonitrile. Nevertheless, S. vacuolatus was found to be less sensitive to OXT, MET and FLO than C. vulgaris, P. subcapitata or S. capricornatum, as shown in Table 2. The results for FLO (EC50 = 18.0 mg LÀ1) are comparable to those given by Ferreira et al. (2007) and Lai et al.

This concentration is, however, well above environmentally relevant concentrations, which range from ng LÀ1 to hundreds of lg LÀ1 (Boxall et al., 2006). The 30 min EC50 obtained for OXT (108 mg LÀ1) is comparable to the results reported by Lalumera et al. (2004) (121–139 mg LÀ1) (Table 2). However, no clear correlation between available ecotoxiciy data for OXT to V. ﬁscheri and exposure time can be observed. Isidori et al. (2005) highlighted that most of the toxicity data available for V. ﬁscheri using short exposure times (between 5 and 30 min) rather than a 24 h exposure show that most pharmaceuticals have a low toxic potential in this respect, because these compounds interfere only slightly with biosynthetic pathways.

The nitroimidazole MET is an antibiotic effective against anaerobic bacteria, protozoans and certain parasites. It acts by entering bacterial and protozoan cells and interfering with DNA (Lanzky and Halling-Sørensen, 1997). DOR is an antiparasitic drug which is a one of the most popular compound for curing anthelmintic disease. DOR binds to receptors that increase membrane permeability to chloride ions. This inhibits the electrical activity of nerve cells in nematodes and muscle cells in arthropods, paralyzing and ultimately killing the parasites (Horvat et al., 2012; Lumaret et al., 2012). In many countries these pharmaceuticals are registered as medical premixes so they can be used in feedstuffs for the treatment or prevention of animal diseases.

It acts by entering bacterial and protozoan cells and interfering with DNA (Lanzky and Halling-Sørensen, 1997). DOR is an antiparasitic drug which is a one of the most popular compound for curing anthelmintic disease. DOR binds to receptors that increase membrane permeability to chloride ions. This inhibits the electrical activity of nerve cells in nematodes and muscle cells in arthropods, paralyzing and ultimately killing the parasites (Horvat et al., 2012; Lumaret et al., 2012). In many countries these pharmaceuticals are registered as medical premixes so they can be used in feedstuffs for the treatment or prevention of animal diseases. For example the usage of OXT in the UK in 2000 was 8.5 t and in the US, just in aquacultures in 2003, was 15 t (Sarmah et al., 2006; Schmidt et al., 2007). Furthermore, in accordance to the IMS Health Market Prognosis (2012) the global pharmaceutical market has grown twice during the last decade. However the real amounts of drugs entering the environment can be much more higher due to lack of control with type and amounts of pharmace</context>

(2000) for both OXT and MET; these observations are in agreement with our results for these two compounds. No data about the toxicity of FLO toward D. magna are available to date. Our investigation demonstrated the very low toxicity of this compound toward D. magna – 337 mg LÀ1. However, we obtained strong effects (EC50 = 0.0637 lg LÀ1) with DOR, which shows that this compound is ﬁve orders of magnitude more toxic than K2Cr2O7, the reference substance for this test. This was also stated by Pﬁzer Inc. (1996), who reported an EC50 of 0.1 lg LÀ1 for DOR. In their experiments, however, the authors did not consider determining the water-soluble fraction of this drug in biological media, which can be lower than in pure water. Hence the amount of compound which can cause harmful effect on the tested organisms can be lower than suspected. Therefore the EC50 of DOR that they determined was almost twice as high as our value (Pﬁzer Inc., 1996). These results highlight the importance of combining ecotoxicity tests with instrumental analysis in order to obtain reliable data, and to conﬁrm the exposure concen</context>

This concentration is, however, well above environmentally relevant concentrations, which range from ng LÀ1 to hundreds of lg LÀ1 (Boxall et al., 2006). The 30 min EC50 obtained for OXT (108 mg LÀ1) is comparable to the results reported by Lalumera et al. (2004) (121–139 mg LÀ1) (Table 2). However, no clear correlation between available ecotoxiciy data for OXT to V. ﬁscheri and exposure time can be observed. Isidori et al. (2005) highlighted that most of the toxicity data available for V. ﬁscheri using short exposure times (between 5 and 30 min) rather than a 24 h exposure show that most pharmaceuticals have a low toxic potential in this respect, because these compounds interfere only slightly with biosynthetic pathways.

Effects were found for OXT and FLO – both EC50 values were around 3 mg LÀ1 – but they were one order of magnitude higher than the values determined for the toxic reference compound atrazine. Pro et al. (2003) and Zounková et al. (2011) determined the toxicity of OXT toward L. minor in a 7-d test, obtaining EC50s of 4.92 mg LÀ1 and 2.1 mg LÀ1, respectively. Brain et al. (2004), however, assessed the phytotoxicity of OXT to Lemna gibba in 7-d static-renewal tests at the level of EC50 = 1.01 mg LÀ1 (calculated for the frond number). Halling-Sørensen (2000) suggested that the toxic effect may have been underestimated in static tests because, for example, of photodegradation of compounds with short halflives like OXT. Other authors, however, have conﬁrmed the negligible inﬂuence of photodegradation on the results under the conditions of a 7-d static test (Zounková et al., 2011).

The Koc value is very useful in predicting the mobility of organic soil contaminants; generally the higher Koc values the less mobile organic chemicals. However, studies have shown that the parent form of this drug can be present in the aquatic environment at concentration of 0.24–0.42 ng LÀ1 (Pﬁzer Inc., 1996).

Growth inhibition assay with duckweed No toxic effect toward L. minor was found for the maximal soluble fraction of MET (&gt;25 mg LÀ1) and DOR (&gt;0.31 mg LÀ1). Effects were found for OXT and FLO – both EC50 values were around 3 mg LÀ1 – but they were one order of magnitude higher than the values determined for the toxic reference compound atrazine. Pro et al. (2003) and Zounková et al. (2011) determined the toxicity of OXT toward L. minor in a 7-d test, obtaining EC50s of 4.92 mg LÀ1 and 2.1 mg LÀ1, respectively. Brain et al. (2004), however, assessed the phytotoxicity of OXT to Lemna gibba in 7-d static-renewal tests at the level of EC50 = 1.01 mg LÀ1 (calculated for the frond number). Halling-Sørensen (2000) suggested that the toxic effect may have been underestimated in static tests because, for example, of photodegradation of compounds with short halflives like OXT.

Of the various pharmaceuticals commonly used in veterinary medicine, special attention has been paid to four of them in the present work: doramectin, metronidazole, ﬂorfenicol and oxytetracycline, which differ in their activity and physicochemical properties (Table 1). OXT, FLO and MET are antibiotics and have a similar mode of action at the DNA/RNA-level. OXT is commonly used because of its broad-spectrum efﬁcacy in the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, mycoplasma and large viruses.

Growth inhibition assay with D. magna D. magna is usually regarded as the least sensitive organism, toward which, for example, OXT demonstrated no toxicity up to 400 mg LÀ1 in an acute test and only low toxicity in a chronic reproduction test (Zounková et al., 2011). Similar results were also obtained by Wollenberger et al. (2000) for both OXT and MET; these observations are in agreement with our results for these two compounds. No data about the toxicity of FLO toward D. magna are available to date. Our investigation demonstrated the very low toxicity of this compound toward D. magna – 337 mg LÀ1. However, we obtained strong effects (EC50 = 0.0637 lg LÀ1) with DOR, which shows that this compound is ﬁve orders of magnitude more toxic than K2Cr2O7, the reference substance for this test. This was also stated by Pﬁzer Inc. (1996), who reported an EC50 of 0.1 lg LÀ1 for DOR. In their experiments, however, the authors did n</context>

Isidori et al. (2005) highlighted that most of the toxicity data available for V. ﬁscheri using short exposure times (between 5 and 30 min) rather than a 24 h exposure show that most pharmaceuticals have a low toxic potential in this respect, because these compounds interfere only slightly with biosynthetic pathways. For example, the low sensitivity of V. ﬁscheri to OXT can be explained by its mode of action on protein synthesis, which is not of importance during short-term bioluminescence testing (Zounková et al., 2011). 3.2.2. Reproduction inhibition assay with green algae The toxicity of veterinary drugs toward S. vacuolatus is reported for the ﬁrst time. Our results indicate that this limnic green alga was generally more sensitive than V. ﬁscheri for FLO and OXT. FLO exhibited the strongest growth inhibition against S. vacuolatus, followed by OXT and MET. The toxicity of DOR to green algae has not been calculated yet, but our study found its EC50 to be &gt;0.34 mg LÀ1. The exact value was not determined because of the low water solubility of this compound and the necessity of performing the test with an addi</context>

As a result, despite having the same general mode of action, FLO was found to be more toxic (EC50 = 6.06 mg LÀ1) than OXT (EC50 = 11.18 mg LÀ1), a situation backed up by our ﬁndings. 3.2.3. Growth inhibition assay with duckweed No toxic effect toward L. minor was found for the maximal soluble fraction of MET (&gt;25 mg LÀ1) and DOR (&gt;0.31 mg LÀ1). Effects were found for OXT and FLO – both EC50 values were around 3 mg LÀ1 – but they were one order of magnitude higher than the values determined for the toxic reference compound atrazine. Pro et al. (2003) and Zounková et al. (2011) determined the toxicity of OXT toward L. minor in a 7-d test, obtaining EC50s of 4.92 mg LÀ1 and 2.1 mg LÀ1, respectively. Brain et al. (2004), however, assessed the phytotoxicity of OXT to Lemna gibba in 7-d static-renewal tests at the level of EC50 = 1.01 mg LÀ1 (calculated for the frond number). Halling-Sørensen (2000) suggested that the toxic effect may have been underestimated in static tests because, for example, of photodegradation of compounds with short halflives like OXT. Other authors, however, have conﬁrmed the negligible inﬂuence of photodegradation on the results under the condi</context>

As knowledge of its environmental fate and mobility in the environment is very limited, however, its effects on aquatic organisms should not be excluded from an evaluation of its ecotoxicity potential (Kolar and Kozˇuh Erzˇen, 2006.). 3.2.4. Growth inhibition assay with D. magna D. magna is usually regarded as the least sensitive organism, toward which, for example, OXT demonstrated no toxicity up to 400 mg LÀ1 in an acute test and only low toxicity in a chronic reproduction test (Zounková et al., 2011). Similar results were also obtained by Wollenberger et al. (2000) for both OXT and MET; these observations are in agreement with our results for these two compounds. No data about the toxicity of FLO toward D. magna are available to date. Our investigation demonstrated the very low toxicity of this compound toward D. magna – 337 mg LÀ1. However, we obtained strong effects (EC50 = 0.0637 lg LÀ1) with DOR, which shows that this compound is ﬁve orders of magnitude more toxic than K2Cr2O7, the reference substance for this test. This was also stated by Pﬁzer Inc. (1996), who reported an EC50 of 0.</context>
