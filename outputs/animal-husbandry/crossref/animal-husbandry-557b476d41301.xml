introduces the topic of normative orientation into the debate about socio-technical
transitions and system innovation (Kemp et al., 1998; Elzen et al., 2004; Smith et
al., 2005). Many historical cases that have been studied by transition scholars were
driven by commercial motivations of pioneers and entrepreneurs, e.g. cars replacing
horses (Geels, 2005), mechanical cargo handling machines replacing manual unloading
of ships (Van Driel and Schot, 2005), steamships replacing sailing ships (Geels,
2002), jet engines replacing piston engines (Geels, 2006a). While<component x="84.63"

main drivers. tive orientation therefore forms a new substantive contribution, which
has particular relevance for scholars who are interested in transitions towards
societal goals like sustainability (Elzen et al., 2004). In particular, we are
interested in transitions where the initial impulse for change consists of normative
contestation from regime outsiders (Van de Poel, 2000), such as social movements or
concerned researchers, who find certain performance aspects of existing
socio-technological regimes normatively unacceptable and in need of change. We call
these 'transitions in the making', not because we are able to foresee this will lead
to a transition, but because new developments are started that question some of the
basic assumptions in the existing regime which may (or may not) eventually lead to a
transition.<component x="354.12" y="170.65" width="251.56" height="154.4" page="1"

orientation is particularly difficult for transitions 'in the making', because
multiple transition paths often co-exist and are pursued simultaneously by different
actors and 5 social groups (Stirling, 2009). Which possible path eventually becomes
dominant thus depends on interactions between multiple actors, moves and
countermoves, strategic games, shifting alliances, political support, economic
success, technological learning processes and changing perceptions. The article's
general research question is: How, when and why is normative contestation of existing
regimes effective in influencing the orientation of transitions in the making? By
'effective in influencing the orientation' we mean that the developments in the
regime move in a direction that the contestants advocate. We address this question in
two steps. Firstly, we will enrich the multi-level perspective, which provides a
useful conceptualization of transitions, with insights from social movement theory
(SMT) and political science. We add SMT to conceptualize how outsiders such as animal
welfare groups exert normative pressure on existing regimes. From political science,
we use Kingdon's (1984) multiple stream model to argue that normative pressure is
more likely to lead to regime change if alignments with other developments (in
markets, regulations and technology) create a 'package' between problems and
solutions that is attractive to various stakeholders. Second, we investigate two case
studies where normative pressures tried to destabilize an existing regime and call
for alternatives that might lead to a future transition. The two cases concern two
sub-sectors in pig husbandry in the Netherlands and the influence from animal welfare
concerns (1970-2008). We have chosen these cases because animal welfare concerns are
entirely about normative considerations in contrast to negative externalities that
affect people or sectors. They differ fromconcerns over pig manure, which caused
functional problems of water pollution, stench, ammonia emissions and acid rain that
hindered water companies, local residents and urbanites. Defining socio-technological
regimes as rules and routines (Rip and Kemp, 1998), in tandem with technological
artefacts in practice, the two comparative cases are about technical changes in pig
husbandry systems (e.g. automatic feeding systems, manure removal systems, and floor
design), certain changes in husbandry routines (e.g. feeding routines) and market
changes. The regime reconfigurations in both cases are still 'in the making',
although one case has progressed substantially while the other has not. We will use
our conceptual additions to explain this difference. In Section 2, we provide a
conceptualization of the relevant processes and mechanisms in normatively oriented
transitions in the making. Section 3 discusses the data sources of our comparative
case study and historical pre-developments that set the scene. Subsequently we
analyze and compare two cases that formsub-sectors within pig husbandry: sow breeding
and pig fattening. Section 4 describes the first case (sow breeding), where animal
welfare pressure led to the large-scale introduction of new, group housing systems.
Section 5 describes the second case (pig fattening), where the contestants were less
successful. Three innovation projects (Hercules, Comfort Class, and Canadian Bedding)
that constitute alternative paths for transitions in the making did not progress much
in terms of wider diffusion. The discussion and analysis in Section 6 explains the
difference in outcomes with the conceptual perspective. The article ends in Section 7
with conclusions and suggestions for further research.<component x="73.82" y="148.47"

our conceptual framework for analysing the influence of normative contestation on the
orientation of transitions in the making. As there are no existing conceptual
frameworks that address the relation between normative contestation and innovation we
will combine some existing approaches to tackle our research question. We take the
multi-level perspective as a starting point (Section 2.1) and enrich this with
insights from social movement theory (Section 2.2) and political science (Section
2.3).<component x="343.31" y="671.51" width="251.56" height="91.64" page="2"

(MLP) distinguishes three analytical levels (Rip and Kemp, 1998; Geels, 2002; Geels
and Schot, 2007). Niches are seen as the locus for learning and experimentation with
radical innovation. The socio-technical regime refers to the semicoherent set of
rules and actors that reproduce, maintain and incrementally change elements that
together fulfil a societal function such as transport or meat production and
consumption. The regime is characterized by stability and path dependence because of
lockin mechanisms on various dimensions (e.g. costs, shared beliefs, sunk
investments, capabilities, user preferences and life styles). The socio-technical
landscape is an exogenous environment that influences niche and regime developments.
The MLP proposes that transitions, which are defined as regime shifts, come about
through interacting processes within and between these levels. Transitions do not
come about easily, because existing regimes are oriented towards stability and
incremental innovation along predictable trajectories. Radical innovations emerge in
niches, where dedicated actors engage in innovation projects to create
'configurations that work' (Rip and Kemp, 1998). Wider diffusion of niche-innovations
depends on internal dynamics and on windows of opportunity at the regime level, which
may arise fromexternal landscape developments or from normative pressures, as we will
show in this article. We propose a specific operationalization of the socio-technical
regime concept to accommodate our empirical focus on pig farmers and the animal
husbandry systems they operate in. While pig farmers are our focal group, we use an
embeddedness approach (Dacin et al., 1999) to capture the relations with various
other actors such as slaughterhouses, supermarkets, consumers, technology suppliers,
research institutes and universities, social movements such as the Animal Protection
Society, public opinion, and policy. To further conceptualize these relations, we
suggest that enterprises such as pig farms operate simultaneously in two environments
(Oliver, 1997): (1) a task environment which includes social groups that engage in
economic exchanges and transactions with industries (e.g. consumers, suppliers);
economic competitiveness, efficiency, and financial performance are dominant
selection criteria, and (2) an institutional environment which contains social groups
that affect industries in non-commercial ways, e.g. policy makers, social movements,
the wider public, media, public opinion; regulatory legitimacy and cultural-normative
legitimacy are the main selection criteria (Suchman, 1995). Fig. 1 links the MLP to
this conceptualization of socio-technical regimes for pig farming. This
operationalization of the MLP enables us to address the question of normative
orientation by investigating how initial normative pressure from the institutional
environment, in particular from social movements and public opinion, influences
policy and the task environment (consumer preferences, market demand, etc.). It also
helps us study how normative pressure influences the various niche-innovations that
may help transform the incumbent regime. It thus helps us answer our research
question, i.e. to analyze the effectiveness of normative contestation in influencing
transitions in the making.<component x="343.31" y="96.17" width="251.56"

pressure we mobilize insights from social movement theory. SMT is useful for our
research question, because it generally deals with conflicts between established
orders and groups that aim to correct some perceived injustice. Because SMT
traditionally focused on the labour movement, the civil rights movement,
suffragettes, etc., much of the work has a political focus. Recent work by
technology-oriented scholars, however, shows that SMT can be usefully applied to
technological innovations and industries as well (Lounsbury et al., 2003; Hess, 2005;
Smith, 2005). The existing literature suggests that the following three processes
from the social movement literature are particularly relevant to understand how
movements create normative pressure on existing political regimes: (1) resource
mobilization, (2) framing processes, and (3) political opportunity structures
(McAdamet al., 1996; Davis et al., 2005). (1) The mobilization of resources is
important for internal development of a social movement and for external influence on
other actors (e.g. public opinion, policy makers). Important resources are: money,
members, internal and external networks, expertise, credibility, respectability, and
contacts. If social movements mobilize more resources, their (normative) appeals
gather strength (McCarthy and Zald, 1977). (2) Framing processes are important ways
through which social movements aim to influence public opinion and the discourses by
which issues are discussed (Hajer, 1995). Issues or problems do not have meaning by
themselves. Instead, meaning arises from the frames into which issues are placed,
i.e. the "schemata of interpretation" that enable actors "to locate, perceive,
identify and label" (Goffman, 1974, p. 21) them. 'Framing' thus is a process through
which actors define problems, attribute causality and responsibility, and generally
influence the meaning of issues or problems. Framing is consequential because
collective constructions of reality make certain actions and response strategies more
(or less) likely. Social movements frame problems in ways to enhance their salience
and appeal to wider publics. This way they aim to shape the cognitive space in which
issues are debated (Eyerman and Jamison, 1991) and influence public opinion, which
then exerts credibility pressure on policy makers. Building on Benford and Snow
(2000), we propose that the strength or mobilization potential of collective frames
is influenced by: (a) their focus (addressing too many issues dilutes the strength),
(b) their empirical credibility The normative pressure on regimes increases if these
three sub-processes grow stronger. This increase depends on (changing) circumstances
and events. Major shocks or accidents, for instance, can push an issue higher on the
agenda and strengthen the empirical credibility of particular discourses. Issues also
compete for public attention with other problems (Hilgartner and Bosk, 1988) and
often experience issue-attention cycles (McComas and Shanahan, 1999; Brossard et al.,
2004) with problems rising and falling on public agendas as media and audiences get
bored and search for new issues. Increases in normative pressure are likely to have
more effect on transitions if they coincide with and can become linked to other
developments, leading to a particular 'package' (Kingdon, 1984) that can be pushed
through. We turn to these alignments now.<component x="84.63" y="391.91"

lateness="0.3076923076923077" reference_score="5.24">Normative pressure, even when it
is increasing, cannot bring about substantial regime change on its own. We argue that
such regime changes require alignments of normative pressure with other
socio-technical developments in Fig. 1, e.g. regulations, consumer demand, or market
pressure from supermarkets, nicheinnovations, etc. While social movements may try to
influence the developments in other domains (market, technology/innovation,
regulation), these domains also have their own dynamics. From the perspective of
social movements, these changes in other domains thus form 'opportunity structures',
to which normative pressures can (or cannot) be linked. To further operationalize
this alignment, we mobilize some insights from political science, in particular
Kingdon (1984), and adapt these for our research question. Kingdon criticized the
linear view on policy making, and instead argued that major policy changes come about
through alignments of three streams that have relatively independent dynamics:
problem stream, politics stream, and policy/solution stream. Although his multiple
stream model has much to offer for understanding political decision making, his focus
on policy is somewhat too narrow for our research topic. We therefore adapt some of
Kingdon's ideas and propose a broader view on streams, distinguishing four of them.
The first stream follows from our interest in normative contestation, the second and
third stream are based on the two 'environments' in Fig. 1, and the fourth is
relevant because of our focus on innovation. These streams are: 1. Problem stream. In
our case articulated as the normative orientation in the pressure by social
movements. 2. Regulatory and political stream. Since we focus on innovation and
socio-technical regimes, rather than policy per se, we have merged the policy and
politics stream from Kingdon's model. 3. Market stream. The dynamics in the system
can be affected by consumer preferences (households or businesses). If normative
concerns and cultural discourses lead to changes in consumer preferences, then
normatively oriented transitions become more likely. But while citizens may publicly
express concerns about normative problems, such as animal welfare, they often buy the
cheapest products as consumers (Te Velde et al., 2002). Social movements therefore
tend to target supermarkets which are often more sensitive to legitimacy and
reputation effects. Because supermarkets are important players in the meat chain,
changes in their policies may have substantial effects on pig farming practices. 4.
Technology stream. This generates potential technical solutions through R&amp;D
activities and innovation projects. Mainstream researchers with close ties to the
regime tend to generate incremental innovations, while researchers that deviate from
established regime rules tend to focus on more radical innovations. The latter are
what Van de Poel (2000) calls outside 6 professionals, who tend to operate at the
niche level in the MLP. These streams have their own dynamics, but also partially
interact. Building on Kingdon, we suggest that the chances for normatively-oriented
transitions greatly increase if various streams can be combined into a coherent
'package'. Despite his policy focus, Kingdon (1984: 21) articulates this dynamic
eloquently: "The separate streams come together at certain critical times, solutions
become joined to problems, and both of them are joined to favourable political
forces. This coupling is most likely when policy windows (opportunities for pushing
pet proposals or conceptions of problems) are open. ( ) Windows are . . . opened
either by the appearance of compelling problems or by happenings in the political
stream. ( ) Significant movement. . . is much more likely if problems, policy
proposals, and politics are all coupled into a package" (Kingdon, 1984: 21). Windows
of opportunity may open up because of crises and disasters (which can act as events
that focus public opinion and push problems onto political agendas), elections,
national mood swings, the appearance of new political parties, or technological
breakthroughs. But windows also close again and problems that may have risen on the
agenda because of social movement activities and normative pressures, can also fall
down again if they cannot be linked to a technological solution. Kingdon (1984: 210)
suggests that (policy) windows may be missed if proposals and solutions "have not
already gone through the long gestation process before the window opens". In contrast
to Kingdon, who suggests that the four streams are independent (he only sees somewhat
free floating policy entrepreneurs as bringing about linkages), we believe that
actors in problem and technical solution streams may actively work on bringing about
alignments and linkages. Zahariadis (1999) made a similar criticism. Social
movements, such as the Animal Protection Society, may actively support innovation
projects that aim to address problems. And researchers, designers, and firms who are
engaged in innovation projects, followand anticipate what happens in civil society,
markets and regulations. Innovators are 'heterogeneous engineers' (Law, 1987) who
work not only on inanimate physical materials, but also incorporate economic,
political, and social dimensions in the specification of their design criteria and
goals for innovation projects. Within innovation projects, actors can thus
deliberately work on creating a 'package' With these conceptual additions, and the
combinations between social movement theory, political science and innovation
studies, we have developed a perspective that is particularly tailored to the issue
of normative orientation in socio-technical transitions. This perspective builds on
the MLP, but pays more detailed attention to the roles of civil society actors and
policy makers, who play an important role in normative transitions, and their
interactions with innovation processes and market dynamics. We will use this
framework to answer our research question on the influence of normative contestation
on transitions in the making by applying it in a comparative case study in the
following sections.<component x="354.12" y="96.17" width="251.56" height="70.72"

that formsub-sectors within pig husbandry: sow breeding and pig fattening. Both
sub-sectors are characterized by mechanization, specialization, rationalization and
economies of scale, which form overarching guiding principles and routines. But they
are also different: socially they consist of different networks, with some farmers
specializing in breeding and others in fattening; in terms of technological knowledge
and routines, sow breeding draws on artificial insemination, breeding research,
artificial heating, antibiotics and nurturing, while pig fattening draws on
physiological research, food uptake and conversion rates, designer foods, rapid
growth and mass production. They also operate on different markets (Geels, 2009). If
we are precise, we need to call them sub-regimes since there are also clear links,
e.g. with the sows sub-regime providing piglets that are the starting 'material' for
the fattening pigs sub-regime. For the purpose of our analysis, however, these
relations play no role and therefore we can treat them as two separate regimes, i.e.
as two separate cases. The case studies are based on various technical and economic

interviewed representatives from the farmers association (LTO), slaughtering industry
(Vion), Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Protection Society and researchers who have
been involved in various developments described. In the case description these are
referred to by giving the interviewee's organizational background. To receive
feedback to our initial findings we organized a workshop with sector representatives
and agricultural scientists from different disciplines. Before we dive into the case,
we give a broad sketch of the development of pig farming in the Netherlands after the
Second World War. Fig. 2 illustrates that the number of pigs expanded rapidly to a
total of 14 million in 1990. After the year 2000, the number slightly decreased to
about 11.5 million in the years 2005-2007 (De Bont and Van der Knijff, 2007, p. 50).
In 2004, about 56% of all pigs were exported (Central Bureau of Statistics:
http://www.cbs.nl). Most of these pigs were slaughtered by the Dutch slaughtering
industry where a concentration took place in the early 2000s. This led to the
establishment of the Vion group that held two thirds of the Dutch market by 2007 and
became the largest in Europe. The growth in pig farming, which turned into an
economically flourishing sector, was accompanied by a shift towards industrial animal
production systems that were based on guiding principles such as mechanization,
specialization, rationalization and economies of scale. During this shift, pig
farming developed into an integrated chain with strong ties between animal food
providers, pig farmers, slaughterhouses, supermarkets, and consumers (Geels, 2009).
Pig farming itself transformed into a factory-like mass production system, with farms
of increasing size. The average number of pigs per farmincreased from25 in 1960 to
1300 in 2006 (Table 1). The scale increase in pigs per farm was accompanied by a
decrease in the number of farms, from about 120,000 in 1960 to 9040 in 2006, a 92%
drop. Sectoral evolution is characterized by a struggle for survival, with
cost-competition driving further scale increases. Consumers and supermarkets
contribute to the strong cost focus in the sector. For supermarkets, meat fulfils the
role of traffic generator: advertised at low prices, meat should seduce customers to
enter their shops, assuming they will also buy other products with larger profit
margins (Hoste et al., 2004, pp. 7-8). This practice creates strong backward pressure
from supermarkets to farmers to produce meat as cheaply as possible.<component

2007, respectively (Bolhuis and Wisman, 2008). Pigs to be fattened (or porkers) were
kept in groups of about a dozen in units separated from each other by metal fences
with an 2 per pig until 1998. The floors were average floor space of 0.7 m typically
made of slatted concrete on which the pigs urinated and defecated. By walking around,
the pigs pressed the faeces through the slits to be collected in cellars underneath.
This made the floors very slippery causing many claw problems. Furthermore, the pigs
experienced boredom in the small confinements making them bite the tails of
neighbours, resulting in wounds and infection. To reduce this problem, tails were
often cut off and teeth commonly clipped. Pregnant sows were kept differently because
of their eating habits. While pigs generally continue to grow when eating more,
mature sows do not grow larger but get fatter. This was prevented by giving them
limited rations, made possible by keeping them individually, sometimes in boxes
separated from each other. Another option were semi-open pigsties with fences between
the animals in which they were tethered to the floor with either a chain or a belt
fixed around the shoulder. Since the early 1970s, the shift to industrial mass
production methods in pig farming has been accompanied by criticism from
special-interest groups that represented new societal values such as animal welfare
and the environment. In 1972, the opening of a model pig farm (de Flevohof), intended
as the pride of the livestock sector to inform the public about progress in animal
husbandry, invoked strong protest against industrialized living conditions of pigs
and gave rise to the creation of an action group 'Sweet Animal' ('Lekker Dier'). The
same year, the Foundation for Nature and Environment published a critical report
called Bio Industry that warned that pigs were no longer seen as living creatures but
as resources and input materials for industrial processes. The term 'bio industry'
was coined deliberately to frame the damaging effects of industrial methods on
farming. The report also drew attention to stench problems, pollution of water and
soil from manure surpluses, and damage to the natural landscape (Crijns, 1998). The
Animal Protection Society (APS; 'Dierenbescherming'), a respectable NGO established
in 1864 with over 200,000 members and 70 staff members in the early 2000s, (APS
website) also saw industrial animal husbandry as a step backward for animal welfare
and favoured keeping animals according to organic principles. In the 1970s, organic
pig farming constituted a small market niche of about 1%, carried by small subsection
of 'moral consumers' who were willing to pay about 30-40% more for organically
produced pork. This meat came from animals that were kept in a more 'natural'
environment, had room to play and could exhibit their natural behaviour. This organic
niche slowly expanded to about 2% in the early 2000s. Initially, pig farmers
downplayed and ignored animal welfare concerns. In the late 1990s, however, the
sub-sector of pregnant sows, which initially kept sows in individual boxes, began
moving to group husbandry systems, which entailed the adoption of new<component

Agriculture established a commission "Animal husbandry - animal welfare" to
investigate how pregnant sows were kept. In 1975, the committee published a report
that concluded that sow husbandry had some weaknesses, which could be remedied with
various technical means (NRLO, 1975). In practice, however, little changed in the
following years. The debate intensified in the early 1980s. In 1982 the APS released
a study that was very critical of sow husbandry, focussing on chained sows stating:
"The short chain only allows the sow to stand op or lie down. Turning around or
walking a fewsteps is out of the question" (Dierenbescherming, 1982, p. 7). The study
concluded that the way sows were kept in the Netherlands was 'completely
unacceptable' (p. 41). With various campaigns, the APS tried to generate public
awareness. To this end they framed the problem using the catchy term 'chain sow' for
the pregnant sows that were tethered to the floor. This term and the accompanying
images struck an emotional chord in public opinion which felt that these animals
deserved better treatment (Fig. 3; Interview APS). Shortly after the release of the
APS report, the Ministry of Agriculture set up a new commission for pig welfare
issues. Its 1984<component x="73.82" y="323.18" width="251.56" height="206.71"

lateness="0.5384615384615384" reference_score="6.69">Gradually it became clear,
however, both in research and practice, that group housing had serious problems. The
reason was that the basic design was copied from the cattle sector, without taking
into account that pigs behave differently from cows. While cows tend to wait their
turn to be fed, sows are prepared to fight for more food and eat as much as they can.
If one sow was eating, for instance, a stronger sister might bite her in the rear to
chase her away to start eating a second ration. In the early 1990s, many pig-farmers,
who had moved to group housing, shifted back to the individual system. About half of
them, however, stuck to group housing. These pig farmers had developed specific
farming skills for successfully keeping pigs in groups (Interview animal researcher).
Scientists at the Rosmalen research institute continued to investigate group housing
systems. The fact that some 2% of the farmers had no serious problem with the group
housing suggested that the systemcould work despite its bad image. APS and the
scientists also referred to the UK where group-housing was more widely applied and
where a new bill would enforce it by the end of the decade. In the early 1990s, the
scientists occasionally interacted with the ministry and the APS on research findings
and on shaping further research. By 1996 they had developed and tested a second
generation of group housing systems. They concluded that group housing was now ready
for practical use but that it would require new managerial skills and competencies
from the pig farmer (Backus, 1997). The sector and the ministry, however, showed
little interest. At the time, there was much more societal concern for disposal of
manure and emissions from the bio industry than animal welfare which was rather low
on the political and societal agenda (Interview animal researcher). Thus, in terms of
our conceptual vocabulary, the political opportunity structure that had been
favourable to group housing in the late 1980s, had disappeared in the mid 1990s.
According to one involved researcher it was almost taboo to talk about group housing
in the mid 1990s. In his view this was due to a surplus of eagerness to move to group
housing in the 1980s, pushed by certain pig farmers and the ministry. They used crude
concepts adapted fromthe cattle sector and then found these did not work very well.
This eventually led to sector-wide hostility towards group housing of pregnant sows
in general which was difficult to counter with results from further research, no
matter how hard the scientist tried to show that the second-generation system worked
well (Interview LTO). 4.3. Swine-fever: the aftermath of an external shock
(1997-2007) After 4 February 1997, the political opportunity structure turned
completely due to an external shock. The trigger was an outbreak of swine-fever that
spread rapidly. On numerous pig farms, all pigs were killed and cranes were used to
load dead pigs onto huge trucks to take them to destroyers. These scenes were
broadcasted widely on Dutch television and stimulated a lively societal debate. In
total, over 11 million pigs were killed including almost 3 million 3-17 day old
piglets (Ministry of Agriculture data, cited in Dierenbescherming, 1999, 47). Many,
including politicians as well as the public, felt something really had to change in
pig husbandry. Within a few months, new legislation was drafted that would make
group-housing compulsory in ten years, i.e. in 2008. The sector protested heavily but
did not stand a chance against the societal and political pressure and determination.
LTO, the sector representative, realised that it made no sense to fight this change
further and that it had to find ways to inform farmers on how to make a smooth
transition. They organised meetings with pig-farmers throughout the country at which
the Rosmalen researchers were often invited to inform the attendees of their
findings. The unrest lasted about half a year and then gradually disappeared
(Interview animal researcher). Market forces also played a role in the change towards
group housing. The crucial economic factor was the export of Dutch pork to the UK. As
of 1 January 1999, pregnant sows in the UK would have to be kept in groups. UK pig
producers, animal welfare and consumer organizations put pressure on British
retailers to sell only bacon and other pig meat that came from pigs whose mothers had
been kept in groups. They were successful and because the UK formed a large export
market, the Dutch slaughter industry became interested in ensuring that a significant
share of Dutch pregnant sows would be kept in groups (Vermeer et al., 1999). This
made Dumeco, then a major slaughter company that later became part of the Vion group,
give a bonus to farmers who kept pregnant sows in groups (Interview LTO). Thus, the
normatively driven innovation in the niche aligned with market developments in the
regime. Also at the European level, pig husbandry increasingly became a matter of
concern. The European Commission enacted new regulations that resembled the Dutch
although they lagged a few years. New EU regulation forbade keeping pregnant sows on
chains as of 2005 (2001 in the Netherlands) and by 2013 all pregnant sows in the EU
should be kept in groups. The Dutch pig sector argued that this meant unfair
competition as for them group housing was compulsory by 2008 and to comply, the date
has been changed to 2013 in the Netherlands as well (Enting et al., 2006). In
anticipation of this new regulation, by 2008 about half the pig farmers had already
changed to group housing. Thus, in terms of our conceptual framework, we see that
normative pressure was exerted from the 1980s onward, although with varying strength.
The regulatory opportunity stream showed more variation and gained an enormous boost
after an external shock, the outbreak of swine fever. The technology stream showed a
hypedisappointment cycle with high expectations in the late 1980s, disappointment in
the early 1990s and development of a second<component x="343.31" y="96.17"

General aversion towards the bio industry (treating animals as commodities rather
than living beings). groups sought to end the bio industry altogether. In this
context, animal welfare concerns rose rapidly on the public and political agenda. The
societal pressure and the political determination led to a slight tightening of
rules, which triggered a gradual regime transformation path. Although economic
considerations remained prominent for the government, more attention was given to
animal welfare issues. To understand the discussion on regulations it is relevant to
know that many laws and regulations in the pig sector are communal, meaning that
regulation is laid down in directives of the EU. Member states have to translate
these into national legal and administrative measures. In relation to pig welfare,
the relevant EU directive is 91/630/EEC that specifies a minimum floor space of 2
0.65 m per pig (Enting et al., 2006). Since 1994, the Netherlands 2 had specified a
somewhat stricter rule, notably demanding 0.7 m per pig. Furthermore, the Dutch
ruling ('Varkensbesluit') specified that in due course it would be forbidden to keep
pigs on floors that were 100% slatted (to collect manure and urine in 2 underlying
cellars). For new pigsties, 0.3 m per pig would have to be solid and by 2003 fully
slatted floors would be prohibited (Spoolder et al., 2003). The EU directive does not
have such a provision. Shortly after the outbreak of swine fever the Dutch government
decided that in 1998 the floor space standard would be raised to 2 1 m and that by
the year 2000 the mandated solid floor area would 2 be 0.6 m (LNV, 1999). The sector
protested heavily as this implied they could keep 35% fewer pigs in the same area as
their European competitors. The Dutch government conceded and the rules were somewhat
relaxed. As of 2008, new pigsties would have to provide 2 2 0.8 m per pig which would
increase to 1 m by 2013 with a solid 2 (Enting et al., 2006). area of 0.4 m Another
new rule, specified in the EU directive, was that as of 1 January 2003 pigs should
have permanent access to a sufficient quantity of material "to enable proper
investigation and manipulation activities, such as straw, hay, wood, sawdust,
mushroom compost, peat or a mixture of such" (Enting et al., 2006). As stated, member
countries had to make their own interpretations of these directives and the Dutch
ruling was far less precise. The typical solution in the Netherlands was to hang a
chain in the sty that pigs could bite in and pull on, something that Dutch regulators
allowed (Interviews APS, Animal researcher). Pig farmers were anything but happy with
the new regulations, 2 especially the 2013 rule of 1 m per pig. They argued that this
would undermine their competitive position in the international market. 2 2 Going
from the minimum of 0.7 m for existing pigsties to 1 m was expected to cost 75 per
pig-place which added 2.8 eurocents D per kilogram to the price of meat. Because this
was more or less the farmer's profit margin, this was not considered economically
viable (Interview LTO). 5.3. Further contestation and the development of new
husbandry systems (2000-2008) A concentration of animal diseases in the late 1990s
and early 2000s (swine fever, BSE, foot and mouth disease, avian flu) further
deteriorated the public image of industrial animal production. In 2002 it led to a
new political party that exclusively focussed on animals. This Party for the Animals
('Partij voor de Dieren') participated in the 2003 general elections but won no
seats. In 2006, they were more successful, gaining 2 parliamentary seats out of 150.
They were supported by a wide variety of public figures including authors, artists
and TV personalities. This strategy of network building increased their visibility
and legitimacy, and enabled them to influence the public debate. Since 2006, the
party has bombarded the ministry with parliamentary questions on all sorts of issues
relating to animal welfare (cf. website http://www.partijvoordedieren.nl). Their
visibility also required other political parties and the Minister of Agriculture to
become more outspoken on animal welfare issues. In 2007, animal welfare issues also
received more attention at the European level, leading to debates about raising the
EU floor space standard 2 2 to about 0.75 m by 2013 (InterviewLTO). Thus, a new
from0.65 m political opportunity structure developed for animal welfare issues and
innovations. In response to these new social and political pressures, the pig sector
set up image campaigns like 'Pigs in Sight' ('Varkens in Zicht'). Some pig farms were
equipped with sky boxes where the public could watch pigsties and the behaviour of
pigs. This campaign was intended to convince the public that pigs were treated well
and that there was no reason for change (Interviews LTO, animal researcher). While
political actors and pig farmers focused on framing and regulations, several outside
actors worked on innovative projects. These innovations involved new components and
husbandry systems (mainly developed by engineers and scientists in various research
institutes) and new market segments (mainly developed by new retailers). We first
discuss two more radical concepts, the Hercules pigsty and Pigs in Comfort Class, and
then a concept that is closer to the mainstream, Canadian Bedding. 5.3.1. Hercules
pigsty 8 Researchers at WUR started the Hercules project in 1998. Their approach was
based on the expectation that emission standards would be tightened in the future and
that, especially after the 1997 outbreak of swine-fever, tighter animal welfare rules
would also be imposed (Ogink et al., 2001). Processing of manure became a focal point
in the design and communication on the Hercules project. In a conventional pigsty,
most of the floor space is slatted. Manure and urine fall on the floor and are
pressed through it by the pigs walking around. It is collected in underground cellars
and disposed of. Because of the large slatted area it is problematic to use straw
since this will clog up the openings. For animal welfare reasons, the government
intended to mandate an increase of the solid floor area. Farmers were not happy with
this because the larger the solid area made cleaning more difficult. One of the focal
points in Hercules was to design a system for separation of manure and urine in order
to lower the emissions of ammonia. The technical approach was to develop a slightly
convex moving manure belt under a row of pigpens. The liquid fraction (the urine)
would drip fromthe sides and was collected underneath while the solid fraction (the
manure) was collected at the end of the belt in a concentrated form (Ogink et al.,
2001). Although the Hercules design was primarily inspired for environmental reasons
it also had various animal welfare benefits. In view of costs, this moving belt could
not be too wide implying that the slatted part of the pigsty, where pigs should
relieve themselves, should also be smaller. This had the advantage that there was
more 2 solid floor space. The concept provided 1 m of floor space per pig (25% more
than the regulated standard) of which 75% was solid. This floor could be cooled or
warmed by running either cold or warm water through hoses in the floor. An increased
area of solid floor could also be better combined with the use of straw which had
become an icon in animal welfare. Pigs like to play with straw, chew on it and root
in it. Part of the Hercules design was a device called the 'straw swing'. Pigs could
play with it with their snout for which they were rewarded with some straw. Because

the year 2000, the APS proposed an activity on 'animal centred design' to the
Ministry of Agriculture within its long-term programme on 'Animal Production 2030'.
The ministry agreed and a desk study was started by APS and WUR-researchers (another
group than the one working on Hercules) to explore this. They took pig husbandry as
an example to elaborate the methodology. The methodology started by identifying ten
basic needs of pigs that were subsequently translated into various technical
solutions which, together, defined the pigsty concept. The main conclusion was that
it was possible to take animal welfare as a starting point to design pigsties in
which animals could be kept in an economically viable way. APS proposed to LTO that
they could try to build such a pigsty together, to prove that it could indeed be
done. LTO, feeling the societal pressure to develop new forms of husbandry, accepted
(Interviews LTO and APS). Although they agreed on building the pigsty there were
differences in the visions of the partners. LTO sawthe project primarily as a
research project that might have an impact in the long term. APS, however, aimed for
a pigsty that could operate within the existing systemand be economically viable
(Interviews LTO and APS). Eventually, a compromise was developed between aiming for
the long and the short term. First, a demonstration pigsty would be built to
demonstrate the technical viability. Then pigs would be introduced to demonstrate
that they were actually better off in the new pigsty. After that, five pig farmers
would be sought to use the new design principles in their own pigsty and demonstrate
the economic viability. Thus, it was not only a research project but it would also
have to operate in practice (LTO and Dierenbescherming, 2006). This eventually led to
the development of a new pigsty concept called Pigs in 10 Comfort Class (PCC) with a
term derived from the aviation sector. The PCC-approach specifies the 10 basic needs
of pigs, but it does not prescribe technical solutions to satisfy these needs (LTO
and Dierenbescherming, 2006, 4). To give an example, in a popular vision pigs have a
need to be outside and roll in the mud, allegedly 5.3.3. Canadian bedding Trying to
find other routes to improve the keeping of animals the APS has worked with a
relatively new Dutch retailer, Jumbo supermarkets. Jumbo is a family owned company, a
relative outsider in the supermarket world that seeks to profile itself with low
prices and care for quality and sustainability. On its website, Jumbo has several
pages addressing "responsible food" which also provides information on how animals
are kept for some of its 'responsible' 11 products and contrasts this with the bio
industry.<component x="84.63" y="166.09" width="251.56" height="363.62" page="9"

the APS, Jumbo started to sell a pigs case, APS performed additional work by teaming
up special type of pork, in addition to regular pork, that comes from with LTO, the
(pig-) farmers representative, to demonstrate pigs that are kept in so-called
Canadian Bedding pigsties. This conan alternative concept (PCC). Until 2009, this had

pigs to lie on and gives them something to root in and chew on. This concept has also
been adopted by a small number of Dutch pig farmers. Jumbo has embraced the concept
and now sells meat from pigs from one farmer who houses pigs in these pigsties,
calling it "Jumbo conscious pork". APS has designed a special quality label that
Jumbo is allowed to use. This meat is about 15% more expensive than typical
supermarket pork. In 2006, Jumbo started to sell it in six shops and 12 in 2007 did
so in all of its over 100 outlets (Interview APS). In this case, three streams
aligned, notably normative pressure, technology (Canadian Bedding) and market. There
are no indications that regulation played a serious role in developing this concept.
It can hardly be stated that this started a transformation as the husbandry concept
was already used and the market share of this pork at the time of writing was so
small that it did not lead to an increased use of the Canadian Bedding concept. 6.
Analysis and discussion Our research question was: How, when and why is normative
contestation of existing regimes effective in influencing the orientation of
transitions in the making? We can now answer this question for the two empirical
cases, explaining the different outcomes with the conceptualizations from Section 2.
In the case of pregnant sows, normative contestations from NGOs and animal scientists
reached their aspired goals. By 2009 about half the pig farmers had converted to
group housing systems and the others will soon follow because group housing will be
legally enforced as of 2013. In the case of fattening pigs, normative contestations
had less success, leading only to gradual changes 2 2 in floor space (from 0.7 m per
pig via 0.8 m for new pigsties as of 2 2008 and 1 m in 2013), a slight increase in
solid floor space in 2013 and the provision of toys. Various alternative husbandry
concepts were developed but did not diffuse widely. To explain these differences, we
will look at two main processes: (a) increasing normative pressure, and (b) alignment
of normative pressure with economic, regulatory, and technological niche
developments. 6.1. Increasing normative pressure To analyze normative pressure,
Section 2 proposed three concepts: (1) resource mobilization, (2) (political)
opportunity structures, and (3) framing, which was sub-divided into focus, empirical
credibility, cultural resonance and emotional appeal. We will apply these concepts in
turn. the lumber industry produces a lot of sawdust that local pig farm- (Ad 2)
Political opportunity structures were also more or less the same for both cases.
Until the turn of the century, the structural characteristics of the political
constellation relevant for animal welfare changed relatively little. This changed
with the advent of the Party for the Animals in early 2007. It succeeded in pushing
animal welfare concerns high on the political agenda and these have remained there
since. (Ad 3) Framing by animal welfare organizations differed considerably for both
cases. Firstly, the framing had more focus for pregnant sows, both in terms of
problems (the 'chain sow') and solutions (keeping pregnant sows in groups). For
fattening pigs, the framing was less focused, because a wide variety of animal
welfare problems struggled for attention. Furthermore, animal welfare problems
competed with sustainability issues related to emissions (ammonia) and manure
disposal. This multitude of problems limited the focus and strength of framing
processes for the fattening pigs case. (Ad 4) Secondly, framing processes had
stronger emotional appeal for pregnant sows, especially through the catchy term and
images of 'chain sows'. The public, policy makers and even some farmers agreed that a
sow with a chain or belt around the shoulder was unfriendly to the animal. The APS
used this powerful image to articulate a moral framing of unacceptability. The
alternative (group housing) was also well framed by linking it with notions of pigs
as sociable animals. For fattening pigs, in contrast, the framing was less successful
in terms of emotional appeal. Furthermore, the pig farmers, especially their
representative body LTO, were more successful in counter-framing for fattening pigs
than for pregnant sows. For fattening pigs, the farmers argued that strong
international cost-based competition prevented them from adopting the more
substantial animal welfare innovations that would raise costs and reduce
competitiveness. Initially, in the early 1990s, a counter-framing strategy also
worked successfully for pregnant sows ("experience shows pregnant sows in groups is a
disaster") even though proponents pointed to 2% of the sow farmer's population who
had successfully implemented the alternative in practice. (Ad 5) In the late 1990s, a
sequence of external shocks changed the context drastically. These included the swine
fever outbreak in 1997 and a number of other animal diseases and food scandals
shortly thereafter. This considerably reduced the strength of the LTO counter-framing
while the general problem framing by animal welfare groups gained empirical
credibility and cultural resonance. This strengthened general concerns about
industrial animal production and mobilized public opinion as an additional resource
to put pressure on political and regulatory processes.<component x="73.82" y="232.16"

pregnant sows entailed a change in practices-the management of sows required farmers
to develop some new routines (e.g. to manage sows in groups), which many of them
initially resisted, as well as development and adoption of new technical components
(especially new feeding systems that separated eating sows from each other). Thus,
technological change was important, especially the development from first generation
(late 1980s) to second generation feeding systems (mid-1990s). The technology
experienced a hype-disappointment cycle, with farmers having high expectations in the
late 1980s when about 5% of sow farmers shifted to group housing. However, teething
problems with the first generation feeding systems led to disappointments causing a
decline in group farming to about 2%. Around 1995, when second generation systems
were developed, negative perceptions of group housing had hardened, which frustrated
further diffusion. The swine fever shock in 1997, however, provided a window of
opportunity, which advocates of group housing took advantage of. Alignment with
public opinion led to strong normative pressure on policy makers. Policy makers then
issued regulations that made group housing compulsory in 10 years time. Farmers
protested, arguing that this was not possible and would reduce competitiveness
(counter-framing) but NGOs and policy makers could overrule these protests by
pointing both to technical progress (second generation) and the 2% of farmers who
showed that such concepts could be applied successfully. Market forces also played a
role, especially from UK supermarkets (which faced pressure from more radical animal
rights groups) which in 1999 demanded group housing in relation to imported bacon.
This dynamic of the various streams is summarised in Table 2. As Kingdomnoted, the
coming together of various streams at the same time to forma coherent package greatly
enhances the chances for regime change. In the case of pregnant sows, this is what
happened in 1997. It was particularly crucial that the second generation of technical
alternatives were sufficiently developed when the window of opportunity opened (due
to the swine fever shock) and that 2% of farmers had demonstrated economic
feasibility. Both aspects enabled policy makers to issue strict regulations that
pushed the alternative through. For fattening pigs, the development of alternatives
such as Hercules, Pigs in Comfort Class (PCC) and Canadian Bedding resulted in
stabilized concepts in the early 2000s. At the time of the 1997 crisis, however, such
concepts were not available because most innovation efforts in the 1980s had not
focused on animal welfare, but on<component x="84.63" y="229.77" width="251.56"

no well-developed alternatives when the 1997 window of opportunity opened. By 2005,
when the Hercules project was finished the political interest had gone and the
concept was shelved. Two years later, with the upcoming of the Party for the Animals
the interest rose again and the PCC concept, that was then in the middle of its
development, gained a better reception, thus reinforcing the conclusion about the
importance of creating a package. Furthermore, regulatory pressure was weak in the
case of fattening pigs, partly because there were no available alternatives that
could be pushed through when the normative pressure was high, and partly because the
counter-framing strategies of farmers (welfare innovations would reduce
competitiveness) were more successful. Market demand was also weaker in this case,
with mainstream consumers not translating moral concerns into purchasing decisions,
buying the cheapest meat in supermarkets instead. The 2008-2009 attempts by Jumbo,
then a relative fringe actor in the supermarket sector, to create an intermediary
'animal friendly' segment (between organic and regular pork) are interesting in this
respect, but have not produced major successes at the time of writing. In sum, while
these alternatives might constitute the onset of a transition path, the lack of
alignment with regulatory and market processes hindered broader diffusion. As a
result, the overall development path in the fattening pig sub-sector has been gradual
change, driven primarily by somewhat stricter regulations in response to normative
pressure and public concerns. Following the 1997 crisis, and in response to the
accompanying public outrage, government regulations mandated 2 2 increased floor
space from 0.7 m to 0.8 m per pig for new pigsties 2 which will increase to 1 m by
2013. Further regulations also specified the introduction of toys and and a minimum
area of solid floor. Table 3 summarises the dynamic of the various streams for
different periods in the pig fattening case. Normative pressure from outsiders was
present throughout de studied timeframe although with different strength for the
various periods. The dynamic of the other streams shows more variation, esp. from2002
onward. Comparing Tables 2 and 3 we conclude that the 'coherent package', to use
Kingdon's term, that developed in the sows case did not develop in the fattening
case, neither in terms of problems nor in terms of solutions. In the case of sows
there was a rather uniform problem definition of keeping sows separate, using

for framing. In the fattening pigs case, many animal welfare issues competed for
attention like little room per pig, no possibility to root and play, cutting tails,
clipping teeth, castration without using anaesthetic. Moreover, there were also
environmental concerns in connection with manure disposal, (ammonia) emissions and
stench. Concerning solutions, in the sows case there was a clear way to go, i.e. to
move towards group housing. For pig fattening, the variety in problem definitions
also led to a variety in (technical as well as market/institutional) solutions. In
this case no coherent package could therefore be offered that could be 'pushed
through' with the proper alignment of different forces.<component x="73.82"

topic of normative orientation into the debate on transitions and enriched the
multi-level perspective with insights from social movement theory and political
science. More specifically, it investigated the question how normative contestation
of existing regimes can influence the orientation of transitions in the making. Our
analysis shows that there are two sides to this question: the first concerns the
dynamic of the contestation process, the second concerns the alignment with three
other processes or streams in our analysis. Social movement theory was helpful in
analysing the contestation dynamic. Three key concepts (resource mobilization,
(political) opportunity structures, and framing) were useful to analyze how
contestation by regime outsiders may lead to increased normative pressure on regimes.
One conclusion fromour study is that the existence of a variety of problem
definitions may considerably weaken the normative pressure. But our cases also show
that the strength of normative pressure forms only part of the explanation. The
second part of the explanation is that ongoing processes may create 'opportunity'
structures that allow normative pressure to be effective. Building on Kingdon and the
multi-level perspective, we suggested that four 'streams' are relevant to determine
this opportunity structure, notably a problem, regulatory/policy, technology and
market stream. Each of these streams has its own dynamic although various actors
involved make explicit attempts to link them. As a general conclusion, normative
contestation has its largest impact when the other streams become aligned at a
certain point in time to create what Kingdon calls a 'coherent package'. Because the
four streams have their own dynamic the issue of timing is critical for the creation
of such a package. Interestingly, in our case we see that a variety of problem
definitions in the fattening pigs case is accompanied by a variety in technical
solutions (Hercules, PCC, Canadian Bedding). It seems that this variety on the
problem side and variety on the solution side both weaken the possibility of
alignment and hence the onset of a transformation process. Using a term from
innovation studies, we presume that the creation of a successful package increases if
preceding innovation processes have resulted in a 'dominant design' that can be
linked to problems if a policy window opens. If various designs exist, this linkage
is more difficult. More research would be needed to analyze how this works exactly.
This article has addressed the topic of normative orientation with a conceptual
framework and a comparative case study. Our findings therefore have a 'proof of
principle' character. To generalise the findings and elaborate the perspective, we
hope that other studies will further investigate these topics. On a more general
note, we think that these topics also have relevance for the field of innovation
studies, which has produced substantial knowledge about factors that influence
general innovativeness (often related to economic issues of competitiveness and
profitability) and the speed of technical trajectories, but paid less attention to
questions surrounding directionality and normativity (Stirling, 2009).<component

driven by commercial motivations of pioneers and entrepreneurs, e.g. cars replacing
horses (Geels, 2005), mechanical cargo handling machines replacing manual unloading

has particular relevance for scholars who are interested in transitions towards
societal goals like sustainability (Elzen et al., 2004). In particular, we are
interested in transitions where the initial impulse for change consists of normative
contestation from regime outsiders (Van de Poel, 2000), such as social movements or
concerned researchers, who find certain performance aspects of existing
socio-technological regimes normatively unacceptable and in need of change. We call
these 'transitions in the making', not because we are able to foresee this will lead
to a transition, but because new developments are started that question some of the
basic assumptions in the existing regime which may (or may not) eventually lead to a

actors and 5 social groups (Stirling, 2009). Which possible path eventually becomes
dominant thus depends on interactions between multiple actors, moves and
countermoves, strategic games, shifting alliances, political support, economic
success, technological learning processes and changing perceptions. The article's
general research question is: How, when and why is normative contestation of existing
regimes effective in influencing the orientation of transitions in the making? By
'effective in influencing the orientation' we mean that the developments in the
regime move in a direction that the contestants advocate. We address this question in
two steps. Firstly, we will enrich the multi-level perspective, which provides a
useful conceptualization of transitions, with insights from social movement theory
(SMT) and political science. We add SMT to conceptualize how outsiders such as animal
welfare groups exert normative pressure on existing regimes. From political science,
we use Kingdon's (1984) multiple stream model to argue that normative pressure is
more likely to lead to regime change if alignments with other developments (in
markets, regulations and technology) create a 'package' between problems and
solutions that is attractive to various stakeholders. Second, we investigate two case
studies where normative pressures tried to destabilize an existing regime and call
for alternatives that might lead to a future transition. The two cases concern two
sub-sectors in pig husbandry in the Netherlands and the influence from animal welfare
concerns (1970-2008). We have chosen these cases because animal welfare concerns are
entirely about normative considerations in contrast to negative externalities that
affect people or sectors. They differ fromconcerns over pig manure, which caused
functional problems of water pollution, stench, ammonia emissions and acid rain that
hindered water companies, local residents and urbanites. Defining socio-technological
regimes as rules and routines (Rip and Kemp, 1998), in tandem with technological
artefacts in practice, the two comparative cases are about technical changes in pig
husbandry systems (e.g. automatic feeding systems, manure removal systems, and floor
design), certain changes in husbandry routines (e.g. feeding routines) and market
changes. The regime reconfigurations in both cases are still 'in the making',
although one case has progressed substantially while the other has not. We will use
our conceptual additions to explain this difference. In Section 2, we provide a
conceptualization of the relevant processes and mechanisms in normatively oriented
transitions in the making. Section 3 discusses the data sources of our comparative
case study and historical pre-developments that set the scene. Subsequently we
analyze and compare two cases that formsub-sectors within pig husbandry: sow breeding
and pig fattening. Section 4 describes the first case (sow breeding), where animal
welfare pressure led to the large-scale introduction of new, group housing systems.
Section 5 describes the second case (pig fattening), where the contestants were less
successful. Three innovation projects (Hercules, Comfort Class, and Canadian Bedding)
that constitute alternative paths for transitions in the making did not progress much
in terms of wider diffusion. The discussion and analysis in Section 6 explains the
difference in outcomes with the conceptual perspective. The article ends in Section 7
with conclusions and suggestions for further research.<component x="73.82" y="148.47"

frameworks that address the relation between normative contestation and innovation we
will combine some existing approaches to tackle our research question. We take the
multi-level perspective as a starting point (Section 2.1) and enrich this with
insights from social movement theory (Section 2.2) and political science (Section
2.3).<component x="343.31" y="671.51" width="251.56" height="91.64" page="2"

(MLP) distinguishes three analytical levels (Rip and Kemp, 1998; Geels, 2002; Geels
and Schot, 2007). Niches are seen as the locus for learning and experimentation with
radical innovation. The socio-technical regime refers to the semicoherent set of
rules and actors that reproduce, maintain and incrementally change elements that
together fulfil a societal function such as transport or meat production and
consumption. The regime is characterized by stability and path dependence because of
lockin mechanisms on various dimensions (e.g. costs, shared beliefs, sunk
investments, capabilities, user preferences and life styles). The socio-technical
landscape is an exogenous environment that influences niche and regime developments.
The MLP proposes that transitions, which are defined as regime shifts, come about
through interacting processes within and between these levels. Transitions do not
come about easily, because existing regimes are oriented towards stability and
incremental innovation along predictable trajectories. Radical innovations emerge in
niches, where dedicated actors engage in innovation projects to create
'configurations that work' (Rip and Kemp, 1998). Wider diffusion of niche-innovations
depends on internal dynamics and on windows of opportunity at the regime level, which
may arise fromexternal landscape developments or from normative pressures, as we will
show in this article. We propose a specific operationalization of the socio-technical
regime concept to accommodate our empirical focus on pig farmers and the animal
husbandry systems they operate in. While pig farmers are our focal group, we use an
embeddedness approach (Dacin et al., 1999) to capture the relations with various
other actors such as slaughterhouses, supermarkets, consumers, technology suppliers,
research institutes and universities, social movements such as the Animal Protection
Society, public opinion, and policy. To further conceptualize these relations, we
suggest that enterprises such as pig farms operate simultaneously in two environments
(Oliver, 1997): (1) a task environment which includes social groups that engage in
economic exchanges and transactions with industries (e.g. consumers, suppliers);
economic competitiveness, efficiency, and financial performance are dominant
selection criteria, and (2) an institutional environment which contains social groups
that affect industries in non-commercial ways, e.g. policy makers, social movements,
the wider public, media, public opinion; regulatory legitimacy and cultural-normative
legitimacy are the main selection criteria (Suchman, 1995). Fig. 1 links the MLP to
this conceptualization of socio-technical regimes for pig farming. This
operationalization of the MLP enables us to address the question of normative
orientation by investigating how initial normative pressure from the institutional
environment, in particular from social movements and public opinion, influences
policy and the task environment (consumer preferences, market demand, etc.). It also
helps us study how normative pressure influences the various niche-innovations that
may help transform the incumbent regime. It thus helps us answer our research
question, i.e. to analyze the effectiveness of normative contestation in influencing
transitions in the making.<component x="343.31" y="96.17" width="251.56"

pressure we mobilize insights from social movement theory. SMT is useful for our
research question, because it generally deals with conflicts between established
orders and groups that aim to correct some perceived injustice. Because SMT
traditionally focused on the labour movement, the civil rights movement,
suffragettes, etc., much of the work has a political focus. Recent work by
technology-oriented scholars, however, shows that SMT can be usefully applied to
technological innovations and industries as well (Lounsbury et al., 2003; Hess, 2005;
Smith, 2005). The existing literature suggests that the following three processes
from the social movement literature are particularly relevant to understand how
movements create normative pressure on existing political regimes: (1) resource
mobilization, (2) framing processes, and (3) political opportunity structures
(McAdamet al., 1996; Davis et al., 2005). (1) The mobilization of resources is
important for internal development of a social movement and for external influence on
other actors (e.g. public opinion, policy makers). Important resources are: money,
members, internal and external networks, expertise, credibility, respectability, and
contacts. If social movements mobilize more resources, their (normative) appeals
gather strength (McCarthy and Zald, 1977). (2) Framing processes are important ways
through which social movements aim to influence public opinion and the discourses by
which issues are discussed (Hajer, 1995). Issues or problems do not have meaning by
themselves. Instead, meaning arises from the frames into which issues are placed,
i.e. the "schemata of interpretation" that enable actors "to locate, perceive,
identify and label" (Goffman, 1974, p. 21) them. 'Framing' thus is a process through
which actors define problems, attribute causality and responsibility, and generally
influence the meaning of issues or problems. Framing is consequential because
collective constructions of reality make certain actions and response strategies more
(or less) likely. Social movements frame problems in ways to enhance their salience
and appeal to wider publics. This way they aim to shape the cognitive space in which
issues are debated (Eyerman and Jamison, 1991) and influence public opinion, which
then exerts credibility pressure on policy makers. Building on Benford and Snow
(2000), we propose that the strength or mobilization potential of collective frames
is influenced by: (a) their focus (addressing too many issues dilutes the strength),
(b) their empirical credibility The normative pressure on regimes increases if these
three sub-processes grow stronger. This increase depends on (changing) circumstances
and events. Major shocks or accidents, for instance, can push an issue higher on the
agenda and strengthen the empirical credibility of particular discourses. Issues also
compete for public attention with other problems (Hilgartner and Bosk, 1988) and
often experience issue-attention cycles (McComas and Shanahan, 1999; Brossard et al.,
2004) with problems rising and falling on public agendas as media and audiences get
bored and search for new issues. Increases in normative pressure are likely to have
more effect on transitions if they coincide with and can become linked to other
developments, leading to a particular 'package' (Kingdon, 1984) that can be pushed
through. We turn to these alignments now.<component x="84.63" y="391.91"

is increasing, cannot bring about substantial regime change on its own. We argue that
such regime changes require alignments of normative pressure with other
socio-technical developments in Fig. 1, e.g. regulations, consumer demand, or market
pressure from supermarkets, nicheinnovations, etc. While social movements may try to
influence the developments in other domains (market, technology/innovation,
regulation), these domains also have their own dynamics. From the perspective of
social movements, these changes in other domains thus form 'opportunity structures',
to which normative pressures can (or cannot) be linked. To further operationalize
this alignment, we mobilize some insights from political science, in particular
Kingdon (1984), and adapt these for our research question. Kingdon criticized the
linear view on policy making, and instead argued that major policy changes come about
through alignments of three streams that have relatively independent dynamics:
problem stream, politics stream, and policy/solution stream. Although his multiple
stream model has much to offer for understanding political decision making, his focus
on policy is somewhat too narrow for our research topic. We therefore adapt some of
Kingdon's ideas and propose a broader view on streams, distinguishing four of them.
The first stream follows from our interest in normative contestation, the second and
third stream are based on the two 'environments' in Fig. 1, and the fourth is
relevant because of our focus on innovation. These streams are: 1. Problem stream. In
our case articulated as the normative orientation in the pressure by social
movements. 2. Regulatory and political stream. Since we focus on innovation and
socio-technical regimes, rather than policy per se, we have merged the policy and
politics stream from Kingdon's model. 3. Market stream. The dynamics in the system
can be affected by consumer preferences (households or businesses). If normative
concerns and cultural discourses lead to changes in consumer preferences, then
normatively oriented transitions become more likely. But while citizens may publicly
express concerns about normative problems, such as animal welfare, they often buy the
cheapest products as consumers (Te Velde et al., 2002). Social movements therefore
tend to target supermarkets which are often more sensitive to legitimacy and
reputation effects. Because supermarkets are important players in the meat chain,
changes in their policies may have substantial effects on pig farming practices. 4.
Technology stream. This generates potential technical solutions through R&amp;D
activities and innovation projects. Mainstream researchers with close ties to the
regime tend to generate incremental innovations, while researchers that deviate from
established regime rules tend to focus on more radical innovations. The latter are
what Van de Poel (2000) calls outside 6 professionals, who tend to operate at the
niche level in the MLP. These streams have their own dynamics, but also partially
interact. Building on Kingdon, we suggest that the chances for normatively-oriented
transitions greatly increase if various streams can be combined into a coherent
'package'. Despite his policy focus, Kingdon (1984: 21) articulates this dynamic
eloquently: "The separate streams come together at certain critical times, solutions
become joined to problems, and both of them are joined to favourable political
forces. This coupling is most likely when policy windows (opportunities for pushing
pet proposals or conceptions of problems) are open. ( ) Windows are . . . opened
either by the appearance of compelling problems or by happenings in the political
stream. ( ) Significant movement. . . is much more likely if problems, policy
proposals, and politics are all coupled into a package" (Kingdon, 1984: 21). Windows
of opportunity may open up because of crises and disasters (which can act as events
that focus public opinion and push problems onto political agendas), elections,
national mood swings, the appearance of new political parties, or technological
breakthroughs. But windows also close again and problems that may have risen on the
agenda because of social movement activities and normative pressures, can also fall
down again if they cannot be linked to a technological solution. Kingdon (1984: 210)
suggests that (policy) windows may be missed if proposals and solutions "have not
already gone through the long gestation process before the window opens". In contrast
to Kingdon, who suggests that the four streams are independent (he only sees somewhat
free floating policy entrepreneurs as bringing about linkages), we believe that
actors in problem and technical solution streams may actively work on bringing about
alignments and linkages. Zahariadis (1999) made a similar criticism. Social
movements, such as the Animal Protection Society, may actively support innovation
projects that aim to address problems. And researchers, designers, and firms who are
engaged in innovation projects, followand anticipate what happens in civil society,
markets and regulations. Innovators are 'heterogeneous engineers' (Law, 1987) who
work not only on inanimate physical materials, but also incorporate economic,
political, and social dimensions in the specification of their design criteria and
goals for innovation projects. Within innovation projects, actors can thus
deliberately work on creating a 'package' With these conceptual additions, and the
combinations between social movement theory, political science and innovation
studies, we have developed a perspective that is particularly tailored to the issue
of normative orientation in socio-technical transitions. This perspective builds on
the MLP, but pays more detailed attention to the roles of civil society actors and
policy makers, who play an important role in normative transitions, and their
interactions with innovation processes and market dynamics. We will use this
framework to answer our research question on the influence of normative contestation
on transitions in the making by applying it in a comparative case study in the

that formsub-sectors within pig husbandry: sow breeding and pig fattening. Both
sub-sectors are characterized by mechanization, specialization, rationalization and
economies of scale, which form overarching guiding principles and routines. But they
are also different: socially they consist of different networks, with some farmers
specializing in breeding and others in fattening; in terms of technological knowledge
and routines, sow breeding draws on artificial insemination, breeding research,
artificial heating, antibiotics and nurturing, while pig fattening draws on
physiological research, food uptake and conversion rates, designer foods, rapid
growth and mass production. They also operate on different markets (Geels, 2009). If
we are precise, we need to call them sub-regimes since there are also clear links,
e.g. with the sows sub-regime providing piglets that are the starting 'material' for
the fattening pigs sub-regime. For the purpose of our analysis, however, these
relations play no role and therefore we can treat them as two separate regimes, i.e.
as two separate cases. The case studies are based on various technical and economic
reports from research institutes, sector organizations and the Min7 istry of

interviewed representatives from the farmers association (LTO), slaughtering industry
(Vion), Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Protection Society and researchers who have
been involved in various developments described. In the case description these are
referred to by giving the interviewee's organizational background. To receive
feedback to our initial findings we organized a workshop with sector representatives
and agricultural scientists from different disciplines. Before we dive into the case,
we give a broad sketch of the development of pig farming in the Netherlands after the
Second World War. Fig. 2 illustrates that the number of pigs expanded rapidly to a
total of 14 million in 1990. After the year 2000, the number slightly decreased to
about 11.5 million in the years 2005-2007 (De Bont and Van der Knijff, 2007, p. 50).
In 2004, about 56% of all pigs were exported (Central Bureau of Statistics:
http://www.cbs.nl). Most of these pigs were slaughtered by the Dutch slaughtering
industry where a concentration took place in the early 2000s. This led to the
establishment of the Vion group that held two thirds of the Dutch market by 2007 and
became the largest in Europe. The growth in pig farming, which turned into an
economically flourishing sector, was accompanied by a shift towards industrial animal
production systems that were based on guiding principles such as mechanization,
specialization, rationalization and economies of scale. During this shift, pig
farming developed into an integrated chain with strong ties between animal food
providers, pig farmers, slaughterhouses, supermarkets, and consumers (Geels, 2009).
Pig farming itself transformed into a factory-like mass production system, with farms
of increasing size. The average number of pigs per farmincreased from25 in 1960 to
1300 in 2006 (Table 1). The scale increase in pigs per farm was accompanied by a
decrease in the number of farms, from about 120,000 in 1960 to 9040 in 2006, a 92%
drop. Sectoral evolution is characterized by a struggle for survival, with
cost-competition driving further scale increases. Consumers and supermarkets
contribute to the strong cost focus in the sector. For supermarkets, meat fulfils the
role of traffic generator: advertised at low prices, meat should seduce customers to
enter their shops, assuming they will also buy other products with larger profit
margins (Hoste et al., 2004, pp. 7-8). This practice creates strong backward pressure
from supermarkets to farmers to produce meat as cheaply as possible.<component

by specialization that resulted in two sub-sectors in pig farming: (1) fattening and
meat production and (2) breeding, which focuses on sows and piglets. While the Dutch
fattening sector was always export oriented, the breeding sector has also become an
international player during the past few decades, growing from virtually no exports
in the mid-1980s to an annual export of 4.5 million and 5 million piglets in 2006 and
2007, respectively (Bolhuis and Wisman, 2008). Pigs to be fattened (or porkers) were
kept in groups of about a dozen in units separated from each other by metal fences
with an 2 per pig until 1998. The floors were average floor space of 0.7 m typically
made of slatted concrete on which the pigs urinated and defecated. By walking around,
the pigs pressed the faeces through the slits to be collected in cellars underneath.
This made the floors very slippery causing many claw problems. Furthermore, the pigs
experienced boredom in the small confinements making them bite the tails of
neighbours, resulting in wounds and infection. To reduce this problem, tails were
often cut off and teeth commonly clipped. Pregnant sows were kept differently because
of their eating habits. While pigs generally continue to grow when eating more,
mature sows do not grow larger but get fatter. This was prevented by giving them
limited rations, made possible by keeping them individually, sometimes in boxes
separated from each other. Another option were semi-open pigsties with fences between
the animals in which they were tethered to the floor with either a chain or a belt
fixed around the shoulder. Since the early 1970s, the shift to industrial mass
production methods in pig farming has been accompanied by criticism from
special-interest groups that represented new societal values such as animal welfare
and the environment. In 1972, the opening of a model pig farm (de Flevohof), intended
as the pride of the livestock sector to inform the public about progress in animal
husbandry, invoked strong protest against industrialized living conditions of pigs
and gave rise to the creation of an action group 'Sweet Animal' ('Lekker Dier'). The
same year, the Foundation for Nature and Environment published a critical report
called Bio Industry that warned that pigs were no longer seen as living creatures but
as resources and input materials for industrial processes. The term 'bio industry'
was coined deliberately to frame the damaging effects of industrial methods on
farming. The report also drew attention to stench problems, pollution of water and
soil from manure surpluses, and damage to the natural landscape (Crijns, 1998). The
Animal Protection Society (APS; 'Dierenbescherming'), a respectable NGO established
in 1864 with over 200,000 members and 70 staff members in the early 2000s, (APS
website) also saw industrial animal husbandry as a step backward for animal welfare
and favoured keeping animals according to organic principles. In the 1970s, organic
pig farming constituted a small market niche of about 1%, carried by small subsection
of 'moral consumers' who were willing to pay about 30-40% more for organically
produced pork. This meat came from animals that were kept in a more 'natural'
environment, had room to play and could exhibit their natural behaviour. This organic
niche slowly expanded to about 2% in the early 2000s. Initially, pig farmers
downplayed and ignored animal welfare concerns. In the late 1990s, however, the
sub-sector of pregnant sows, which initially kept sows in individual boxes, began
moving to group husbandry systems, which entailed the adoption of new<component

Agriculture established a commission "Animal husbandry - animal welfare" to
investigate how pregnant sows were kept. In 1975, the committee published a report
that concluded that sow husbandry had some weaknesses, which could be remedied with
various technical means (NRLO, 1975). In practice, however, little changed in the
following years. The debate intensified in the early 1980s. In 1982 the APS released
a study that was very critical of sow husbandry, focussing on chained sows stating:
"The short chain only allows the sow to stand op or lie down. Turning around or
walking a fewsteps is out of the question" (Dierenbescherming, 1982, p. 7). The study
concluded that the way sows were kept in the Netherlands was 'completely
unacceptable' (p. 41). With various campaigns, the APS tried to generate public
awareness. To this end they framed the problem using the catchy term 'chain sow' for
the pregnant sows that were tethered to the floor. This term and the accompanying
images struck an emotional chord in public opinion which felt that these animals
deserved better treatment (Fig. 3; Interview APS). Shortly after the release of the
APS report, the Ministry of Agriculture set up a new commission for pig welfare
issues. Its 1984<component x="73.82" y="323.18" width="251.56" height="206.71"

lateness="0.5384615384615384" reference_score="6.69">Gradually it became clear,
however, both in research and practice, that group housing had serious problems. The
reason was that the basic design was copied from the cattle sector, without taking
into account that pigs behave differently from cows. While cows tend to wait their
turn to be fed, sows are prepared to fight for more food and eat as much as they can.
If one sow was eating, for instance, a stronger sister might bite her in the rear to
chase her away to start eating a second ration. In the early 1990s, many pig-farmers,
who had moved to group housing, shifted back to the individual system. About half of
them, however, stuck to group housing. These pig farmers had developed specific
farming skills for successfully keeping pigs in groups (Interview animal researcher).
Scientists at the Rosmalen research institute continued to investigate group housing
systems. The fact that some 2% of the farmers had no serious problem with the group
housing suggested that the systemcould work despite its bad image. APS and the
scientists also referred to the UK where group-housing was more widely applied and
where a new bill would enforce it by the end of the decade. In the early 1990s, the
scientists occasionally interacted with the ministry and the APS on research findings
and on shaping further research. By 1996 they had developed and tested a second
generation of group housing systems. They concluded that group housing was now ready
for practical use but that it would require new managerial skills and competencies
from the pig farmer (Backus, 1997). The sector and the ministry, however, showed
little interest. At the time, there was much more societal concern for disposal of
manure and emissions from the bio industry than animal welfare which was rather low
on the political and societal agenda (Interview animal researcher). Thus, in terms of
our conceptual vocabulary, the political opportunity structure that had been
favourable to group housing in the late 1980s, had disappeared in the mid 1990s.
According to one involved researcher it was almost taboo to talk about group housing
in the mid 1990s. In his view this was due to a surplus of eagerness to move to group
housing in the 1980s, pushed by certain pig farmers and the ministry. They used crude
concepts adapted fromthe cattle sector and then found these did not work very well.
This eventually led to sector-wide hostility towards group housing of pregnant sows
in general which was difficult to counter with results from further research, no
matter how hard the scientist tried to show that the second-generation system worked
well (Interview LTO). 4.3. Swine-fever: the aftermath of an external shock
(1997-2007) After 4 February 1997, the political opportunity structure turned
completely due to an external shock. The trigger was an outbreak of swine-fever that
spread rapidly. On numerous pig farms, all pigs were killed and cranes were used to
load dead pigs onto huge trucks to take them to destroyers. These scenes were
broadcasted widely on Dutch television and stimulated a lively societal debate. In
total, over 11 million pigs were killed including almost 3 million 3-17 day old
piglets (Ministry of Agriculture data, cited in Dierenbescherming, 1999, 47). Many,
including politicians as well as the public, felt something really had to change in
pig husbandry. Within a few months, new legislation was drafted that would make
group-housing compulsory in ten years, i.e. in 2008. The sector protested heavily but
did not stand a chance against the societal and political pressure and determination.
LTO, the sector representative, realised that it made no sense to fight this change
further and that it had to find ways to inform farmers on how to make a smooth
transition. They organised meetings with pig-farmers throughout the country at which
the Rosmalen researchers were often invited to inform the attendees of their
findings. The unrest lasted about half a year and then gradually disappeared
(Interview animal researcher). Market forces also played a role in the change towards
group housing. The crucial economic factor was the export of Dutch pork to the UK. As
of 1 January 1999, pregnant sows in the UK would have to be kept in groups. UK pig
producers, animal welfare and consumer organizations put pressure on British
retailers to sell only bacon and other pig meat that came from pigs whose mothers had
been kept in groups. They were successful and because the UK formed a large export
market, the Dutch slaughter industry became interested in ensuring that a significant
share of Dutch pregnant sows would be kept in groups (Vermeer et al., 1999). This
made Dumeco, then a major slaughter company that later became part of the Vion group,
give a bonus to farmers who kept pregnant sows in groups (Interview LTO). Thus, the
normatively driven innovation in the niche aligned with market developments in the
regime. Also at the European level, pig husbandry increasingly became a matter of
concern. The European Commission enacted new regulations that resembled the Dutch
although they lagged a few years. New EU regulation forbade keeping pregnant sows on
chains as of 2005 (2001 in the Netherlands) and by 2013 all pregnant sows in the EU
should be kept in groups. The Dutch pig sector argued that this meant unfair
competition as for them group housing was compulsory by 2008 and to comply, the date
has been changed to 2013 in the Netherlands as well (Enting et al., 2006). In
anticipation of this new regulation, by 2008 about half the pig farmers had already
changed to group housing. Thus, in terms of our conceptual framework, we see that
normative pressure was exerted from the 1980s onward, although with varying strength.
The regulatory opportunity stream showed more variation and gained an enormous boost
after an external shock, the outbreak of swine fever. The technology stream showed a

the early 1990s and development of a second<component x="343.31" y="96.17"

General aversion towards the bio industry (treating animals as commodities rather
than living beings). groups sought to end the bio industry altogether. In this
context, animal welfare concerns rose rapidly on the public and political agenda. The
societal pressure and the political determination led to a slight tightening of
rules, which triggered a gradual regime transformation path. Although economic
considerations remained prominent for the government, more attention was given to
animal welfare issues. To understand the discussion on regulations it is relevant to
know that many laws and regulations in the pig sector are communal, meaning that
regulation is laid down in directives of the EU. Member states have to translate
these into national legal and administrative measures. In relation to pig welfare,
the relevant EU directive is 91/630/EEC that specifies a minimum floor space of 2
0.65 m per pig (Enting et al., 2006). Since 1994, the Netherlands 2 had specified a
somewhat stricter rule, notably demanding 0.7 m per pig. Furthermore, the Dutch
ruling ('Varkensbesluit') specified that in due course it would be forbidden to keep
pigs on floors that were 100% slatted (to collect manure and urine in 2 underlying
cellars). For new pigsties, 0.3 m per pig would have to be solid and by 2003 fully
slatted floors would be prohibited (Spoolder et al., 2003). The EU directive does not
have such a provision. Shortly after the outbreak of swine fever the Dutch government
decided that in 1998 the floor space standard would be raised to 2 1 m and that by
the year 2000 the mandated solid floor area would 2 be 0.6 m (LNV, 1999). The sector
protested heavily as this implied they could keep 35% fewer pigs in the same area as
their European competitors. The Dutch government conceded and the rules were somewhat
relaxed. As of 2008, new pigsties would have to provide 2 2 0.8 m per pig which would
increase to 1 m by 2013 with a solid 2 (Enting et al., 2006). area of 0.4 m Another
new rule, specified in the EU directive, was that as of 1 January 2003 pigs should
have permanent access to a sufficient quantity of material "to enable proper
investigation and manipulation activities, such as straw, hay, wood, sawdust,
mushroom compost, peat or a mixture of such" (Enting et al., 2006). As stated, member
countries had to make their own interpretations of these directives and the Dutch
ruling was far less precise. The typical solution in the Netherlands was to hang a
chain in the sty that pigs could bite in and pull on, something that Dutch regulators
allowed (Interviews APS, Animal researcher). Pig farmers were anything but happy with
the new regulations, 2 especially the 2013 rule of 1 m per pig. They argued that this
would undermine their competitive position in the international market. 2 2 Going
from the minimum of 0.7 m for existing pigsties to 1 m was expected to cost 75 per
pig-place which added 2.8 eurocents D per kilogram to the price of meat. Because this
was more or less the farmer's profit margin, this was not considered economically
viable (Interview LTO). 5.3. Further contestation and the development of new
husbandry systems (2000-2008) A concentration of animal diseases in the late 1990s
and early 2000s (swine fever, BSE, foot and mouth disease, avian flu) further
deteriorated the public image of industrial animal production. In 2002 it led to a
new political party that exclusively focussed on animals. This Party for the Animals
('Partij voor de Dieren') participated in the 2003 general elections but won no
seats. In 2006, they were more successful, gaining 2 parliamentary seats out of 150.
They were supported by a wide variety of public figures including authors, artists
and TV personalities. This strategy of network building increased their visibility
and legitimacy, and enabled them to influence the public debate. Since 2006, the
party has bombarded the ministry with parliamentary questions on all sorts of issues
relating to animal welfare (cf. website http://www.partijvoordedieren.nl). Their
visibility also required other political parties and the Minister of Agriculture to
become more outspoken on animal welfare issues. In 2007, animal welfare issues also
received more attention at the European level, leading to debates about raising the
EU floor space standard 2 2 to about 0.75 m by 2013 (InterviewLTO). Thus, a new
from0.65 m political opportunity structure developed for animal welfare issues and
innovations. In response to these new social and political pressures, the pig sector
set up image campaigns like 'Pigs in Sight' ('Varkens in Zicht'). Some pig farms were
equipped with sky boxes where the public could watch pigsties and the behaviour of
pigs. This campaign was intended to convince the public that pigs were treated well
and that there was no reason for change (Interviews LTO, animal researcher). While
political actors and pig farmers focused on framing and regulations, several outside
actors worked on innovative projects. These innovations involved new components and
husbandry systems (mainly developed by engineers and scientists in various research
institutes) and new market segments (mainly developed by new retailers). We first
discuss two more radical concepts, the Hercules pigsty and Pigs in Comfort Class, and
then a concept that is closer to the mainstream, Canadian Bedding. 5.3.1. Hercules
pigsty 8 Researchers at WUR started the Hercules project in 1998. Their approach was
based on the expectation that emission standards would be tightened in the future and
that, especially after the 1997 outbreak of swine-fever, tighter animal welfare rules
would also be imposed (Ogink et al., 2001). Processing of manure became a focal point
in the design and communication on the Hercules project. In a conventional pigsty,
most of the floor space is slatted. Manure and urine fall on the floor and are
pressed through it by the pigs walking around. It is collected in underground cellars
and disposed of. Because of the large slatted area it is problematic to use straw
since this will clog up the openings. For animal welfare reasons, the government
intended to mandate an increase of the solid floor area. Farmers were not happy with
this because the larger the solid area made cleaning more difficult. One of the focal
points in Hercules was to design a system for separation of manure and urine in order
to lower the emissions of ammonia. The technical approach was to develop a slightly
convex moving manure belt under a row of pigpens. The liquid fraction (the urine)
would drip fromthe sides and was collected underneath while the solid fraction (the
manure) was collected at the end of the belt in a concentrated form (Ogink et al.,
2001). Although the Hercules design was primarily inspired for environmental reasons
it also had various animal welfare benefits. In view of costs, this moving belt could
not be too wide implying that the slatted part of the pigsty, where pigs should
relieve themselves, should also be smaller. This had the advantage that there was
more 2 solid floor space. The concept provided 1 m of floor space per pig (25% more
than the regulated standard) of which 75% was solid. This floor could be cooled or
warmed by running either cold or warm water through hoses in the floor. An increased
area of solid floor could also be better combined with the use of straw which had
become an icon in animal welfare. Pigs like to play with straw, chew on it and root
in it. Part of the Hercules design was a device called the 'straw swing'. Pigs could
play with it with their snout for which they were rewarded with some straw. Because

the year 2000, the APS proposed an activity on 'animal centred design' to the
Ministry of Agriculture within its long-term programme on 'Animal Production 2030'.
The ministry agreed and a desk study was started by APS and WUR-researchers (another
group than the one working on Hercules) to explore this. They took pig husbandry as
an example to elaborate the methodology. The methodology started by identifying ten
basic needs of pigs that were subsequently translated into various technical
solutions which, together, defined the pigsty concept. The main conclusion was that
it was possible to take animal welfare as a starting point to design pigsties in
which animals could be kept in an economically viable way. APS proposed to LTO that
they could try to build such a pigsty together, to prove that it could indeed be
done. LTO, feeling the societal pressure to develop new forms of husbandry, accepted
(Interviews LTO and APS). Although they agreed on building the pigsty there were
differences in the visions of the partners. LTO sawthe project primarily as a
research project that might have an impact in the long term. APS, however, aimed for
a pigsty that could operate within the existing systemand be economically viable
(Interviews LTO and APS). Eventually, a compromise was developed between aiming for
the long and the short term. First, a demonstration pigsty would be built to
demonstrate the technical viability. Then pigs would be introduced to demonstrate
that they were actually better off in the new pigsty. After that, five pig farmers
would be sought to use the new design principles in their own pigsty and demonstrate
the economic viability. Thus, it was not only a research project but it would also
have to operate in practice (LTO and Dierenbescherming, 2006). This eventually led to
the development of a new pigsty concept called Pigs in 10 Comfort Class (PCC) with a
term derived from the aviation sector. The PCC-approach specifies the 10 basic needs
of pigs, but it does not prescribe technical solutions to satisfy these needs (LTO
and Dierenbescherming, 2006, 4). To give an example, in a popular vision pigs have a
need to be outside and roll in the mud, allegedly 5.3.3. Canadian bedding Trying to
find other routes to improve the keeping of animals the APS has worked with a
relatively new Dutch retailer, Jumbo supermarkets. Jumbo is a family owned company, a
relative outsider in the supermarket world that seeks to profile itself with low
prices and care for quality and sustainability. On its website, Jumbo has several
pages addressing "responsible food" which also provides information on how animals
are kept for some of its 'responsible' 11 products and contrasts this with the bio
industry.<component x="84.63" y="166.09" width="251.56" height="363.62" page="9"

the APS, Jumbo started to sell a pigs case, APS performed additional work by teaming

(pig-) farmers representative, to demonstrate pigs that are kept in so-called

pigs to lie on and gives them something to root in and chew on. This concept has also
been adopted by a small number of Dutch pig farmers. Jumbo has embraced the concept
and now sells meat from pigs from one farmer who houses pigs in these pigsties,
calling it "Jumbo conscious pork". APS has designed a special quality label that
Jumbo is allowed to use. This meat is about 15% more expensive than typical
supermarket pork. In 2006, Jumbo started to sell it in six shops and 12 in 2007 did
so in all of its over 100 outlets (Interview APS). In this case, three streams
aligned, notably normative pressure, technology (Canadian Bedding) and market. There
are no indications that regulation played a serious role in developing this concept.
It can hardly be stated that this started a transformation as the husbandry concept
was already used and the market share of this pork at the time of writing was so
small that it did not lead to an increased use of the Canadian Bedding concept. 6.
Analysis and discussion Our research question was: How, when and why is normative
contestation of existing regimes effective in influencing the orientation of
transitions in the making? We can now answer this question for the two empirical
cases, explaining the different outcomes with the conceptualizations from Section 2.
In the case of pregnant sows, normative contestations from NGOs and animal scientists
reached their aspired goals. By 2009 about half the pig farmers had converted to
group housing systems and the others will soon follow because group housing will be
legally enforced as of 2013. In the case of fattening pigs, normative contestations
had less success, leading only to gradual changes 2 2 in floor space (from 0.7 m per
pig via 0.8 m for new pigsties as of 2 2008 and 1 m in 2013), a slight increase in
solid floor space in 2013 and the provision of toys. Various alternative husbandry
concepts were developed but did not diffuse widely. To explain these differences, we
will look at two main processes: (a) increasing normative pressure, and (b) alignment
of normative pressure with economic, regulatory, and technological niche
developments. 6.1. Increasing normative pressure To analyze normative pressure,
Section 2 proposed three concepts: (1) resource mobilization, (2) (political)
opportunity structures, and (3) framing, which was sub-divided into focus, empirical
credibility, cultural resonance and emotional appeal. We will apply these concepts in
turn. the lumber industry produces a lot of sawdust that local pig farm- (Ad 2)
Political opportunity structures were also more or less the same for both cases.
Until the turn of the century, the structural characteristics of the political
constellation relevant for animal welfare changed relatively little. This changed
with the advent of the Party for the Animals in early 2007. It succeeded in pushing
animal welfare concerns high on the political agenda and these have remained there
since. (Ad 3) Framing by animal welfare organizations differed considerably for both
cases. Firstly, the framing had more focus for pregnant sows, both in terms of
problems (the 'chain sow') and solutions (keeping pregnant sows in groups). For
fattening pigs, the framing was less focused, because a wide variety of animal
welfare problems struggled for attention. Furthermore, animal welfare problems
competed with sustainability issues related to emissions (ammonia) and manure
disposal. This multitude of problems limited the focus and strength of framing
processes for the fattening pigs case. (Ad 4) Secondly, framing processes had
stronger emotional appeal for pregnant sows, especially through the catchy term and
images of 'chain sows'. The public, policy makers and even some farmers agreed that a
sow with a chain or belt around the shoulder was unfriendly to the animal. The APS
used this powerful image to articulate a moral framing of unacceptability. The
alternative (group housing) was also well framed by linking it with notions of pigs
as sociable animals. For fattening pigs, in contrast, the framing was less successful
in terms of emotional appeal. Furthermore, the pig farmers, especially their
representative body LTO, were more successful in counter-framing for fattening pigs
than for pregnant sows. For fattening pigs, the farmers argued that strong
international cost-based competition prevented them from adopting the more
substantial animal welfare innovations that would raise costs and reduce
competitiveness. Initially, in the early 1990s, a counter-framing strategy also
worked successfully for pregnant sows ("experience shows pregnant sows in groups is a
disaster") even though proponents pointed to 2% of the sow farmer's population who
had successfully implemented the alternative in practice. (Ad 5) In the late 1990s, a
sequence of external shocks changed the context drastically. These included the swine
fever outbreak in 1997 and a number of other animal diseases and food scandals
shortly thereafter. This considerably reduced the strength of the LTO counter-framing
while the general problem framing by animal welfare groups gained empirical
credibility and cultural resonance. This strengthened general concerns about
industrial animal production and mobilized public opinion as an additional resource
to put pressure on political and regulatory processes.<component x="73.82" y="232.16"

pregnant sows entailed a change in practices-the management of sows required farmers
to develop some new routines (e.g. to manage sows in groups), which many of them
initially resisted, as well as development and adoption of new technical components
(especially new feeding systems that separated eating sows from each other). Thus,
technological change was important, especially the development from first generation
(late 1980s) to second generation feeding systems (mid-1990s). The technology
experienced a hype-disappointment cycle, with farmers having high expectations in the
late 1980s when about 5% of sow farmers shifted to group housing. However, teething
problems with the first generation feeding systems led to disappointments causing a
decline in group farming to about 2%. Around 1995, when second generation systems
were developed, negative perceptions of group housing had hardened, which frustrated
further diffusion. The swine fever shock in 1997, however, provided a window of
opportunity, which advocates of group housing took advantage of. Alignment with
public opinion led to strong normative pressure on policy makers. Policy makers then
issued regulations that made group housing compulsory in 10 years time. Farmers
protested, arguing that this was not possible and would reduce competitiveness
(counter-framing) but NGOs and policy makers could overrule these protests by
pointing both to technical progress (second generation) and the 2% of farmers who
showed that such concepts could be applied successfully. Market forces also played a
role, especially from UK supermarkets (which faced pressure from more radical animal
rights groups) which in 1999 demanded group housing in relation to imported bacon.
This dynamic of the various streams is summarised in Table 2. As Kingdomnoted, the
coming together of various streams at the same time to forma coherent package greatly
enhances the chances for regime change. In the case of pregnant sows, this is what
happened in 1997. It was particularly crucial that the second generation of technical
alternatives were sufficiently developed when the window of opportunity opened (due
to the swine fever shock) and that 2% of farmers had demonstrated economic
feasibility. Both aspects enabled policy makers to issue strict regulations that
pushed the alternative through. For fattening pigs, the development of alternatives
such as Hercules, Pigs in Comfort Class (PCC) and Canadian Bedding resulted in
stabilized concepts in the early 2000s. At the time of the 1997 crisis, however, such
concepts were not available because most innovation efforts in the 1980s had not
focused on animal welfare, but on<component x="84.63" y="229.77" width="251.56"

no well-developed alternatives when the 1997 window of opportunity opened. By 2005,
when the Hercules project was finished the political interest had gone and the
concept was shelved. Two years later, with the upcoming of the Party for the Animals
the interest rose again and the PCC concept, that was then in the middle of its
development, gained a better reception, thus reinforcing the conclusion about the
importance of creating a package. Furthermore, regulatory pressure was weak in the
case of fattening pigs, partly because there were no available alternatives that
could be pushed through when the normative pressure was high, and partly because the
counter-framing strategies of farmers (welfare innovations would reduce
competitiveness) were more successful. Market demand was also weaker in this case,
with mainstream consumers not translating moral concerns into purchasing decisions,
buying the cheapest meat in supermarkets instead. The 2008-2009 attempts by Jumbo,
then a relative fringe actor in the supermarket sector, to create an intermediary
'animal friendly' segment (between organic and regular pork) are interesting in this
respect, but have not produced major successes at the time of writing. In sum, while
these alternatives might constitute the onset of a transition path, the lack of
alignment with regulatory and market processes hindered broader diffusion. As a
result, the overall development path in the fattening pig sub-sector has been gradual
change, driven primarily by somewhat stricter regulations in response to normative
pressure and public concerns. Following the 1997 crisis, and in response to the
accompanying public outrage, government regulations mandated 2 2 increased floor
space from 0.7 m to 0.8 m per pig for new pigsties 2 which will increase to 1 m by
2013. Further regulations also specified the introduction of toys and and a minimum
area of solid floor. Table 3 summarises the dynamic of the various streams for
different periods in the pig fattening case. Normative pressure from outsiders was
present throughout de studied timeframe although with different strength for the
various periods. The dynamic of the other streams shows more variation, esp. from2002
onward. Comparing Tables 2 and 3 we conclude that the 'coherent package', to use
Kingdon's term, that developed in the sows case did not develop in the fattening
case, neither in terms of problems nor in terms of solutions. In the case of sows
there was a rather uniform problem definition of keeping sows separate, using

for framing. In the fattening pigs case, many animal welfare issues competed for
attention like little room per pig, no possibility to root and play, cutting tails,
clipping teeth, castration without using anaesthetic. Moreover, there were also
environmental concerns in connection with manure disposal, (ammonia) emissions and
stench. Concerning solutions, in the sows case there was a clear way to go, i.e. to
move towards group housing. For pig fattening, the variety in problem definitions
also led to a variety in (technical as well as market/institutional) solutions. In
this case no coherent package could therefore be offered that could be 'pushed
through' with the proper alignment of different forces.<component x="73.82"

topic of normative orientation into the debate on transitions and enriched the
multi-level perspective with insights from social movement theory and political
science. More specifically, it investigated the question how normative contestation
of existing regimes can influence the orientation of transitions in the making. Our
analysis shows that there are two sides to this question: the first concerns the
dynamic of the contestation process, the second concerns the alignment with three
other processes or streams in our analysis. Social movement theory was helpful in
analysing the contestation dynamic. Three key concepts (resource mobilization,
(political) opportunity structures, and framing) were useful to analyze how
contestation by regime outsiders may lead to increased normative pressure on regimes.
One conclusion fromour study is that the existence of a variety of problem
definitions may considerably weaken the normative pressure. But our cases also show
that the strength of normative pressure forms only part of the explanation. The
second part of the explanation is that ongoing processes may create 'opportunity'
structures that allow normative pressure to be effective. Building on Kingdon and the
multi-level perspective, we suggested that four 'streams' are relevant to determine
this opportunity structure, notably a problem, regulatory/policy, technology and
market stream. Each of these streams has its own dynamic although various actors
involved make explicit attempts to link them. As a general conclusion, normative
contestation has its largest impact when the other streams become aligned at a
certain point in time to create what Kingdon calls a 'coherent package'. Because the
four streams have their own dynamic the issue of timing is critical for the creation
of such a package. Interestingly, in our case we see that a variety of problem
definitions in the fattening pigs case is accompanied by a variety in technical
solutions (Hercules, PCC, Canadian Bedding). It seems that this variety on the
problem side and variety on the solution side both weaken the possibility of
alignment and hence the onset of a transformation process. Using a term from
innovation studies, we presume that the creation of a successful package increases if
preceding innovation processes have resulted in a 'dominant design' that can be
linked to problems if a policy window opens. If various designs exist, this linkage
is more difficult. More research would be needed to analyze how this works exactly.
This article has addressed the topic of normative orientation with a conceptual
framework and a comparative case study. Our findings therefore have a 'proof of
principle' character. To generalise the findings and elaborate the perspective, we
hope that other studies will further investigate these topics. On a more general
note, we think that these topics also have relevance for the field of innovation
studies, which has produced substantial knowledge about factors that influence
general innovativeness (often related to economic issues of competitiveness and
profitability) and the speed of technical trajectories, but paid less attention to
questions surrounding directionality and normativity (Stirling, 2009).<component
