studies of modern terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have shown that that 13
d diet can directly influence carbon ( C) and nitrogen 15 d ( N) stable isotope
values in the tissues of the consumer (DeNiro and Epstein, 1978, 1981).
Archaeologists were very quick to exploit this theory and stable isotope analysis of
preserved bone collagen is now routinely utilised in palaeodietary reconstruction
studies, providing archaeologists with a detailed insight into prehistoric diet (Van
der Merwe and Vogel, 1978; Tauber, 1981; Schoeninger et al., 1983). Recent advances
in continuous-flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (CF-IRMS) have allowed sulphur
isotopes 34 d ( S) to be measured from organic and inorganic materials (Giesemann et
al., 1994; Fry et al., 1996; Grassineau et al., 2001; Yun et al., 2005; Fritzsche and
Tichomirowa, 2006; Grassineau, 2006; Fry, 2007; Hansen et al., 2009) and over the
past decade there has been a marked increase in the use of sulphur isotopes in
conjunction with carbon and nitrogen isotopes to aid our understanding of the diet
and movement of prehistoric animals and humans (Macko et al., 1999; Richards et al.,
2001, 2003; Hu et al., 2009; Vika, 2009; Craig et al., 2010; Howcroft et al., 2012;
Nehlich et al., 2012; Oelze et al., 2012a,b). Sulphur isotopes have also been
exploited to explore the variability in terrestrial, marine- and freshwater-based
diets (Craig et al., 2006; Privat et al., 2007; Nehlich et al., 2010, 2011; Lamb et
al., 2012), have been used as indicators of environmental changes (Wadleigh, 2003;
Newton and Bottrell, 2007; Yun et al., 2010) and are regularly utilised in food
authentication studies (Bahar et al., 2008; Rummel et al., 2010; Tanz and Schmidt,
2010; Osorio et al., 2011). Previous findings from the Lake Myvatn region of
north-east Iceland have demonstrated a significant overlap 15 d between the N values
of both modern and archaeologi15 d cal-age terrestrial herbivore bone collagen and
the N val13 d ues of modern and archaeological-age freshwater fish. C values of
freshwater biota were also found to be similar to those of marine resources (Ascough
et al., 2010), and consequently, separation of herbivores, freshwater fish and marine
fish as components of human diet is difficult using 13 15 d d only C and N analyses.
Likewise, complications were encountered when human bone collagen samples from the 14
same region were radiocarbon ( C) dated, as the exact proportion of freshwater and
marine carbon consumed was indeterminable, which prevented ages being corrected for
14 both marine and freshwater C reservoir effects (Ascough et al., 2012). Freshwater
and marine radiocarbon reservoir 14 effects (FRE and MRE, respectively) are C age
offsets between CO in the atmosphere and the freshwater or marine 2 carbon
reservoirs. The MRE arises because of the extended residence time of carbon in the
global marine reservoir, dur14 ing which time radioactive decay of the C occurs. It
has a 14 global average value of approximately 400 C years for surface waters and can
be corrected for in order to produce a truer calendar age range (Reimer et al.,
2009). FREs are 14 brought about by the input of low C-activity carbon (e.g. carbon
from dissolution of geological carbonates or from high temperature geothermal
water-rock interactions), or restriction of atmosphere-water CO exchange 2 (e.g. via
density stratification or ice cover). Unlike the MRE, a universal amendment cannot be
implemented as the magnitude of FREs is site dependent and can fluctuate
significantly (Ascough et al., 2011; Keaveney and Reimer, 2012). 34 d The purpose of
this study was to utilise S stable isotope measurements in animal and bird bone
collagen from remains found in midden deposits at a Viking farmstead on Lake Myvatn
in an attempt to distinguish between terrestrial, marine and freshwater dietary
components. In turn, this could allow the identification of terrestrial, freshwater
and marine components in the human diet. To date, this is the first study of its kind
to examine sulphur isotopes in bone collagen from archaeological remains found in
Iceland. It is also the largest, single-site sulphur isotope study to be undertaken,
in which 129 bones of domesticated and wild fauna from Skutusta&#xF0;ir were
analysed. These data were produced, together with C and N stable isotope ratio 14
measurements and C age measurements, as part of a multi-isotope approach, building on
previous work to reconstruct animal diet and human activity in the region (Ascough et
al., 2007, 2010, 2012).<component x="61.79" y="69.03" width="227.17" height="632.96"

this study were from Skutusta&#xF0;ir, an archaeological site to the south of Lake
Myvatn (meaning "the lake of midges" in Icelandic) in the north-eastern highlands of
Iceland. Famed, as its name suggests, for its abundant insect life, this shallow
lake, located 50 km inland and at an altitude of 277 m above ( sea level (Fig. 1), is
a sanctuary for breeding waterfowl (Einarsson, 2004; Gardarsson, 2006). The region
has been documented as an area of major archaeological importance with respect to the
settlement of Viking communities during landnam the from around AD 870 onwards
(Vesteinsson, 1998; McGovern et al., 2007; Einarsson and Aldred, 2011). Radiocarbon
dating of terrestrial animal remains and tephrochronological studies from various
sites sur rounding Lake Myvatn have shown that settlers populated the region from the
late 9th century (McGovern et al., 2006, 2007). The presence of these inhabitants is
thought to have had a large environmental impact on the area, with the introduction
of grazing livestock and rapid deforestation (Hallsdottir, 1987), leading to
significant soil erosion (Arn alds et al., 1997; Vesteinsson et al., 2002; Dugmore et
al., 2005; Lawson et al., 2007).<component x="312.83" y="178.62" width="227.17"

Myvatn is volcanic in nature, with igneous rocks of the tholeiitic series dominating
the landscape. The series is split into three subsections: (1) basaltic rocks, which
are most abundant, comprising of picrite, olivine tholeiite and tholeiite; (2)
intermediate rocks which include icelandite and basaltic icelandite; and (3) silicic
rocks which include dacite and rhyolite (Jakobsson et al., 2008). Porous lava fields
dominate the area, leaving the surface characteristically devoid of water. The lake
has two major basins, Ytrifloi (north basin), which is fed by hot springs from the
Namafjall geothermal field, and Sy&#xF0;rifloi (south basin), which is fed by cold
springs along its eastern shores (Kristmannsdottir and Armannsson, 2004). As
groundwater springs supply most of Lake Myvatn's water and there is an absence of
surface water in the area for it to mix with, the chemical makeup of the water
entering the lake is very stable. Before draining into the River Laxa in the west,
the geothermal waters provide Lake Myvatn with plentiful supplies of silica and
sulphate, whilst cooler waters deliver phosphate to the lake (Kris tmannsdottir and
Armannsson, 2004).<component x="312.83" y="69.03" width="227.15" height="74.14"

store the majority of the earth's sulphur supplies, with sulphides in shale and sul34
&amp; d phates in evaporites exhibiting S values between 40 ( &amp; and +30 (Claypool
et al., 1980; Strauss, 1997) and sulphate in marine water providing a very
isotopically uniform 34 &amp; d reservoir of S = +21 (Rees et al., 1978). In coastal
regions, sulphur-containing particles can be propelled inland 34 d in a process known
as the sea-spray effect, causing soil S values to be similar to that of seawater
(Wadleigh et al., 1994). Intensive weathering of igneous rocks causes leached
sulphides to filter into ground and stream water systems, enabling plants to
accumulate the oxidised sulphate form in their roots. Oxidation of pyrite (FeS )
produces negligi2 ble isotopic fractionation (Nakai and Jensen, 1964; Taylor 34 d and
Wheeler, 1984), whilst plant S values are on average &amp; 1.5 depleted compared to
their sulphate source (Trust and Fry, 1992). Analysis of total sulphur in volcanic
rocks from the Krafla-Namafjall fissure swarm neighbouring 34 d ( Lake Myvatn
provided S values that ranged between &amp; &amp; &amp; 2.0 and +4.2 (mean: 0.8 )

fractionation between plants and sulphates deposited in the soil from the weathering
of local bedrock is relatively 34 d small, S values of Lake Myvatn flora should be
similar to those reported by Torssander (1989). However, Icelandic lava fields are
sparsely vegetated with lichen and moss (Bjarnason, 1991), which can accumulate their
sulphur directly from atmospheric sulphur dioxide (SO ) with very lit2 tle isotopic

July 1980 yielded S val&amp; &amp; ues between 1.8 and +3.4 (Torssander, 1988), how(
ever, it is conceivable that atmospheric SO in Iceland has 2 varied with time due to
the volcanic nature of the island. Wet deposition of sulphate from the aqueous
oxidation of atmospheric SO can provide soil with an additional source 2 of sulphur
and isotopic fractionation during this process &amp; &amp; can be very large (ca. 11
to +17 ) (Harris et al., ( 2012). However, the amount of sulphate deposited has been
shown to be negligible in areas where SO emissions are 2 high (Nriagu and Coker,
1978), and compared to other parts of Iceland, the Myvatn region has little rain- or
snowfall (Einarsson, 1979). The eruption of the Gr&#x131;msvotn volcano in 1996,
which is &#xA8; situated below the Vatnajokull Glacier in south-east Ice&#xA8; land,
caused the Skei&#xF0;ara River to flood, and water samples taken before and during
the early stages of the overflow revealed a post-eruption increase in sulphur
concentration. Analysis of sulphate in the floodwaters demonstrated that 34 &amp;
&amp; d S values varied between +7.9 and +9.0 , suggesting that sulphurous magmatic
gases were oxidised to sulphate upon dissolution in water (G&#x131;slason et al.,
2002). Together with water samples taken from kettle-hole lakes that had formed since
the 1996 glacier-outburst flood, further groundwater, geothermal spring water and
Skei&#xF0;ara River samples were retrieved between 1998 and 2001 from the
Skei&#xF0;ararsandur outwash plain (Robinson et al., 2009). 34 &amp; d S values from
river sulphates ranged from +3.4 to &amp; +8.8 , with the higher value again
attributed to magmatic sulphate from the Gr&#x131;msvotn caldera, whilst the lower
end &#xA8; value was measured during normal discharge; both values &amp; &amp; fall
within the range of +2 to +10 reported by G&#x131;slason 34 d and Torssander (2006).
Groundwater sulphate S values &amp; &amp; varied between 0.3 and +5.3 , whilst
sulphate in geo( 34 &amp; d thermal spring water had an average S value of +4.1 .
Water from the kettle-hole lakes was found to be depleted 34 34 &amp; d in S, with S
values ranging between 1.7 and ( &amp; 0.0 , which could be attributed to dissolved
sulphate originating from igneous sulphide minerals. Samples taken from the Hekla

revealed that magmatic degassing into groundwater was still occurring. Dissolved 34 d
sulphate in these water samples displayed S values be&amp; &amp; tween +1.5 and +4.3

explored in greater detail during a series of excavations between 2008 and 2010
(Edwald and McGovern, 2009, 2010; Hicks et al., 2009; Hicks, 2010; Hicks and
Palsdottir, 2011), and a large number of animal bones and artefacts were discovered.
The midden site is on a natural rise in the landscape, and due to the porous nature
of the bedrock, drainage conditions are good and no pockets of waterlogged sediments
were noted. The pH of the soil is around 6.5, providing favourable conditions for
preservation of animal bones. The work discussed in this paper deals solely with
excavations carried out during the 2008 and 2009 field trips and a list of all
samples analysed with their stratigraphic context and chronology is presented in the
Supplementary data section. 3.2. Extraction of bone collagen A modified version of
the Longin method was used to extract the collagen component from the animal bones
(Longin, 1971). Sample surfaces were initially cleaned using &#xD2; a Dremel
multi-tool, before they were lightly crushed into smaller fragments and immersed in 1
M HCl for approx. 24 h to effect demineralisation. The acid was then decanted and
samples were rinsed with ultra-pure water to remove any remaining dissociated
carbonates, acid soluble N values from 3.1. Sampling location and materials &amp;

from +11.9 to +15.4 (Barrett et al., 15 d 2008, 2011; Russell et al., 2011). Again,
the N values for pigs and birds displayed a large range of values &amp; &amp; &amp;

d Oceanic primary producers demonstrate sulphate S &amp; &amp; values between +17 and
+21 (Peterson and Fry, 34 d 1987), however, S values for organisms living within a
freshwater environment have been shown to vary anywhere &amp; &amp; between 22 and
+20 due to differing sulphur sources ( in the local geology as well as anaerobic
bacteria residing within lakes and rivers, which can reduce sulphate ions to hydrogen
sulphide (H S) (Faure, 1977; Peterson and Fry, 2 1987). For mammals to successfully
thrive, sulphur-containing biochemical compounds, such as the essential amino acids,
methionine and cysteine, need to be acquired from the diet. Studies have demonstrated
that there is a negligible trophic level shift for sulphur isotopes compared 34 d to
the large range of S values shown within terrestrial, freshwater and marine
environments (Peterson et al., 1985; Richards et al., 2003). Therefore, consumers
eating produce from within the Lake Myvatn vicinity should have 34 d similar S values
to the surrounding terrestrial vegetation. 34 d Currently, there are no published S

vegetation containing marine-derived sulphur, suggesting these animals may have been
reared closer to the coast and trading of domestic animals was also occurring within
Icelandic Norse communities. Studies have shown that sea-spray 34 d not only
influences coastal soil S values, as sulphate particles can be propelled inland over
extensive distances (Zazzo et al., 2011), however, it is unlikely that the land
around Lake Myvatn would have been affected by sea-spray as the 34 d S values of
these six animals are very distinct from the 34 d average S values of their
contemporaries. The rate of bone collagen turnover is poorly understood, with
estimates ranging from less than a year in birds (Hobson and Clark, 1992) to over ten
years in adult humans (Hedges et al., 2007). Assuming that fully matured animals are
slaughtered within a few years of being brought inland, 34 S signature is unlikely to
have changed significantly their from when they first arrived at Lake Myvatn.
However, collagen turnover rates in juveniles should be higher than in adults, and
therefore if young livestock grazing on coastal vegetation were then traded inland
and reared for the remainder of their lives in the Lake Myvatn region, it is 34 d
likely that their S values would lie somewhere between 34 d a marine signature and
the 34 d S values S value for the local vegetation, and this may account for the
intermediary observed in some domestic animals.<component x="61.79" y="386.85"

dating of GUsi-1110 14 cal. (1593 - 28 C yr. BP, AD 412-540 (95.4% probabil14 cal.
ity)) and GUsi-1111 (1552 - 29 C yr. BP, AD 426- 573 (95.4% probability)) confirms
that a large freshwater reservoir effect (FRE) was occurring as both pigs are signif
landnam icantly older than the Viking settlement date of AD 871 - 2 (Vesteinsson,
1998; McGovern et al., 2007; Einarsson and Aldred, 2011). It was assumed that GUsi13
15 &amp; d d 1113, with its slightly enriched C ( 20.6 ), N ( 34 &amp; &amp; d (+6.5

suggest otherwise. As observed with GUsi-1110 landnam and GUsi-1111, GUsi-1113
pre-dates the and disr played an overall 2 calibrated age range of AD 576-656. This
could suggest that this pig had been consuming fresh water resources from a different
body of water to Lake Myvatn, and again potentially highlights that trading was
taking place between Viking communities. Subsequently, human consumption of these
pigs (and any other freshwa14 ter species) would influence their C ages and they too
would appear older than their assigned cultural period (Ascough et al., 2007, 2010,
2011, 2012). Arctic foxes are known to be opportunistic feeders that can adapt their
diet depending on seasonal or geographical changes (Hersteinsson and MacDonald,
1996). They are renowned for preying on birds and stealing their eggs, and the large
population of waterfowl surrounding Lake Myvatn would have provided an ample food
supply for these predators. Even during the winter months, a considerable part of the
lake and the Laxa River remains ice-free, allowing the 13 &amp; d foxes to hunt all
year round. C (mean: 14.9 - 1.3 ), ( 15 34 &amp; d d N (mean: +9.0 - 1.5 ) and in
particular S (mean: &amp; &amp; +1.4 - 0.7 ) stable isotope analysis supports the
theory that like pigs, they too may have been scavenging freshwater fish carcasses
from the shores of the lake and river. GUsi-2118 and GUsi-2126 were discovered just
above the 14 landnam tephra fall of AD 871 - 2, yet C-dating estimates 14 that these
animals ranged from 2605 - 30 C yr. BP 14 (GUsi-2118) to 2160 - 30 C yr. BP
(GUsi-2126). These r results offer an overall 2 age range of 827-107 BC, which again
is significantly earlier than the Viking settlement per14 iod and demonstrates that
the C ages of these samples are affected by a freshwater reservoir effect (Ascough et
al., 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012).<component x="312.83" y="69.03" width="227.19"

stable isotope study to be undertaken of archaeological fauna from one specific site
34 within the Lake Myvatn area, utilisation of S analysis in 13 15 conjunction with C
and N analyses has revealed important details concerning the husbandry techniques and
livestock trading practice of early Viking settlers in Iceland. This study is also
the first instance in which sulphur isotope analysis has been carried out on animal
remains from archaeological deposits in Iceland, and has proven to be a valuable tool
for discriminating between terrestrial, freshwater and marine based diets. 34 d
Cattle bones were found to have lower S values but 15 d higher N values than the
caprine bones analysed, which suggests that they were being kept closer to Lake
Myvatn 15 d and perhaps feeding on N enriched grasses, whereas a 34 d more enriched S
value for sheep and goat bones indicated they were grazing away from the lake and
possibly consuming moss and lichens on the Krafla lava fields. Three 13 d 10th
century pigs were analysed during this study and C 15 d and N values indicated that
two of them were consuming a mixture of terrestrial and non-terrestrial resources,
whilst 34 d S analyses and radiocarbon dating points towards the ingestion of
freshwater fish as the non-terrestrial source. This suggests that early settlers
allowed pigs to roam quite freely around the farmstead and consume domestic waste, or
alternatively, if they were styed, they were deliberately being fed scraps that
included non-terrestrial material. It would be incorrect to assume that only the
weathering 34 d of local bedrock dictates S results, as the majority of the 34 d S
value greater than terrestrial animals examined had a 34 &amp; d +4.2 , whilst almost
all of the freshwater fish had S val&amp; ues less than 2.0 . Iceland has been
subjected to many ( landnam volcanic eruptions before and since the , and evidence
has shown that the increased amounts of sulphurous 34 d magmatic gases have affected
the S values of rivers, lakes and groundwater. The increase in sulphate concentration
34 d has led to an increase in S variability, and as a consequence, this variability
has been transferred throughout the food chain. It is highly conceivable that the
enriched sulphur isotope values observed in some terrestrial animals were the result
of sea-spray affecting coastally reared animals, which were then moved inland. &amp;
Overall, there is an offset of 8 in sulphur isotope val( ues between terrestrial and
freshwater systems in the Lake Myvatn region of Iceland, and the tight range for
freshwater fish demonstrates the homogeneity of this environment 34 d with respect to
S. Results have shown that the freshwater fish populating Lake Myvatn have a
significantly different 34 d S value from their marine contemporaries, with the
aver34 &amp; d age S value of the two groups offset by approx. 18.5 . As the remains
of both freshwater and marine resources have been found in middens at
Skutusta&#xF0;ir, sulphur isotope analysis will be a useful tool for reconstructing
the diets of the human inhabitants, and while correcting for the fresh14 water C
reservoir effect at Lake Myvatn is problematic, these results have nevertheless
enabled us to differentiate 14 whether the anomalously old C ages are due to a marine
14 or freshwater C reservoir effect. As a final point, further research into the use
of sulphur isotopes in archaeology is required, but this study has demonstrated that
if a system is well-defined, is investigated in a methodical manner and is supported
with archaeological and palaeoenvironmental information, it is possible to use
sulphur isotopes as an important tracer of diet.<component x="55.27" y="69.03"

studies of modern terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have shown that that 13
d diet can directly influence carbon ( C) and nitrogen 15 d ( N) stable isotope
values in the tissues of the consumer (DeNiro and Epstein, 1978, 1981).
Archaeologists were very quick to exploit this theory and stable isotope analysis of
preserved bone collagen is now routinely utilised in palaeodietary reconstruction
studies, providing archaeologists with a detailed insight into prehistoric diet (Van
der Merwe and Vogel, 1978; Tauber, 1981; Schoeninger et al., 1983). Recent advances
in continuous-flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (CF-IRMS) have allowed sulphur
isotopes 34 d ( S) to be measured from organic and inorganic materials (Giesemann et
al., 1994; Fry et al., 1996; Grassineau et al., 2001; Yun et al., 2005; Fritzsche and
Tichomirowa, 2006; Grassineau, 2006; Fry, 2007; Hansen et al., 2009) and over the
past decade there has been a marked increase in the use of sulphur isotopes in
conjunction with carbon and nitrogen isotopes to aid our understanding of the diet
and movement of prehistoric animals and humans (Macko et al., 1999; Richards et al.,
2001, 2003; Hu et al., 2009; Vika, 2009; Craig et al., 2010; Howcroft et al., 2012;
Nehlich et al., 2012; Oelze et al., 2012a,b). Sulphur isotopes have also been
exploited to explore the variability in terrestrial, marine- and freshwater-based
diets (Craig et al., 2006; Privat et al., 2007; Nehlich et al., 2010, 2011; Lamb et
al., 2012), have been used as indicators of environmental changes (Wadleigh, 2003;
Newton and Bottrell, 2007; Yun et al., 2010) and are regularly utilised in food
authentication studies (Bahar et al., 2008; Rummel et al., 2010; Tanz and Schmidt,
2010; Osorio et al., 2011). Previous findings from the Lake Myvatn region of
north-east Iceland have demonstrated a significant overlap 15 d between the N values
of both modern and archaeologi15 d cal-age terrestrial herbivore bone collagen and
the N val13 d ues of modern and archaeological-age freshwater fish. C values of
freshwater biota were also found to be similar to those of marine resources (Ascough
et al., 2010), and consequently, separation of herbivores, freshwater fish and marine
fish as components of human diet is difficult using 13 15 d d only C and N analyses.
Likewise, complications were encountered when human bone collagen samples from the 14
same region were radiocarbon ( C) dated, as the exact proportion of freshwater and
marine carbon consumed was indeterminable, which prevented ages being corrected for
14 both marine and freshwater C reservoir effects (Ascough et al., 2012). Freshwater
and marine radiocarbon reservoir 14 effects (FRE and MRE, respectively) are C age
offsets between CO in the atmosphere and the freshwater or marine 2 carbon
reservoirs. The MRE arises because of the extended residence time of carbon in the
global marine reservoir, dur14 ing which time radioactive decay of the C occurs. It
has a 14 global average value of approximately 400 C years for surface waters and can
be corrected for in order to produce a truer calendar age range (Reimer et al.,
2009). FREs are 14 brought about by the input of low C-activity carbon (e.g. carbon
from dissolution of geological carbonates or from high temperature geothermal
water-rock interactions), or restriction of atmosphere-water CO exchange 2 (e.g. via
density stratification or ice cover). Unlike the MRE, a universal amendment cannot be
implemented as the magnitude of FREs is site dependent and can fluctuate
significantly (Ascough et al., 2011; Keaveney and Reimer, 2012). 34 d The purpose of
this study was to utilise S stable isotope measurements in animal and bird bone
collagen from remains found in midden deposits at a Viking farmstead on Lake Myvatn
in an attempt to distinguish between terrestrial, marine and freshwater dietary
components. In turn, this could allow the identification of terrestrial, freshwater
and marine components in the human diet. To date, this is the first study of its kind
to examine sulphur isotopes in bone collagen from archaeological remains found in
Iceland. It is also the largest, single-site sulphur isotope study to be undertaken,
in which 129 bones of domesticated and wild fauna from Skutusta&#xF0;ir were
analysed. These data were produced, together with C and N stable isotope ratio 14
measurements and C age measurements, as part of a multi-isotope approach, building on
previous work to reconstruct animal diet and human activity in the region (Ascough et
al., 2007, 2010, 2012).<component x="61.79" y="69.03" width="227.17" height="632.96"

this study were from Skutusta&#xF0;ir, an archaeological site to the south of Lake
Myvatn (meaning "the lake of midges" in Icelandic) in the north-eastern highlands of
Iceland. Famed, as its name suggests, for its abundant insect life, this shallow
lake, located 50 km inland and at an altitude of 277 m above ( sea level (Fig. 1), is
a sanctuary for breeding waterfowl (Einarsson, 2004; Gardarsson, 2006). The region
has been documented as an area of major archaeological importance with respect to the
settlement of Viking communities during landnam the from around AD 870 onwards
(Vesteinsson, 1998; McGovern et al., 2007; Einarsson and Aldred, 2011). Radiocarbon
dating of terrestrial animal remains and tephrochronological studies from various
sites sur rounding Lake Myvatn have shown that settlers populated the region from the
late 9th century (McGovern et al., 2006, 2007). The presence of these inhabitants is
thought to have had a large environmental impact on the area, with the introduction
of grazing livestock and rapid deforestation (Hallsdottir, 1987), leading to
significant soil erosion (Arn alds et al., 1997; Vesteinsson et al., 2002; Dugmore et

Myvatn is volcanic in nature, with igneous rocks of the tholeiitic series dominating
the landscape. The series is split into three subsections: (1) basaltic rocks, which
are most abundant, comprising of picrite, olivine tholeiite and tholeiite; (2)
intermediate rocks which include icelandite and basaltic icelandite; and (3) silicic
rocks which include dacite and rhyolite (Jakobsson et al., 2008). Porous lava fields
dominate the area, leaving the surface characteristically devoid of water. The lake
has two major basins, Ytrifloi (north basin), which is fed by hot springs from the
Namafjall geothermal field, and Sy&#xF0;rifloi (south basin), which is fed by cold
springs along its eastern shores (Kristmannsdottir and Armannsson, 2004). As
groundwater springs supply most of Lake Myvatn's water and there is an absence of
surface water in the area for it to mix with, the chemical makeup of the water
entering the lake is very stable. Before draining into the River Laxa in the west,
the geothermal waters provide Lake Myvatn with plentiful supplies of silica and
sulphate, whilst cooler waters deliver phosphate to the lake (Kris tmannsdottir and
Armannsson, 2004).<component x="312.83" y="69.03" width="227.15" height="74.14"

store the majority of the earth's sulphur supplies, with sulphides in shale and sul34

et al., 1980; Strauss, 1997) and sulphate in marine water providing a very
isotopically uniform 34 &amp; d reservoir of S = +21 (Rees et al., 1978). In coastal
regions, sulphur-containing particles can be propelled inland 34 d in a process known
as the sea-spray effect, causing soil S values to be similar to that of seawater
(Wadleigh et al., 1994). Intensive weathering of igneous rocks causes leached
sulphides to filter into ground and stream water systems, enabling plants to
accumulate the oxidised sulphate form in their roots. Oxidation of pyrite (FeS )
produces negligi2 ble isotopic fractionation (Nakai and Jensen, 1964; Taylor 34 d and
Wheeler, 1984), whilst plant S values are on average &amp; 1.5 depleted compared to
their sulphate source (Trust and Fry, 1992). Analysis of total sulphur in volcanic

shown to be negligible in areas where SO emissions are 2 high (Nriagu and Coker,
1978), and compared to other parts of Iceland, the Myvatn region has little rain- or
snowfall (Einarsson, 1979). The eruption of the Gr&#x131;msvotn volcano in 1996,
which is &#xA8; situated below the Vatnajokull Glacier in south-east Ice&#xA8; land,
caused the Skei&#xF0;ara River to flood, and water samples taken before and during
the early stages of the overflow revealed a post-eruption increase in sulphur
concentration. Analysis of sulphate in the floodwaters demonstrated that 34 &amp;
&amp; d S values varied between +7.9 and +9.0 , suggesting that sulphurous magmatic
gases were oxidised to sulphate upon dissolution in water (G&#x131;slason et al.,
2002). Together with water samples taken from kettle-hole lakes that had formed since
the 1996 glacier-outburst flood, further groundwater, geothermal spring water and
Skei&#xF0;ara River samples were retrieved between 1998 and 2001 from the
Skei&#xF0;ararsandur outwash plain (Robinson et al., 2009). 34 &amp; d S values from
river sulphates ranged from +3.4 to &amp; +8.8 , with the higher value again
attributed to magmatic sulphate from the Gr&#x131;msvotn caldera, whilst the lower
end &#xA8; value was measured during normal discharge; both values &amp; &amp; fall
within the range of +2 to +10 reported by G&#x131;slason 34 d and Torssander (2006).
Groundwater sulphate S values &amp; &amp; varied between 0.3 and +5.3 , whilst

enriched S values. The higher S values may be attributed to the consumption of
vegetation containing marine-derived sulphur, suggesting these animals may have been
reared closer to the coast and trading of domestic animals was also occurring within
Icelandic Norse communities. Studies have shown that sea-spray 34 d not only
influences coastal soil S values, as sulphate particles can be propelled inland over
extensive distances (Zazzo et al., 2011), however, it is unlikely that the land
around Lake Myvatn would have been affected by sea-spray as the 34 d S values of
these six animals are very distinct from the 34 d average S values of their
contemporaries. The rate of bone collagen turnover is poorly understood, with
estimates ranging from less than a year in birds (Hobson and Clark, 1992) to over ten
years in adult humans (Hedges et al., 2007). Assuming that fully matured animals are
slaughtered within a few years of being brought inland, 34 S signature is unlikely to
have changed significantly their from when they first arrived at Lake Myvatn.
However, collagen turnover rates in juveniles should be higher than in adults, and
therefore if young livestock grazing on coastal vegetation were then traded inland
and reared for the remainder of their lives in the Lake Myvatn region, it is 34 d
likely that their S values would lie somewhere between 34 d a marine signature and
the 34 d S values S value for the local vegetation, and this may account for the
intermediary observed in some domestic animals.<component x="61.79" y="386.85"

that the S values of GUsi&amp; &amp; 1110 (+3.8 ) and GUsi-1111 (+3.7 ) are lower
than the 34 d S values observed for the terrestrial animals average &amp; (+5.6 ),

trout and char bones (mean: 2.7 - 1.4 ) corrobo( rates this theory. Radiocarbon
dating of GUsi-1110 14 cal. (1593 - 28 C yr. BP, AD 412-540 (95.4% probabil14 cal.
ity)) and GUsi-1111 (1552 - 29 C yr. BP, AD 426- 573 (95.4% probability)) confirms
that a large freshwater reservoir effect (FRE) was occurring as both pigs are signif
landnam icantly older than the Viking settlement date of AD 871 - 2 (Vesteinsson,
1998; McGovern et al., 2007; Einarsson and Aldred, 2011). It was assumed that GUsi13
15 &amp; d d 1113, with its slightly enriched C ( 20.6 ), N ( 34 &amp; &amp; d (+6.5
) and S (+8.5 ) values, may have been consuming a small proportion of terrestrial
animal or marine re14 sources, yet its radiocarbon date (1431 - 29 C yr. BP) would
suggest otherwise. As observed with GUsi-1110 landnam and GUsi-1111, GUsi-1113
pre-dates the and disr played an overall 2 calibrated age range of AD 576-656. This
could suggest that this pig had been consuming fresh water resources from a different
body of water to Lake Myvatn, and again potentially highlights that trading was
taking place between Viking communities. Subsequently, human consumption of these
pigs (and any other freshwa14 ter species) would influence their C ages and they too
would appear older than their assigned cultural period (Ascough et al., 2007, 2010,
2011, 2012). Arctic foxes are known to be opportunistic feeders that can adapt their
diet depending on seasonal or geographical changes (Hersteinsson and MacDonald,
1996). They are renowned for preying on birds and stealing their eggs, and the large
population of waterfowl surrounding Lake Myvatn would have provided an ample food
supply for these predators. Even during the winter months, a considerable part of the
lake and the Laxa River remains ice-free, allowing the 13 &amp; d foxes to hunt all
year round. C (mean: 14.9 - 1.3 ), ( 15 34 &amp; d d N (mean: +9.0 - 1.5 ) and in
particular S (mean: &amp; &amp; +1.4 - 0.7 ) stable isotope analysis supports the
theory that like pigs, they too may have been scavenging freshwater fish carcasses
from the shores of the lake and river. GUsi-2118 and GUsi-2126 were discovered just
above the 14 landnam tephra fall of AD 871 - 2, yet C-dating estimates 14 that these
animals ranged from 2605 - 30 C yr. BP 14 (GUsi-2118) to 2160 - 30 C yr. BP
(GUsi-2126). These r results offer an overall 2 age range of 827-107 BC, which again
is significantly earlier than the Viking settlement per14 iod and demonstrates that
the C ages of these samples are affected by a freshwater reservoir effect (Ascough et
al., 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012).<component x="312.83" y="69.03" width="227.19"

stable isotope study to be undertaken of archaeological fauna from one specific site
34 within the Lake Myvatn area, utilisation of S analysis in 13 15 conjunction with C
and N analyses has revealed important details concerning the husbandry techniques and
livestock trading practice of early Viking settlers in Iceland. This study is also
the first instance in which sulphur isotope analysis has been carried out on animal
remains from archaeological deposits in Iceland, and has proven to be a valuable tool
for discriminating between terrestrial, freshwater and marine based diets. 34 d
Cattle bones were found to have lower S values but 15 d higher N values than the
caprine bones analysed, which suggests that they were being kept closer to Lake
Myvatn 15 d and perhaps feeding on N enriched grasses, whereas a 34 d more enriched S
value for sheep and goat bones indicated they were grazing away from the lake and
possibly consuming moss and lichens on the Krafla lava fields. Three 13 d 10th
century pigs were analysed during this study and C 15 d and N values indicated that
two of them were consuming a mixture of terrestrial and non-terrestrial resources,
whilst 34 d S analyses and radiocarbon dating points towards the ingestion of
freshwater fish as the non-terrestrial source. This suggests that early settlers
allowed pigs to roam quite freely around the farmstead and consume domestic waste, or
alternatively, if they were styed, they were deliberately being fed scraps that
included non-terrestrial material. It would be incorrect to assume that only the
weathering 34 d of local bedrock dictates S results, as the majority of the 34 d S
value greater than terrestrial animals examined had a 34 &amp; d +4.2 , whilst almost
all of the freshwater fish had S val&amp; ues less than 2.0 . Iceland has been
subjected to many ( landnam volcanic eruptions before and since the , and evidence
has shown that the increased amounts of sulphurous 34 d magmatic gases have affected
the S values of rivers, lakes and groundwater. The increase in sulphate concentration
34 d has led to an increase in S variability, and as a consequence, this variability
has been transferred throughout the food chain. It is highly conceivable that the
enriched sulphur isotope values observed in some terrestrial animals were the result
of sea-spray affecting coastally reared animals, which were then moved inland. &amp;
Overall, there is an offset of 8 in sulphur isotope val( ues between terrestrial and
freshwater systems in the Lake Myvatn region of Iceland, and the tight range for
freshwater fish demonstrates the homogeneity of this environment 34 d with respect to
S. Results have shown that the freshwater fish populating Lake Myvatn have a
significantly different 34 d S value from their marine contemporaries, with the
aver34 &amp; d age S value of the two groups offset by approx. 18.5 . As the remains
of both freshwater and marine resources have been found in middens at
Skutusta&#xF0;ir, sulphur isotope analysis will be a useful tool for reconstructing
the diets of the human inhabitants, and while correcting for the fresh14 water C
reservoir effect at Lake Myvatn is problematic, these results have nevertheless
enabled us to differentiate 14 whether the anomalously old C ages are due to a marine
14 or freshwater C reservoir effect. As a final point, further research into the use
of sulphur isotopes in archaeology is required, but this study has demonstrated that
if a system is well-defined, is investigated in a methodical manner and is supported
with archaeological and palaeoenvironmental information, it is possible to use
sulphur isotopes as an important tracer of diet.<component x="55.27" y="69.03"
