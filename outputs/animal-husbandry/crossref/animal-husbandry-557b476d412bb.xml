physicochemical properties (Table 1). OXT, FLO and MET are antibiotics and have a
similar mode of action at the DNA/RNA-level. OXT is commonly used because of its
broad-spectrum efficacy in the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria, mycoplasma and large viruses. It inhibits protein synthesis
by preventing the association of aminoacyl-tRNA with bacterial ribosomes (Reemtsma

transpeptidation in the bacterial protein synthesis, and is effective<component

study were obtained according to internationally accepted test guidelines (e.g. OECD,
ISO) or on specific (e.g. national) testing guidelines (e.g. DIN). Hence, according
to the European Medicines Agency (Klimisch et al. (1997) and EMEA, 2008 our results
can be classified under ''reliability index 1''. According to Klimisch et al. (1997)
different terms are being used synonymously to characterize the quality of the data
of toxicological and ecotoxicological studies: validation/validity, reliability and
adequacy. These terms describe not only procedures to define the quality of test
results (data), but also test methods are validated to prove their relevance and
reproducibility. The RI category includes studies or data from the tests generated
according to generally valid and/or internationally accepted testing guidelines or in
which the test parameters documented are based on a specific (national) testing
guideline (preferably performed according to Good Laboratory Practice) or in which
all parameters described are closely related/comparable to a guideline method.
Therefore, all the ecotoxicological tests used in our study fulfill the validation
criteria (for example for ISO 8692 validity criteria includes: the average control
growth, variability of control growth rates (C.V.%), changes of medium pH) stated in
respective Standard Protocols Procedures (SOP) and according to

highlighted that most of the toxicity data available for V. fischeri using short
exposure times (between 5 and 30 min) rather than a 24 h exposure show that most
pharmaceuticals have a low toxic potential in this respect, because these compounds
interfere only slightly with biosynthetic pathways. For example, the low sensitivity
of V. fischeri to OXT can be explained by its mode of action on protein synthesis,
which is not of importance during short-term bioluminescence testing (Zounkov&#xE1;

OXT and FLO - both EC values were around 50 (1 3 mg L - but they were one order of

(calculated for 50 the frond number). Halling-S&#xF8;rensen (2000) suggested that the
toxic effect may have been underestimated in static tests because, for example, of
photodegradation of compounds with short halflives like OXT. Other authors, however,
have confirmed the negligible influence of photodegradation on the results under the
conditions of a 7-d static test (Zounkov&#xE1; et al., 2011). Photodegradation can
also be presumed insignificant in the context of the current study, because the EC
for OXT calculated in 50 this study is generally comparable with the results obtained
by both static and static-renewal tests (Brain et al. 2004; Zounkov&#xE1; et al.,
2011). Brain et al. (2004) also suggested that the ability of antibiotics (like MET,
OXT and FLO) to affect plants might be understood by examining the chloroplast, which
originated from the engulfment of an endosymbiotic Cyanobacteria - like a prokaryotic
cell by a larger eukaryotic cell. However, no information on the toxic effect of DOR
toward aquatic higher plants can be found in the literature. This is probably due to
the assumption that this compound, having a high Koc, will have the potential to sorb
to soil or other solid matrices. As knowledge of its environmental fate and mobility
in the environment is very limited, however, its effects on aquatic organisms should
not be excluded from an evalu&#x2C7; &#x2C7; ation of its ecotoxicity potential
(Kolar and Kozuh Erzen, 2006.). 3.2.4. Growth inhibition assay with D. magna D. magna

comparative ecotoxicological analysis, the potential effects of four selected
veterinary drugs, most commonly used in livestock or in aquacultures, on aquatic
organisms were defined. DOR was found to be highly toxic toward D. magna. Even if
environmental concentrations and ''local hot spots'' during the application of these
pharmaceuticals are still much lower that the EC s of these pharmaceuticals
vis-&#xE0;-vis certain organisms, it 50 must always be borne in mind that these drugs
occur in natural media usually together with others of the same family or type.
Therefore, mixture effects need to be considered, as in such situations toxic
thresholds could already be reached. Moreover, ecotoxicological hazard assessments of
these pharmaceuticals may be misleading if only acute toxicity assays are done.
Therefore, a further research is necessary. This includes ecotoxicological testing in
combination with analytical methods in order to acquire a complete picture of the
exposure to and the risk posed by these pollu<component x="301.72" y="38.3"

similar mode of action at the DNA/RNA-level. OXT is commonly used because of its
broad-spectrum efficacy in the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria, mycoplasma and large viruses. It inhibits protein synthesis
by preventing the association of aminoacyl-tRNA with bacterial ribosomes (Reemtsma

to the European Medicines Agency (Klimisch et al. (1997) and EMEA, 2008 our results
can be classified under ''reliability index 1''. According to Klimisch et al. (1997)
different terms are being used synonymously to characterize the quality of the data
of toxicological and ecotoxicological studies: validation/validity, reliability and
adequacy. These terms describe not only procedures to define the quality of test
results (data), but also test methods are validated to prove their relevance and
reproducibility. The RI category includes studies or data from the tests generated
according to generally valid and/or internationally accepted testing guidelines or in
which the test parameters documented are based on a specific (national) testing
guideline (preferably performed according to Good Laboratory Practice) or in which
all parameters described are closely related/comparable to a guideline method.
Therefore, all the ecotoxicological tests used in our study fulfill the validation
criteria (for example for ISO 8692 validity criteria includes: the average control
growth, variability of control growth rates (C.V.%), changes of medium pH) stated in
respective Standard Protocols Procedures (SOP) and according to

modified DIN 38412-L34 protocol (1991). The tests were carried out at least twice for
each substance. At least four controls (2% NaCl solution, phosphate-buffered) were
used during each test. The tests were performed at 15 C using thermostats
(LUMIS&#xB0; therm, Dr. Lange GmbH, Germany). The luminescence was measured with a
luminometer (LUMIStox 300, Dr Lange GmbH, Germany). The lyophilized bacteria were
rehydrated according to the test protocol; then, 500 lL aliquots of the bacteria
solution were pre-incubated for 15 min at 15 C. After the initial lumines&#xB0; cence
had been measured, 500 lL of the diluted samples were added to the bacteria. The
bioluminescence was measured again after an incubation time of 30 min. The relative
toxicity of the samples was expressed as a percentage inhibition compared to the
controls.<component x="301.72" y="519.45" width="251.07" height="185.81" page="4"

mL . ( This test is a modified version of the assay described by Altenburger et al.
(1990), and its sensitivity is comparable to the standardized 72 h test (ISO 8692,
1989). The toxicity tests started with autospores. The algae were exposed to the test
substances for one growth cycle (24 h). The endpoint of this assay is the inhibition
of algal reproduction, measured as the inhibition of population growth. Cell numbers
were determined with a Coulter Counter Z2 (Beckmann, N&#xFC;rnberg, Germany). The
tests were performed in sterilized glass tubes, the algae were stirred throughout the
24 h test period, and the test conditions were the same as for the stock culture
except for the CO source. 2 Here, 150 lL of NaHCO solution was added to each test
tube.3 The methods of stock culturing and testing are described in detail by Faust et
al. (2001). Growth inhibition was calculated using the cell counts of the treated
samples in relation to the untreated controls. At least six controls were used for
each assay. The tests were performed using six different concentrations in two
replicates of every compound and each test was carried out at least twice.<component

highlighted that most of the toxicity data available for V. fischeri using short
exposure times (between 5 and 30 min) rather than a 24 h exposure show that most
pharmaceuticals have a low toxic potential in this respect, because these compounds
interfere only slightly with biosynthetic pathways. For example, the low sensitivity
of V. fischeri to OXT can be explained by its mode of action on protein synthesis,
which is not of importance during short-term bioluminescence testing (Zounkov&#xE1;

(calculated for 50 the frond number). Halling-S&#xF8;rensen (2000) suggested that the
toxic effect may have been underestimated in static tests because, for example, of
photodegradation of compounds with short halflives like OXT. Other authors, however,
have confirmed the negligible influence of photodegradation on the results under the
conditions of a 7-d static test (Zounkov&#xE1; et al., 2011). Photodegradation can
also be presumed insignificant in the context of the current study, because the EC
for OXT calculated in 50 this study is generally comparable with the results obtained
by both static and static-renewal tests (Brain et al. 2004; Zounkov&#xE1; et al.,
2011). Brain et al. (2004) also suggested that the ability of antibiotics (like MET,
OXT and FLO) to affect plants might be understood by examining the chloroplast, which
originated from the engulfment of an endosymbiotic Cyanobacteria - like a prokaryotic
cell by a larger eukaryotic cell. However, no information on the toxic effect of DOR
toward aquatic higher plants can be found in the literature. This is probably due to
the assumption that this compound, having a high Koc, will have the potential to sorb
to soil or other solid matrices. As knowledge of its environmental fate and mobility
in the environment is very limited, however, its effects on aquatic organisms should
not be excluded from an evalu&#x2C7; &#x2C7; ation of its ecotoxicity potential
