with major changes in their environment as they go through different phases of the
production system. Examples include introduction to a new housing system, provision
of a new type of feed, mixing with unfamiliar conspecifics or being exposed to new
human handlers. Learning processes that reduce uncertainty in such situations are
likely to be very important both for animal welfare and for performance. The aim of
this paper is to describe, from the animal's point of view, situations typical of
learning in farm animal husbandry and to provide a framework for assessing the
significance of learning processes for farm animal husbandry and welfare. The
literature reviewed covers experimental studies into the learning abilities of
ruminants, pigs and poultry as well as evidence stemming from applied studies showing
problems farm animals may face in situations of change. We argue that knowledge of
species-specific learning abilities may help in the design of housing systems and the
establishment of management routines that facilitate learning by the animals. Having
searched the literature, we conclude that there is a lack of studies focusing on the
initial phase after the introduction of farm animals into a new housing system and on
the way they learn to use new housing equipment. Moreover, we suggest that studies
into: (a) learning of farm animals during transport and in the slaughterhouse, (b)
their motivation to explore the environment and (c) the development of enrichment
tasks taking into account their learning abilities may provide solutions to some
animal welfare # problems. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.<component

and alter its future behaviour. As a consequence, successful coping responses will
result in learning. The first few hours or days after introduction of a farm animal
into a given housing system are thus likely to lead to significant alterations in
behaviour due to information that is acquired and processed by the animal. The animal
will learn about specific characteristics of its housing environment, and the
resulting behavioural modifications can be interpreted as an attempt to optimise its
behaviour, both in terms of improving survival and fitness and in terms of trying to
achieve positive emotional states and to avoid suffering. Astonishingly, adaptation
by learning has not been paid much attention in the applied animal behaviour
literature on farm animals. In the literature search we did in the preparation of
this review article, we found only a few studies focussing on the first hours or days
the animals spent in a new housing system. Typically, studies assessing the welfare
of farm animals in a given housing system begin when the animals are already
accustomed to the housing conditions, and this is usually mentioned in the ''Methods
section'' to give assurance that the situation investigated was stable and that the
behaviour observed was typical for animals kept in such a housing system. However,
this approach neglects processes of learning that take place when animals become
familiar with a new environment, and it may even fail to recognise welfare problems
that arise specifically during that period. The lack of interest in the initial phase
after the introduction of farm animals into a new housing system also contrasts with
the scientific interest that has been paid to farm animals that have been released
into semi-natural environments in experimental studies on the natural behaviour of
domestic animals in the late 1970s. Both with the study on laying hens (Wood-Gush and
Duncan, 1976) and the study on pigs (Wood-Gush et al., 1990) a report on the initial
phase of the experiment was published, probably because this phase was thought to be
critical with regard to the animals' success to fare well in the wild on the one
hand, and very informative concerning the animals' ability to cope with a new
environment on the other. But why should these aspects not be of special interest
when animals are confronted with a new indoor environment? The aim of this review
article is to provide a framework for assessing the significance of learning
processes for farm animal husbandry, focussing on ruminants, pigs and poultry. We
will first address different aspects that usually have to be learned by farm animals.
Secondly, we will discuss possibilities for facilitating learning in order to enhance
the animals' ability to adapt to housing conditions. Finally, we set out a number of
fields that, in our opinion, are of interest for future research into learning in
farm animals.<component x="45.35" y="236.63" width="382.63" height="379.56" page="3"

lateness="0.29411764705882354" reference_score="4.55">Unless animals are tethered or
crated, they can move around and use different sites of their housing system for
different activities. Current housing systems typically provide different resources
in different sites, so the animals are expected to use different areas for resting,
feeding, drinking, and comfort behaviour. With poultry, the third dimension may also
be important when nest sites and perches are provided at different levels above the
ground in aviary systems. When animals are introduced into such a housing system,
they have to learn how the resources are distributed within it. This is probably not
a demanding task in the case of weaned pigs moved to a fully slatted fattening pen.
However, if the floor of the pen is only partly slatted, it is of much advantage both
to the pigs and the farmer if the animals learn to use the slatted part of the pen as
a dunging area and the solid floor as a lying area, thus avoiding pen fouling, animal
dirtiness, and increased ammonia concentrations (Aarnink et al., 1997). Similarly, it
is important that sows due to farrow in loose-house systems choose the place near the
heated piglet nest as their nest-site to ensure that the piglets start to use the
piglet nest soon after birth, and dairy cows housed in cubicle systems should not lie
down in the alleys but choose the cubicles for lying to avoid dirtiness of the udder
which may lead to problems with udder health and milk quality. At first sight, such a
differentiation in the use of different areas of a housing system for different
activities seems to be trivial. After all, the housing systems were designed to be
used in a particular way, and activity and resting areas are labelled on the plans
drawn by the architects. Animals, however, do not read architects' plans. There is
evidence that there are problems with fattening pigs fouling the pen floor (Randall
et al., 1983; Aarnink et al., 1996), dairy cows lying down outside the cubicles
(Kjaestad and Myren, 2001), and hens laying eggs outside the nest boxes (floor eggs)
(Appleby et al., 1988; Cooper and Appleby, 1996). Consequently, it is worth having a
closer look at the learning processes leading to appropriate use of the housing
systems as well as at possible constraints on learning responsible for any difficulty
animals may find in selecting the right place for a given activity. Experimental
investigations with farm species have shown that they are good at solving tasks
requiring spatial memory. For example, Mendl et al. (1997) reported that pigs could
remember the location of food across a 2-h retention interval. Edwards et al. (1996)
and Dumont and Petit (1998) showed that sheep remembered the spatial location of
patches in which they had found food 12 and 24 h previously, and Edwards et al. found
that the sheep's performance did not decline when the time between successive visits
was increased to 72 h. Similarly, chicks accurately return to the geometric location
of food 24 h after training (Tommasi and Vallortigara, 2000). Both chicks and grazing
cattle may use long-term spatial memory to return to food locations (Zimmerman et
al., 2003; Laca, 1998), and cattle can remember food locations accurately for at
least 48 days (Ksiksi and Laca, 2002). Given this evidence, when farm animals do not
use a given area of a housing system adequately, it is unlikely that this is because
of any difficulty in remembering which site they had used previously to perform a
given behaviour. Rather, we have to suppose that the area where a given behaviour has
been made possible by the design of the living quarters is, from the animal's point
of view, unsuitable in some way. Firstly, it is possible that the perceptual cues
available are inadequate to elicit the required behaviour in a given area. For
example, pigs prefer to show eliminative behaviour at sites that are wet and where
they can have contact with pigs in a neighbouring pen (Mollet and Wechsler, 1991;
Hacker et al., 1994). However, if these environmental characteristics are not limited
to a specific area of a pen but can be found at different sites within the pen the
pigs will find it difficult to choose a specific site where all members of the group
defecate. Similarly, sows due to farrow typically select as a nest site an area with
straw bedding and solid walls separating it from neighbouring pens (Arey et al.,
1992; Schmid, 1992). In pens where these cues are provided in a specific area
supposed to be the nest site they will show eliminative behaviour away from that
site. Schmid (1992, 1997) followed the process of selection of a dunging area both in
sows due to farrow and in fattening pigs after introduction into new pens and
observed that eliminative behaviour is more scattered over the whole pen floor on the
1st day than thereafter, showing that learning does take place. Secondly, animals may
be reluctant to use a specific site within their housing system for a given behaviour
because of negative experiences they made on previous use of that site. For example,
dairy cows need ample space in front of the lying area in cubicles to make a head
swing when standing up (Lidfors, 1989). If large cows are housed in stables with
cubicles that are too short, the difficulty of standing up in these cubicles may
result in cows lying in the alleys rather than in the foreseen lying place. With
pigs, pens may not be used in the way they were designed if there is draught in the
lying area; the animals will then tend to lie elsewhere in their housing system
(Geers et al., 1986). Finally, sites near to the door of a shed may generally be
unattractive to farm animals, as there is a risk of being disturbed every time a
human enters the building. Thirdly, animals may be unable to visit sites intended for
a given behaviour. With laying hens, it has been found that rearing chicks without
early access to perches impairs the spatial skills they &#xA8; need to reach perches
(Frohlich, 1991; Gunnarsson et al., 2000). This may result in an increased prevalence
of floor eggs in adult hens, as they have difficulty in reaching elevated nest boxes
(Appleby et al., 1988; Gunnarsson et al., 1999). Similarly, Bircher et al. (1996)
reported that turkeys had more and more difficulty in using elevated perches for
resting during the fattening period, and this was paralleled by an increase in leg
problems.<component x="45.35" y="57.2" width="382.55" height="116.57" page="3"

animal species have innate preferences for food over non-food items, a phenomenon
that has been investigated extensively in poultry (Dawkins, 1968). Nevertheless, they
do have to learn what they can eat in the environment in which they actually grow up
(Hogan, 1973), and there is much experimental evidence in various species that food
avoidance learning occurs when animals are given the experience of harmful feed (e.g.
cattle: Kronberg et al., 1993; sheep: Burritt and Provenza, 1989; goats: Zahorik et
al., 1990; poultry: Hale and Green, 1988); conversely, goats and sheep may learn to
eat foods that have a medicinal effect (Rogosic et al., 2006; Villalba et al., 2006).
Several studies with farm animals have shown that social learning may be important
for feed acceptance. For example, Fukasawa et al. (1999) reported that calves who
could eat a novel food in early ontogeny when housed together with their dam, who was
familiar with that food, were more likely to feed on it 12 weeks later than calves
without such a social experience. With weaned piglets, the presence of a piglet that
is already experienced with eating solid food stimulates food intake of an
inexperienced piglet (Morgan et al., 2001). It has also been found that an
experimentally induced feed aversion my be overcome by social learning. For example,
Ralphs and Olsen (1990) observed that averted heifers started to sample of the
formerly avoided feed when paired with non-averted conspecifics, and the aversion was
even extinguished in some animals. Similar results were obtained in a study with
sheep (Thorhallsdottir et al., 1990). With fattening ruminants in intensive housing,
it is typical that they have to learn to accept food they would not eat in their
natural environment. For example, Chapple et al. (1987a) observed how sheep learned
to eat wheat and reported that it took up to 14 days until a sheep began eating this
feed. In this case too, sheep learned the new type of feed faster if they were
grouped with conspecifics who were experienced in eating wheat (Chapple et al.,
1987b). Another problem farm animals may face is that the food they are offered
changes suddenly; this is often the case when animals are weaned or translated from
rangeland to intensive housing for finishing, for example. Experimental evidence
shows that there are several ways of promoting intake of a novel food. Launchbaugh et
al. (1997) found that addition of a familiar flavour to a novel food may increase its
acceptance. Lambs that were used to eating onion-flavoured barley ate more
onion-flavoured rice than lambs that had previously eaten only unflavoured barley.
Moreover, it may help animals to accept a novel food if it is provided in a familiar
environment. Burritt and Provenza (1997) reported that lambs ate less of the novel
feeds at an unfamiliar than at a familiar location suggesting that feed neophobia is
greater in unfamiliar environments. Therefore, a simultaneous change of the
environment and the feed should be avoided, and the new feed should be presented to
the animals for some time in the familiar environment before they are moved to the
new environment. With pigs, the change from milk to solid food at weaning is
critical, resulting in a temporary decrease in daily weight gain, which is more
pronounced in piglets weaned early (Worobec et al., 1999). This may reflect the
piglets' difficulty in learning about solid food at an early age, though it may
simple be a consequence of problems they face in digesting solid food at that
age.<component x="45.35" y="57.2" width="382.6" height="391.53" page="5"

the technology used in farm animal husbandry, animals have to learn more and more
about housing equipment. For example, sows learn to feed from electronic feeding
stations and dairy cows may have to get used to be milked in an automatic milking
system. There are, however, only a few studies in which the process of adaptation to
housing equipment has been monitored extensively. For example, Pojtner et al. (1984)
described the adaptation of dairy cows to automatic feeders and Kashiwamura et al.
(2001) reported how habituation was used to encourage dairy cows to enter the milking
boxes of an automatic milking system. Evidence from experimental studies suggests
that social learning may help animals to learn about housing equipment. In a study
with heifers, Veissier (1993) found that the activity of a demonstrator would draw
the attention of observers to stimuli involved in a task (pushing a panel to get food
into a box) and hence enhance the learning of the task. Veissier and Stefanova (1993)
showed that newborn lambs learned to suck milk from a bucket provided with teats in 3
days rather than 9 if they had an older, experienced lamb in their group. With pigs,
individuals who had observed a trained sibling demonstrator press one of two panels
for food reward directed more non-rewarded presses at the operant panels in a
subsequent test (Nicol and Pope, 1994a). Similarly, Nicol and Pope (1994b) reported
that small flocks of laying hens exposed to a demonstrator trained to peck a key for
a food reward made more keypecks after demonstration sessions than controls without
such a social cue, especially if the demonstrator was a dominant
individual.<component x="39.68" y="272.46" width="382.57" height="236.13" page="6"

lateness="0.4117647058823529" reference_score="6.54">It is typical of farm animal
husbandry that animals are moved from the group in which they were raised to other
groups for breeding or fattening. Thus, they are confronted with the situation of
meeting strange conspecifics, and there must therefore be a process of learning about
the characteristics of the group members and finding its place in the social
organisation of the group. Quite often, this process involves aggressive interactions
resulting in knowledge about asymmetries in dyadic relationships concerning access to
resources (Addison and Baker, 1982; Bolhuis et al., 2005). Interestingly, the process
of group formation may vary with group size. Andersen et al. (2004) found that the
number of fights per individual decreased with increasing group size in newly mixed
groups of weaned piglets, indicating that the pigs are able to alter the way groups
are settled according to the number of individuals involved. Similarly, D'Eath and
Keeling (2003) reported that laying hens kept in small groups performed more
aggressive behaviour towards conspecifics presented in test cages with vertical bars
than hens kept in large groups, suggesting a shift from a peck order to social
tolerance as group size increases. Learning about other group members may, however,
include characteristics other than fighting ability, and positive social
relationships are also likely to be the result of a learning process. It is thus not
surprising that farm animals are able to discriminate between individual familiar
group members, as has been shown for cattle (Hagen and Broom, 2003), sheep (Ligout
and Porter, 2003), pigs (McLeman et al., 2005) and hens (Bradshaw, 1991).<component

animals are regularly in close contact with humans, and in many cases those humans
interact with them, thus becoming a significant aspect of their environment.
Experimental studies have shown that farm animals are able to discriminate between
humans based on previous experience with them. For example, Miura et al. (1996)
reported that weaning pigs that had been handled regularly by an experimenter for 2
weeks approached the handler rather than a stranger. Dairy cows were found to keep a
longer distance from an aversive than a gentle handler (Munksgaard et al., 2001), and
calves that were treated repeatedly either positively or adversely in their home pen
contacted the positive handler significantly more than the aversive handler in their
home pen, but did not discriminate between the two handlers when retested outside
their home pens (de Passille et al., 1996). Similarly, Koba and Tanida (1999)
observed that miniature pigs could differentiate between a handler who touched and
fed them on approach and a non-handler in a familiar environment, though they had
difficulty discriminating the two people in a new place. Sheep that were rewarded in
the presence of a handler but not in the presence of a second handler also showed the
ability to differentiate between individual humans (Davis et al., 1998). Rybarczyk et
al. (2001) showed in formal experiments that cattle used both face and height
information to discriminate between people, while Peirce et al. (2001) found in maze
experiments that sheep could discriminate between human faces. Several studies have
provided evidence that animals' initial fear of humans can be overcome by regular
handling. For example, Miura et al. (1996) observed that regularly handled weanling
pigs showed significantly less aversion to a non-familiar human than did non-handled
pigs. With chicks, Jones (1994) reported that regular gentle handling in early
ontogeny reliably reduces the animals' fear of humans. Moreover, he found that chicks
habituated to one person through regular handling also exhibited reduced fear of
other people wearing either similar or different types of clothing, thus showing
stimulus generalisation. Similarly, Hemsworth et al. (1996) observed that pigs fed by
an experimenter were subsequently less fearful both of the handler and of other
humans. With farm animals, it is inevitable that they sometimes have negative
experiences with humans, for example when they are caught for marking or veterinary
treatment, or subjected to mutilations, such as dehorning, tail-docking or
castration. Experimental studies suggest that such situations are perceived as less
aversive by the animals if they have been regularly handled by humans before. With
sheep, it has been shown that gentle handling reduces the flight distance and the
heart rate response to humans during subsequent aversive treatment (Hargreaves and
Hutson, 1990) and improves the ease of handling during weighing procedures (Uetake et
al., 2000). Similarly, Tanida et al. (1994) found that piglets receiving regular
handling showed less aversion and even tried to make frequent physical contact with
an experimenter in spite of repeated chasing and catching events. Interestingly,
Jones and Waddington (1992) reported that early environmental enrichment also
attenuated the tonic immobility reaction of chicks to manual restraint, suggesting
that enrichment may have modified general, non-specific fearfulness. There is growing
evidence that farm animals' fear of humans does not only impair their welfare but may
also markedly affect their performance (Rushen et al., 1999). As a consequence, it is
worth investing in the establishment of positive human-animal relationships through
regular gentle handling, which seems to be most effective if it occurs in early
ontogeny. Given that the experiences an animal has with one person may also affect
its behaviour towards other people, such an investment will have a positive impact on
a wide range of situations the animal will face during its life.<component x="45.35"

role of uncertainty reduction in determining animal behaviour, and this aspect of
behavioural organisation is not only important in the wild, but also for farm
animals. The process includes information gathering as well as information processing
resulting in a cognitive model of the environment, from which rules of behavioural
responses to specific environmental situations are derived and further selected based
on the feedback the animal gets when performing the response. If learning in farm
animals is viewed in this way, it is possible to deduce general principles from
learning theories that may be applied to enhance farm animals' adaptation to housing
conditions and hence their welfare.<component x="39.69" y="439.87" width="382.57"

of its environment are equally relevant. For example, for newborn piglets, cues of
the sow, such as udder shape and temperature, are probably of much importance in
terms of survival. It is thus not surprising that behavioural organisation is
characterised by innate preferences regarding cues to which they will react, as
exemplified by the preference of newborn piglets to approach and lie down close to
soft and warm tissue (Welch and Baxter, 1986). Similarly, specific cues in the
environment of newly hatched chicks are important for the development of sufficient
eating behaviour to ensure their survival (Shreck et al., 1963). Such preferences can
be used to facilitate farm animals' learning about the housing system. For example,
cows have a preference for a soft surface of the floor in the place they lie down
(Herlin, 1997). Such information can be used to design cubicles that are well
accepted as lying places. With poultry, Appleby and McRae (1986) showed that
enclosure is an important stimulus in nest-site selection by laying hens, and Duncan
and Kite (1989) found that hens opt for nests containing loose material that can be
moulded by body and feet movements. As noted above, knowledge of such preferences is
important for the design of aviary systems to ensure that the hens will learn to lay
their eggs in the available nest boxes and not elsewhere in the housing system.
Moreover, chicks of both broiler and layer strains preferentially show active
behaviour in bright light and resting and perching in dim light (Davis et al., 1999).
Consequently, it may be useful to structure the housing system according to this
preference with feeding and drinking equipment provided in brighter areas than
perches. Dairy cows have a clear preference for lighted over unlighted passageways
(Phillips and Morris, 2001) and it is important to take this into account in order to
ensure that cows return willingly to the different resources of their housing system,
such as the concentrate feeder or the milking parlour.<component x="39.68" y="140.94"

person also in interactions with other people. Similarly, it is likely that the
animals get used to other cues present on a farm, such as noises, smells and daily
management routines which will influence the way they react to future changes in
their environment. In an experimental study with laying hens, Dawkins (1977) found
that animals that had been kept in battery cages preferred cages over an outdoor run
in the initial trials of a preference test and only gradually changed their
preference towards the outdoor run, whereas hens that were already familiar with an
outdoor run chose this option preferentially right from the beginning of the testing.
Consequently, if it is known that the animals will be moved to a certain type of
housing system or will have to be handled in a certain way, it may be useful to give
them opportunities to learn about features that will be important in the future. With
fattening pigs, for example, it can be foreseen that they will have to be moved
outside their pen at loading for the transport to the slaughterhouse, and Abbott et
al. (1997) showed experimentally that their willingness to move is increased if they
are moved outside the building and back to the pen three times during the month
before slaughter. Laying hens that will be kept in aviary systems during the laying
period should preferentially also be raised in aviary systems that allow them to use
different vertical levels, thus &#xA8; enhancing their ability to cope with this
housing system (Hane et al., 2000). Rearing farm animals in enriched rather than
barren environments seems to be another promising approach for enhancing their
learning ability and thus their ability to cope with challenges they will meet later
in life. For example, Sneddon et al. (2000) found that growing pigs performed better
in both an operant task which involved learning to push a panel for a reward and a
maze test which involved spatial learning if they had been reared in an enriched
environment, incorporating extra space and areas which contained peat and straw in a
rack, compared to pigs from barren, intensive housing. Similarly, the possibility of
building up social relationships in early ontogeny may have a significant influence
on the animals' future learning ability, as it does in non-farm animals, such as rats
(e.g. Morgan, 1973). The effects of environmental enrichment on brain development and
cognitive abilities have been studied extensively in laboratory animals &#xA8; (e.g.
Rosenzweig and Bennett, 1996; van Praag et al., 2000; Wurbel, 2001) and results
achieved in these studies may also be relevant for farm animals.<component x="45.35"

animals that ancestrally lived in groups, such as our farm animals, has probably been
shaped by evolution to use information stemming from conspecifics reacting to a given
event and interacting with a given environmental feature to form rules of response to
similar events and features. As discussed above, social learning occurs in farm
animal species in a variety of situations, probably mainly in the form of local or
stimulus enhancement. If &#xA8; possible, it may thus be preferable to introduce
na&#x131;ve animals to groups that are already familiar with a given housing system
or equipment instead of composing groups in which all individuals lack experience. In
line with this, Nicol (1995) suggested that few trained demonstrators could be &#xA8;
added to newly established groups to facilitate habituation and correct use of
equipment by na&#x131;ve animals.<component x="45.36" y="117.07" width="382.64"

equipment and then that, if they start exploring it, they receive a reinforcing
feedback without much delay. In order to encourage correct manipulation of feeders or
drinkers it is usually helpful to spread some feed or sprinkle water in the vicinity
of the equipment. Studies of natural foraging have shown that, when hungry or
thirsty, animals will look for cues for food and water and, once they have found
small quantities, typically modify their behaviour so that they stay in the vicinity
(Smith, 1974), so long as the source is not experienced as being exhausted (Kamil,
1978). Of course, food may also be used to draw the attention of animals to a site
for other reasons than feeding. Prescott et al. (1998) showed experimentally that
food is significantly more rewarding than milking and likely to be a necessary
incentive to attract cows to an automatic milking system. If an operant response is
required to produce more food or water, for example, pressing on a bar to induce the
delivery of food pellets or squeezing a nipple drinker to start a continuous flow of
water, it is always recommended that the interval between the behaviour of the animal
about to learn and the delivery of the resource should be as short as possible.
Experiments in tightly controlled situations show that even the briefest delay
between response and reinforcement can greatly slow learning (Grice, 1948). However,
in simple operant situations of the sort likely to be encountered in agricultural
practice, learning can still occur even with quite substantial response-reinforcer
delays (Lattal and Gleeson, 1990; Wilkenfeld et al., 1992), and in any case the
effects of response-reinforcer delay can usually be overcome by providing an
immediate stimulus which has been pre-associated with food (Schlinger and Blakely,
1994). This ''bridging'' effect of a stimulus, which becomes a conditioned
reinforcer, has been well understood from the time of Grice's work, and one of the
purposes of procedures such as clicker training is to provide it. With farm animal
equipment, there is pressure to make learning to operate equipment correctly as easy
for the animals as possible. Extensive training involving human assistance will
increase labour costs. Furthermore, the length of the period the animals need to
learn the task tends to be negatively related to their performance. As a consequence,
the equipment in use has to be simple if it is to be successful on the market.
Nevertheless, there is room for further improvement, for example in providing
apparatus to promote water intake of newborn piglets (Deligeorgis et al., 2006) and
dairy cows (Teixeira et al., 2006) or feed intake in weaned piglets (O'Connell et
al., 2002). Furthermore, new technology, such as distance sensors and electronic tags
used for individual recognition of animals may offer new opportunities to shape the
behaviour of farm animals using operant conditioning techniques without human
intervention.<component x="39.68" y="224.67" width="382.66" height="391.53" page="10"

for the animals' ability to adapt to a housing system, it would be desirable to give
more attention to the process of information gathering and processing in novel
situations, both to describe the mechanisms of learning involved, and also to
identify problems in learning in farm animals. Methodologically, this would probably
be best achieved by recording the behaviour of individuals chosen as focal animals
and analysing the behavioural changes occurring after introduction to the new housing
conditions. Such studies would contrast sharply with the usual current approach, i.e.
using behaviour to measure the outcome of an adaptation process some time after
introduction to a housing system, and using these data to judge whether the animals
are able to cope with it. In experimental psychology, a number of standard tests
exists in which animals are confronted with defined experimental situations to
measure their response to novel environments, from the traditional open field test
introduced by Hall (1934) to more recently introduced procedures, such as the
''strange situation'' adapted from experiments with human children (Topal et al.,
1998). The ways animals approach spatial or manipulative tasks and the cues they use
have been investigated extensively (e.g. Jacobs and Schenk, 2003; Osthaus et al.,
2005). Thus, the methods for such recording and analysis of behaviour can be found in
the publications of this field of research. In applied animal behaviour science,
standardised test situations, such as open field tests or novel object tests have
also been used as a measure of fear or personality traits (e.g. Andersen et al.,
2000; Thodberg et al., 1999). What is missing, however, are studies that focus in
similar detail on the behaviour of individuals when they are confronted with a novel
situation typical for farm animal husbandry, such as being introduced to a new
housing system or having to learn to use a new housing equipment. Such studies would
be of interest for both practical and theoretical reasons. They could make a
contribution to the design of housing systems and development of equipment that do
not cause problems to the animals in terms of learning. Furthermore, they could
provide insight into the basic mechanisms by which animals, other than traditional
laboratory animals, form response rules to reduce uncertainty. Carrying out such
experiments with farm animals in an animal husbandry context has a number of possible
benefits. It is possible to investigate more complex situations than those typically
studied in laboratory experiments, e.g. in a Skinner box, without facing the problems
of doing such studies with wild animals in a natural environment. With farm animals
there should be no problem with sample size, their behaviour can be observed for 24 h
a day, they are very suitable for experimental manipulations, and they are already
adapted or habituated to tolerate interactions with humans.<component x="39.69"

farm animal usually experiences only rarely, and the last few hours spent in the
slaughterhouse are experienced only once. Nevertheless, as reduction of uncertainty
is a major issue of behavioural organisation, animals will gather information and use
their learning ability to cope as well as possible with these new situations. It is
thus likely that they will be very attentive to stimuli allowing them to make
predictions about coming events and that they will immediately incorporate
experiences they make on these journeys into their response rules. Furthermore both
these situations are of great concern from the point of view of animal welfare, so it
is particularly important to consider what animals may learn about them (see also
Lea, 2001). We suggest that animals' attentiveness and readiness to learn in these
situations should be investigated in detail, with the aim of identifying cues that
help them take stress-reducing responses. For example, the cues provided by races
should be considered as an essential element in their design. Furthermore, the visual
and vocal signals given by humans (often humans with whom the animals are unfamiliar)
to move or guide the animals could be tested and screened for their effect on animal
learning. It would also be relevant to analyse how experiences the animals have at
the beginning of the journey, when leaving their housing system and during loading,
affect their behaviour at unloading and in the slaughterhouse. Animals that are given
time and clear signals to learn to cope with uncertainty at loading may be better
able to adjust their response rules to their experiences at the slaughterhouse, thus
reducing stress and there increasing welfare and also, very probably, meat
quality.<component x="45.35" y="57.2" width="382.57" height="236.13" page="11"

human assisted training, and laboratory experiments have shown that animals will
learn simple operant tasks without human intervention (Lattal and Gleeson, 1990).
Tasks should be based on the animals' motivation to explore their housing system and
to derive rules of behavioural responses to redundant patterns in their environment
upon reinforcement. Given the fact that farm animals usually have plenty of time to
explore and manipulate their environment, it is likely that they will sooner or later
solve enrichment tasks by trial and error learning. For example, Smith et al. (1990)
reported that caged laying hens developed three different methods of opening a door
in order to lay in a dust bath and spent on average 34 min attempting to open the
door before access was finally achieved.<component x="45.35" y="511.59"

adapt to and cope with their housing conditions is likely to be much influenced by
learning processes. We therefore suggest that studies focusing on the initial phase
after changes in the housing environment would be promising for both identifying and
solving problems animals may face when exposed to such changes. Knowledge of
speciesspecific learning abilities may help in the design of housing systems and in
establishing management routines which facilitate learning and, assuming that
uncertainty reduction is an important goal to the animals, are favourable regarding
animal welfare.<component x="45.35" y="387.26" width="382.54" height="80.68"

with major changes in their environment as they go through different phases of the
production system. Examples include introduction to a new housing system, provision
of a new type of feed, mixing with unfamiliar conspecifics or being exposed to new
human handlers. Learning processes that reduce uncertainty in such situations are
likely to be very important both for animal welfare and for performance. The aim of
this paper is to describe, from the animal's point of view, situations typical of
learning in farm animal husbandry and to provide a framework for assessing the
significance of learning processes for farm animal husbandry and welfare. The
literature reviewed covers experimental studies into the learning abilities of
ruminants, pigs and poultry as well as evidence stemming from applied studies showing
problems farm animals may face in situations of change. We argue that knowledge of
species-specific learning abilities may help in the design of housing systems and the
establishment of management routines that facilitate learning by the animals. Having
searched the literature, we conclude that there is a lack of studies focusing on the
initial phase after the introduction of farm animals into a new housing system and on
the way they learn to use new housing equipment. Moreover, we suggest that studies
into: (a) learning of farm animals during transport and in the slaughterhouse, (b)
their motivation to explore the environment and (c) the development of enrichment
tasks taking into account their learning abilities may provide solutions to some
animal welfare # problems. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.<component

and alter its future behaviour. As a consequence, successful coping responses will
result in learning. The first few hours or days after introduction of a farm animal
into a given housing system are thus likely to lead to significant alterations in
behaviour due to information that is acquired and processed by the animal. The animal
will learn about specific characteristics of its housing environment, and the
resulting behavioural modifications can be interpreted as an attempt to optimise its
behaviour, both in terms of improving survival and fitness and in terms of trying to
achieve positive emotional states and to avoid suffering. Astonishingly, adaptation
by learning has not been paid much attention in the applied animal behaviour
literature on farm animals. In the literature search we did in the preparation of
this review article, we found only a few studies focussing on the first hours or days
the animals spent in a new housing system. Typically, studies assessing the welfare
of farm animals in a given housing system begin when the animals are already
accustomed to the housing conditions, and this is usually mentioned in the ''Methods
section'' to give assurance that the situation investigated was stable and that the
behaviour observed was typical for animals kept in such a housing system. However,
this approach neglects processes of learning that take place when animals become
familiar with a new environment, and it may even fail to recognise welfare problems
that arise specifically during that period. The lack of interest in the initial phase
after the introduction of farm animals into a new housing system also contrasts with
the scientific interest that has been paid to farm animals that have been released
into semi-natural environments in experimental studies on the natural behaviour of
domestic animals in the late 1970s. Both with the study on laying hens (Wood-Gush and
Duncan, 1976) and the study on pigs (Wood-Gush et al., 1990) a report on the initial
phase of the experiment was published, probably because this phase was thought to be
critical with regard to the animals' success to fare well in the wild on the one
hand, and very informative concerning the animals' ability to cope with a new
environment on the other. But why should these aspects not be of special interest
when animals are confronted with a new indoor environment? The aim of this review
article is to provide a framework for assessing the significance of learning
processes for farm animal husbandry, focussing on ruminants, pigs and poultry. We
will first address different aspects that usually have to be learned by farm animals.
Secondly, we will discuss possibilities for facilitating learning in order to enhance
the animals' ability to adapt to housing conditions. Finally, we set out a number of
fields that, in our opinion, are of interest for future research into learning in
farm animals.<component x="45.35" y="236.63" width="382.63" height="379.56" page="3"

crated, they can move around and use different sites of their housing system for
different activities. Current housing systems typically provide different resources
in different sites, so the animals are expected to use different areas for resting,
feeding, drinking, and comfort behaviour. With poultry, the third dimension may also
be important when nest sites and perches are provided at different levels above the
ground in aviary systems. When animals are introduced into such a housing system,
they have to learn how the resources are distributed within it. This is probably not
a demanding task in the case of weaned pigs moved to a fully slatted fattening pen.
However, if the floor of the pen is only partly slatted, it is of much advantage both
to the pigs and the farmer if the animals learn to use the slatted part of the pen as
a dunging area and the solid floor as a lying area, thus avoiding pen fouling, animal
dirtiness, and increased ammonia concentrations (Aarnink et al., 1997). Similarly, it
is important that sows due to farrow in loose-house systems choose the place near the
heated piglet nest as their nest-site to ensure that the piglets start to use the
piglet nest soon after birth, and dairy cows housed in cubicle systems should not lie
down in the alleys but choose the cubicles for lying to avoid dirtiness of the udder
which may lead to problems with udder health and milk quality. At first sight, such a
differentiation in the use of different areas of a housing system for different
activities seems to be trivial. After all, the housing systems were designed to be
used in a particular way, and activity and resting areas are labelled on the plans
drawn by the architects. Animals, however, do not read architects' plans. There is
evidence that there are problems with fattening pigs fouling the pen floor (Randall
et al., 1983; Aarnink et al., 1996), dairy cows lying down outside the cubicles
(Kjaestad and Myren, 2001), and hens laying eggs outside the nest boxes (floor eggs)
(Appleby et al., 1988; Cooper and Appleby, 1996). Consequently, it is worth having a
closer look at the learning processes leading to appropriate use of the housing
systems as well as at possible constraints on learning responsible for any difficulty
animals may find in selecting the right place for a given activity. Experimental
investigations with farm species have shown that they are good at solving tasks
requiring spatial memory. For example, Mendl et al. (1997) reported that pigs could
remember the location of food across a 2-h retention interval. Edwards et al. (1996)
and Dumont and Petit (1998) showed that sheep remembered the spatial location of
patches in which they had found food 12 and 24 h previously, and Edwards et al. found
that the sheep's performance did not decline when the time between successive visits
was increased to 72 h. Similarly, chicks accurately return to the geometric location
of food 24 h after training (Tommasi and Vallortigara, 2000). Both chicks and grazing
cattle may use long-term spatial memory to return to food locations (Zimmerman et
al., 2003; Laca, 1998), and cattle can remember food locations accurately for at
least 48 days (Ksiksi and Laca, 2002). Given this evidence, when farm animals do not
use a given area of a housing system adequately, it is unlikely that this is because
of any difficulty in remembering which site they had used previously to perform a
given behaviour. Rather, we have to suppose that the area where a given behaviour has
been made possible by the design of the living quarters is, from the animal's point
of view, unsuitable in some way. Firstly, it is possible that the perceptual cues
available are inadequate to elicit the required behaviour in a given area. For
example, pigs prefer to show eliminative behaviour at sites that are wet and where
they can have contact with pigs in a neighbouring pen (Mollet and Wechsler, 1991;
Hacker et al., 1994). However, if these environmental characteristics are not limited
to a specific area of a pen but can be found at different sites within the pen the
pigs will find it difficult to choose a specific site where all members of the group
defecate. Similarly, sows due to farrow typically select as a nest site an area with
straw bedding and solid walls separating it from neighbouring pens (Arey et al.,
1992; Schmid, 1992). In pens where these cues are provided in a specific area
supposed to be the nest site they will show eliminative behaviour away from that
site. Schmid (1992, 1997) followed the process of selection of a dunging area both in
sows due to farrow and in fattening pigs after introduction into new pens and
observed that eliminative behaviour is more scattered over the whole pen floor on the
1st day than thereafter, showing that learning does take place. Secondly, animals may
be reluctant to use a specific site within their housing system for a given behaviour
because of negative experiences they made on previous use of that site. For example,
dairy cows need ample space in front of the lying area in cubicles to make a head
swing when standing up (Lidfors, 1989). If large cows are housed in stables with
cubicles that are too short, the difficulty of standing up in these cubicles may
result in cows lying in the alleys rather than in the foreseen lying place. With
pigs, pens may not be used in the way they were designed if there is draught in the
lying area; the animals will then tend to lie elsewhere in their housing system
(Geers et al., 1986). Finally, sites near to the door of a shed may generally be
unattractive to farm animals, as there is a risk of being disturbed every time a
human enters the building. Thirdly, animals may be unable to visit sites intended for
a given behaviour. With laying hens, it has been found that rearing chicks without
early access to perches impairs the spatial skills they &#xA8; need to reach perches
(Frohlich, 1991; Gunnarsson et al., 2000). This may result in an increased prevalence
of floor eggs in adult hens, as they have difficulty in reaching elevated nest boxes
(Appleby et al., 1988; Gunnarsson et al., 1999). Similarly, Bircher et al. (1996)
reported that turkeys had more and more difficulty in using elevated perches for
resting during the fattening period, and this was paralleled by an increase in leg
problems.<component x="45.35" y="57.2" width="382.55" height="116.57" page="3"

animal species have innate preferences for food over non-food items, a phenomenon
that has been investigated extensively in poultry (Dawkins, 1968). Nevertheless, they
do have to learn what they can eat in the environment in which they actually grow up
(Hogan, 1973), and there is much experimental evidence in various species that food
avoidance learning occurs when animals are given the experience of harmful feed (e.g.
cattle: Kronberg et al., 1993; sheep: Burritt and Provenza, 1989; goats: Zahorik et
al., 1990; poultry: Hale and Green, 1988); conversely, goats and sheep may learn to
eat foods that have a medicinal effect (Rogosic et al., 2006; Villalba et al., 2006).
Several studies with farm animals have shown that social learning may be important
for feed acceptance. For example, Fukasawa et al. (1999) reported that calves who
could eat a novel food in early ontogeny when housed together with their dam, who was
familiar with that food, were more likely to feed on it 12 weeks later than calves
without such a social experience. With weaned piglets, the presence of a piglet that
is already experienced with eating solid food stimulates food intake of an
inexperienced piglet (Morgan et al., 2001). It has also been found that an
experimentally induced feed aversion my be overcome by social learning. For example,
Ralphs and Olsen (1990) observed that averted heifers started to sample of the
formerly avoided feed when paired with non-averted conspecifics, and the aversion was
even extinguished in some animals. Similar results were obtained in a study with
sheep (Thorhallsdottir et al., 1990). With fattening ruminants in intensive housing,
it is typical that they have to learn to accept food they would not eat in their
natural environment. For example, Chapple et al. (1987a) observed how sheep learned
to eat wheat and reported that it took up to 14 days until a sheep began eating this
feed. In this case too, sheep learned the new type of feed faster if they were
grouped with conspecifics who were experienced in eating wheat (Chapple et al.,
1987b). Another problem farm animals may face is that the food they are offered
changes suddenly; this is often the case when animals are weaned or translated from
rangeland to intensive housing for finishing, for example. Experimental evidence
shows that there are several ways of promoting intake of a novel food. Launchbaugh et
al. (1997) found that addition of a familiar flavour to a novel food may increase its
acceptance. Lambs that were used to eating onion-flavoured barley ate more
onion-flavoured rice than lambs that had previously eaten only unflavoured barley.
Moreover, it may help animals to accept a novel food if it is provided in a familiar
environment. Burritt and Provenza (1997) reported that lambs ate less of the novel
feeds at an unfamiliar than at a familiar location suggesting that feed neophobia is
greater in unfamiliar environments. Therefore, a simultaneous change of the
environment and the feed should be avoided, and the new feed should be presented to
the animals for some time in the familiar environment before they are moved to the
new environment. With pigs, the change from milk to solid food at weaning is
critical, resulting in a temporary decrease in daily weight gain, which is more
pronounced in piglets weaned early (Worobec et al., 1999). This may reflect the
piglets' difficulty in learning about solid food at an early age, though it may
simple be a consequence of problems they face in digesting solid food at that
age.<component x="45.35" y="57.2" width="382.6" height="391.53" page="5"

the technology used in farm animal husbandry, animals have to learn more and more
about housing equipment. For example, sows learn to feed from electronic feeding
stations and dairy cows may have to get used to be milked in an automatic milking
system. There are, however, only a few studies in which the process of adaptation to
housing equipment has been monitored extensively. For example, Pojtner et al. (1984)
described the adaptation of dairy cows to automatic feeders and Kashiwamura et al.
(2001) reported how habituation was used to encourage dairy cows to enter the milking
boxes of an automatic milking system. Evidence from experimental studies suggests
that social learning may help animals to learn about housing equipment. In a study
with heifers, Veissier (1993) found that the activity of a demonstrator would draw
the attention of observers to stimuli involved in a task (pushing a panel to get food
into a box) and hence enhance the learning of the task. Veissier and Stefanova (1993)
showed that newborn lambs learned to suck milk from a bucket provided with teats in 3
days rather than 9 if they had an older, experienced lamb in their group. With pigs,
individuals who had observed a trained sibling demonstrator press one of two panels
for food reward directed more non-rewarded presses at the operant panels in a
subsequent test (Nicol and Pope, 1994a). Similarly, Nicol and Pope (1994b) reported
that small flocks of laying hens exposed to a demonstrator trained to peck a key for
a food reward made more keypecks after demonstration sessions than controls without
such a social cue, especially if the demonstrator was a dominant
individual.<component x="39.68" y="272.46" width="382.57" height="236.13" page="6"

husbandry that animals are moved from the group in which they were raised to other
groups for breeding or fattening. Thus, they are confronted with the situation of
meeting strange conspecifics, and there must therefore be a process of learning about
the characteristics of the group members and finding its place in the social
organisation of the group. Quite often, this process involves aggressive interactions
resulting in knowledge about asymmetries in dyadic relationships concerning access to
resources (Addison and Baker, 1982; Bolhuis et al., 2005). Interestingly, the process
of group formation may vary with group size. Andersen et al. (2004) found that the
number of fights per individual decreased with increasing group size in newly mixed
groups of weaned piglets, indicating that the pigs are able to alter the way groups
are settled according to the number of individuals involved. Similarly, D'Eath and
Keeling (2003) reported that laying hens kept in small groups performed more
aggressive behaviour towards conspecifics presented in test cages with vertical bars
than hens kept in large groups, suggesting a shift from a peck order to social
tolerance as group size increases. Learning about other group members may, however,
include characteristics other than fighting ability, and positive social
relationships are also likely to be the result of a learning process. It is thus not
surprising that farm animals are able to discriminate between individual familiar
group members, as has been shown for cattle (Hagen and Broom, 2003), sheep (Ligout
and Porter, 2003), pigs (McLeman et al., 2005) and hens (Bradshaw, 1991).<component

animals are regularly in close contact with humans, and in many cases those humans
interact with them, thus becoming a significant aspect of their environment.
Experimental studies have shown that farm animals are able to discriminate between
humans based on previous experience with them. For example, Miura et al. (1996)
reported that weaning pigs that had been handled regularly by an experimenter for 2
weeks approached the handler rather than a stranger. Dairy cows were found to keep a
longer distance from an aversive than a gentle handler (Munksgaard et al., 2001), and
calves that were treated repeatedly either positively or adversely in their home pen
contacted the positive handler significantly more than the aversive handler in their
home pen, but did not discriminate between the two handlers when retested outside
their home pens (de Passille et al., 1996). Similarly, Koba and Tanida (1999)
observed that miniature pigs could differentiate between a handler who touched and
fed them on approach and a non-handler in a familiar environment, though they had
difficulty discriminating the two people in a new place. Sheep that were rewarded in
the presence of a handler but not in the presence of a second handler also showed the
ability to differentiate between individual humans (Davis et al., 1998). Rybarczyk et
al. (2001) showed in formal experiments that cattle used both face and height
information to discriminate between people, while Peirce et al. (2001) found in maze
experiments that sheep could discriminate between human faces. Several studies have
provided evidence that animals' initial fear of humans can be overcome by regular
handling. For example, Miura et al. (1996) observed that regularly handled weanling
pigs showed significantly less aversion to a non-familiar human than did non-handled
pigs. With chicks, Jones (1994) reported that regular gentle handling in early
ontogeny reliably reduces the animals' fear of humans. Moreover, he found that chicks
habituated to one person through regular handling also exhibited reduced fear of
other people wearing either similar or different types of clothing, thus showing
stimulus generalisation. Similarly, Hemsworth et al. (1996) observed that pigs fed by
an experimenter were subsequently less fearful both of the handler and of other
humans. With farm animals, it is inevitable that they sometimes have negative
experiences with humans, for example when they are caught for marking or veterinary
treatment, or subjected to mutilations, such as dehorning, tail-docking or
castration. Experimental studies suggest that such situations are perceived as less
aversive by the animals if they have been regularly handled by humans before. With
sheep, it has been shown that gentle handling reduces the flight distance and the
heart rate response to humans during subsequent aversive treatment (Hargreaves and
Hutson, 1990) and improves the ease of handling during weighing procedures (Uetake et
al., 2000). Similarly, Tanida et al. (1994) found that piglets receiving regular
handling showed less aversion and even tried to make frequent physical contact with
an experimenter in spite of repeated chasing and catching events. Interestingly,
Jones and Waddington (1992) reported that early environmental enrichment also
attenuated the tonic immobility reaction of chicks to manual restraint, suggesting
that enrichment may have modified general, non-specific fearfulness. There is growing
evidence that farm animals' fear of humans does not only impair their welfare but may
also markedly affect their performance (Rushen et al., 1999). As a consequence, it is
worth investing in the establishment of positive human-animal relationships through
regular gentle handling, which seems to be most effective if it occurs in early
ontogeny. Given that the experiences an animal has with one person may also affect
its behaviour towards other people, such an investment will have a positive impact on
a wide range of situations the animal will face during its life.<component x="45.35"

role of uncertainty reduction in determining animal behaviour, and this aspect of
behavioural organisation is not only important in the wild, but also for farm
animals. The process includes information gathering as well as information processing
resulting in a cognitive model of the environment, from which rules of behavioural
responses to specific environmental situations are derived and further selected based
on the feedback the animal gets when performing the response. If learning in farm
animals is viewed in this way, it is possible to deduce general principles from
learning theories that may be applied to enhance farm animals' adaptation to housing
conditions and hence their welfare.<component x="39.69" y="439.87" width="382.57"

of its environment are equally relevant. For example, for newborn piglets, cues of
the sow, such as udder shape and temperature, are probably of much importance in
terms of survival. It is thus not surprising that behavioural organisation is
characterised by innate preferences regarding cues to which they will react, as
exemplified by the preference of newborn piglets to approach and lie down close to
soft and warm tissue (Welch and Baxter, 1986). Similarly, specific cues in the
environment of newly hatched chicks are important for the development of sufficient
eating behaviour to ensure their survival (Shreck et al., 1963). Such preferences can
be used to facilitate farm animals' learning about the housing system. For example,
cows have a preference for a soft surface of the floor in the place they lie down
(Herlin, 1997). Such information can be used to design cubicles that are well
accepted as lying places. With poultry, Appleby and McRae (1986) showed that
enclosure is an important stimulus in nest-site selection by laying hens, and Duncan
and Kite (1989) found that hens opt for nests containing loose material that can be
moulded by body and feet movements. As noted above, knowledge of such preferences is
important for the design of aviary systems to ensure that the hens will learn to lay
their eggs in the available nest boxes and not elsewhere in the housing system.
Moreover, chicks of both broiler and layer strains preferentially show active
behaviour in bright light and resting and perching in dim light (Davis et al., 1999).
Consequently, it may be useful to structure the housing system according to this
preference with feeding and drinking equipment provided in brighter areas than
perches. Dairy cows have a clear preference for lighted over unlighted passageways
(Phillips and Morris, 2001) and it is important to take this into account in order to
ensure that cows return willingly to the different resources of their housing system,
such as the concentrate feeder or the milking parlour.<component x="39.68" y="140.94"

person also in interactions with other people. Similarly, it is likely that the
animals get used to other cues present on a farm, such as noises, smells and daily
management routines which will influence the way they react to future changes in
their environment. In an experimental study with laying hens, Dawkins (1977) found
that animals that had been kept in battery cages preferred cages over an outdoor run
in the initial trials of a preference test and only gradually changed their
preference towards the outdoor run, whereas hens that were already familiar with an
outdoor run chose this option preferentially right from the beginning of the testing.
Consequently, if it is known that the animals will be moved to a certain type of
housing system or will have to be handled in a certain way, it may be useful to give
them opportunities to learn about features that will be important in the future. With
fattening pigs, for example, it can be foreseen that they will have to be moved
outside their pen at loading for the transport to the slaughterhouse, and Abbott et
al. (1997) showed experimentally that their willingness to move is increased if they
are moved outside the building and back to the pen three times during the month
before slaughter. Laying hens that will be kept in aviary systems during the laying
period should preferentially also be raised in aviary systems that allow them to use
different vertical levels, thus &#xA8; enhancing their ability to cope with this
housing system (Hane et al., 2000). Rearing farm animals in enriched rather than
barren environments seems to be another promising approach for enhancing their
learning ability and thus their ability to cope with challenges they will meet later
in life. For example, Sneddon et al. (2000) found that growing pigs performed better
in both an operant task which involved learning to push a panel for a reward and a
maze test which involved spatial learning if they had been reared in an enriched
environment, incorporating extra space and areas which contained peat and straw in a
rack, compared to pigs from barren, intensive housing. Similarly, the possibility of
building up social relationships in early ontogeny may have a significant influence
on the animals' future learning ability, as it does in non-farm animals, such as rats
(e.g. Morgan, 1973). The effects of environmental enrichment on brain development and
cognitive abilities have been studied extensively in laboratory animals &#xA8; (e.g.
Rosenzweig and Bennett, 1996; van Praag et al., 2000; Wurbel, 2001) and results
achieved in these studies may also be relevant for farm animals.<component x="45.35"

animals that ancestrally lived in groups, such as our farm animals, has probably been
shaped by evolution to use information stemming from conspecifics reacting to a given
event and interacting with a given environmental feature to form rules of response to
similar events and features. As discussed above, social learning occurs in farm
animal species in a variety of situations, probably mainly in the form of local or
stimulus enhancement. If &#xA8; possible, it may thus be preferable to introduce
na&#x131;ve animals to groups that are already familiar with a given housing system
or equipment instead of composing groups in which all individuals lack experience. In
line with this, Nicol (1995) suggested that few trained demonstrators could be &#xA8;

equipment and then that, if they start exploring it, they receive a reinforcing
feedback without much delay. In order to encourage correct manipulation of feeders or
drinkers it is usually helpful to spread some feed or sprinkle water in the vicinity
of the equipment. Studies of natural foraging have shown that, when hungry or
thirsty, animals will look for cues for food and water and, once they have found
small quantities, typically modify their behaviour so that they stay in the vicinity
(Smith, 1974), so long as the source is not experienced as being exhausted (Kamil,
1978). Of course, food may also be used to draw the attention of animals to a site
for other reasons than feeding. Prescott et al. (1998) showed experimentally that
food is significantly more rewarding than milking and likely to be a necessary
incentive to attract cows to an automatic milking system. If an operant response is
required to produce more food or water, for example, pressing on a bar to induce the
delivery of food pellets or squeezing a nipple drinker to start a continuous flow of
water, it is always recommended that the interval between the behaviour of the animal
about to learn and the delivery of the resource should be as short as possible.
Experiments in tightly controlled situations show that even the briefest delay
between response and reinforcement can greatly slow learning (Grice, 1948). However,
in simple operant situations of the sort likely to be encountered in agricultural
practice, learning can still occur even with quite substantial response-reinforcer
delays (Lattal and Gleeson, 1990; Wilkenfeld et al., 1992), and in any case the
effects of response-reinforcer delay can usually be overcome by providing an
immediate stimulus which has been pre-associated with food (Schlinger and Blakely,
1994). This ''bridging'' effect of a stimulus, which becomes a conditioned
reinforcer, has been well understood from the time of Grice's work, and one of the
purposes of procedures such as clicker training is to provide it. With farm animal
equipment, there is pressure to make learning to operate equipment correctly as easy
for the animals as possible. Extensive training involving human assistance will
increase labour costs. Furthermore, the length of the period the animals need to
learn the task tends to be negatively related to their performance. As a consequence,
the equipment in use has to be simple if it is to be successful on the market.
Nevertheless, there is room for further improvement, for example in providing
apparatus to promote water intake of newborn piglets (Deligeorgis et al., 2006) and
dairy cows (Teixeira et al., 2006) or feed intake in weaned piglets (O'Connell et
al., 2002). Furthermore, new technology, such as distance sensors and electronic tags
used for individual recognition of animals may offer new opportunities to shape the
behaviour of farm animals using operant conditioning techniques without human
intervention.<component x="39.68" y="224.67" width="382.66" height="391.53" page="10"

for the animals' ability to adapt to a housing system, it would be desirable to give
more attention to the process of information gathering and processing in novel
situations, both to describe the mechanisms of learning involved, and also to
identify problems in learning in farm animals. Methodologically, this would probably
be best achieved by recording the behaviour of individuals chosen as focal animals
and analysing the behavioural changes occurring after introduction to the new housing
conditions. Such studies would contrast sharply with the usual current approach, i.e.
using behaviour to measure the outcome of an adaptation process some time after
introduction to a housing system, and using these data to judge whether the animals
are able to cope with it. In experimental psychology, a number of standard tests
exists in which animals are confronted with defined experimental situations to
measure their response to novel environments, from the traditional open field test
introduced by Hall (1934) to more recently introduced procedures, such as the
''strange situation'' adapted from experiments with human children (Topal et al.,
1998). The ways animals approach spatial or manipulative tasks and the cues they use
have been investigated extensively (e.g. Jacobs and Schenk, 2003; Osthaus et al.,
2005). Thus, the methods for such recording and analysis of behaviour can be found in
the publications of this field of research. In applied animal behaviour science,
standardised test situations, such as open field tests or novel object tests have
also been used as a measure of fear or personality traits (e.g. Andersen et al.,
2000; Thodberg et al., 1999). What is missing, however, are studies that focus in
similar detail on the behaviour of individuals when they are confronted with a novel
situation typical for farm animal husbandry, such as being introduced to a new
housing system or having to learn to use a new housing equipment. Such studies would
be of interest for both practical and theoretical reasons. They could make a
contribution to the design of housing systems and development of equipment that do
not cause problems to the animals in terms of learning. Furthermore, they could
provide insight into the basic mechanisms by which animals, other than traditional
laboratory animals, form response rules to reduce uncertainty. Carrying out such
experiments with farm animals in an animal husbandry context has a number of possible
benefits. It is possible to investigate more complex situations than those typically
studied in laboratory experiments, e.g. in a Skinner box, without facing the problems
of doing such studies with wild animals in a natural environment. With farm animals
there should be no problem with sample size, their behaviour can be observed for 24 h
a day, they are very suitable for experimental manipulations, and they are already
adapted or habituated to tolerate interactions with humans.<component x="39.69"

is a major issue of behavioural organisation, animals will gather information and use
their learning ability to cope as well as possible with these new situations. It is
thus likely that they will be very attentive to stimuli allowing them to make
predictions about coming events and that they will immediately incorporate
experiences they make on these journeys into their response rules. Furthermore both
these situations are of great concern from the point of view of animal welfare, so it
is particularly important to consider what animals may learn about them (see also
Lea, 2001). We suggest that animals' attentiveness and readiness to learn in these
situations should be investigated in detail, with the aim of identifying cues that
help them take stress-reducing responses. For example, the cues provided by races
should be considered as an essential element in their design. Furthermore, the visual
and vocal signals given by humans (often humans with whom the animals are unfamiliar)
to move or guide the animals could be tested and screened for their effect on animal
learning. It would also be relevant to analyse how experiences the animals have at
the beginning of the journey, when leaving their housing system and during loading,
affect their behaviour at unloading and in the slaughterhouse. Animals that are given
time and clear signals to learn to cope with uncertainty at loading may be better
able to adjust their response rules to their experiences at the slaughterhouse, thus
reducing stress and there increasing welfare and also, very probably, meat
quality.<component x="45.35" y="57.2" width="382.57" height="236.13" page="11"

human assisted training, and laboratory experiments have shown that animals will
learn simple operant tasks without human intervention (Lattal and Gleeson, 1990).
Tasks should be based on the animals' motivation to explore their housing system and
to derive rules of behavioural responses to redundant patterns in their environment
upon reinforcement. Given the fact that farm animals usually have plenty of time to
explore and manipulate their environment, it is likely that they will sooner or later
solve enrichment tasks by trial and error learning. For example, Smith et al. (1990)
reported that caged laying hens developed three different methods of opening a door
in order to lay in a dust bath and spent on average 34 min attempting to open the
door before access was finally achieved.<component x="45.35" y="511.59"

adapt to and cope with their housing conditions is likely to be much influenced by
learning processes. We therefore suggest that studies focusing on the initial phase
after changes in the housing environment would be promising for both identifying and
solving problems animals may face when exposed to such changes. Knowledge of
speciesspecific learning abilities may help in the design of housing systems and in
establishing management routines which facilitate learning and, assuming that
uncertainty reduction is an important goal to the animals, are favourable regarding
animal welfare.<component x="45.35" y="387.26" width="382.54" height="80.68"
