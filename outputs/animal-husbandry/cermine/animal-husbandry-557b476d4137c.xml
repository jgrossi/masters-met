      <abstract>
        <p>a b s t r a c t In the last decade several surveys of primate care and training programs highlight a common theme; despite scientific evidence that animal training can be effective in reducing stress, increasing efficiency and improving veterinary care, animal training is not widely incorporated into animal care and management programs in laboratory settings. This is particularly important with the recent release of the internationally recognized version of the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” by the National Research Council. The Guide includes multiple recommendations to incorporate training methods into husbandry and experimental procedures. To address the divide between the regulatory and scientifically based support for animal training, and a broader establishment of formal animal training programs, this paper will: describe three approaches to structuring animal training programs; provide rationale as to why facilities should have animal training programs; report on a recent survey of animal training programs at nine, large USA facilities housing nonhuman primates; discuss important elements of an animal training program; discuss negative reinforcement and means to minimize its use; and finally give a detailed description of a facility-wide animal training program. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

      <title>1. What is a laboratory primate training program?</title>
      <p>The systematic application of operant and classical
conditioning techniques to training primates living in
laboratory facilities has become much more common over
the last two decades (Bloomsmith et al., 1998; Clay et al.,
2009; Coleman et al., 2008; Fernstrom et al., 2009; Laule
et al., 1996, 2003; Perlman et al., 2010; Reinhardt, 1997;
Schapiro et al., 2003, 2005). A major development in this

(J.E. Perlman).
field has been extending the use of positive
reinforcement training (PRT) techniques to increase the primates’
cooperation with animal management and research
procedures. There have been a large number of publications
describing training technique, training terminology and
various uses for training (Bloomsmith et al., 2007; Coleman
and Maier, 2010; Kazdin, 2001; Laule and Whittaker,
2001, 2007; Ramirez, 1999; Schapiro et al., 2005).
However, issues related to designing and initiating animal
training programs have been less well described. Animal
training programs are an important refinement in the
care of laboratory primates as they can help to reduce
stress experienced by animals and improve their research
use by minimizing this confound. The programs may
include dedicated personnel, education programs, routines
to increase consistency among trainers, documentation
systems, and evaluation of trained animals. The objective
of this manuscript is to assist those caring for laboratory
primates in the development of new, or in the refinement
of existing, primate training programs.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="2">
      <title>2. Three approaches to structuring animal training</title>
      <p>Animal training programs generally fall into three
categories: project-based programs, section-wide programs
and facility-wide programs (Whittaker et al., 2008). Within
one institution, multiple approaches may be
simultaneously operating or programs may evolve from one type
of structure to another. It is essential to understand the
focus and breadth of the training program to maximize
effectiveness for the animals and staff. Using the
framework presented here, one can determine which approach
is best suited for the animal care needs and goals of the
institution.</p>
      <sec id="2-1">
        <title>2.1. Project-based approach</title>
        <p>A project-based training program typically includes a
few animals or groups of animals and a limited number of
staff. Specific behavioral objectives can be addressed. For
example, one group of primates may be trained: (1) by the
primary caregiver to shift from one area to another; (2)
by the veterinary technician to present an arm for
ointment application; and (3) by a lab technician to calmly
present for pole attachment to the collar. Resulting benefits
of the project-based training approach include a positive
influence on animal welfare with the application of PRT
to improve voluntary animal cooperation, and job
satisfaction is often enhanced for the person(s) implementing
the training who may take great pride and ownership in
the training project. If successful, other technicians may
take notice of the training accomplishment and may be
motivated to incorporate training into their daily routine. A
project-based approach can serve as the catalyst for other
training projects, and help build the foundation for the
facility’s animal training program. Project-based projects,
when successful, can expand to a section-wide approach.</p>
        <p>There are common drawbacks of a project-based
approach. This approach typically does not receive the
institution’s full support, particularly with regard to the
dedication of time and monetary resources. Training is
a skill that must be developed, and with this approach,
support for continuing education such as conference or
workshop attendance is limited. Additionally, supervisor
oversight may be minimal, which may result in
compromised safety of the trainer or the animal when technique,
facilities, and protocols are not adequately assessed. Once
animals are trained by the primary trainer, behaviors
should be transferred to others. In the absence of direct
supervision, this process may be difficult to implement,
therefore reducing the scope of application for both the
animals and institution. Finally, few animals benefit from
the training conducted in a small project, and the project
may not persist if the motivated primary trainer leaves the
facility.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="2-2">
        <title>2.2. Section-wide approach</title>
        <p>A section-wide approach to training is typically
supported within a particular department or research
laboratory by the manager, and involves staff implementing
training toward specific objectives. For example, the
objective may be training all primates in a particular laboratory
to calmly move into a restraint chair. This section-wide
approach typically involves a subset of animals at a
facility, and there may be support for continuing education
and skills development. Due to the broader scope of this
approach, when applied properly, animal management
will be improved for that particular area or section, and
oversight of safety for animals and humans is available.
If successful, the example may serve as an impetus for
changes in other departments or laboratories within the
facility and, over time, development of a facility-wide
approach may occur.</p>
        <p>One drawback of a section-wide approach is limited
communication among all those working with the same
animals. For example, animals will be trained to calmly
move into a restraint chair for research purposes but
similar animal movement activities, such as calmly entering
a transfer box for animal care purposes, would unlikely
benefit. Further, if an animal is assigned to another study
with a different manager, there may be little
communication between managers regarding the training the animal
received. The program may not persist if the manager
leaves his/her position.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="2-3">
        <title>2.3. Facility-wide approach</title>
        <p>The most comprehensive is the facility-wide approach
to structuring a training program. This program is
implemented throughout the institution and is supported by
multiple management and departmental levels
including animal care, veterinary staff, colony management,
behavioral management, research groups, administration,
occupational health and safety, facility or operations
managers, and perhaps even public relations or regulatory
oversight committees (e.g., Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee, IACUC). Many more people and animals are
positively impacted in comparison to the other approaches.
The institutional commitment to the facility-wide training
program is demonstrated by hiring for dedicated positions,
supplying continuing education opportunities and training
for staff, providing the necessary tools, facility
modifications and safety oversight. Training responsibilities are
included in appropriate job descriptions and supervisors
ensure accountability for training responsibilities. Goals
and objectives of the training program are communicated
throughout the facility. Progress toward centralized
training goals are assessed and refined, as needed, to move the
program forward. A facility-wide training approach creates
a framework of safety, education, consistency and
communication for the multiple project-based and section-wide
training applications that are often present in larger
institutions.</p>
        <p>There are few drawbacks to such a facility-wide
program, but they are significant. Development and
implementation of such a program takes time and monetary
resources. There are significant costs associated with
hiring additional personnel, providing training and continuing
education to all staff involved, modifying facilities and
providing supplies to support the training program. Additional
drawbacks are staff frustration with perceived additional
responsibilities and time expenditure, as well as lack of
interest to “fix what ain’t broke”.</p>

      <title>3. Why primate facilities should have animal training programs</title>
      <sec id="3-1">
        <title>3.1. Regulatory compliance</title>
        <p>There is increased interest from regulatory agencies
on the effects of animal training on the welfare of
nonhuman primates. The recent version of the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (2011) emphasizes
the importance and benefits of animal training programs
with the following recommendation: “Habituating animals
to routine husbandry or experimental procedures should
be encouraged whenever possible as it may assist the
animal to better cope with a captive environment by reducing
stress associated with novel procedures or people. The type
and duration of habituation needed will be determined by
the complexity of the procedure. In most cases, principles
of operant conditioning may be employed during training
sessions, using progressive behavioral shaping, to induce
voluntary cooperation with procedures” (pp. 64–65). In a
2010 report of site visits to chimpanzee facilities in the
United States of America, The Office of Laboratory
Animal Welfare (OLAW) also supported the notion that PRT
may help in reducing stress and concluded that when
safe and feasible, nonhuman primates should be afforded
positive reinforcement training opportunities (OLAW,
2010).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="3-2">
        <title>3.2. Stress reduction</title>
        <p>Experience has shown that trained animals consistently
voluntarily participate in veterinary and research
procedures, and are less stressed while doing so (Lambeth et al.,
2006; Reinhardt et al., 1990; Turkkan, 1990). Training
laboratory animals to cooperate reduces the need for physical
restraint and/or anesthesia, and thus reduces the stress
that accompanies those procedures. Evidence for stress
reduction includes reductions in cortisol levels,
stressrelated abortions, physical resistance to handling, and fear
responses such as fear-grinning, screaming, and acute
diarrhea (Clay et al., 2009; Moseley and Davis, 1989; Reinhardt
et al., 1990; Vertein and Reinhardt, 1989). Chimpanzees
who voluntarily presented for injection of an anesthetic
agent had significantly reduced physiological measures
of stress when compared to those who did not
cooperate and were anesthetized via chemical darts (Lambeth
et al., 2006). These results were supported by within and
between subjects’ comparisons. A study evaluating the
effect of PRT on cortisol, hematology and cardiovascular
measures in cynomolgus macaques found subjects exposed
to daily PRT sessions showed decreased measures of stress
compared to those not exposed to PRT (Koban et al.,
2005).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="3-3">
        <title>3.3. Increase the efficiency of working with primates</title>
        <p>Although animal training requires an initial time
investment, it can lead to a savings in the personnel time required
for some tasks over the long-term. Many procedures, such
as moving primates within their enclosures for cleaning,
transporting them between enclosures and collecting
biological samples, can be completed much faster once the
primates have been trained. McKinley et al. (2003) reported
saving 91% of the time required to weigh a marmoset by
training them to target at the front of the cage and climb
onto the scale (174.25 s reduced to 159.5 s). Veeder et al.
(2009) trained a group of mangabeys to move from one area
of the enclosure to another for cleaning, saving 46 min a day
of animal care staff time. The total training time required
was recouped in fewer than 35 days. PRT also improves the
ability to collect samples without requiring anesthesia or
social separation. Stone et al. (1994) quickly and reliably
obtained urine samples from chimpanzees without
necessitating social isolation, and Kelley and Bramblett (1981)
had similar results with a group of vervet monkeys.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="3-4">
        <title>3.4. Improve veterinary care and research</title>
        <p>Training facilitates veterinary care by improving the
ability to conduct procedures, and observe animals more
closely and more frequently without the use of anesthesia
or restraint. Primates voluntarily participate in procedures
such as conscious blood collection (Coleman et al., 2008;
Laule et al., 1996), urine collection (Laule et al., 1996;
Perlman et al., 2010; Stone et al., 1994), subcutaneous
injections (Perlman et al., 2004; Schapiro et al., 2005), and
voluntary intramuscular injections for anesthesia,
antibiotics or vaccines (Lambeth et al., 2006; Schapiro et al., 2005;
Videan et al., 2005).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="3-5">
        <title>3.5. Provide opportunities for choice and control</title>
        <p>PRT enables animals to learn about the consequences
of their actions and it relies on their voluntary
participation (Bassett and Buchanan-Smith, 2007). If there are
welfare benefits to training that are above and beyond
the benefits of having animals conditioned to calmly and
efficiently comply with various husbandry, research and
veterinary needs, then this is another reason to invest time
and resources into animal training programs. The data on
primates indicate that experience with controllable events
fosters exploration, enhances performance on cognitive
tasks, and may attenuate stress reactivity (Hanson et al.,
1976; Mineka et al., 1986; Roma et al., 2006; Washburn
et al., 1991). These are positive contributions to
psychological well-being (Novak and Suomi, 1988) and PRT may
provide similar benefits to well-being by stimulating
activity that offers primates choice and control over some
aspects of their environment.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="3-6">
        <title>3.6. Enhance social housing There are challenges with managing social groups of primates that can be addressed through PRT techniques. One particularly useful technique, known as cooperative</title>
        <p>feeding (Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Whittaker, 2005)
involves reinforcing the dominant individual for allowing
subordinate group members to have desirable resources
such as food, enrichment, or attention from a caregiver.
This technique can reduce fighting during meal times
(Bloomsmith et al., 1994). To further enhance
socialization, primates can be taught to tolerate proximity to
one another, and to touch each other gently (Cox, 1987;
Desmond et al., 1987; Schapiro et al., 2001). This type of
training has potential to benefit the process of introducing
unfamiliar primates to one another (Laule and Desmond,
1990). A more advanced technique, collaborative
training, involves training animals to work together toward a
common goal by rewarding their mutual efforts (i.e. two
individuals are rewarded for working together to move
an object). The use of collaborative training to
purposefully create social ties may also enhance social relationships
(Laule and Whittaker, 2007).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="3-7">
        <title>3.7. Address behavioral problems</title>
        <p>Scientists have evaluated PRT’s impact on behavioral
problems to determine whether it can reduce, eliminate
or prevent the expression of problematic behaviors, and
whether these treatment effects generalize to the
primates’ overall behavioral repertoire (Baker et al., 2010;
Bloomsmith et al., 2007).</p>
        <sec id="3-7-1">
          <title>3.7.1. Stereotyped behavior</title>
          <p>Training can reduce stereotyped behavior (behavior
that is repetitive, invariant and seems to be without
function, such as pacing or repeated flipping, Mason, 1999)
during the period of time the trainer is working with the
primates (Bloomsmith et al., 1997; Morgan et al., 1993).
However there are conflicting findings as to whether PRT
has a generalized effect on abnormal behavior of
primates outside of training sessions: two studies showed no
such generalization (Baker et al., 2009; Bloomsmith et al.,
1997), while three other studies did show a generalized
decrease in stereotypies when the trainer was not present
(Bourgeois and Brent, 2005; Coleman and Maier, 2010;
Pomerantz and Terkel, 2009). Training behaviors that are
incompatible with the stereotyped behavior may be an
effective therapy (e.g., reinforcement for remaining still,
for subjects that were pacing) (Bourgeois and Brent, 2005).
PRT may help to prevent the development of stereotyped
behavior, as has been found with young nursery-reared
rhesus monkeys (Brunelli et al., 2009). Combining PRT with
other treatment approaches (social group manipulations,
drug therapy) reduced the extreme stereotyped behavior
in a male bonobo (Prosen and Bell, 2000). While there does
seem to be promise in using PRT as a treatment and
perhaps even as a preventative measure, it is important to note
that in no studies did the training eliminate stereotyped
behaviors.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="3-7-2">
          <title>3.7.2. Self-injurious behavior (SIB)</title>
          <p>Several studies have evaluated whether SIB can be
modified through training. A chimpanzee exhibiting SIB
was successfully treated with a combination of therapies
including enrichment, socialization, drug therapy and PRT
(Bourgeois et al., 2007). Staff avoided the chimpanzee when
he was exhibiting behaviors associated with his SIB, he
was trained to perform an incompatible behavior, and he
was desensitized to arousing stimuli. In combination with
intensive enrichment, socialization changes and drug
therapy, the training significantly reduced his SIB for several
years (S. Bourgeois, pers. comm.). A similar combination
approach was used by Prosen and Bell (2000) with a bonobo
who exhibited a great deal of SIB, and it was very successful
in reducing his SIB.</p>
          <p>In another study, SIB in a baboon was reduced using
a functional analysis (FA) technique (Dorey et al., 2009).
FA is an assessment technique used in humans to treat
behavioral problems by systematically identifying what
is reinforcing a specific behavior, and then manipulating
that reinforcement. Since the FA revealed the SIB was
positively reinforced by human attention, during treatment SIB
was ignored by staff, and the behavior decreased. This FA
approach, while time intensive, shows promise in the
treatment of some behavioral problems in nonhuman primates.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="3-7-3">
          <title>3.7.3. Fear and aggression</title>
          <p>Fearful behavior in singly housed laboratory primates
has been successfully treated with PRT. Individuals who
showed fear responses to specific, routine husbandry tasks
(e.g. removing food from a cage, spraying water from a
hose) were desensitized to these experiences, and they
displayed significantly less fearful responses than those study
animals given additional time to acclimate to their
environment, or those who underwent basic husbandry training
(Clay et al., 2009). A recent study using PRT techniques
to reduce rhesus macaque aggression toward humans was
effective in reducing the behavior during and outside of
training sessions (Minier et al., 2011).</p>

          <title>3.7.4. Feces throwing</title>
          <p>A FA approach was used to assess feces throwing by
a chimpanzee, and confirmed that human attention was
reinforcing this behavior (Martin et al., 2011). The
subject was trained to touch a specific target, or a “functional
communication tool” which served as a request for the
human caregiver to give positive attention to the
chimpanzee which reduced the undesirable behavior by about
80%. This effect generalized in the presence of unfamiliar
people.</p>

      <title>4. Status of training programs at National Primate</title>
      <p>A survey was conducted in 2009 in an effort to assess
the state of PRT programs within National Primate
Research Centers (these are large, specialized primate
facilities supported by National Institutes of Health [NIH]
to conduct biomedical and behavioral research) in the
United States of America. The survey consisted of 28
questions in four sections and basic terminology was defined
within the survey (see Appendix). The survey respondents
included the eight National Primate Research Centers
(NPRCs) and one NIH facility (henceforth “facilities”). The
survey was compiled by two of this paper’s authors, BM
and DEM. Answers to survey questions were completed

the number of responses for each question is indicated in
the information below.</p>
      <sec id="4-1">
        <title>4.1. Survey summary, animal training programs</title>
        <p>Of the nine reporting facilities, all indicated that they
trained both singly and socially housed primates. Four had
formalized or documented animal training programs, and
five reported they were in the process of formalizing an
animal training program, but that resources such as staff time
(three of five), funding (two of five), and qualified staff (two
of five) were impeding the implementation. All nine
facilities reported animal training programs had been, or were
being initiated by the behavior management units, with
animal care and husbandry (two of nine) and research and
investigation (one of nine) also reported as training
program initiators. The respondents reported that their animal
training programs were created to assist research
personnel (eight), animal care and husbandry personnel (seven),
and both behavior management and veterinary care
personnel (six).</p>
        <p>Two methods were identified as the most effective for
garnering institutional support for animal training
programs (five of eight responding facilities): a presentation
using slides or video; and beginning training with a small
number of animals (see Table 1). This suggests that
demonstration via visual examples of animal training piques staff
interest and that small, pilot training projects are effective
in gaining institutional support.</p>
        <p>Three of five responding facilities agreed that having
full-time staffing was a benefit to formalizing their animal
training program, and two others stated either that it would
have been easier to start with full-time staff, or that they
never had full-time training staff and believe this is why
the animal training program has not been fully engaged.
In total, five full-time (four within a behavior
management program and one in a hybrid behavior management
and animal care position) and 26 part-time trainers (11
within behavior management programs, 5 within animal
care programs, 10 in other programs) were employed in the
facilities. This suggests a growing trend in animal training
expertise and implementation. The majority of
formalized animal training is conducted by behavior management
staff, followed by research staff and animal care and
husbandry staff, who are reported to train about the same
number of primates.</p>
        <p>Five of the nine facilities reported the ways in which
their training programs are managed (see Table 2). The
remaining four facilities noted a combination of these
components is in development or they are managing animal
training on an animal-by-animal or as-needed basis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="4-2">
        <title>4.2. Survey summary, behaviors and techniques</title>
        <p>Despite most facilities maintaining animal numbers
in the thousands, and increased resources being directed
toward the development of training programs, relatively
few animals were reported as being trained in formalized
programs (Fig. 1). This finding probably is due to the early
stage of development of many of the training programs.</p>
        <p>All facilities indicated the use of shaping by
approximations as a PRT method, six facilities used both
active desensitization and cooperative/collaborative
training methods (see Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Reinhardt,
2003; Schapiro et al., 2001; Wilson and Davison, 1971 for
description of the methods), and four facilities used
contraaggression training for human-directed aggression (see
Bloomsmith et al., 1994; Clay et al., 2009; Minier et al., 2011
for description of the method). PRT was used to train all of
the specific husbandry and research behaviors described in</p>
        <p>Response % and count (N = 5)
Fig. 1. In the National Primate Research Center survey, relatively few animals are reported as receiving training in formalized programs despite the large
number housed at each facility.</p>
        <p>Table 3, and negative reinforcement training (NRT) was also
applied for some behaviors. Punishment methods were not
used to train animals at any facility.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="4-3">
        <title>4.3. Survey summary, benefits and current constraints</title>
        <p>Constraints on the formalization of training programs
were reported and may be based on real or perceived
concerns. Monetary expense was reported as the highest
concern (see Table 4). Half of the facilities listed concerns
about increased staff injury, research interference, and
decreased quality of animal care due to time spent
training, and non-generalization of training to other staff. When
asked to list the most beneficial part of having PRT
programs at their facility, five of the seven responding facilities
reported increased efficiency in animal care, increased
efficiency in veterinary care, and increased animal well-being
(Table 5). The prevalence of training benefits and concerns
may be associated with the low number of formal training
programs (44% of NPRC’s) and the short time frame most
programs have been in existence. These program
components can be carefully and thoroughly addressed by each
facility by assessing the animal training program (see
Section 5).</p>
        <p>Even with concerns about training, there is
increasing attention toward animal training programs within
the greater laboratory animal community. Three of four
responding facilities reported that animal training was a
topic of discussion in the last 5 years during inspections and
accreditation visits including: IACUC who oversee and
evaluate all aspects of animal care; Association for Assessment
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)
International who manage a voluntary accreditation and
assessment program; and United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA), who inspect facilities housing animals
to enforce USDA regulations, the Animal Welfare Act, and
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(2011). Two facilities reported discussions about animal
training during recent Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare
(OLAW) or National Institutes of Health (NIH) site visits.</p>

      <title>5. Elements of a training program</title>
      <p>The most effective primate training program will be
one that includes clearly defined training goals,
accountability, assessment and refinement of training effort, and
continuing education for staff. Many of these programmatic
recommendations are also described in other published
papers (Colahan and Breder, 2003; Prescott et al., 2005;
Young and Cipreste, 2004).</p>
      <sec id="5-1">
        <title>5.1. Safety</title>
        <p>Fundamental to any animal training program is human
and animal safety (Colahan and Breder, 2003; but see
Young and Cipreste, 2004 for examples of safety features
within a training program). People have good reason to
be concerned for their safety when working with primates
since they are unpredictable, strong, and capable of
inflicting great harm. Depending on the species and zoonotic
disease risk, personal protective equipment (PPE) such as
gloves, cover clothing, a mask and eye protection may
be necessary. Training can be accomplished with
trainers wearing such PPE, and facility policies for PPE should
always be followed while training primates. Trainers must
be aware of their own positioning near the enclosure when
training, and should know how far an animal can reach
out, being conscious of whether social companions are
nearby and may try to grab the trainer. Understanding
species-typical behavior, specifically fearful behavior, can
help reduce the risk of trainer-directed aggression. Safety
can be enhanced through the use of engineering controls
and safety apparatus such as an enclosed “blood sleeve”
which allows animals to present arms or legs safely outside
of the cage for conscious blood collection, while
decreasing the opportunity for the primate to grab the trainer
(Coleman et al., 2008). Targets are used to position
primates with their hands in view or holding a peg that falls
if the animal lets go; these tools enhance trainer safety
when working in close proximity to primates. If food
reinforcers are offered to the primate by hand, precautions to
reduce the trainers risk of being bitten or grabbed need
to be taken. Two examples include delivering the food at
a distance using a bottle to squirt juice directly into the
primate’s mouth, or placing a receptacle on the cage front
where food can be safely deposited by the trainer and then
retrieved by the animal.</p>
        <p>There is a need for the safety of training programs to
be tested. The survey of the NPRCs showed that half of
the respondents reported safety concerns at their
facilities, however about half of the behavioral managers
reported increased staff safety as a benefit of a training
program. These conflicting perspectives highlight the need for
assessments of animal training programs with regard to
personnel safety. Environmental Health and Safety offices
and similar programs present in many institutions serve
to address safety in the working environment. These
programs may have the means to evaluate the safety of training
tools and techniques used within animal training
programs.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="5-2">
        <title>5.2. Integration of PRT into research objectives</title>
        <p>Nearly half of the NPRC’s listed that animal training
was a research interference concern and 38% of
respondents listed increased animal stress-related behavior as a
concern. Researchers and behavioral managers can work
together to establish guidelines for incorporating PRT
into protocols. PRT, when applied properly, desensitizes
subjects to potentially stressful elements of research
procedures. At the Yerkes National Primate Research Center
(YNPRC), the behavioral management scientist reviews
IACUC protocols and may suggest or require incorporating
PRT techniques to prepare subjects for aspects of the study
(McMillan et al., 2007).</p>
        <p>In a research setting, time constraints can influence
what training is accomplished. Researchers usually do not
budget for subject costs in advance of beginning study
procedures, but this may be necessary to have the time to
train subjects to cooperate with study procedures. A greater
commitment to PRT requires considering costs and
logistics associated with pre-study animal arrangements, such
as acquiring animals ahead of the onset of the study,
initiating training while animals are in quarantine, and ensuring
appropriate staff expertise. In some cases vendors may be
able to provide primates that have received some level of
training or conditioning which may then expedite the
animal training process for specific research procedures. All
should be considered when planning research studies and
writing grant proposals to support research.</p>
        <p>The selection of subjects for some studies may be
aided with the involvement of behavioral management
staff members. At the Oregon NPRC, monkey temperament
characteristics have been useful in identifying animals who
are more responsive to PRT than others, and thus may
be more suitable subjects for particular studies (Coleman
et al., 2005). At the California NPRC the animal record
keeping system indicates if an animal is trained or in the process
of being trained for a behavior. The Behavioral
Management group can be contacted to get specific information
about the training.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="5-3">
        <title>5.3. Continuing education</title>
        <p>There are many opportunities available to those
in the laboratory animal community to broaden
animal training knowledge. There are numerous books,
articles, internet discussion forums, and websites on
animal training (see Laule and Whittaker, 2001; see
also Prescott et al., 2005; Pryor, 2002; Ramirez, 1999).
Workshops such as the “Primate Training and
Enrichment Workshop” (http://ptew.kccmr.org/) are available
and conferences, including International Marine
Animal Trainers’ Association (IMATA) (http://www.imata.org)
and the Animal Behavior Management Alliance (ABMA)
(http://www.theabma.org/), focus mostly on training.
Animal training consultants can be useful resources.
Additional continuing education opportunities that can be
supported within the institution include journal clubs,
interest groups, an animal training committee, and
lectures to hear invited speakers with expertise in behavior
management and animal training. If the primate
laboratory employs an animal training specialist, this person can
conduct PRT workshops, lectures, and practical learning
opportunities for individuals working with nonhuman
primates. The Joint Working Group on Refinement (2009)
recommends learning outcomes for staff training of
familiarity with behavior and how to interact with the relevant
species in a positive way.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="5-4">
        <title>5.4. Documentation and record keeping</title>
        <p>Documentation is an important component of
formalized training programs (Prescott et al., 2005; Young
and Cipreste, 2004). Communication of institutional or
programmatic training goals, training applications and
expectations, and providing opportunities for consistency
and communication among trainers and staff who will be
maintaining any trained behaviors are vital in the success
of a training program. In general there should be some
record of: (a) which animals have been taught what
behaviors; (b) the approach used for their training; (c) the cues
used; (d) the animal’s expected behavioral response to the
cue; and (e) some measure of the animal’s consistency in
responding.</p>
        <p>Shaping plans, established training protocols, and
training documentation sheets are used to record and review
training progress. Training documentation sheets should
include data such as number and duration of sessions,
shaping plan steps trained during a session, and the
animal’s response. These data assists trainers in summarizing
training progress and identifying problems. Training
documentation improves communication, which is especially
important if multiple trainers work with an individual
animal.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="5-5">
        <title>5.5. Encouraging consistency and transfer of trained</title>
        <p>Most primates in laboratories work with several
people on a daily basis, and they are often trained by multiple
people. Documentation of universal cues and expected
responses can help increase training consistency across
multiple individuals. For each behavior there should be the
verbal cue, photograph and description of the
corresponding visual cue (see Fig. 2a) and a photograph and description
of the animals expected behavioral response (see Fig. 2b).
If all animals are trained using the same cues and all
trainers train a behavior to look a specific way, inconsistency
is minimized. For example, see Minier et al. (2011) for an
assessment of PRT progress using single and multiple
trainers to reduce human-directed aggression.</p>
        <p>There is often concern over whether primates trained
by one individual will perform the same behavior for
others, and dealing with this “transfer” of trained behaviors
Fig. 2. (a) and (b) shows the “hand” behavior. The trainee presents left
hand. (a) Universal cue: verbal cue; “Hand”. Corresponding visual cue;
trainer’s right hand held flat with fingers and palm parallel to floor. Hand

between trainers is important. In one model, the primary
trainer is responsible for initial training, following a
shaping plan and documenting training sessions. Once the
primate is performing the behavior reliably (e.g., four out
of five times asked) the behavior is considered trained. At
this point, the trained behavior may be transferred from
the primary trainer to the secondary trainer who will then
be responsible for maintaining the behavior at the same
criterion. At least one study has shown that primates’
performance can be sustained through this transfer process
(Bloomsmith et al., 1998). Not everyone will become a
good primary trainer, but everyone working with primates
should learn the basic principles of animal training and
apply them effectively to maintain trained behaviors.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="5-6">
        <title>5.6. Evaluation of training program</title>
        <p>The evaluation of animal training programs is
recommended to assess whether the program is meeting
the needs of the animals, and set goals for husbandry,
veterinary care, and research. Individuals implementing
the training should also be assessed regularly for
technique, consistency and progress. Regular meetings among
staff who are planning and implementing the training are
encouraged so progress can be highlighted, and challenges
can be discussed and addressed.</p>

      <title>6. Identifying and minimizing negative</title>
      <p>reinforcement training (NRT) methods</p>
      <p>NRT is widely used in primate facilities (NPRC survey
described above; Prescott and Buchanan-Smith, 2007) and
its use needs to be thoughtfully addressed. Common types
of NRT include:
1. using the squeeze back to move an animal to the cage
front for an injection or treatment;
2. loud voices, clapping or tapping on the cage, threatening
with a net or leather gloves to move an animal from one
location to another;
3. a person entering an enclosure to get an animal to move
away from that person and into a transport box or
tunnel;
4. spraying water behind an animal to encourage
movement from one location to another; and
5. threatening with a dart gun to get an animal to present
for an injection.</p>
      <p>Often people using these techniques do not recognize
them as negative reinforcement, but this recognition is an
important step in trying to minimize its use.</p>
      <p>To date there is no published literature comparing PRT
and NRT techniques on the behavior or well-being of
primates, but there is some literature on other species.
Differences have been found in equine behavior and
physiology based on training techniques employed. Horses
trained with PRT exhibited more exploratory behavior and
participated more in training sessions than those trained
with NRT. A higher heart rate in the PRT group in the later
stages of training was considered a positive physiological
response linked to increased motivation to participate and
anticipation of food rewards (Innes and McBride, 2008).
Comparing horses trained only with NRT to those trained
with a blended approach of NRT followed by PRT showed
those in the latter group expressed behaviors and body
postures indicating improved welfare (Warren-Smith and
McGreevy, 2007). Given the widespread application of NRT
in primate facilities similar assessments should be
conducted with nonhuman primates to understand the impact
on welfare measures.</p>
      <p>There are significant challenges to moving from a
NRT-based system toward a more PRT-based program for
laboratory primates. The large numbers of animals to
provide PRT to, limitations due to research protocols, and rigid
schedules and feeding times may make a move toward
a more PRT-based program difficult. Rotating staff, staff
turnover or resistance to a new system may further
complicate the process of moving to a more PRT-based program.
Of significant importance is the fact that the effective use
of PRT is a skill that takes time and effort to develop.
However, given the known benefits of PRT, we suggest that
modern laboratory primate training programs should have
the objective of using as little NRT as possible, moving
toward eliminating its use and replacing it with positive
reinforcement.</p>
      <p>When PRT is not currently practical as the sole approach
to all needed animal training, careful consideration should
be given to how a combination of PRT and NRT might be
implemented. Even in a system that will use NRT,
animals should first be given the chance to cooperate before
any aversive stimulus is presented and all staff should use
clear and consistent cues. If it is necessary to use the
aversive stimulus, the mildest negative reinforcement that is
effective for an individual animal should be applied. For
example, to move an animal to the front of a cage, instead
of bringing the squeeze back wall all the way forward as
the first step, begin by tapping on the latches that release
the squeeze. If the subject does not respond, unlatch the
latches. If still no response, move the squeeze wall a small
way toward the subject, and so on. When the animal does
the correct behavior, immediately provide a reward, and
remove the aversive stimulus. The animal may not accept
the reward when they are uncomfortable or feel
threatened, but trainers should continue to offer it. Over time,
the animal may become more comfortable, and take the
food reward. Patience needs to be exercised as the primates
learn to live in a new system.</p>
      <p>Other steps toward emphasizing PRT include planning
ahead and preparing animals in advance of veterinary
procedures and research protocols by training individuals to
cooperate with some or all aspects of these procedures.
Even if animals can only be trained to cooperate with some
components of a procedure (e.g., blood collection from the
earlobe can begin with rewarding the subject for
approaching the front of the cage and presenting the ear; subjects
can be desensitized to the equipment used, such as needles
and alcohol swabs), this is better than using no training at
all.</p>
      <p>Another step in minimizing NRT and emphasizing PRT is
to start with small projects that have a high chance of
success. This helps staff develop confidence and demonstrates
the efficacy of PRT. Some important steps to take to make
this shift include:</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="7">
      <title>1. Identify staff roles and responsibilities by determining who will be the primary trainers responsible for training new behaviors from start to finish.</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="8">
      <title>2. Determine what tools and equipment are necessary to</title>
      <p>complete training tasks, and acquire them.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="9">
      <title>3. While it may not be possible to exclusively use PRT,</title>
      <p>every effort should be made to move in that direction.
As a working principle, positive alternatives should be
exhausted before any kind of NRT is employed.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="10">
      <title>4. When NRT is necessary, it should be kept to a minimum</title>
      <p>and balanced by delivering positive reinforcement the
majority of the time.</p>
      <p>When moving away from a NRT-based system to a more
PRT-based system, two important steps are to determine
the current status of training practices, and to assess the
interactions between primates and humans working with
them. The following questions should be answered:</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="11">
      <title>1. How are animals moved between enclosures, into trans</title>
      <p>fer boxes, etc.? Does this process use NRT, PRT, a
combination, or are inconsistent approaches used?</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="12">
      <title>2. How do animals respond to daily husbandry practices? Are they cooperative, fearful, or is their response staffdependent?</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="13">
      <title>3. What types of restrictions exist for the animals on the study protocols? Are the animals on a restricted food and/or liquid diet? Is there more than one laboratory working with the same animals?</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="14">
      <title>4. What animal behavior problems exist for husbandry, veterinary, and research staff? Are animals noncooperative, aggressive or fearful?</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="15">
      <title>5. With what frequency and intensity do the above prob</title>
      <p>lems occur?</p>
      <p>Finally, assess the daily, weekly, and as-needed
interactions between an animal and various staff members
(husbandry, veterinary, and research). When this
information is compiled, the results can be surprising. Often
staff may think PRT is used because a treat is provided
to the animal following a procedure. However upon
further investigation, one learns that the animal ‘cooperates’
to avoid something (net, squeeze back, etc.) rather than just
to earn the treat. Conducting observations of practices may
reveal undesirable or abnormal behaviors exhibited by the
animals around the time of these procedures. A thorough
assessment of current practices will provide a good
platform upon which to begin the development of a PRT-based
management system.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="16">
      <title>7. Yerkes National Primate Research Center’s</title>
      <p>As an example of one primate institution’s approach to
developing an animal training program, the evolution of
the program at the Yerkes National Primate Research
Center (YNPRC) will be described. YNPRC houses nearly 3400
nonhuman primates in two locations in a variety of
settings from groups living in corrals and runs, to individuals
living in pairs and singly in cages. These animals are used
in the Center’s research studies on topics such as cognition
and behavior, vaccine development and disease
progression. The Division of Animal Resources is responsible for
the care and well-being of the nonhuman primates and
numerous principal investigators and laboratory personnel
conduct the behavioral and biomedical research.</p>
      <p>Prior to 2005, Yerkes had accomplished animal training
through numerous project-based approaches, often driven
by research laboratories to meet research objectives, and
through section-wide approaches (e.g., the chimpanzee
section began doing some training with most of the
animals). A training consultant was used in some situations.</p>
      <p>The result was training success for a limited number of
animals, but with little consistency in training methods among
people in the various laboratories or across the many
animal housing areas. This approach had weaknesses. For
example, a chimpanzee may have been trained to
cooperate with an injection by research personnel, but the
behavior was not always transferred to veterinary staff so
that they could successfully inject that same chimpanzee
by voluntary means. Because trainers were working
independently, there was no consistency or communication
regarding the cues used for training specific behaviors,
no centralized documentation of training progress, and no
way to track what behaviors a certain primate had learned.</p>
      <p>In 2005, Yerkes adopted a facility-wide approach. Efforts
to raise the program to this level included hiring a full-time
primate training specialist (PTS), establishing an animal
training committee, and setting training goals that included
all species of primates housed at Yerkes, and included
primates who live in indoor cages, as well as those housed in
small and large groups. The animal training program
originates in the Behavioral Management Unit. The PTS is jointly
supervised by the Behavior Management and Animal Care
Units, which emphasizes the importance of training to
both units. The position is a resource to all Yerkes
departments that use primates. This position requires an animal
training background, familiarity with operant
conditioning theory and practice, strong problem solving skills, and
strong interpersonal communication skills. The success of
a training program relies heavily on selecting an individual
with a calm demeanor, patience, consistency, and an ability
to analyze one’s own behavior (Prescott et al., 2005; Young
and Cipreste, 2004).</p>
      <p>The PTS trains people much more often than she trains
nonhuman primates, and this is an important element in a
large primate facility, since one person would only be able
to work with a small fraction of the animals that should be
trained. The PTS responsibilities include educating staff and
faculty about the Yerkes’ animal training program, teaching
operant conditioning terminology and techniques through
seminars and hands-on instruction, serving as an internal
consultant to assist in developing animal training plans,
and assessing progress on training goals. Some training
consultations between the PTS and principle investigators
conducting research are recommended through the IACUC
protocol review process. Depending on the need, the
consultation may entail a review of existing animal training
plans, recommendations for incorporating specific
training methods, and discussion about how the study or study
subjects could benefit from animal training.</p>
      <p>Another component to the training program is the
Animal Training Committee comprised of people from
Behavioral Management, Veterinary Medicine, Animal
Care, Colony Management, Occupational Health and Safety,
and research laboratories. This inclusive, team approach is
consistent with recommendations by others (Prescott et al.,
2005; Prescott and Buchanan-Smith, 2007). The Animal
Training Committee has been responsible for developing
these major advances:
(1) Establishing training goals for the entire Center.
Drawing on the broad composition and training needs of
committee members, three training goals that impact
the majority of departments working directly with
the primates were established: movement of animals,
present for injection and conscious blood collection.
(2) Developing an institutional training philosophy (see</p>
      <p>Fig. 3). This serves to communicate to the Yerkes
community a rationale for, and expectations of the animal
Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Animal Training Philosophy
Training is an animal management tool that facilitates good animal care by promoting animal socialization, enhancing cognitive stimulation, and
decreasing stress. Training also facilitates the conduct of research protocols and facilitates veterinary care of animals. The philosophy of the
animal training program at Yerkes is to enhance the well-being of monkeys and apes by maximizing the use of positive reinforcement training.
Other training methods are also appropriately used in some situations.</p>
      <p>There are a number of elements to consider as Yerkes personnel work to achieve our training goal.
1. Safety comes first in any training program, including the safety of the animals and the trainers. We use equipment and procedures geared
toward enhancing safety.
2. Educating employees is critical. This includes making sure they understand the correct uses of positive reinforcement training and the
acceptable application and context in which negative reinforcement may be used. Negative reinforcement should be followed with positive
reinforcement when possible. Staff members involved in training are expected to understand the goals of the program, training terminology and
the appropriate use of positive and negative reinforcement methods.
3. Good record keeping is part of a successful training program. This includes written “shaping plans” for all behaviors, and documentation that
tracks of training sessions. The center’s Primate Training Specialist routinely will review and evaluate training documentation.
4. Evaluation of the training program also will include a quantitative assessment of data (some collected through the documentation system) that
will help answer specific questions about the value of training. As appropriate, some of these evaluation projects will be published.
5. To achieve a "facility-wide" training program we will increase training consistency across Yerkes by offering training classes, using consistent
“shaping plans” and employing a centralized documentation system. Success will be noted when animals trained for certain behaviors
successfully perform those behaviors for each appropriate staff member.</p>

training program, and the commitment of the Center to
enhancing care for nonhuman primates.
(3) Determining the basic training information provided
to all new employees working with primates (included
in orientation packets). All staff members are informed
of the scope, function, availability and services of the
animal training program.
(4) Developing a plan to identify staff members that need
to understand training. The “All Staff Training Plan” was
developed to educate all faculty and staff working with
primates about animal training, the services provided
by the PTS, and goals of the animal training program.</p>
      <p>The Director of Yerkes strongly encouraged principal
investigators, veterinarians, supervisors, and
laboratory managers to be involved. This level of commitment
and dedication from the very top of the administration
was integral in the promotion and continued support
of the animal training program.</p>
      <p>Results of this comprehensive training program are
many. With a core group of Animal Care staff familiar with
training, daily training for husbandry can be implemented
(McMillan et al., 2007). Husbandry training objectives
include training primates to voluntarily enter transport
boxes and to shift between areas within home enclosures
(McMillan et al., 2009; Veeder et al., 2009). The
majority of the PTS’s consultations with research laboratories
have focused on pole and collar training, chair restraint
training (McMillan et al., 2010), and biological specimen
collection (e.g., blood, urine, semen) (Perlman et al., 2010).</p>
      <p>Other behaviors and animal management issues addressed
have included present for injection, desensitization to
fearprovoking stimuli (Clay et al., 2009), training to decrease
human-directed aggression (Martin et al., 2011), improving
research testing performance, training to decrease
abnormal behavior (Baker et al., 2010), and training to enhance
socialization. The facility-wide approach has enhanced
communication and function between those in various
departments working with the same primates.</p>

      <title>8. Summary</title>
      <p>This paper presents a framework for categorizing the
structure of animal training programs for both existing and
planned programs. The program structure should be
developed around the animal care needs and the goals of the
facility. A structure that works for one facility may not be a
good fit for another. Assessments of PRT on husbandry (e.g.,
moving animals), behavior problems (e.g., fear, self injury,
undesirable behavior), and veterinary and experimental
procedures (e.g., present for injection and blood collection)
shows that animals trained with PRT have enhanced
welfare. Currently, about half of the NPRCs in the United States
of America have formalized animal training programs,
and the others are in various stages of creating animal
training programs. It is recommended that more primate
facilities develop formalized animal training programs
emphasizing PRT to continue to meet and exceed
