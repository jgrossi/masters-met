      <abstract>
        <p>Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (d13C and d15N) have been used widely in archaeology to investigate palaeodiet. Sulphur stable isotope ratios (d34S) have shown great promise in this regard but the potential of this technique within archaeological science has yet to be fully explored. Here we report d34S, d13C and d15N values for 129 samples of animal bone collagen from Sku´ tustaðir, an early Viking age (landna´ m) settlement in north-east Iceland. This dataset represents the most comprehensive study to date of its kind on archaeological material and the results show a clear offset in d34S values between animals deriving their dietary resources from terrestrial (mean = +5.6 ± 2.8&amp;), freshwater (mean = 2.7 ± 1.4&amp;) or marine (mean = +15.9 ± 1.5&amp;) reservoirs (with the three food groups being significantly different at 2r). This offset allows reconstruction of the dietary history of domesticated herbivores and demonstrates differences in husbandry practices and animal movement/trade, which would be otherwise impossible using only d13C and d15N values. For example, several terrestrial herbivores displayed enriched bone collagen d34S values compared to the geology of the Lake My´ vatn region, indicating they may have been affected by sea-spray whilst being pastured closer to the coast, before being traded inland. Additionally, the combination of heavy d15N values coupled with light d34S values within pig bone collagen suggests that these omnivores were consuming freshwater fish as a significant portion of their diet. Arctic foxes were also found to be consuming large quantities of freshwater resources and radiocarbon dating of both the pigs and foxes confirmed previous studies showing that a large freshwater radiocarbon (14C) reservoir effect exists within the lake. Overall, these stable isotope and 14C data have important implications for obtaining a fuller reconstruction of the diets of the early Viking settlers in Iceland, and may allow a clearer identification of the marine and/or freshwater 14C reservoir effects that are known to exist in human bone collagen. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

      <title>1. INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Extensive controlled feeding studies of modern
terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have shown that that
diet can directly influence carbon (d13C) and nitrogen
(d15N) stable isotope values in the tissues of the consumer
(DeNiro and Epstein, 1978, 1981). Archaeologists were
very quick to exploit this theory and stable isotope analysis
of preserved bone collagen is now routinely utilised in
palaeodietary reconstruction studies, providing archaeologists
with a detailed insight into prehistoric diet (Van der Merwe
and Vogel, 1978; Tauber, 1981; Schoeninger et al., 1983).</p>
      <p>Recent advances in continuous-flow isotope-ratio mass
spectrometry (CF-IRMS) have allowed sulphur isotopes
(d34S) to be measured from organic and inorganic materials
(Giesemann et al., 1994; Fry et al., 1996; Grassineau et al.,
2001; Yun et al., 2005; Fritzsche and Tichomirowa, 2006;
Grassineau, 2006; Fry, 2007; Hansen et al., 2009) and over
the past decade there has been a marked increase in the use
of sulphur isotopes in conjunction with carbon and
nitrogen isotopes to aid our understanding of the diet and
movement of prehistoric animals and humans (Macko et al.,
1999; Richards et al., 2001, 2003; Hu et al., 2009; Vika,
2009; Craig et al., 2010; Howcroft et al., 2012; Nehlich
et al., 2012; Oelze et al., 2012a,b). Sulphur isotopes have
also been exploited to explore the variability in
terrestrial, marine- and freshwater-based diets (Craig et al., 2006;
Privat et al., 2007; Nehlich et al., 2010, 2011; Lamb et al.,
2012), have been used as indicators of environmental
changes (Wadleigh, 2003; Newton and Bottrell, 2007; Yun
et al., 2010) and are regularly utilised in food authentication
studies (Bahar et al., 2008; Rummel et al., 2010; Tanz and
Schmidt, 2010; Osorio et al., 2011).</p>
      <p>Previous findings from the Lake My´ vatn region of
north-east Iceland have demonstrated a significant overlap
between the d15N values of both modern and
archaeological-age terrestrial herbivore bone collagen and the d15N
values of modern and archaeological-age freshwater fish. d13C
values of freshwater biota were also found to be similar to
those of marine resources (Ascough et al., 2010), and
consequently, separation of herbivores, freshwater fish and
marine fish as components of human diet is difficult using
only d13C and d15N analyses. Likewise, complications were
encountered when human bone collagen samples from the
same region were radiocarbon (14C) dated, as the exact
proportion of freshwater and marine carbon consumed was
indeterminable, which prevented ages being corrected for
both marine and freshwater 14C reservoir effects (Ascough
et al., 2012). Freshwater and marine radiocarbon reservoir
effects (FRE and MRE, respectively) are 14C age offsets
between CO2 in the atmosphere and the freshwater or marine
carbon reservoirs. The MRE arises because of the extended
residence time of carbon in the global marine reservoir,
during which time radioactive decay of the 14C occurs. It has a
global average value of approximately 400 14C years for
surface waters and can be corrected for in order to produce
a truer calendar age range (Reimer et al., 2009). FREs are
brought about by the input of low 14C-activity carbon
(e.g. carbon from dissolution of geological carbonates or
from high temperature geothermal water–rock
interactions), or restriction of atmosphere-water CO2 exchange
(e.g. via density stratification or ice cover). Unlike the
MRE, a universal amendment cannot be implemented as
the magnitude of FREs is site dependent and can fluctuate
significantly (Ascough et al., 2011; Keaveney and Reimer,
2012).</p>
      <p>The purpose of this study was to utilise d34S stable
isotope measurements in animal and bird bone collagen from
remains found in midden deposits at a Viking farmstead on
Lake My´ vatn in an attempt to distinguish between
terrestrial, marine and freshwater dietary components. In turn,
this could allow the identification of terrestrial, freshwater
and marine components in the human diet. To date, this
is the first study of its kind to examine sulphur isotopes
in bone collagen from archaeological remains found in
Iceland. It is also the largest, single-site sulphur isotope study
to be undertaken, in which 129 bones of domesticated and
wild fauna from Sku´ tustaðir were analysed. These data
were produced, together with C and N stable isotope ratio
measurements and 14C age measurements, as part of a
multi-isotope approach, building on previous work to
reconstruct animal diet and human activity in the region
(Ascough et al., 2007, 2010, 2012).</p>

        <title>2.1. Geographical and historical information</title>
        <p>The animal bones analysed in this study were from
Sku´ tustaðir, an archaeological site to the south of Lake
My´ vatn (meaning “the lake of midges” in Icelandic) in
the north-eastern highlands of Iceland. Famed, as its name
suggests, for its abundant insect life, this shallow lake,
located 50 km inland and at an altitude of 277 m above
sea level (Fig. 1), is a sanctuary for breeding waterfowl
(Einarsson, 2004; Gardarsson, 2006). The region has been
documented as an area of major archaeological importance
with respect to the settlement of Viking communities during
the landna´ m from around AD 870 onwards (Ve´steinsson,
1998; McGovern et al., 2007; Einarsson and Aldred,
2011). Radiocarbon dating of terrestrial animal remains
and tephrochronological studies from various sites
surrounding Lake My´vatn have shown that settlers populated
the region from the late 9th century (McGovern et al., 2006,
2007). The presence of these inhabitants is thought to have
had a large environmental impact on the area, with the
introduction of grazing livestock and rapid deforestation
(Hallsdo´ ttir, 1987), leading to significant soil erosion
(Arnalds et al., 1997; Ve´steinsson et al., 2002; Dugmore et al.,
2005; Lawson et al., 2007).</p>

      <sec id="2-2">
        <title>2.2. Geology of the Lake My´ vatn area</title>
        <p>The area surrounding Lake My´vatn is volcanic in
nature, with igneous rocks of the tholeiitic series dominating
the landscape. The series is split into three subsections:
(1) basaltic rocks, which are most abundant, comprising
of picrite, olivine tholeiite and tholeiite; (2) intermediate
rocks which include icelandite and basaltic icelandite; and
(3) silicic rocks which include dacite and rhyolite
(JakobsFig. 1. Location of Sku´ tustaðir from which material was obtained for stable isotope (d13C, d15N and d34S) and radiocarbon (14C)
measurements.
son et al., 2008). Porous lava fields dominate the area,
leaving the surface characteristically devoid of water. The lake
has two major basins, Ytriflo´ i (north basin), which is fed by
hot springs from the Na´mafjall geothermal field, and
Syðriflo´ i (south basin), which is fed by cold springs along
its eastern shores (Kristmannsdo´ ttir and A´rmannsson,
2004). As groundwater springs supply most of Lake My´
vatn’s water and there is an absence of surface water in
the area for it to mix with, the chemical makeup of the
water entering the lake is very stable. Before draining into
the River Laxa´ in the west, the geothermal waters provide
Lake My´vatn with plentiful supplies of silica and sulphate,
whilst cooler waters deliver phosphate to the lake
(Kristmannsdo´ ttir and A´ rmannsson, 2004).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="2-3">
        <title>2.3. Isotope geochemistry of Iceland</title>
        <p>The lithosphere and hydrosphere store the majority of
the earth’s sulphur supplies, with sulphides in shale and
sulphates in evaporites exhibiting d34S values between 40&amp;
and +30&amp; (Claypool et al., 1980; Strauss, 1997) and
sulphate in marine water providing a very isotopically uniform
reservoir of d34S = +21&amp; (Rees et al., 1978). In coastal
regions, sulphur-containing particles can be propelled inland
in a process known as the sea-spray effect, causing soil d34S
values to be similar to that of seawater (Wadleigh et al.,
1994).</p>
        <p>Intensive weathering of igneous rocks causes leached
sulphides to filter into ground and stream water systems,
enabling plants to accumulate the oxidised sulphate form
in their roots. Oxidation of pyrite (FeS2) produces
negligible isotopic fractionation (Nakai and Jensen, 1964; Taylor
and Wheeler, 1984), whilst plant d34S values are on average
1.5&amp; depleted compared to their sulphate source (Trust
and Fry, 1992). Analysis of total sulphur in volcanic rocks
from the Krafla-Na´mafjall fissure swarm neighbouring
Lake My´vatn provided d34S values that ranged between
2.0&amp; and +4.2&amp; (mean: 0.8&amp;) (Torssander, 1989),
whilst examination of transitional basaltic and rhyolitic
rocks from the Katla Volcanic Centre in southern Iceland
gave similar d34S values, ranging between 1.8&amp; and
+2.4&amp; (Hildebrand and Torssander, 1998). As isotopic
fractionation between plants and sulphates deposited in
the soil from the weathering of local bedrock is relatively
small, d34S values of Lake My´vatn flora should be similar
to those reported by Torssander (1989). However, Icelandic
lava fields are sparsely vegetated with lichen and moss
(Bjarnason, 1991), which can accumulate their sulphur
directly from atmospheric sulphur dioxide (SO2) with very
little isotopic fractionation (Krouse, 1977). SO2 gas produced
during the eruption of Krafla in July 1980 yielded d34S
values between 1.8&amp; and +3.4&amp; (Torssander, 1988),
however, it is conceivable that atmospheric SO2 in Iceland has
varied with time due to the volcanic nature of the island.
Wet deposition of sulphate from the aqueous oxidation of
atmospheric SO2 can provide soil with an additional source
of sulphur and isotopic fractionation during this process
can be very large (ca. 11&amp; to +17&amp;) (Harris et al.,
2012). However, the amount of sulphate deposited has been
shown to be negligible in areas where SO2 emissions are
high (Nriagu and Coker, 1978), and compared to other
parts of Iceland, the My´vatn region has little rain- or
snowfall (Einarsson, 1979).</p>
        <p>The eruption of the Gr´ımsvo¨ tn volcano in 1996, which is
situated below the Vatnajo¨ kull Glacier in south-east
Iceland, caused the Skeiðara´ River to flood, and water samples
taken before and during the early stages of the overflow
revealed a post-eruption increase in sulphur concentration.
Analysis of sulphate in the floodwaters demonstrated that
d34S values varied between +7.9&amp; and +9.0&amp;, suggesting
that sulphurous magmatic gases were oxidised to sulphate
upon dissolution in water (G´ıslason et al., 2002). Together
with water samples taken from kettle-hole lakes that had
formed since the 1996 glacier-outburst flood, further
groundwater, geothermal spring water and Skeiðara´ River
samples were retrieved between 1998 and 2001 from the
Skeiðara´rsandur outwash plain (Robinson et al., 2009).
d34S values from river sulphates ranged from +3.4&amp; to
+8.8&amp;, with the higher value again attributed to magmatic
sulphate from the Gr´ımsvo¨ tn caldera, whilst the lower end
value was measured during normal discharge; both values
fall within the range of +2&amp; to +10&amp; reported by G´ıslason
and Torssander (2006). Groundwater sulphate d34S values
varied between 0.3&amp; and +5.3&amp;, whilst sulphate in
geothermal spring water had an average d34S value of +4.1&amp;.
Water from the kettle-hole lakes was found to be depleted
in 34S, with d34S values ranging between 1.7&amp; and
0.0&amp;, which could be attributed to dissolved sulphate
originating from igneous sulphide minerals. Samples taken
from the Hekla cold springs in southern Iceland, fifteen
years after the volcano last erupted, revealed that magmatic
degassing into groundwater was still occurring. Dissolved
sulphate in these water samples displayed d34S values
between +1.5&amp; and +4.3&amp;, with magmatic sulphate
estimated to have had a d34S value of around +7.0&amp; (Holm
et al., 2010). Thus, the numerous volcanic eruptions that
have occurred since Iceland was first settled are likely to
have influenced the d34S values of all water sources feeding
Lake My´ vatn and its surrounding landscape. However,
whilst Icelandic rock and water samples have demonstrated
d34S values that span from 2&amp; to +10&amp;, and
atmospheric SO2 d34S values in the My´ vatn region may vary
between 1.8&amp; and +3.4&amp;, what is evident is that they are
all isotopically very distinct from the d34S value of seawater
(Fig. 2).</p>

      <sec id="2-4">
        <title>2.4. Isotope biochemistry of Iceland</title>
        <p>d13C analysis of various plants and lichens from four
lakes in northern Iceland provided values ranging between
30.9&amp; and 23.3&amp; (Wang and Wooller, 2006). Likewise,
the analysis of moss, grass, willow and liverwort samples
from the geothermal area of Kerlingarfjo¨ ll in central
Iceland produced d13C values between 28.8&amp; and 20.4&amp;
(Skrzypek et al., 2008). Ascough et al. (in press) measured
d13C on a variety of modern flora from four sites close to
Lake My´vatn and at one location approximately 5 km to
the west of the lake, and found that the vegetation ranged
from 31.6&amp; to 26.9&amp;. These results are within the
expected range for plants in the northern hemisphere
following a C3 photosynthetic pathway, with the more enriched
value of 20.4&amp; from Kerlingarfjo¨ ll being attributed to
the moss growing in a colder climate (Skrzypek et al.,
2007). Aquatic plant samples from one site had d13C values
averaging 13.3&amp;, which is characteristic of freshwater
plants in Iceland (Wang and Wooller, 2006). Previous
stable isotope studies of archaeological bone samples
discovered at various sites surrounding Lake My´ vatn indicate
that d13C values for terrestrial animals ranged from
22.1&amp; to 20.3&amp;, whilst modern and archaeological
freshwater fish displayed d13C values from 16.0&amp; to
7.9&amp;. Omnivorous pigs and various birds displayed a
large range of d13C values ( 22.5&amp; to 16.9&amp; and
24.8&amp; to 7.9&amp;, respectively), reflecting the mixed
terrestrial, freshwater and possibly marine diet they would
have been consuming (Ascough et al., 2007, 2010, 2012,
in press). Although cod and haddock bones have been
recovered at Sku´ tustaðir, prior to this study, no stable
isotope analysis had been undertaken on these samples.
However, cod from four archaeological sites in the north-east
Atlantic yielded d13C values between 14.7&amp; and
11.3&amp; (Barrett et al., 2008, 2011; Russell et al., 2011).</p>
        <p>It is well established that, although 13C trophic level
shifts are small, 15N values have been shown to shift
between +3&amp; and +5&amp; with each trophic level in marine
and terrestrial food chains (Schoeninger and DeNiro,
1984). Given that terrestrial plants have d15N values
ranging between approximately 0&amp; and +5&amp;, herbivores and
carnivores should accordingly exhibit d15N values of
+4&amp; to +9&amp; and +8&amp; to +13&amp;, respectively. Within
the marine environment, d15N values can range between
+15&amp; to +20&amp; as a consequence of the food chains
being considerably longer than in the terrestrial biosphere
(DeNiro and Epstein, 1981; Schoeninger et al., 1983;
Schoeninger and DeNiro, 1984). However, organisms lower
down in the marine food chain such as gastropods,
molluscs, Polychaeta and Maxillopoda demonstrate lighter
d13C ( 23.2&amp; to 17.1&amp;) and d15N values (+5.9&amp; to
+9.7&amp;) (Mateo et al., 2008). Freshwater fish have also
displayed enriched d15N values; however studies have shown
that some species have d13C and d15N values that are
similar to those observed within a terrestrial environment
(Dufour et al., 1999). Therefore, the introduction of a third
stable isotope, namely sulphur, to aid in the distinction
between these two food groups, is potentially highly
advantageous.</p>
        <p>Wang and Wooller (2006) carried out d15N analysis on
the plants and lichens recovered from the four sites
mentioned previously in northern Iceland and found that values
ranged from 12.4&amp; to +5.6&amp;, with many of the samples

having values lower than 6.0&amp;. Similarly, the analysis of
moss, grass, willow and liverwort specimens from
Kerlingarfjo¨ ll produced d15N values between 5.5&amp; and
1.7&amp; (Skrzypek et al., 2008). Ascough et al. (in press)
determined that modern flora from around Lake My´vatn
had d15N values between 9.1&amp; and +6.5&amp;. It has been
noted that in soils depleted in phosphorous, plants and
lichens that take up ammonia from the atmosphere are
capable of generating negative d15N values (Erskine et al., 1998;
McKee et al., 2002). Ascough et al. (2007, 2010, 2012, in
press) found that d15N values for modern and
archaeological terrestrial animals ranged between 1.5&amp; and
+5.9&amp;, whilst freshwater fish displayed d15N values from
+3.1&amp; to +8.5&amp;, and north-east Atlantic cod yielded
d15N values from +11.9&amp; to +15.4&amp; (Barrett et al.,
2008, 2011; Russell et al., 2011). Again, the d15N values
for pigs and birds displayed a large range of values
( 1.2&amp; to +8.7&amp; and 3.7&amp; and +16.4&amp;, respectively),
and are typical of a mixed diet. A comparison of the various
d13C and d15N ranges for Icelandic terrestrial and aquatic
plants and fauna from the Lake My´vatn region is illustrated
in Fig. 3.</p>
        <p>Oceanic primary producers demonstrate sulphate d34S
values between +17&amp; and +21&amp; (Peterson and Fry,
1987), however, d34S values for organisms living within a
freshwater environment have been shown to vary anywhere
between 22&amp; and +20&amp; due to differing sulphur sources
in the local geology as well as anaerobic bacteria residing
within lakes and rivers, which can reduce sulphate ions to
hydrogen sulphide (H2S) (Faure, 1977; Peterson and Fry,
1987). For mammals to successfully thrive,
sulphur-containing biochemical compounds, such as the essential
amino acids, methionine and cysteine, need to be acquired
from the diet. Studies have demonstrated that there is a
negligible trophic level shift for sulphur isotopes compared
to the large range of d34S values shown within terrestrial,
freshwater and marine environments (Peterson et al.,
1985; Richards et al., 2003). Therefore, consumers eating
produce from within the Lake My´ vatn vicinity should have
similar d34S values to the surrounding terrestrial vegetation.
Currently, there are no published d34S values for either
animal or human archaeological remains from Iceland, and
globally only a small number of sulphur isotope studies
have been undertaken on archaeological material.
However, this is now changing rapidly and more recently an
increasing number of archaeological studies have utilised
sulphur isotope analysis as part of their investigations
(Privat et al., 2007; Vika, 2009; Nehlich et al., 2011).
Nevertheless, many of these findings could be seen to be limited in
that they are either lacking in sample numbers, or where
a larger sample set has been analysed, they have originated
from multiple sites (Richards et al., 2001; Hu et al., 2009;
Nehlich et al., 2010).</p>

        <p>Sku´ tustaðir, situated on the southern shore of Lake
My´vatn (65 570 N 17 030 W), was excavated during the
NSFfunded IPY program “Long Term Human Ecodynamics in
the Norse North Atlantic: cases of sustainability, survival,
and collapse”. After the discovery of an archaeological
midden in 2007, the site was explored in greater detail during a
series of excavations between 2008 and 2010 (Edwald and
McGovern, 2009, 2010; Hicks et al., 2009; Hicks, 2010;
Hicks and Pa´ lsdo´ ttir, 2011), and a large number of animal
bones and artefacts were discovered. The midden site is on
a natural rise in the landscape, and due to the porous nature
of the bedrock, drainage conditions are good and no
pockets of waterlogged sediments were noted. The pH of the soil
is around 6.5, providing favourable conditions for
preservation of animal bones. The work discussed in this paper
deals solely with excavations carried out during the 2008
and 2009 field trips and a list of all samples analysed with
their stratigraphic context and chronology is presented in

a Dremel multi-tool, before they were lightly crushed into

24 h to effect demineralisation. The acid was then decanted
and samples were rinsed with ultra-pure water to remove

        <title>3.3. Carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isotope ratio analyses</title>
        <p>d13C, d15N and d34S stable isotope measurements were
obtained using a continuous-flow isotope ratio mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Delta V Advantage (Bremen,
Germany)) coupled to a Costech ECS 4010 elemental
analyser (EA) (Milan, Italy) fitted with a pneumatic
autosampler. Samples were weighed into tin capsules ( 600 lg for
d13C and d15N and 10 mg for d34S) and the d13C and
d15N values measured in one of two ways. The EA was
coupled to the mass spectrometer via a ConfloIIIe and
samples were combusted in a reactor containing chromium
oxide and silvered cobaltous/cobaltic oxide at 1020 C to
produce N2 and CO2. The gases were then passed over a
reduction reactor containing reduced copper wires at
650 C. A magnesium perchlorate trap was used to
eliminate water produced during the combustion process and
the gases were separated in a 3 m stainless steel Porapak
QS 50–80 mesh GC column heated to 45 C. Alternatively,
the EA was coupled via a ConfloIVe and samples were
combusted in a single reactor containing tungstic oxide
and copper wires at 1020 C to produce N2 and CO2. The
gases were then separated in a 2 m stainless steel Porapak
QS 50–80 mesh GC column heated to 70 C. The latter
system was used to obtain d34S values and the column was
heated to 90 C to separate SO2. Helium (100 ml/min)
was used as a carrier gas throughout the procedure. N2,
CO2 and SO2 entered the mass spectrometer via an open
split arrangement within the ConfloIIIe/ConfloIVe and
were analysed against their corresponding reference gases.</p>

respectively. All animals analysed had C:N atomic ratios
that fell within the range of 2.9–3.6, indicating good bone
collagen preservation (DeNiro, 1985). For d34S analysis,
two internal standards, which are calibrated to the
international reference materials IAEA-S-1 ( 0.3&amp;), IAEA-S-3
( 32.55&amp;) and IAEA-S-4 (+16.90&amp;), were run for every

carried out in duplicate; there were no significant differences
in the reproducibility of the results.</p>
        <p>Nehlich and Richards (2009) analysed a variety of
mammalian and fish bone archaeological samples, with the
objective of introducing quality control standards for
measuring sulphur isotopes in bone collagen. They found that,
on average, mammalian and bird bone collagen had an
atomic C:S ratio of 600 ± 300, an atomic N:S ratio of
200 ± 100 and contained between 0.15% and 0.35%
sulphur, whilst fish bone collagen was found to have an atomic
C:S ratio of 175 ± 50, an atomic N:S ratio of 60 ± 20 and
contained between 0.4% and 0.8% sulphur. A small number
of individual samples in this study fell outside the above
ranges and are excluded from the discussion (shown in

        <title>5.1. Domestic animals: evidence of husbandry practices via stable isotope analysis</title>
        <p>d13C and d15N values confirm that cows, caprines and
horses were consuming a wholly terrestrial C3 plant diet,
however, d34S values varied by 14.9&amp; ( 1.0&amp; to
+13.9&amp;, mean = +5.6 ± 2.8&amp;), implying that these
animals were acquiring their food from different geographical
areas. There are currently no published d34S values for the
vegetation surrounding Lake My´ vatn, however, local flora
can source its sulphur from three main reservoirs: rock
sulphide (My´vatn d34S value: 2.0&amp; to +4.2&amp;, (Torssander,
1989)), atmospheric SO2 (My´ vatn d34S value: 1.8&amp; to
+3.4&amp;, (Torssander, 1988)) and river, ground, and spring
water in the area. Whilst d34S values for My´ vatn water
supplies have not yet been established, previous studies have
shown that magmatic sulphate from volcanic eruptions
have the potential to influence local water sources, and
sulphate d34S values have been found to range between 1.7&amp;
and +10.1&amp; (G´ıslason et al., 2002; G´ıslason and
Torssander, 2006; Robinson et al., 2009; Holm et al., 2010).
Therefore, it is conceivable that the d34S value of sulphur in the
My´ vatn region could range from 2.0&amp; to +10.1&amp;, and
since plants are depleted in 34S by 1.5&amp; relative to their
sulphate source (Trust and Fry, 1992), vegetation in the
region is likely to have a d34S value that can vary between
3.5&amp; and +8.6&amp;. Similarly, isotopic fractionation of
sulphur in mammals is small relative to their diet (Peterson
et al., 1985; Richards et al., 2003), and hence domestic
animals raised in My´vatn and consuming local vegetation
would not be expected to display a d34S value greater than
+10&amp;, however, this cut off value remains ambiguous
until d34S values of flora and water samples in the area have
been measured.</p>
        <p>Two late medieval to early modern cows provided very
similar d13C and d15N values (GU-20231: 21.6&amp; and
+4.0&amp;, respectively and GU-20241: 21.9&amp; and +4.1&amp;,
respectively), and it could mistakenly be assumed that these
animals were reared in close proximity to each other, yet
their d34S values tell a very different story (+0.6&amp; vs.
+9.0&amp;) (Fig. 5). Norse communities were known to
participate in co-operative farming and animals were often
moved around multiple farmsteads or jointly supervised
uplands (e.g. Dugmore et al., 2012). The lower d34S value for
GU-20231 indicates that this cow was likely grazing on
vegetation that assimilated its sulphur predominantly from
d34S-depleted rock sulphide, whilst it is possible that
animals with higher d34S values, as observed with GU-20241,
were perhaps grazing closer to d34S-enriched geothermal
water sources or were reared on sea-spray effected coastal
vegetation (see Section 5.2. for further discussion). A weak
linear relationship (R2 = 0.24) between d15N and d34S exists
for cows, with animals that have a more enriched d15N
value tending to have a depleted d34S value (Fig. 6A). Cattle
grazing near Lake My´ vatn are likely to have consumed
plant material that was enriched in 15N due to the
decomposition of chironomid midges, which transports nitrogen
from the lake to the shore, whilst for cows foraging further
afield, their d15N values may be less enriched due to a
decreasing effect of chironomid numbers with increasing
distance from the shore (Gratton et al., 2008).
Alternatively, animals being farmed closer to Lake My´vatn may
have elevated d15N values due to the soil being fertilised
with manure (Bogaard et al., 2007; Fraser et al., 2011).</p>
        <p>Although the average d13C and d15N values for cattle
and caprines are very similar ( 21.5&amp; vs. 21.2&amp; and
+3.9&amp; vs. +2.5&amp;), their average d34S values are slightly
different (+4.1&amp; vs. +6.7&amp;) (Fig. 4), suggesting differing
diet and/or grazing areas between the two groups. If sheep
and goats were grazing in the Krafla lava fields, then they
may have been consuming moss and lichens that are
capable of accumulating their sulphur directly from atmospheric
SO2. Given that atmospheric SO2 is likely to have varied
over time due to numerous volcanic eruptions, it is not
inconceivable that the higher d34S value of caprines

compared to cattle may be due to the consumption of a
different food source with a more enriched isotopic signature.
As observed with cows, there is a weak correlation
(R2 = 0.22) between d15N and d34S, with caprines that have
a more enriched d15N value tending to have depleted d34S
value (Fig. 6B), suggesting that sheep and goats that were
being kept closer to the lake were also consuming plants
that had been 15N enriched by chironomid midges.</p>
        <p>Only five horses were sampled in this study and as
expected their d13C, d15N and d34S values were very similar
to those observed in cattle and caprines. It is probable that,

GU-20275: d34S +10.5&amp;) and a horse (GUsi-2131: d34S
+10.2&amp;) displayed enriched d34S values. The higher d34S
values may be attributed to the consumption of vegetation
containing marine-derived sulphur, suggesting these
animals may have been reared closer to the coast and trading
of domestic animals was also occurring within Icelandic
Norse communities. Studies have shown that sea-spray
not only influences coastal soil d34S values, as sulphate
particles can be propelled inland over extensive distances
(Zazzo et al., 2011), however, it is unlikely that the land around
Lake My´vatn would have been affected by sea-spray as the
d34S values of these six animals are very distinct from the
average d34S values of their contemporaries.</p>
        <p>The rate of bone collagen turnover is poorly understood,
with estimates ranging from less than a year in birds
(Hobson and Clark, 1992) to over ten years in adult humans
(Hedges et al., 2007). Assuming that fully matured animals
are slaughtered within a few years of being brought inland,
their 34S signature is unlikely to have changed significantly
from when they first arrived at Lake My´vatn. However,
collagen turnover rates in juveniles should be higher than in
adults, and therefore if young livestock grazing on coastal
vegetation were then traded inland and reared for the
remainder of their lives in the Lake My´vatn region, it is
likely that their d34S values would lie somewhere between
a marine signature and the d34S value for the local
vegetation, and this may account for the intermediary d34S values
observed in some domestic animals.</p>

        <title>5.3. Lake My´vatn birdlife: evidence of avian diet variability</title>
        <p>The very broad range in d13C ( 21.3&amp; to 6.9&amp;,
mean = 13.6 ± 4.2&amp;), d15N (+1.9&amp; to +16.1&amp;,
mean = +6.5 ± 3.9&amp;) and d34S ( 5.3&amp; to +13.6&amp;,
mean = 3.0 ± 5.0&amp;) values for birds reflects the variation
in diet of each species. Analysis of modern detritus, algae,
pondweed, larvae, zooplankton and mollusc samples taken
from Lake My´vatn yielded d13C values that varied between
22.6&amp; and 10.1&amp; and d15N values that varied between
16.0&amp; and +6.3&amp; (Ascough et al., 2011). Freshwater
resources would have been the main food supply for birds
surrounding Lake My´vatn, and as eight of the eleven birds
have a d34S value below +4&amp;, this suggests that the waters
of Lake My´vatn may have been their permanent home.
Settlers brought the domestic fowl to Iceland in the 9th
century, and whilst only one chicken has currently been
analysed, its enriched d13C, d15N and depleted d34S value
(GUsi-2116: 18.3&amp;, +9.5&amp; and +2.6&amp;, respectively)
would suggest that it had consumed freshwater fish scraps.
GUsi-2129’s enriched d15N value (+8.5&amp;) indicates that
this duck may have also been consuming some animal
protein. However, its d34S value (+7.7&amp;) is midway between
the values observed for a pure freshwater feeder and a pure
marine feeder, which would suggest migratory birds also
resided at Lake My´vatn. The enriched d15N and d34S values
of GUsi-2130 (+16.0&amp; and +13.6&amp;, respectively)
demonstrate that although this bird spent the majority of its life
within a marine environment, it may have occasionally
migrated to the fertile waters of Lake My´vatn. Alternatively,
this bird could have spent its entire life at the coast,
indicating that perhaps it was not just domestic animals, seals and
marine fish that were being traded between communities.
5.4. 14C-dating: evidence of freshwater reservoir effects
d13C and d15N values for two of the three pigs examined
in this study indicated they were consuming a variety of
produce, including both terrestrial- and
non-terrestrialbased resources (GUsi-1110: 18.9&amp; and +9.7&amp;,
respectively and GUsi-1111: 19.0&amp; and +9.3&amp;, respectively).
However, by solely considering their d13C and d15N values,
there is no clear indication as to whether it was terrestrial
animal, freshwater fish or marine fish/mammal protein that
was being consumed. Given that the d34S values of
GUsi1110 (+3.8&amp;) and GUsi-1111 (+3.7&amp;) are lower than the
average d34S values observed for the terrestrial animals
(+5.6&amp;), and marine species recovered from the midden
at Sku´ tustaðir have an average d34S value of +15.9&amp;, these
results would suggest that the pigs have been consuming
freshwater fish scraps, and the depleted d34S values
exhibited in trout and char bones (mean: 2.7 ± 1.4&amp;)
corroborates this theory. Radiocarbon dating of GUsi-1110
(1593 ± 28 14C yr. BP, cal. AD 412–540 (95.4%
probability)) and GUsi-1111 (1552 ± 29 14C yr. BP, cal. AD 426–
573 (95.4% probability)) confirms that a large freshwater
reservoir effect (FRE) was occurring as both pigs are
significantly older than the landna´ m Viking settlement date of
AD 871 ± 2 (Ve´steinsson, 1998; McGovern et al., 2007;
Einarsson and Aldred, 2011). It was assumed that
GUsi1113, with its slightly enriched d13C ( 20.6&amp;), d15N
(+6.5&amp;) and d34S (+8.5&amp;) values, may have been
consuming a small proportion of terrestrial animal or marine
resources, yet its radiocarbon date (1431 ± 29 14C yr. BP)
would suggest otherwise. As observed with GUsi-1110
and GUsi-1111, GUsi-1113 pre-dates the landna´ m and
displayed an overall 2r calibrated age range of AD 576–656.
This could suggest that this pig had been consuming
freshwater resources from a different body of water to Lake
My´vatn, and again potentially highlights that trading was
taking place between Viking communities. Subsequently,
human consumption of these pigs (and any other
freshwater species) would influence their 14C ages and they too
would appear older than their assigned cultural period
(Ascough et al., 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012).</p>
        <p>Arctic foxes are known to be opportunistic feeders that
can adapt their diet depending on seasonal or geographical
changes (Hersteinsson and MacDonald, 1996). They are
renowned for preying on birds and stealing their eggs, and the
large population of waterfowl surrounding Lake My´vatn
would have provided an ample food supply for these
predators. Even during the winter months, a considerable part of
the lake and the Laxa´ River remains ice-free, allowing the
foxes to hunt all year round. d13C (mean: 14.9 ± 1.3&amp;),
d15N (mean: +9.0 ± 1.5&amp;) and in particular d34S (mean:
+1.4&amp; ± 0.7&amp;) stable isotope analysis supports the theory
that like pigs, they too may have been scavenging
freshwater fish carcasses from the shores of the lake and river.
GUsi-2118 and GUsi-2126 were discovered just above the
landna´ m tephra fall of AD 871 ± 2, yet 14C-dating estimates
that these animals ranged from 2605 ± 30 14C yr. BP
(GUsi-2118) to 2160 ± 30 14C yr. BP (GUsi-2126). These
results offer an overall 2r age range of 827–107 BC, which
again is significantly earlier than the Viking settlement
period and demonstrates that the 14C ages of these samples are
affected by a freshwater reservoir effect (Ascough et al.,
2007, 2010, 2011, 2012).</p>

      <title>6. CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <p>In the first comprehensive stable isotope study to be
undertaken of archaeological fauna from one specific site
within the Lake My´vatn area, utilisation of 34S analysis in
conjunction with 13C and 15N analyses has revealed
important details concerning the husbandry techniques and
livestock trading practice of early Viking settlers in Iceland.
This study is also the first instance in which sulphur isotope
analysis has been carried out on animal remains from
archaeological deposits in Iceland, and has proven to be a
valuable tool for discriminating between terrestrial,
freshwater and marine based diets.</p>
      <p>Cattle bones were found to have lower d34S values but
higher d15N values than the caprine bones analysed, which
suggests that they were being kept closer to Lake My´vatn
and perhaps feeding on d15N enriched grasses, whereas a
more enriched d34S value for sheep and goat bones
indicated they were grazing away from the lake and possibly
consuming moss and lichens on the Krafla lava fields. Three
10th century pigs were analysed during this study and d13C
and d15N values indicated that two of them were consuming
a mixture of terrestrial and non-terrestrial resources, whilst
d34S analyses and radiocarbon dating points towards the
ingestion of freshwater fish as the non-terrestrial source.
This suggests that early settlers allowed pigs to roam quite
freely around the farmstead and consume domestic waste,
or alternatively, if they were styed, they were deliberately
being fed scraps that included non-terrestrial material.</p>
      <p>It would be incorrect to assume that only the weathering
of local bedrock dictates d34S results, as the majority of the
terrestrial animals examined had a d34S value greater than
+4.2&amp;, whilst almost all of the freshwater fish had d34S
values less than 2.0&amp;. Iceland has been subjected to many
volcanic eruptions before and since the landn a´m, and
evidence has shown that the increased amounts of sulphurous
magmatic gases have affected the d34S values of rivers, lakes
and groundwater. The increase in sulphate concentration
has led to an increase in d34S variability, and as a
consequence, this variability has been transferred throughout
the food chain. It is highly conceivable that the enriched
sulphur isotope values observed in some terrestrial animals
were the result of sea-spray affecting coastally reared
animals, which were then moved inland.</p>
      <p>Overall, there is an offset of 8&amp; in sulphur isotope
values between terrestrial and freshwater systems in the Lake
My´vatn region of Iceland, and the tight range for
freshwater fish demonstrates the homogeneity of this environment
with respect to d34S. Results have shown that the freshwater
fish populating Lake My´vatn have a significantly different
d34S value from their marine contemporaries, with the
average d34S value of the two groups offset by approx. 18.5&amp;.
As the remains of both freshwater and marine resources
have been found in middens at Sku´ tustaðir, sulphur isotope
analysis will be a useful tool for reconstructing the diets of
the human inhabitants, and while correcting for the
freshwater 14C reservoir effect at Lake My´vatn is problematic,
these results have nevertheless enabled us to differentiate
whether the anomalously old 14C ages are due to a marine
or freshwater 14C reservoir effect.</p>
      <p>As a final point, further research into the use of sulphur
isotopes in archaeology is required, but this study has
demonstrated that if a system is well-defined, is investigated in a
methodical manner and is supported with archaeological
and palaeoenvironmental information, it is possible to use
sulphur isotopes as an important tracer of diet.</p>
