        <title>1. Introduction</title>
        <p>Large quantities of veterinary pharmaceuticals (VPs) are in use
worldwide. As animals do not completely metabolize these
compounds, a large proportion of them are excreted unchanged in feces
and urine. Therefore, both the drugs and their metabolites are
released into the environment, either directly from aquaculture
and by grazing animals, or indirectly during manure spreading
(Reemtsma and Jekel, 2006).</p>
        <p>Of the various pharmaceuticals commonly used in veterinary
medicine, special attention has been paid to four of them in the
present work: doramectin, metronidazole, florfenicol and
oxytetracycline, which differ in their activity and physicochemical
properties (Table 1).</p>
        <p>OXT, FLO and MET are antibiotics and have a similar mode of
action at the DNA/RNA-level. OXT is commonly used because of its
broad-spectrum efficacy in the treatment of infections caused by
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, mycoplasma and large
viruses. It inhibits protein synthesis by preventing the association
of aminoacyl-tRNA with bacterial ribosomes (Reemtsma and Jekel,
2006). FLO is a fluorinated derivative of thiamphenicol, inhibits
transpeptidation in the bacterial protein synthesis, and is effective</p>
        <p>Substance (Abbreviation) [CAS]
Doramectin (DOR) [117704-25-3]

Oxytetracycline (OXT) [96310-42-8]

against many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria
(Christensen et al., 2006). The nitroimidazole MET is an antibiotic effective
against anaerobic bacteria, protozoans and certain parasites. It acts
by entering bacterial and protozoan cells and interfering with DNA
(Lanzky and Halling-Sørensen, 1997). DOR is an antiparasitic drug
which is a one of the most popular compound for curing
anthelmintic disease. DOR binds to receptors that increase membrane
permeability to chloride ions. This inhibits the electrical activity of nerve
cells in nematodes and muscle cells in arthropods, paralyzing and
ultimately killing the parasites (Horvat et al., 2012; Lumaret et al.,
2012). In many countries these pharmaceuticals are registered as
medical premixes so they can be used in feedstuffs for the
treatment or prevention of animal diseases. For example the usage of
OXT in the UK in 2000 was 8.5 t and in the US, just in aquacultures
in 2003, was 15 t (Sarmah et al., 2006; Schmidt et al., 2007).
Furthermore, in accordance to the IMS Health Market Prognosis
(2012) the global pharmaceutical market has grown twice during
the last decade. However the real amounts of drugs entering the
environment can be much more higher due to lack of control with
type and amounts of pharmaceuticals usage in developing
countries e.g. India, Thailand, Indonesia (Sarmah et al., 2006). The
relatively low cost and the broad spectrum of activity of these
pharmaceuticals means they are very commonly used not only in
animal husbandry (DOR, MET, FLO, OXT) but also in aquaculture
(MET, FLO, OXT) (Christensen et al., 2006; Ferreira et al., 2007; Lai
et al., 2009; Lumaret et al., 2012; Horvat et al., 2012).</p>
        <p>It must be pointed out that the veterinary medicines used in
aquaculture are commonly administered as a medicated feed
mainly as a bath formulation (Hekoten et al., 1995; Boxall, 2010).
Hence a considerable proportion of these drugs administered in
an intensive fish farm was found to have been released into the
aquatic environment via urinary and fecal excretions and in
unconsumed medicated food (Hekoten et al. 1995). For example, Ferreira
et al. (2007) highlighted that when OXT was administrated orally,
fish took up only about 10–30% of the total amount administered,
while 70–90% of it entered the environment and was available for
distribution to other compartments.</p>
        <p>Disregarding the different routes by which these
pharmaceuticals enter the environment, their presence in its different
compartments has already been determined (Kolpin et al., 2002; Kay et al.,
2005). Despite their quite low concentrations in environmental
samples at the lg L 1 or ng L 1 level (MET – 30 ng L 1, OXT –
340 lg L 1, FLO – 2.4 lg L 1) (Kolpin et al., 2002; da Silva et al.,
2011; Wei et al., 2012) and their different stabilities in the
environment (FLO is resistant to abiotic degradation but easily
biodegradable; OXT is susceptible to photodegradation; MET cannot be
biodegraded, photodegradation under UV light is also less
effective; DOR is quite susceptible to both biodegradation or
photodegradation), they are continuously being released into ecosystems
(Jacobsen and Berglind, 1988; Oka et al., 1989; Lunestad, 1992;
Pfizer Inc., 1996; Doi and Stoskopf, 2000). Consequently, these
compounds may be considered pseudo-persistent. Therefore, the
kind of exposure organisms may be subjected to will resemble that
of traditional pollutants (e.g. pesticides, detergents).</p>
        <p>This may result in adverse ecological effects, including, for
example, the development of resistant bacterial populations or
direct toxicity to microflora and microfauna. Since these compounds
(like FLO and MET) are polar pollutants with quite a low sorption
potential and/or are directly introduced into aquatic environment
(like OXT), it can be assumed that aquatic organisms may be the
species most endangered by the presence of pharmaceuticals used
in aquaculture and animal husbandry. Kolar and Kozˇuh Erzˇen
(2006) reported that DOR is excreted mainly with the feces:
almost 98% of the drug is excreted as the non-metabolized

pharmaceutical. DOR’s mobility is very low which is related to the
very high soil organic carbon-water partitioning coefficient (Koc
&gt;1000). The Koc value is very useful in predicting the mobility of
organic soil contaminants; generally the higher Koc values the less
mobile organic chemicals. However, studies have shown that the
parent form of this drug can be present in the aquatic environment
at concentration of 0.24–0.42 ng L 1 (Pfizer Inc., 1996).</p>
        <p>Several studies have investigated the aquatic toxicity of some of
these compounds (summarized in Table 2). While hardly any data
is available for DOR; OXT, FLO and MET have been more
extensively investigated. Even so, systematic studies investigating these
compounds in different test systems and linking ecotoxicological
research with instrumental analysis are still lacking. The aim of
the present work is to enrich our limited knowledge so far of the
potentially deleterious effects on the environment of commonly
used VPs in aquacultures or animal husbandry. To this end we used
a battery of ecotoxicological tests comprising organisms of
different trophic levels and complexity: luminescent marine bacteria
(Vibrio fischeri), limnic unicellular green algae (Scenedesmus
vacuolatus), duckweed (Lemna minor) and crustaceans (D. magna).
Although EC50 values for investigated compounds are available in
literature they are highly different. Hence, the objective of our
work was also to evaluate the water soluble fraction of the test
compounds in different test media performed via HPLC–UV
measurements. Such experiment is an essential tool to evaluate
trustworthy EC50 values and it enhances much reliability of obtained
data.</p>

        <p>All the data generated in our study were obtained according to
internationally accepted test guidelines (e.g. OECD, ISO) or on
specific (e.g. national) testing guidelines (e.g. DIN). Hence, according to
the European Medicines Agency (Klimisch et al. (1997) and EMEA,
2008 our results can be classified under ‘‘reliability index 1’’.</p>
        <p>According to Klimisch et al. (1997) different terms are being
used synonymously to characterize the quality of the data of
toxicological and ecotoxicological studies: validation/validity,
reliability and adequacy. These terms describe not only procedures
to define the quality of test results (data), but also test methods
are validated to prove their relevance and reproducibility. The
RI category includes studies or data from the tests generated
according to generally valid and/or internationally accepted
testing guidelines or in which the test parameters documented are
based on a specific (national) testing guideline (preferably
performed according to Good Laboratory Practice) or in which all
parameters described are closely related/comparable to a
guideline method. Therefore, all the ecotoxicological tests used in our
study fulfill the validation criteria (for example for ISO 8692
validity criteria includes: the average control growth, variability
of control growth rates (C.V.%), changes of medium pH) stated
in respective Standard Protocols Procedures (SOP) and according
to ENV/JM/MONO(2008)28.</p>

          <p>DOR, MET, FLO and OXT (HCl salt), acetonitrile (ACN) and salts
(see Table A1, Appendix A) used for the culturing media were
purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). The standard
stock solution of DOR was prepared by dissolving it in acetonitrile
at a concentration of 500 mg L 1; it was then stored at 18 C in
the dark. All standard stock solutions of OXT (HCl salt), MET and
FLO used in the assays were prepared in the proper medium
(buffer) to obtain the desired concentration. For DOR 0.2% of ACN was
added to the control samples in the toxicity test to offset the
influence of this solvent on the test organisms.</p>

          <title>2.2. Luminescent inhibition assay with marine bacteria</title>
          <p>The toxicity test based on Vibrio fischeri was done using the LCK
482 test kit (Dr Lange GmbH, Germany). The 30-min standard
bioluminescence inhibition assay was carried out according to a
modified DIN 38412-L34 protocol (1991).</p>
          <p>The tests were carried out at least twice for each substance. At
least four controls (2% NaCl solution, phosphate-buffered) were
used during each test.</p>
          <p>The tests were performed at 15 C using thermostats
(LUMIStherm, Dr. Lange GmbH, Germany). The luminescence was
measured with a luminometer (LUMIStox 300, Dr Lange GmbH,
Germany). The lyophilized bacteria were rehydrated according to
the test protocol; then, 500 lL aliquots of the bacteria solution
were pre-incubated for 15 min at 15 C. After the initial
luminescence had been measured, 500 lL of the diluted samples were
added to the bacteria. The bioluminescence was measured again
after an incubation time of 30 min. The relative toxicity of the
samples was expressed as a percentage inhibition compared to the
controls.</p>

          <title>2.3. Reproduction inhibition assay with limnic green algae</title>
          <p>A synchronized culture of the green algae S. vacuolatus (strain
211-15, SAG (Culture Collection of Algae), Universität Göttingen,
Germany) was used for this assay. The stock culture was grown
under photoautotrophic conditions at 28 C (±0.5 C) in an inorganic,
sterile medium (pH 6.4) with saturating white light (22–33 klx,
Lumilux Daylight L 36W-11 and Lumilux Interna L 36W-41, Osram,
Berlin, Germany). The cells were aerated with 1.5 vol% CO2 and
synchronized using a 14–10 h light – darkness cycle. The stock
culture was diluted every day to a cell density of 5 105 cells mL 1.
This test is a modified version of the assay described by
Altenburger et al. (1990), and its sensitivity is comparable to the
standardized 72 h test (ISO 8692, 1989).</p>
          <p>The toxicity tests started with autospores. The algae were
exposed to the test substances for one growth cycle (24 h). The
endpoint of this assay is the inhibition of algal reproduction, measured
as the inhibition of population growth. Cell numbers were
determined with a Coulter Counter Z2 (Beckmann, Nürnberg, Germany).
The tests were performed in sterilized glass tubes, the algae were
stirred throughout the 24 h test period, and the test conditions
were the same as for the stock culture except for the CO2 source.
Here, 150 lL of NaHCO3 solution was added to each test tube.
The methods of stock culturing and testing are described in detail
by Faust et al. (2001). Growth inhibition was calculated using the
cell counts of the treated samples in relation to the untreated
controls. At least six controls were used for each assay. The tests were
performed using six different concentrations in two replicates of
every compound and each test was carried out at least twice.</p>

          <p>The growth inhibition assay with L. minor was performed
according to a modified version of the test protocol described in
detail by Drost et al. (2007). The plants were grown in open
Erlenmeyer flasks in sterilized Steinberg medium (pH 5.5 ± 0.2) in a
climate chamber with a constant temperature of 25 ± 2 C. To exclude
pH effects on plant growth, the pH was checked at the beginning
and end of the test. Based on control samples evaluation the pH
changes did not affect growth inhibition. The chamber was
illuminated continuously with a maximum of 6 klx. The assays were
performed on six-well cell culture plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH,
Frickenhausen, Germany). All compounds were tested twice in
three replicates, with a minimum of six controls in each test. The
test started with one plant consisting of three duckweed fronds,
and the measured endpoint was the inhibition of the growth rate
determined by the frond area (mm2), which was calculated for
the treated plants in relation to the untreated controls. The frond
area was detected using a Scanalyzer from Lemnatec GmbH
(Würselen, Germany).</p>

supplier’s standard operational procedure (MicroBioTest Inc., 1996).
The tests with neonates less than 24 h old, obtained by the
hatching of ephippia, were performed at 20 C in the dark. 5 pre-fed
animals were incubated with the toxicants in a volume of 10 mL of
mineral medium. In each test five different concentrations of the
test substance were investigated in five parallels and five controls.
All the experiments were performed twice. The numbers of
immobilized organisms were checked after 24 and 48 h. The sensitivity
of the organisms to K2Cr2O7 was checked routinely once a new
batch of organisms was obtained.</p>

          <p>The results presented in Table 3 show that the concentration of
the soluble fraction of MET, FLO and OXT in biological media did
not differ from the nominal concentration of these drugs prepared
in media solution. The accuracy of the results was from 94.4% to
105.6%. It can therefore be assumed that the solubility of the test
compounds in biological media does not affect EC50s.</p>
          <p>Because of the very low solubility of DOR in water, solutions
with nominal concentrations were prepared in biological media
with the addition of 0.2% ACN. Although, it is recommended not
to use more than 0.1% of ACN, it was assessed during control
samples examination that amount of 0.2% did not affect the organisms
used in the tests. This is also supported by the data presented in
Table 4. However, in the presence of ACN, DOR is generally poorly
soluble in different media (&lt;0.34 mg L 1), and is even less so in V.
fischeri media (&lt;0.24 mg L 1), which can be explained by the high
ionic strength of this buffer.</p>

            <p>The results listed in Table 4 show that none of the tested drugs
displayed a high level of acute toxicity toward V. fischeri. The
lowest EC50 was found for FLO (29.4 mg L 1); the values for OXT and
MET were &gt;100 mg L 1. No effect up to 0.24 mg L 1 could be
determined for DOR. This concentration is, however, well above
environmentally relevant concentrations, which range from ng L 1 to
hundreds of lg L 1 (Boxall et al., 2006). The 30 min EC50 obtained
for OXT (108 mg L 1) is comparable to the results reported by
Lalumera et al. (2004) (121–139 mg L 1) (Table 2). However, no clear
correlation between available ecotoxiciy data for OXT to V. fischeri
and exposure time can be observed.</p>
            <p>Isidori et al. (2005) highlighted that most of the toxicity data
available for V. fischeri using short exposure times (between 5
and 30 min) rather than a 24 h exposure show that most
pharmaceuticals have a low toxic potential in this respect, because these
compounds interfere only slightly with biosynthetic pathways.
For example, the low sensitivity of V. fischeri to OXT can be
explained by its mode of action on protein synthesis, which is not
of importance during short-term bioluminescence testing
(Zounková et al., 2011).</p>

            <p>The toxicity of veterinary drugs toward S. vacuolatus is reported
for the first time. Our results indicate that this limnic green alga
was generally more sensitive than V. fischeri for FLO and OXT.
FLO exhibited the strongest growth inhibition against S. vacuolatus,
followed by OXT and MET. The toxicity of DOR to green algae has
not been calculated yet, but our study found its EC50 to be
&gt;0.34 mg L 1. The exact value was not determined because of the
low water solubility of this compound and the necessity of
performing the test with an additional concentration of acetonitrile.
Nevertheless, S. vacuolatus was found to be less sensitive to OXT,
MET and FLO than C. vulgaris, P. subcapitata or S. capricornatum,
as shown in Table 2. The results for FLO (EC50 = 18.0 mg L 1) are
comparable to those given by Ferreira et al. (2007) and Lai et al.

              <p>Tetraselmis chui. As a result, despite having the same general mode
of action, FLO was found to be more toxic (EC50 = 6.06 mg L 1) than
OXT (EC50 = 11.18 mg L 1), a situation backed up by our findings.</p>

            <p>No toxic effect toward L. minor was found for the maximal
soluble fraction of MET (&gt;25 mg L 1) and DOR (&gt;0.31 mg L 1). Effects
were found for OXT and FLO – both EC50 values were around
3 mg L 1 – but they were one order of magnitude higher than
the values determined for the toxic reference compound atrazine.</p>
            <p>Pro et al. (2003) and Zounková et al. (2011) determined the
toxicity of OXT toward L. minor in a 7-d test, obtaining EC50s of
4.92 mg L 1 and 2.1 mg L 1, respectively. Brain et al. (2004),
however, assessed the phytotoxicity of OXT to Lemna gibba in 7-d
static-renewal tests at the level of EC50 = 1.01 mg L 1 (calculated for
the frond number). Halling-Sørensen (2000) suggested that the
toxic effect may have been underestimated in static tests because,
for example, of photodegradation of compounds with short
halflives like OXT. Other authors, however, have confirmed the
negligible influence of photodegradation on the results under the
conditions of a 7-d static test (Zounková et al., 2011).
Photodegradation can also be presumed insignificant in the
context of the current study, because the EC50 for OXT calculated in
this study is generally comparable with the results obtained by
both static and static-renewal tests (Brain et al. 2004; Zounková
et al., 2011). Brain et al. (2004) also suggested that the ability of
antibiotics (like MET, OXT and FLO) to affect plants might be
understood by examining the chloroplast, which originated from
the engulfment of an endosymbiotic Cyanobacteria – like a
prokaryotic cell by a larger eukaryotic cell. However, no information
on the toxic effect of DOR toward aquatic higher plants can be
found in the literature. This is probably due to the assumption that
this compound, having a high Koc, will have the potential to sorb to
soil or other solid matrices. As knowledge of its environmental fate
and mobility in the environment is very limited, however, its
effects on aquatic organisms should not be excluded from an
evaluation of its ecotoxicity potential (Kolar and Kozˇuh Erzˇen, 2006.).</p>

            <title>3.2.4. Growth inhibition assay with D. magna</title>
            <p>D. magna is usually regarded as the least sensitive organism,
toward which, for example, OXT demonstrated no toxicity up to
400 mg L 1 in an acute test and only low toxicity in a chronic
reproduction test (Zounková et al., 2011). Similar results were also
obtained by Wollenberger et al. (2000) for both OXT and MET;
these observations are in agreement with our results for these
two compounds. No data about the toxicity of FLO toward D.
magna are available to date. Our investigation demonstrated the very
low toxicity of this compound toward D. magna – 337 mg L 1.
However, we obtained strong effects (EC50 = 0.0637 lg L 1) with
DOR, which shows that this compound is five orders of magnitude
more toxic than K2Cr2O7, the reference substance for this test. This
was also stated by Pfizer Inc. (1996), who reported an EC50 of
0.1 lg L 1 for DOR. In their experiments, however, the authors
did not consider determining the water-soluble fraction of this
drug in biological media, which can be lower than in pure water.
Hence the amount of compound which can cause harmful effect
on the tested organisms can be lower than suspected. Therefore
the EC50 of DOR that they determined was almost twice as high
as our value (Pfizer Inc., 1996). These results highlight the
importance of combining ecotoxicity tests with instrumental analysis
in order to obtain reliable data, and to confirm the exposure
concentrations of pharmaceuticals used in toxicity experiments,
especially of compounds with a very low water solubility: if this is not
done, chemical hazards may be underestimated as a consequence.</p>
            <p>Such a high toxicity of DOR to D. magna reveals a serious threat
when this compound reaches the aquatic environment. But so far
only limited data have been available concerning the occurrence
and fate of anthelmintics (including DOR) in the environment
(Horvat et al., 2012). Pfizer Inc. (1996) calculated the maximum
expected concentrations of DOR in a surface water body to range
from 0.24 to 0.42 ng L 1, values backed up by Boxall et al. (2006).
Even though these estimated concentrations are lower than
observed EC50s, it must be pointed out that organisms are typically
exposed to multi-component chemical mixtures. It is possible that
DOR, in predicted environmental concentrations and in
combination with residues of veterinary products and/or other
pharmaceuticals/pollutants, will cause adverse effects to biota.</p>

        <title>4. Conclusions</title>
        <p>As a result of such a comparative ecotoxicological analysis, the
potential effects of four selected veterinary drugs, most commonly
used in livestock or in aquacultures, on aquatic organisms were
defined. DOR was found to be highly toxic toward D. magna. Even if
environmental concentrations and ‘‘local hot spots’’ during the
application of these pharmaceuticals are still much lower that
the EC50s of these pharmaceuticals vis-à-vis certain organisms, it
must always be borne in mind that these drugs occur in natural
media usually together with others of the same family or type.
Therefore, mixture effects need to be considered, as in such
situations toxic thresholds could already be reached. Moreover,
ecotoxicological hazard assessments of these pharmaceuticals may be
misleading if only acute toxicity assays are done. Therefore, a
further research is necessary. This includes ecotoxicological testing in
combination with analytical methods in order to acquire a
complete picture of the exposure to and the risk posed by these
pollutants, as we have done in our research. Despite these reservations,
the ecotoxicological test battery used in this study is a suitable tool
for compiling a comprehensive hazard profile for environmentally
relevant contaminants.</p>
