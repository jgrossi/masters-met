        <p>j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / a p p l a n i m The implications of husbandry training on zoo animal response rates a r t i c l e i n f o Positive reinforcement training (hereafter known as training) has increasingly been adopted in zoos, to facilitate complex veterinary procedures without sedation or restraint and support husbandry requirements. However, empirical studies to establish the efficacy of training or investigate its impact on keeper-animal relationships are scarce; this was the topic of the current investigation. Study animals were classified as formally trained (FT) partially trained (PT) or untrained (UT). Eight black rhinoceros (2FT, 2PT &amp; 4UT), twelve Sulawesi crested black macaques (4FT, 4PT &amp; 4UT) and eleven Chapman zebra (4FT, 2PT &amp; 5UT) were studied in 6 zoos across the UK and USA. Subtle cues and commands provided by keepers directed towards the animals were identified and the latency between these and the respective behavioural responses (cue-response) were recorded. Animal personalities were also assessed using trait ratings completed by keepers for each animal. Social species (zebra and macaques) responded quicker to cues than the solitary species (rhino; F2 = 13.716, p &lt; 0.001). FT animals responded quicker to keeper cues than PT and UT animals (F2,22= 6.131, p &lt; 0.01). There was no significant difference in the cue-response latencies according to personality traits (Z = −1.576, p &gt; 0.05). Data suggested that trained group living animals had reduced latencies when reacting to keeper's cues, regardless of their personality. If we consider short cue-response latencies to be indicative of low fear, then we suggest that training can potentially reduce animals' fear of humans thus could contribute to positive keeper-animal relationships which in turn could lead to improved animal welfare.</p>

      <p>Hemsworth and Coleman (1998) investigated
human–animal interactions between stock-keepers
and farm animals which explored how human–animal
relationships formed in this context. Data demonstrated a
significant negative correlation between ‘stress’ and fear
of humans, and productivity for pigs and cattle (Boivin

et al., 2003; Hemsworth, 2003; Waiblinger et al., 2002).
Hemsworth (2003) reported that fearfulness (towards
stock-keepers), could be reduced if the animals were
exposed to positive human interactions, such as petting or
positive communication. Boivin et al. (2003); Hemsworth
et al. (2000) and Lensink et al. (2001) further noted that
“good stock-keepers” had a positive attitude towards
the animals they worked with, described the animals in
a positive manner and created positive human–animal
interactions e.g. patting or stroking.</p>
      <p>Keeper–animal relationships in zoos have been
measured using positive interactions between the keepers
and animals (Carlstead, 2009). Baker (2004) assessed the
effects of positive human–animal interaction in the form
of relaxed treat feeding, playing, and other forms of
social interaction compatible with personnel safety, on
the behaviour of adult chimpanzees. When the
chimpanzees experienced more ‘positive’ time with their
keepers, they performed significantly less self directed
displacement behaviours, such as regurgitation/re-ingestion,
and their percentage time spent inactive decreased.
Manciocco et al. (2009) found similar results with common
marmosets where increased positive human–animal
interaction resulted in increased allo-grooming and increased
play behaviour bouts. Carlstead (2009) proposed that if zoo
housed animals experienced positive human–animal
interaction they would be less fearful of people. Furthermore,
she suggested this lower level of fear might manifest itself
in the animals’ reduced latency to perform an appropriate
behaviour in response to a keeper cue or command.</p>
      <p>Human–animal interactions may also be affected by
the animals’ personality, which has been identified and
described in various animal taxa using various methods
including trait constructs and uses either behavioural
codings or trait ratings (Gosling, 2001). Animal personality
can be assessed by surveying keepers, who know the
animals, and by asking them to rate these animals on various
behavioural traits; they are provided with terms and
definitions and have to determine how well these fit to the animal
(Wielebnowski, 1999). Personalities have been measured
in many taxa including fish (Lepomis gibbosus,
Gasterosteus aculeatus), reptiles (Thamnophis sp), birds (Parus major,
Taeniopygia guttata) and mammals including many
nonhuman primates (Macaca mulatta, Macaca fuscata, Pan
troglodytes; See Gosling, 2001 for an extensive review).
Personality traits such as boldness and fearfulness have been
measured and could suggest that a potentially fearful
animal may be naturally fearful of humans, which could make
them difficult to manage in a captive zoo setting.</p>
      <p>A way to increase the positive human–animal
interactions between the keepers and the animals that they
work with could be the use of positive reinforcement
training (hereafter known as training). This is the
presentation of a stimulus after a behaviour that serves to
maintain or increase the frequency of that behaviour
(Heidenreich, 2007). It has become more commonly used
within zoo animal husbandry to facilitate veterinary and
husbandry procedures (Laule et al., 2003; Young &amp; Cipreste,
2004). Pomerantz &amp; Terkel (2009) investigated the effects
training had on the psychological welfare of zoo-housed
chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). The training regime lasted
approximately 5–10 min per individual and included them
touching and holding onto a target which then progressed
onto the animals presenting areas of their body such as
their feet, back, hands, head and then receiving a food
reward. The training was included in the chimpanzees’
daily routine to aid husbandry and veterinary
procedures. Results comparing abnormal behaviours including
coprophagy, painting with faeces, drinking urine, plucking
hair and sterotypies; indicative of poor psychological
welfare, showed that the presence of training in their routine
decreased these behaviours. Social affiliative behaviours
between individuals were also monitored and found to
increase significantly once the training was part of the
routine. They concluded that the training offered to the
chimpanzees had a positive impact in reducing abnormal
behaviours, they were less tense, spent less time idle and
more time engaged in affiliative behaviours and that the
training influence lasted throughout the day irrespective
of the behaviours that were directly trained. However, the
chimpanzees used within this study were housed in small,
barren indoor areas for around 15 h per day. It could be that
the positive effects noted within this study may be less
beneficial on animals housed in more complex and stimulating
enclosures.</p>
      <p>Melfi and Thomas (2005) measured the effects of
training on a social group of Abyssinian colobus monkeys
(Colobus guereza). The animals were undergoing a training
regime to increase the efficiency of a worming
treatment however, as a consequence the training acted to
reduce human-directed behaviour from the animals
without unduly influencing activity levels or social interactions
within the social group (Melfi and Thomas, 2005).</p>
      <p>Hosey (2008) proposed a human–animal
relationship model, for zoo animals, suggesting that an animal
which was fearful of humans may have encountered
negative interactions and therefore formed a negative
human–animal relationship or no human–animal
relationship at all. By contrast, animals experiencing positive
human–animal interaction would develop low fear of
humans and therefore be confident or enriched by people
i.e. the animals would develop a positive human–animal
relationship or no human–animal relationship
respectively. With this in mind, the use of training with zoo
housed animals could increase the positive human–animal
interactions and therefore help to decrease the fear of
humans that animals may experience from either
unfamiliar (visitors) or familiar (keepers) people. The aim of
this study was to investigate if training had a positive
effect on the keeper–animal interactions and therefore
keeper–animal relationships of different zoo housed
animals.</p>

      <title>2. Methods</title>
      <sec id="2-1">
        <title>2.1. Subjects, housing and husbandry</title>
        <p>Eight black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) aged between
6 and 10 years old, eleven Chapman’s zebra (Equus
burchellii), aged between 4 and 8 years old; and twelve Sulawesi
crested black macaques (Macaca nigra) aged between 3
and 12 years old were studied, ensuring that only adults
were included in data collection. The animals were
maintained in five British and one American zoo, and were
categorised as: (a) un-trained, UT, (b) partially trained, PT
or (c) formally trained, FT (Table 1). UT did not receive
‘conscious’ cues/commands but may have become trained
by unconscious cues/commands. PT did not have a
formal training programme but keepers’ provided consistent
cues/commands and expected an appropriate and
consistent response. FT animals had undergone, or were
part of, a formal ‘goal orientated’ positive reinforcement
training programme involving food rewards to encourage
behaviours such as presenting sections/areas of their body
to enable veterinary checks or procedures to be completed.
Study animals were selected to include different
mammal species that were managed under the three conditions
of interest (untrained, partially trained and trained) and
were held in the same institutions; the latter enabled us
to test whether ‘zoo’ (the location that the animals were
maintained in) contributed to any differences in behaviour
observed, in absolute terms and relative to the variables
tested i.e. training level, species, sociality.</p>
        <p>All of the enclosures within each institution were
cleaned each morning before the zoo opened to the
public. This procedure involved cleaning the outdoor enclosure
whilst the animals were locked indoors, then the animals
were moved to their outdoor enclosure and the vacated
indoor enclosure was cleaned; the time access was
provided between the indoor and outdoor enclosure areas
varied between zoos.</p>

        <title>2.2. Data collection</title>
        <sec id="2-2-1">
          <title>2.2.1. Behavioural observations</title>
          <p>Keeper–animal interactions were observed over the
course of a keepers’ working day (approx. 8 h) for each
species at each zoo (N = 9). The first 2 h (08.00–10.00 am),
and last hour (16.00–17.00 pm) of the keepers’ day
were consistently identified as the period of highest
keeper–animal interactions; when animals were being
moved around their enclosures.</p>
          <p>Keepers were selected according to their shift patterns
to ensure that a suitable amount of data was collected
and that there was enough data per keeper–animal dyad.
All keeper cues/commands visible to the observer (visual,
auditory, contextual), directed to towards all of the study
animals and the animals’ respective behaviours were
recorded; three cues/commands common to all species
and zoos, which were not part of a training programme
were selected for comparison. Experiment cues/commands
(hereon cues/commands) were: (i) a keeper approaching
the enclosure without calling the animals name to which
the animal responds in recognition; (ii) the keeper
‘asking’ the animal to move to the outside enclosure from the
inside enclosure; (iii) and the keeper ‘asking’ the animal
to move to the inside enclosure from the outside
enclosure. All occurrences of the cues/commands and respective
behaviours were recorded using live observations with the
latency to perform the behaviour being the time taken
from when the cues/command was given, to when the
correct behaviour was performed by the focal animal. The
socially grouped animals were recorded per individual
animal. At each institution, 3 animal-keeper dyads were
observed. Latencies for each animal to perform the required
behaviour following all of the cues/commands were
recorded per keeper–animal dyad. Each cues/commands
per keeper–animal dyad was recorded 8 times.</p>

        <sec id="2-2-2">
          <title>2.2.2. Behavioural profiling</title>
          <p>Data were collected using a questionnaire following the
recommendations set out in the BIAZA Behavioural
Profiling Guidelines (Pankhurst et al., 2009). The questionnaire
asked keepers to rate the animals in their care, according
to how they behaved with reference to four main traits:
boldness, adaptability, fearfulness and interactivity with
humans (Knight et al., 2009). The questionnaires were
completed for each keeper–animal dyad and followed a Likert
scale design from 1–7; where 1 signified the trait not being
present in the animal and 7 signifying the trait strongly
being represented in the animal.</p>
          <p>Personality data was unavailable at all of the institutions
housing D. bicornis therefore this data was omitted from the
analysis for this species.</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
      <sec id="2-3">
        <title>2.3. Data analysis</title>
        <p>Keepers were told that the study focused on diurnal
activity budgets of the animals and were not fully aware
of the hypothesis. Keepers’ knowing that their behaviour
was being observed may have distorted their behaviour or
interactions with the animals and could have affected how
they ranked them in the personality questionnaires. A full
debriefing with results was provided retrospectively, data
remained anonymous and the keeper and animal identities
were not acknowledged in data analysis or interpretation
of the results.</p>
        <p>Latencies for the three cues/commands were normally
distributed and averaged per cue/command, and per
individual animal rather than per animal–keeper dyad to
analyse the response of the animal rather than how it
performs for different keepers. Behavioural results were
analysed using a three (species: macaque, zebra, rhino)
by three (training: UT, PT and FT) ANCOVA design with
institution as a covariate. Two contrasts were performed
using contrast coefficients to show differences between
some of the independent variables. These included social
(E. burchellii and M. nigra) versus non-social (D. bicornis)
species, and formally trained animals versus non-formally
trained animals (UT and PT).</p>
        <p>Personality traits were ranked per animal and scores
for each trait were calculated taking into account each
keeper–animal dyad score. Differences in personality traits
scores were analysed using Wilcoxon tests to investigate
any differences the individuals at each training level.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="3">
      <title>3. Results</title>
      <p>There were significant differences in cue-response
latencies between species (F2,22 = 25.017, p &lt; 0.001) with
the slowest latency to perform the appropriate response
being 33.48 ± 6.55 s for the D. bicornis and the quickest was
12.89 ± 0.92 s for the M. nigra. Contrast coefficients
performed to separate social and solitary species highlighted
that social species (E. burchellii and M. nigra) reacted
significantly faster to cues/commands than the solitary species
(D. bicornis; F2,22 = 13.716, p &lt; 0.001).</p>
      <p>There was also a significant difference between
cueresponse latencies according to training condition; UT
animals performed tasks significantly slower (F2,22 = 10.166,
p &lt; 0.01) than the FT animals (means: 24.2 ± 6.14 s and
11.37 ± 0.73 s, respectively). Contrast coefficients
demonstrated that FT animals were significantly faster to perform
the required behaviours after cues/commands, compared
to PT and UT (F2,22 = 6.131, p &lt; 0.001).</p>
      <p>The interaction between training condition and species
was also significant (F3, 22 = 8.411, p &lt; 0.01) which indicated
that the latencies to respond across the species varied
between the different training levels (Fig. 1). Overall, the
PT and UT animals showed latencies which were extremely
varied according to species, ranging from an average of
13.57 s (M. nigra, UT) to 48.13 s (D. bicornis, PT). However,
all species which underwent FT had a much lower range
of latencies to perform the required behaviours with an
average of 8.96 s (M. nigra) to 13.24 s (E. burchelli).
Interestingly the M. nigra were the species which on the whole
had the lowest range of latencies to perform the required
behaviours (8.96–14.98 s).</p>
      <p>There were some significant differences between the
behavioural traits of different individuals at the same and
different institutions (Table 2), however, there was no
significant difference in the cues/command response
latencies according to the behavioural traits of the individuals
(Wilcoxon: Z = −1.576, p &gt; 0.05).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="4">
      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>Results suggest that the species studied, responded in
different time scales to the cues/commands required by a
keeper. This implies that even the untrained animals
recognised what the keepers required and performed the correct
response. This supports the idea that animals in captivity
are continually learning from their daily husbandry
routine and it may be beneficial for them to experience novel
routines to increase the variability they experience (Laule,
2003). The results also showed that the social group living
animals performed the required behaviours significantly
quicker than the solitary animals (F2,22 = 13.716, p &lt; 0.001).</p>
      <p>This could be due to social facilitation meaning that once
one individual performs the required behaviour, the
others follow this reaction of the specific member of the group
possibly due to a degree of confidence and social
support (Zentall, 2006). Overall it was the M. nigra species
which had the quickest response time t react to keepers
cues/commands. This could be linked to the species’ social
structure and that they are more commonly housed in
groups of more than 5–6 individuals compared to the other
social animal studied. Social facilitation within the
capacity of this study could be seen as beneficial as all training
groups (FT, PT and UT) of animals performed the required
behaviours requested by the keepers in a reasonable time.</p>
      <p>However, it is possible that this response may depend upon
the confidence of the dominant individual who is more
likely to initiate the behavioural response. In this study, the
quickest response times were seen by the PT and FT groups
of M. nigra which are both dominated by ‘bold’ individuals.</p>
      <p>Animals that were part of a formal, goal orientated
training programme were significantly quicker to respond to
generic cues and commands required by the keepers. This
could be linked to the increased positive Keeper–animal
relationships formed during the training regime. Baker
(2004) and Manciocco et al. (2009) showed that if a keeper
increases the amount of time spent with the animals they
cared for it can have a positive influence on the animals’
behaviour. However, positive animal behaviour has also
been linked to the use of trining (Melfi and Thomas, 2005;
Pomerantz and Terkel, 2009; Shyne and Block, 2010). From
the results of this study, it is difficult to suggest whether
it is the PRT which is increasing the positive behaviours
from the animals or the extra time that the keepers spend
with them due to the training regime. However, it is clear
to see that the effect of training is of benefit to the animals
and that it does help to increase the positive keeper–animal
relationships formed as suggested by Carlstead (2009).
Further research into this area would help to clarify whether
the major impacting factor is the increase in positive
interactions or simply just more time being spent with the
animals. Results from this research could have huge
implications on a zoo keeper’s daily routine.</p>
      <p>The measurement of animal personalities has been
discussed in many species and has shown differences in
maternal behaviour, grooming preferences, activity
budgets and an animal’s approach to learning (Rouff et al.,
2005). The results within this study suggest that between
the animal studied at each institution, there were
differences in the personality traits measured. Some individuals
were significantly bolder than others within the social
group and some significantly more fearful. However,
results suggested that even fearful individuals that took
part in training showed significantly quicker responses
to cues/commands provided by the keepers. It was
suggested that short cue-response latency could indicate low
fear reaction (Carlstead, 2009; Hosey, 2008) results which
therefore demonstrate that the effect of training reduces
the impact of the animals fearful personality and could
reduce an animals’ fear of humans within a captive
setting which has also been seen as a result of environmental
enrichment (Meehan and Mench, 2002).</p>
      <p>Hosey (2008) created a model which explored
different human–animal interactions and their consequences
for human–animal relationships in zoos. He suggested
that an animal that experienced negative interactions with
humans would either develop a negative relationship or
no relationship at all with that human. This would
therefore lead to a fearful animal and which would possibly

formally trained.
avoid contact with humans. On the other hand, animals that
experienced positive interactions would develop a positive
or again, no relationship which could lead to the animal
experiencing low fear and being enriched by humans. The
research presented shows zoo animals’ response rate to
keeper cues increases in tandem with their level of
training. It is suggested that zoo training programmes which
are undertaken with due care and biased towards positive
reinforcement, as observed in this study, reduces fear in
animals of humans; a fundamental requirement for
neutral or positive human–animal relationships (Hosey, 2008).</p>
      <p>Whether fear is reduced in animals by the prolonged
duration of human interaction, close proximity with humans,
the food reward or because no negative consequences
occur during the training session, is unclear and requires
empirical investigation.</p>
      <p>Stockmanship within a farm animal setting has been
continually shown to affect the behaviour and
productivity of cattle and pigs (Boivin et al., 2003; Hemsworth, 2003;
Waiblinger et al., 2002). Research suggested that negative
stockmanship led to negative behavioural performances
and therefore decreased productivity. Within a zoo setting,
it is however not feasible to record negative keeper–animal
interactions as they were not observed during this study;
they also could not be requested as this would have
ethical implications. Therefore, positive interactions were

recorded and results supported a “zoo stockmanship cycle”.</p>
      <p>This cycle being self-perpetuating where, as the correct
behavioural response is performed by the animals will
reinforce positive keeper–animal interactions from the
keepers, and so it goes on. In this manner, animal
welfare can be promoted in zoos by positive keeper–animal
interactions leading to positive behavioural responses in
the animals (Fig. 2).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="5">
      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>Training reduced the latencies to respond to a
keepers’ cues for both of the social species studied in this
context (Chapman zebra and Sulawesi macaques). This
pattern could be linked to the social facilitative learning
aspect of group living but could be useful within a captive
zoo setting. Training can be used to increase the
positive keeper–animal interactions which underpin positive
keeper–animal relationships within a zoo setting and may
help to mitigate an animal’s fearfulness of humans.</p>
      <p>Stockmanship can have a huge impact on the behaviour
of zoo housed animals. The Zoo Stockmanship Cycle
suggests that positive keeper–animal interactions can lead to
increases in zoo animal welfare.</p>
